SAONE, a considerable river of France, which has its source in the Vosges, near Darney, and falls into the Rhone at Lyons.

Saone , Upper, a department of France, formed out of a part of the ancient province of High Burgundy, or Franche Comté. It is bounded on the north by the Upper Marne and the Vosges, on the east by the Upper Rhine, on the south by the Doubs and the Jura, and on the west by the Cote d’Or and the Upper Marne. It extends, according to the Statistique de la France, over 530,990 hectares, equal to 1867 square miles, and is divided into three arrondissements, twenty-eight cantons, and 651 communes, with a population of 343,298 persons. The chief river is that from which the name is taken, which rises in the Vosges, and is navigable for only a short portion of its course through this department. The other rivers are the Oignon, the Drageon, the Amance, the Auterne, the Saolon, and the Branchin. The surface consists of mountains, hills, and valleys. A spur from the Vosges Mountains enters the eastern side of the department, but to the south-west it is quite level. The soil for the most part consists of clay, and is very stony; but much of it is fertile, and a great part covered with woods. Although the husbandry is conducted in a slovenly manner, yet it yields sufficient corn for the consumption, and more of wheat than of rye. There are abundance of good meadows which afford pasturage for cows, and the dairies produce excellent butter. Fruit is plentiful, especially walnuts, from which much valuable oil is extracted. The vine is extensively cultivated, the vineyards occupying about 20,000 acres, which enables the inhabitants to export some wine. There are mines of iron[7:19:645] and of coal at work, which afford employment to many hands. Much of the iron is converted near the mines into the heavier hardware articles. There are some manufactures produced, but the establishments are upon a small scale, furnishing tiles, glass, paper, and liqueurs. There is also some trade in timber, and in pot and pearl ashes, from the more wooded divisions of the department.

Saone AND Loire, a department of France, formed out of some portions of the ancient duchy of Burgundy, then distinguished as the Autunois, the Charollais, and the Cha-lonnais. It is bounded on the north by the departments of the Nievre and the Cote d’Or; on the east by that of Jura; on the south by those of the Aine, the Rhone, and the Loire; and on the west by the Allier and the Nievre. It extends over 856,472 hectares, which are cqual to 3009 square miles, is divided into five arrondissements, fortyeight cantons, and 592 communes, and in 1836 it contained a population of 538,507 persons. Its inhabitants have increased since the peace at a far greater rate than the other parts of France, having been in 1818 only 470,085. The chief rivers arc the two which confer their names on the department, but there are others of great value, such as the Doubs, the Arroux, the Seille, and the Garonne. It is favoured, too, by the Canal of Digoin, and the Central Canal, which commences at Digoin, and terminates in the Saone at Chalons. The surface is covered with hills, some of which are 2400 feet in height, with rich valleys between them. The soil, upon the whole, is highly fruitful, though in parts chalky, stony, or sandy. The strip from Chalons to Maçon, along the Loire, is one of the finest in France, consisting, on one side of the river, of extensive rich natural meadows, and on the other of gentle acclivities covered with corn and vines. The agriculture has been much increased by bringing into cultivation large portions of land before covered with woods. There are some mines of iron and coal, but their product is not large. There are some manufactures, chiefly for home consumption. The trade consists chiefly in exporting the fruits of the soil, especially corn, wine, hay, wool, and some timber and coal. The capital of the department is the city of Maçon, which in 1836 contained 11,944 inhabitants.
