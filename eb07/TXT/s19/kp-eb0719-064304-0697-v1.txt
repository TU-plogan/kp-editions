SANTIAGO, a large city of Spain, in the province of[7:19:644] Galicia, of which it is the capital. It is about six leagues from the sea, on a little river not navigable, called the Sar, which unites with another called the Sancta, and then flows into the Ulla, and joins the river Arosa, which has at its entrance to the ocean some secure harbours for small vessels. This is an archiepiscopal city, and is one of the most richly endowed of all the cathedrals of the kingdom. In former times this church was the resort of pilgrims from every part of Spain, and a great part of the rest of Europe. The votive offerings have therefore been prodigious, and though the veneration for the shrine of St Iago has been on the decline for many years, yet the accumulation of past periods now serves to keep in idleness, if not in profligacy, a great number of ecclesiastics. The city contains a university of considerable celebrity, a very large and well-regulated hospital, and several smaller ones, besides other sumptuous public edifices. It contains about 25,000 inhabitants, the greater part of whom depend on the religious houses, especially some thousands of poor, who are not disposed to work, because the donations in food and in money from the different pious establishments are sufficient to keep them alive, and allow them to indulge in their habitual indolence. There are indeed some few manufactories of linens, laces, and tapes; they languish, however, and give employment but to very few. The surrounding country is cold and sterile, and therefore the donations of the pious are expended in obtaining necessaries from the more distant parts of the province.

Santiago , or Sr Jago, the capital of the republic of Chili, in South America, is delightfully situated in an extensive plain on the southern shore of the river Mapocho, on each side of which large mounds of stone have been raised as a security against inundation. On the opposite side of the river lie the suburbs, of Chimba, Cannadilla, and Renca, which are connected with the city by means of a beautiful bridge. The streets are straight, wide, well paved, and cross each other at right angles, which divides the city into quadras or solid squares. Water is conveyed from the river by means of aqueducts, which not only supply the inhabitants, but, running through the streets, keep the town very clean. The houses are flat-roofed, of one story, and, being white-washed, give the town a very gay appearance. They are built in a quadrangular form, and all the rooms may be entered from a square court in the middle, or from doors of communication from one to the other. The entrance from the street is by a broad porch, on either side of which are stables, &c. The great square is 450 feet on each side, in the middle of which there is a fine bronze fountain. The north side is occupied by the directorial palace, a splendid building, having the city prison under the same roof. On the western side are the cathedral, and a mean-looking palace of the bishop. The most remarkable edifices are the cathedral, the church of St Dominick, the great college, which formerly belonged to the Jesuits, and the town-hall. The mint is situated in an obscure part of the town. Being the centre of the commerce of Chili, it abounds with all sorts of provisions, which are very cheap. The inhabitants are gay, hospitable, more inclined to hold intercourse with strangers, and less bigoted, than their countrymen generally are. The population is about 45,000. It is thirty leagues distant from the Pacific Ocean, seven from the Andes, and fifty-five miles eastsouth-east from the port of Valparaiso. Long. 70. 44. W. Lat. 33. 26. S.
