SALIX, the Willow. Willow trees have been frequently the theme of poetical description, both in ancient and modern times. In Virgil, in Horace, and in Ovid, we have many exquisite allusions to them and their several properties. The Babylonica, Babylonian pendulous salix, commonly called weeping willow, grows to a large size, having numerous long, slender, pendulous branches, hanging down loosely all round in a curious manner, and long, narrow, spear-shaped, serrated, smooth leaves. This curious willow is a native of the East, and is retained in our hardy plantations for ornament; it exhibits a most agreeable variety, particularly when disposed singly by the verges of any piece of water, or in spacious openings of grass ground. All the species of salix are of the tree kind, very hardy, remarkably fast growers, and several of them attaining a considerable stature when permitted to run up to standards. They are mostly of the aquatic tribe, being generally the most abundant and of most prosperous growth in watery situations. They, however, will grow freely almost anywhere, in any common soil and exposure; but they spring considerably faster and stronger in low moist land, particularly in marshy situations, by the verges of rivers, brooks, and other waters, which places often lying waste, may be employed to good advantage in plantations of willows for different purposes.
