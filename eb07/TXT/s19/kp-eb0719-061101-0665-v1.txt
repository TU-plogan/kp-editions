SAGHALIEN, a large island or peninsula, situated at the eastern extremity of Asia, immediately to the north of the large island of Jesso or Matsmai. It is called also Oku Jesso, or Upper Jesso, and by the natives Tchoka. It is separated from the continent by a narrow channel called the channel of Tartary; and it is not certainly known whether this channel extends along the whole western coast and forms Saghalien into an island, or whether it is connected with Tartary by an isthmus, thus making it a peninsula. The channel was entered by Pérouse with the idea of determining this question; but he was obliged, by adverse winds and other circumstances, to quit it before examining its whole extent. The inhabitants assured him that it was an island separated from the continent only by a narrow strait. The people of Tartary, on the other hand, asserted that it was a peninsula connected with the continent by a narrow isthmus of sand, and covered with marine plants. In confirmation of the latter theory, Pérouse observed the depth of the water constantly to diminish, without any current being felt; and he concluded that it was a strait, though so obstructed by sand and sea-weed as to be scarcely passable. Broughton, who penetrated twenty miles farther, and Krusenstern, observed that in the strait to the north of the river Saghalien the water is rendered almost fresh by the influx of the stream. The territory of Saghalien is mountainous, especially towards the centre. In the lower parts are wooded valleys and hills, and behind lofty mountains covered with snow; towards the south the country becomes more level, and exhibits only hills of sand. Krusenstern, who sailed along the eastern coast, remarked that it was nearly destitute of inhabitants. The southern and western coasts are occupied by rude tribes, of whose dispositions, however, Pérouse gives a favourable account. They arc chiefly employed in hunting and in fishing. The north-east coast, opposite to the mouth of the Saghalien, is occupied by a colony of Mantchou Tartars. The Japanese had formed a colony in the Bay of Aniwa, at the southern extremity of the island; but it has been destroyed by the Russians, who, it is supposed, intend to form establishments for themselves in those countries.
