SCONE, a village of Scotland, now chiefly remarkable for being the place where the kings were anciently crowned. Kenneth II. upon his conquest of the Picts in the ninth century, having made Scone his principal residence, delivered his laws, called the Macalpine laws, from a tumulus, named the Mote Hill of Scone. The old palace was begun by the Earl of Gowrie, but was completed by Sir David Murray of Gospatrick, the favourite of King James VI. to whom that monarch had granted it; and the new possessor, in gratitude to his benefactor, put up the kingâ€™s arms in several parts of the house. During the middle ages of the Scottish monarchy Scone was the occasional residence of the kings; and it was here that they were crowned, sitting on the famous stone called the stone of Dunstaffnage or stone of Scone, which, if the ancient chronicles may be believed, was the pillow on which Jacob slept when journeying through the plains of Luz. Edward I. carried it off, to the great mortification of the Scotch, who looked upon it as a kind of palladium. The abbey and palace were demolished by a mob from Dundee at the Reformation. Charles II., before the battle of Worcester, was crowned in the chapel at Scone.[7:19:694] The old pretender resided here for some time in 1715, and his son paid it a visit in 1745. On the site of the ancient palace a splendid edifice has been reared by the Earl of Mansfield, who represents the old family of Stormont. In the modern structure much of the old furniture has been preserved, particularly a bed that belonged to James VI., and another of which the curtains were wrought by the fair hands of Queen Mary when a prisoner in Lochleven Castle. The old market-cross stands in the midst of the pleasure-grounds. The modern village is regularly built, and of a neat appearance.
