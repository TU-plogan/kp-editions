AGESILAUS, king of the Lacedemonians, the son of Archidamus, was raised to the throne in opposition to the superior claim of his nephew Leotychides. As soon as he came to the throne, he advised the Lacedemonians to anticipate the king of Persia, who was making great preparations for war, and to attack him in his own dominions. He was himself chosen for this expedition, and gained so many advantages over the enemy, that if the league which the Athenians and the Thebans formed against the Lacedemonians had not obliged him to return home, he would have carried his victorious arms into the very heart of the Persian empire. He gave up, however, all these triumphs readily, to come to the succour of his country, which he happily relieved by his victory over the allies in Boeotia. He obtained another near Corinth; but, to his great mortification, the Thebans afterwards gained several over the Lacedemonians. These misfortunes at first raised a clamour against him. He had been sick during the first advantages which the enemy gained; but as soon as he was able to act in person, his valour and prudence prevented the Thebans from reaping the advantages of their victories; so that it was generally believed, had he been in health at the beginning, the Lacedemonians would have sustained no losses, and that all would have been lost had it not been for his assistance. It cannot be denied but he loved war more than the interest of his country required; for if he could have lived in peace, he would have saved the Lacedemonians several losses, and they would not have been engaged in many enterprises which in the end contributed much to weaken their power. He died in the third year of the 104th Olympiad, being the 84th year of his age and 41st of his reign, and was succeeded by his son Archidamus. Agesilaus would never suffer any picture or sculpture to be made of him, and prohibited it also by his will. This he is supposed to have done from a consciousness of his own deformity; for he was of a short stature, and lame of one foot, so that strangers used to despise him at the first sight. Agesilaus was extremely fond of his children, and would often amuse himself by joining in their diversions. One day when he was surprised riding upon a stick with them, he said to a person who had seen him in this posture, “Forbear talking of it till you are a father.”
