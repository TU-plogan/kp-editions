AMRITSIR (the fountain of nectar), an open town of Hindostan, the capital of the Seik nation, and the chief place of their religious worship. It is eight miles in circuâ…›ference; has narrow streets, with lofty houses built of burnt bricks; and is still the great commercial mart for the shawls and. saffron of Cashmere, and various other commodities from the Deccan and eastern parts of India. Its manufactures are confined to a few coarse cloths and inferior silks; but from being still the resort of merchants and the residence of bankers, it is a place of considerable opulence. But the chief source of its opulence is the pond or sacred basin, immersion in which is supposed by the Seiks, and wives of the Hindoos, to purify them from all sin. It is about 135 paces square, built of bricks, in the centre of which stands a temple dedicated to Gooroo Govind Singh, in which is lodged, under a silken canopy, the book of laws written by this saint; and from 500 to 600 priests, who officiate at the temple, are supported by the pious contributions of the devotees. Long. 74. 48. E. Lat. 31. 33. N. 44 miles east from Lahore.
