+=====================================================================+


ALBINUS, Bernhard Siegfred, a celebrated physician and anatomist, was born of an illustrious family at Frankfort on the Oder in 1697. His father was then professor of the practice of medicine in the university of Frankfort; but in the year 1702 he repaired to Leyden, being nominated professor of anatomy and surgery in that university. Here his son had an opportunity of studying under the most eminent masters in Europe, who, from the singular abilities which he then displayed, had no difficulty in prognosticating his future eminence. But while he was distinguished in every branch of literature, his attention was particularly turned to anatomy and surgery. His peculiar attachment to these branches of knowledge gained him the intimate friendship of Ruysch and Rau, who at that time flourished in Leyden; and the latter, so justly celebrated as a lithotomist, is said to have seldom performed a capital operation without inviting him to be present. Having finished his studies at Leyden, he went to Paris, where he attended the lectures of Du Verney, Vaillant, and other celebrated professors. But he had scarce spent a year there when he was invited by the curators of the university of Leyden to be a lecturer on anatomy and surgery at that place. Though contrary to his own inclination, he complied with their request, and upon that occasion was created doctor of physic without any examination. Soon after, upon the death of his father, he was appointed to succeed him as professor of anatomy; and upon being admitted into that office on the 9th of November 1721, he delivered an oration, De vera via adfabricae humani corporis cognitionem ducente, which was heard with universal approbation. In the capacity of a professor, hc not only bestowed the greatest attention upon the instruction of the youth intrusted to his care, but on the improvement of the medical art. With this view he published many important discoveries of his own, and by elegant editions turned the attention of physicians to works of merit, which might otherwise have been neglected. By these means his fame was soon extended over Europe; and the societies of London, Petersburg, and Haerlem, cheerfully received him as an associate. In 1745 he was appointed professor of the practice of medicine at Leyden, and was succeeded in the anatomical chair by his brother Frid. Bern. Albinus. He was twice rector of the university, and as often he refused that high honour when it was voluntarily offered him. At length, worn out by long service and intense study, he died on the 9th of September 1770, in the 74th year of his age.
