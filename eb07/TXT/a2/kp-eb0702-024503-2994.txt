AGHRIM, a town of Ireland, in the county of Wicklow and province of Leinster, situated about 31 miles southwest of Wicklow.

Aghrim, in Galway, a small village, distant about 32 miles from Dublin, and rendered memorable by a decisive battle fought there and at Kilcommodon-hill on the 12th of July 1691, between General Ginkle and Monsieur St Huth, the commanders under King William III. and James II.; when St Ruth, the general of the Irish army, with 7000 of his men, was slain, but of the English only G00. The victory was the more considerable, as the English army consisted of no more than 18,000 men; whereas the Irish were computed at 20,000 foot and 50Ã”0 horse and dragoons. They lost likewise nine pieces of brass cannon; all their ammunition, tents, and baggage; and most of their small arms, which they threw away to expedite their flight; with 11 standards, and 32 pairs of colours.
