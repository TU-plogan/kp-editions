AMYRALDISM, a name given by some writers to the doctrine of universal grace, as explained and asserted by Amyraldus, or Moses Amyraut, and others, his followers, among the reformed in France, towards the middle of the 17 th century.

This doctrine principally consisted of the following particulars, viz. that God desires the happiness of all men, and none are excluded by a divine decree; that none can obtain salvation without faith in Christ; that God refuses to none the power of believing, though he does not grant to all his assistance, that they may improve this power to saving purposes; and that many perish through their own fault. Those who embraced this doctrine were called Urnversalists ; though it is evident they rendered grace universal in words, but partial in reality, and are chargeable with greater inconsistencies than the Supra-lapsarians.
