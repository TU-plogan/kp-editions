AFFUSION, the act of pouring some fluid substance on another body. Dr Grew gives several experiments of the luctation arising from the affusion of divers menstruums on all sorts of bodies. Divines and church historians speak of baptism by affusion, which amounts to much the same with what we now call sprinkling.
