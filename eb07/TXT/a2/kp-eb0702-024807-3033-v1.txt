AGON, a town of Sweden, in die province of Gefleborgs-land, with a good harbour in the Gulf of Finland.

Agon, among the ancients, implied any dispute or contest, whether it had regard to bodily exercises or the accomplishments of the mind; and therefore poets, musicians, painters, &c. had their agones, as well as the athletae. Games of this kind were celebrated at most of the heathen festivals with great solemnity, either annually or at certain periods of years. Among the latter were celebrated at Athens, the agon gymnicus, the agon Nemeus instituted by the Argives in the 53d Olympiad, and the agon Olympius instituted by Hercules 430 years before the first Olympiad.—The Romans also, in imitation of the Greeks, instituted contests of this kind. The emperor Aurelian established one under the name of agon solis, the contest of the sun; Dioclesian another, which he called agon Capitolinus, which was celebrated every fourth year, after the [7:2:249] manner of the Olympic games. Hence the years, instead of lustra, are sometimes numbered by agones. Agon also signified one of the ministers employed in the heathen sacrifices, and whose business it was to strike the victim. The name is supposed to have been derived from hence, that standing ready to give the stroke, he asked, Agon’ ? or Agone ? Shall I strike?
