ACHIAR is a Malayan word, which signifies all sorts of fruits and roots pickled with vinegar and spice. The Dutch import from Batavia all sorts of achiar, but particularly that of Bamboo, a kind of cane, extremely thick, which grows in the East Indies. It is preserved there, whilst it is still green, with very strong vinegar and spice; and is called bamboo achiar. The name changes according to the fruit with which the achiar is made. *
