AMURATH, or Amurat I. the fourth emperor of the Turks, and one of the greatest princes of the Ottoman empire, succeeded Solyman in 1390. He took from the Greeks Gallipoli in Thrace, and Adrianople, which last he chose for the place of his residence. He defeated the prince of Bulgaria, conquered Misnia, chastised his rebellious bashaws, and is said to have gained 36 battles. This prince, in order to form a body of devoted troops that might serve as the immediate guards of his person and dignity, appointed his officers to seize annually, as the imperial property, the fifth part of the Christian youth [7:2:673] taken in war. These, after being instructed in the Mahometan religion, inured to obedience by severe discipline, and trained to warlike exercises, were formed into a body distinguished by the name of Janizaries or New Soldiers. The Janizaries soon became the chief strength and pride of the Ottoman armies, and were distinguished above all the troops whose duty it was to attend on the person of the sultan. The death of Lazarus, despot of Servia, who had endeavoured in vain to stop the progress of Amurath’s arms, touched Milo, one of his servants, in so sensible a manner, that, in revenge, he stabbed the sultan in the midst of his troops, and killed him upon the spot, a. d. 1389, after he bad reigned 23 years.

Amurath IL, the 10th emperor of the Turks, was the eldest son of Mahomet I., and succeeded his father in 1421. He besieged Constantinople and Belgrade without success; but he took Thessalonica from the Venetians, and compelled the prince of Bosnia, and John Castriot, prince of Albania, to pay him tribute. He obliged the latter to send his three sons as hostages, among whom was George, celebrated in history by the name of Sean-derbeg. John Hunniades defeated Amurath’s troops, and obliged him to make peace with the Christian princes in 1442. These princes afterwards breaking the peace, Amurath defeated them in the famous battle of Varna, November 10, 1444, which proved so fatal to the Christians, and in which Ladislaus king of Hungary was killed. He afterwards defeated Hunniades, and killed above 20,000 of -his men; but George Castriot, better known by the name of Seanderbeg, being re-established in the estates of his father, defeated the Turks several times, and obliged Amurath to raise the siege of Croia, the capital of Albania. Amurath died, chagrined with his ill success, and infirm with age, February 11, 1451, at Adrianople. It is observed to this prince’s honour, that he always kept his treaties with the greatest fidelity.

Amurath IV., surnamed the Valiant, was the son of Achmet I., and in the year 1622, at the age of 13, succeeded his uncle Mustapha. Bagdad fell into the hands of the Persians, and several other disastrous events clouded the commencement of his reign. The recovery of Bagdad being a favourite object, in the year 1637 he marched against it; and after thirty days of unremitting assault, with the expense of much blood, he took possession of the city. By pushing his men forward to the attack by the point of the scimitar, and by slaughtering 30,000 Persians in cold blood after their surrender, he displayed the brutal ferocity of his disposition. One person alone is reported to have moved his obdurate heart on the present occasion. A famous player upon the harp entreated those who were sent to massacre him to allow him to speak to the sultan previous to his death. Informed who he was, the sultan requested him to give a specimen of his skill in his profession: with this he readily complied, and touched his harp so melodiously, and sung in such pathetic strains the lamentations on the tragedy of Bagdad, intermixed with the praises of Amurath, that the hard heart of the cruel monarch being at length softened, he melted into tears, and saved both the musician and the remaining inhabitants.

The violence of Amurath soon enfeebled his constitution; and the fruits of his debaucheries and excesses were obvious even in the prime of life. At the age of 31 he fell a victim to an excess of revelling in the feast of Bairam, in the year 1640.
