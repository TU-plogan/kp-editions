ALAVA, a province in the north of Spain, one of those three usually denominated Provincias Vascongadas, which enjoy privileges that distinguish them from the other dominions of the Spanish monarchy, and speak a language most remote from the Castilian, generally called by the natives Vascuence, and by other people the Basque. This province is of a triangular shape, bounded on the north by Guipuscoa and Biscay, on the east by Navarre, on the south and south-west by Rioja, from which it is divided by the river Ebro, and on the west by the northern part of Old Castile. The square extent of this province is 90Â½ leagues; and the population, by the census of 1803, amounted to 67,523 souls, giving a density of inhabitants somewhat exceeding the general average of Spain.

The surface of the province is-very mountainous, and is abundantly clothed with woods and lofty trees. Its valleys are fertile. The soil yields more corn than the subsistence of its inhabitants requires, as well as flax, hemp, some oil, and a kind of wine called chacoli, which, though it is drunk when new, will not long retain its qualities. The mountains abound in iron-ore, and there were once extensive manufactories of iron goods, though they have of late decreased, owing to the privileges of these provinces exempting them from all taxation, in consequence of which their productions are charged with heavy imposts on their introduction into Castile. There are numerous weavers of coarse cloths and blankets over the whole province. Shoes and hats are manufactured; but these articles, like the iron ware, have experienced a sensible declension of late years. The capital of the province is Vittoria, situated on the river Zadora, which empties itself into the Ebro. The other rivers are the Ayuda, which runs into the Zadora; and the Omecillo, which empties itself into the Ebro. ,
