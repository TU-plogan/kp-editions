AGRAM, or Zagrab, a palatinate in the Austrian province of Croatia. Its extent is 768 square miles, or 491,520 English acres. The inhabitants in 1816 were 71,357, all of the Catholic religion. It is subdivided into two circles, that of Agram and of St John; the latter of which comprehends no town. In the whole palatinate there are one city, two market towns, and 279 villages. The country is undulating, but with a range of hills towards the Warasdin frontier. It is Watered by the Save and its tributary streams. The chief productions are corn, tobacco, wine, potashes, and cattle. It contains much wood and pasture land.

Agram, one of the circles into which the palatinate of the same name in Austrian Croatia is divided. It is likewise the name of the capital of the whole. The city of Agram, in long. 16. 10. 13. E. and lat. 45. 49. 2. N., contains 2000 houses and 17,266 inhabitants. It is the seat of a bishop, of the courts of justice, and of the several boards which direct the affairs of the province of Croatia. There is an academical institution with ten professors. It has no manufactures; but the Save being navigable to the city, most of the commerce of Croatia centres in it.
