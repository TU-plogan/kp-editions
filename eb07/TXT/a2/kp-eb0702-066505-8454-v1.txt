AMOS, the fourth of the smaller prophets, who in his youtlι had been a herdsman at Tekoa, a small town about four leagues southward of Jerusalem, was sent to the king of Bashan, that is, to the people of Samaria, or the kingdom of Israel, to call them to repentance and an amendment of their lives; whence it is thought probable that he was bom within the territories of Israel, and only retired to Tekoa on his being driven from Bethel by Amaziah, the priest of the golden calves at Bethel.

The prophet having returned to Tekoa, in the kingdom of Judah, continued to prophesy. He frequently complains of the violent endeavours to force him to silence, and boldly remonstrates against the prevailing sins of the Israelites—idolatry, oppression, wantonness, and obstinacy. He likewise reproves the inhabitants of Judah, for their carnal security, sensuality, and injustice. He warns them that their sins will at last end in the ruin of Judah and Israel, which he illustrates by the visions of a plumb-line and a basket of summer fruit. It is observable, that this prophecy begins with denunciation of judgment and destruction against the Syrians, Philistines, Tyrians, and other enemies of the Jews, and concludes with comfortable promises of restoring the tabernacle of David, and erecting the kingdom of Christ Amos was chosen to the prophetic office in the time of Uzziah, king of Judah, and Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake (Amos i. 1), which, according to the rabbins and most of the modern commentators, happened in the 24th or 25th year of Uzziah, or in the year of the world 3219, when this prince usurped the priest’s office, and attempted to offer incense to the Lord. The first of the prophecies of Amos in order of time are those of the 7th chapter; the rest he pronounced in the town of Tekoa, whither he retired. He foretold the misfortunes which should befall the kingdom of Israel after the death of Rehoboam II., who was then living: he likewise predieted the death of Zechariah; the invasion of the lands belonging to Israel by Pul and Tiglath-pileser, kings of Assyria; and the captivity of the ten tribes. The time and manner of this prophet’s death are not known.
