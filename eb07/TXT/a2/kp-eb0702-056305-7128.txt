ALRESFORD, a market-town in the north division of the county of FIants, 7 miles from Winchester, and 58 from London. It consists of two parishes, having been in past ages a place of more consideration than of late years, as the river Itchen, on whose banks it is built, has long ceased to be navigable. In 1801 the population was 1132; in 1811, 1429; and in 1821, 1264.
