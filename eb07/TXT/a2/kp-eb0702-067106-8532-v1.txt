AMRU-EBN-AL-AS, one of the most famous of the first race of Saracen leaders, was descended of Asia, of the tribe of Koreĩsh, by a notorious prostitute. In his youth he indulged in poetry, and wrote satirical verses against the person and doctrine of Mahomet. His zeal in opposing the new religion prompted him to undertake an embassy to the king of Ethiopia, to stimulate him against the converts whom he had taken under hiś protection. It is uncertain by what arguments he was induced to change his religious sentiments; but he returned a convert to the Mahometan faith, and, along with Caled, joined the fugitive prophet a't Medina. The military talents of Amru had begun to attract general attention, when Abubeker resolved to make a new attack upon Syria, in which he obtained the chief command. After several displays of his military valour and address in some successful enterprises, he rose to the elevated station of chief in Irak, when Caled requested the attendance of all the Arabian generals before Damascus. During the caliphate of Omar he also served in Palestine, under Abu Obeidah. While besieging Caesarea, he held a memorable conference’with Constantine, the son of the emperor Heraclius. Historians mention that their time was chiefly occupied in producing genealogical arguments to prove the affinity of the Greeks and Arabians, and the consequent rights of the latter as their descendants.

After the death of Obeidah, Amru assumed the chief command in Syria, in which he was confirmed by the caliph, notwithstanding the opposition of Othman. An expedition against Egypt having been resolved upon, Amrιι wrote to the caliph, informing him that he would instantly march into that country. During the progress of his march, attended by only 4000 Arabs, a messenger from Omar arrived with a letter, containing directions to return, if he should receive this letter in the territories of Syria; but if he should receive it in those of Egypt, he might advance, and all needful assistance would be instantly sent him. Anticipating the contents, he hastened on to the frontiers of Egypt, and read the instructions of the caliph. Then requesting some of the inhabitants to be brought before him, and inquiring of them in what country they were, and being informed that they were in Egypt, Amru replied, “Let us, then, continue our march.” Having taken Pharma, he advanced to Misrah, the ancient Memphis, and besieged it for seven months. Although numerous reinforcements arrived, he would have found it very difficult to storm the place previous to the inundation of the Nile, if Mokawkas had not treacherously lessened the forces of the citadel, which was consequently taken by storm; and the Greeks who remained there were either made prisoners or put to the sword. On die same spot Amru erected a city named Fostat, the ruins of which are now known by the name of Old Cairo. The Coptic Christians, who composed the great majority of the Egyptian natives, and who were enemies to the Catholic Greeks, after this victory submitted to Amru, and engaged to provide quarters and support for the Mussulman army.

Aιnru pursued the Greeks to Alexandria, and, after an obstinate and bloody siege of 14 months, the city was taken A. D. 640. He was disposed to preserve the famous library, and to give it as a present to John the grammarian; but, by the command of the caliph, he was obliged to commit it to the flames. If the relation is not exaggerated, such was the number of books in that famous library, that they afforded fuel to 5000 baths during the space of six months.

In the year 663, of the Hegira 43, Amru died in his government of Egypt, highly esteemed, and much regretted by his countrymen. In a pathetic oration to his children on his death-bed, he bitterly lamented his youthful offence in satirizing the prophet, although Mahomet had forgiven the offence, and had frequently affirmed that “there was no Mussulman more sincere and stedfast in the faith than Amru.”
