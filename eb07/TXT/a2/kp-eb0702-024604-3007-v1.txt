AGITATOR, in Antiquity, a term sometimes used for a charioteer, especially those who drove in the circus at the curule games.

Agitators, in English History, certain officers set up in the army in 1647, to take care of its interests. Cromwell joined the agitators, only with a view to serve his own ends; which being once accomplished, he found means tó get them abolished.
