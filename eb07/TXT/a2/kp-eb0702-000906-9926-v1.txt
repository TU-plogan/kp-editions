ABAISSED, abaisse, in Heraldry, an epithet applied to the wings of eagles, &c. when the tip looks downwards to the point of the shield, or when the wings are shut; the natural way of bearing them being extended.

ΑΒΑΚΑ, khan, the eighth emperor of the Moguls, a wise and good prince, ascended the throne in 1264. He reigned 17 years, and is by some authors said to have been a Christian. It may be admitted, indeed, that he joined with the Christians in keeping the feast of Easter, in the city Hamadan, a short time before his death. But this is no proof of his Christianity; it being common, in times of brotherly love, for Christians and Mahometans to join in keeping the same feasts, when each would compliment the other with doing honour to his solemnity.
