AERARIUS, a name given by the Romans to a degraded citizen, who had been struek off the list of his century. Sueh persons were so called, because they were liable to all the taxes (aera), without enjoying any of its privileges.

The aerarii were incapable of making a will, of inheriting, of voting in assemblies, or of enjoying any post of honour or profit in effect, they were only subject to the burdens, without the benefits of society; yet they retained their freedom, and were not reduced to the condition of slaves. To be made an aerarius was a punishment inflicted for some offence, and reputed one degree more severe than to be expelled a tribe, tribu moveri. Aerarius was likewise an officer instituted by Alexander Severus, for the distribution of the money given in largesses to the soldiery or people.

Aerarius was also used for a person employed in coining or working brass. These are sometimes called aerarii fusores. At other times, aerarius is distinguished from fusor ; the former answering to what we now call coppersmiths, the latter to founders.

Aerarius was also applied to a soldier who receives pay.
