AGRIA, called by the Germans Eger, is a strong town in Upper Hungary, situated on a river of the same name, and has a citadel called Eriaw. It was besieged by the Turks in 1552, with 70,000 men; but they lost 8000 in one day, and were obliged to raise the siege, though the garrison consisted only of 2000 Hungarians, assisted by the women, who performed wonders on this occasion. However, it was afterwards taken by Mahomet III. in 1596, but was retaken by the emperor in 1687; since which time it has continued under the dominion of the house of Austria. It is 47 miles north-east of Buda, and 55 south-west of Cassovia. Long. 20. 10. E. Lat. 48. 10. N.
