ABUNDANT Number, in Arithmetic, is a number, the [7:2:48]sum of whose aliquot parts is greater than the number itself. Thus, the aliquot parts of 12 being 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, they make, when added together, 16. An abundant number is opposed to a deficient number, or that which is greater than all its aliquot parts taken together; as 14, whose aliquot parts are 1, 2, and 7, which makes no more than 10; and to a perfect number, or one to which its aliquot parts are equal, as 6, whose aliquot parts are 1, 2, and 3.
