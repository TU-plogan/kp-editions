ADMINISTRATOR, in English Law, he to whom the ordinary commits the administration of the goods of a person deceased, in default of an executor. If the administrator die, his executors are not administrators; but the court is to grant a new administration. The origin of administrators is derived from the civil law. Their establishment in England is owing to a statute made in the 31st year of Edward III. Till then, no office of this kind was known beside that of executor; in ease of a want of which, the ordinary had the disposal of goods of persons intestate, &c.

Administrator, in Scotish Law, a person legally empowered to act for another whom the law presumes incapable of acting for himself.

Administrator is sometimes used for the president of a province; for a person appointed to receive, manage, and distribute the revenues of an hospital or religious house; for a prince who enjoys the revenues of a secularized bishop; and for the regent of a kingdom during the minority of a prince or a vacancy of the throne.
