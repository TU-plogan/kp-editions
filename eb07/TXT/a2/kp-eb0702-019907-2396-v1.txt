AETIUS, one of the most zealous defenders of Arianism, was born in Syria, and flourished about the year 336. After being servant to a grammarian, of whom he learned grammar and logic, he was ordained deacon, and at length bishop, by Eudoxus, patriarch of Constantinople. Aetius was banished into Phrygia on account of his religious opinions; but was recalled from exile on the accession of Julian, and was much esteemed by that emperor. He died, it is supposed, at Constantinople, about the year 366. St Epiphanius has preserved 47 of his propositions against the Trinity. His followers were called Aetians. Aetius, a famous physician, born at Amida in Mesopotamia, and the author of a work entitled Tetrabiblos, which is a collection from the writings of those physicians who went before him. He lived, according to Dr Freind, in the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century.

Aetius, governor of Gallia Narbonensis in the reign of Valentinian HI., forced the Franks who were passing into Gaul to repass the Rhine. He defeated the Goths, and routed Attila, king of the Huns, who invaded Gaul with an army of 700,000 men. But the emperor, jealous of the merit of this great man, killed him in 454, with his own hand, under the pretence that he had permitted the invasion of the Huns, after Attila’s defeat.
