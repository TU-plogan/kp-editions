AGNES, St, a large mining village in the county of Cornwall, 168 miles from London, and five from Truro. It is on a small rocky harbour, only accessible to fishing boats, on the Bristol Channel. It contained, in 1801, 4161 inhabitants; in 1811, 4960; and in 1821, 5762. It is also the name of one of the Scilly Islands, on the coast of Cornwall. The soil is fertile, and tolerably cultivated; but there is a great deficiency of water. A light-house on the island, about 50 feet in height, built on one of the loftiest hills, is an important object to seamen. Its exact position, as ascertained by the great trigonometrical survey, is in long. 6. 19. 23. W. and lat. 49. 53. 38. N. from Greenwich. The light is composed of Argand lamps, with reflectors, moving in a circular revolution, and presenting a bright and conspicuous light in every direction once a minute. To the westward of St Agnes is the Gillstone rock, on which Sir Cloudeslcy Shovel was lost in the Association ship of war in 1707.
