AGITATION, the act of shaking a body, or tossing it backwards and forwards.

Agitation, in Physic, is often used for an intestine 'commotion of the parts of a natural body. Fermentation and effervescence are attended with a brisk agitation of the particles.

Agitation is one of the chief causes or instruments of mixtion; by the agitation of the parts of the blood and chyle, in their continual circulation, sanguification is in a good measure effected. Butter is made out of milk by the same means; in which operation a separation is made of the oleous parts from the serous, and a conjunction of the oleous together. Digestion itself is only supposed to be an insensible kind of agitation.

Agitation is reputed one of the symptoms of inspiration. Petit informs us,^[1. [m]1 Petit. De Sibylla , L. i. Nouv. Rep. Lett. tom. viii. p. 1113.] that in the last century there arose in a church of Italy, for the space of a year, a vapour of an extraordinary kind, which put all the people into trembling and agitations, and, unless they got away betimes, set them a dancing, with strange contortions and gesticulations. This seems to verify what has been related of the temple of Delphi.
