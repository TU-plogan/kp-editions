ALAN, Cardinal William, was born at Rossal, in Lancashire, in the year 1532. He went to Oxford at the age of 15, and in 1550 was elected fellow of Oriel College. In 1556, being then only 24 years old, he was chosen principal of St Mary’s Hall, and one of the proctors of the university. In 1558 he was made canon of York; but, upon Queen Elizabeth’s accession to the throne, he left England, and settled at Louvaine, in an English college, of which he became the chief support. In 1565 he visited his native country; but on account of his extreme activity in the propagation of the Roman Catholic religion, he was obliged to fly the kingdom in 1568. He went first to Mechlin, and then to Douay, where be was made doctor of divinity. Soon after he was appointed canon of Cambray, and then canon of Rheims. He was created cardinal on the 28th of July 1587, by the title of St Mar-tin in Montibus, and obtained from the king of Spain à rich abbey in the kingdom of Naples, and afterwards the bishopric of Mechlin. It is supposed to have been by the advice and instigation of this priest that Philip II. attempted to invade England. He died on the 20th of October 1594, aged 63, and was buried in the English college at Rome. He was a man of considerable learning, and an elegant writer. He wrote many books in defence of the Romish religion. The most remarkable are, 1. A Defence of the Twelve Martyrs in one .Year. Tho. Alfield was hanged for bringing into England and publishing this and others of Alan’s works, in the year 1584. 2. A Declaration of the Sentence of Sextus V. &c.; a work intended to explain the pope’s bull for the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth, and to exhort the people of England to take up arms in favour of the Spaniards. Many thousand copies of this book, printed at Antwerp, were put on board the Armada; but the enterprise failing, they were afterwards destroyed. 3. Of the Worship due to Saints and their Relics, 1583. This treatise was answered by Lord Burleigh, and is esteemed the most elegant of the cardinal’s writings.
