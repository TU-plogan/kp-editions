ACARNANIA, a country of Free Greece, or Greece Proper, bounded on the north by the Sinus Ambracius, and separated from Aetolia by the river Achelous on the east, and on the west by the Ionian Sea. This country was famous for an excellent breed of horses; so that Azasνανικjος 'ι<κπος is a proverbial saying for any thing excellent in its kind. It now forms the western part of Livadia.
