ALADULIA, a considerable province of Turkey in Asia, in that part called Natolia, between the mountains of Antitaurus, which separate it from Amasia on the north, and from Caramania on the west. It has the Mediterranean Sea on the south; and the Euphrates or Frat on the east, whieh divides it from Diarbekir. It comprehends the Lesser Armenia of the ancients, and the east part of Cilicia. Formerly it had kings of its own; but the head of the last king was cut off by Selim I. emperor of the Turks, who had conquered the country. It is now divided into two parts: the north, comprehended between Taurus, Antitaurus, and the Euphrates, is a beglerbeglic, which bears the name of Marash, the capital town; and the south, seated between Mount Taurus and the Mediterranean, is united to the beglerbeglic of Aleppo. The country is rough, rugged, and mountainous; yet there are good pastures, and plenty of horses and camels. The people are hardy and thievish. The capital is Malatigah.
