AMBROSIN, in middle-age writers, denotes a coin struck by the lords or dukes of Milan, whereon was represented St Ambrose on horseback, with a whip in his right hand. The occasion of this coinage is said to have been a vision of that saint, who appeared to the Milanese general in 1339, during the time of a battle.
