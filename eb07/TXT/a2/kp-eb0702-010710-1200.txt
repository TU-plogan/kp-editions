ACORUS, Calamus Aromaticus, Sweet Flag, or Sweet Rush. Acorus, in the Materia Medica, a name sometimes given to the great galangal.

Acorus, in Natural History, blue coral. The true sort is very scarce; some, however, is fished on the coasts of Africa, particularly from Rio del Re to the river of the Camarones. This coral is part of the merchandise which the Dutch trade for with the Camarones: that of the kingdom of Benin is also very much esteemed. It grows in form of a tree on a rocky bottom.
