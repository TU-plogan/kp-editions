AKIBA, a famous rabbin, flourished a little after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. He kept the flocks of a rich citizen of Jerusalem till the 40th year of his age, and then devoted himself to study in the academies for twenty-four years; and was afterwards one of the greatest masters in Israel. According to the Jewish accounts, he had 24,000 scholars. He declared for the impostor Bar-cochebas, whom he owned for the Messiah; and not only anointed him king, but took upon himself the office of his master of the horse. The troops which the emperor Hadrian sent against the Jews, who under the conduct of this false Messiah had committed horrid .massacres, exterminated this faction, ^Î¹kiba was taken, and put to death with great cruelty. He lived 120 years, and was buried with his wife in a cave upon a mountain not far from Tiberias, and his 24,000 scholars were buried round about him upon the same mountain. It is imagined he invented a supposititious work under the name of the patriarch Abraham.
