ADESSENARIANS, Adessenarii, in Church History, a sect of Christians who hold the real presence of Christâ€™s body in the eucharist, though not by way of transubstantiation. They differ considerably as to this presence; some holding that the body of Christ is in the bread, others that it is about the bread, and others that it is under the bread.
