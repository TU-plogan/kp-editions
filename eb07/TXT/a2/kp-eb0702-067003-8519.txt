AMPHORA, in Antiquity, a liquid measure among the Greeks and Romans. The Roman amphora contained 48 sextaries, equal to about seven gallons one pint English wine measure; and the Grecian or Attic amphora contained one third more.

Amphora was also a dry measure used by the Romans, and contained about three bushels.

Amphora, among the Venetians, is the largest measure used for liquids, containing about 16 quarts.
