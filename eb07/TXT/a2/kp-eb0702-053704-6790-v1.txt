ALMUGGIM, Almiggim, or Almug Tree, a certain kind of wood mentioned in the first book of Kings (x. 11), which the Vulgate translates ligna thyina, and the Sep-tuagint wrought wood.

But it is observed, that the almug tree can by no means be coral, because that is not fit for the purposes for which the Scripture tells uś the almug tree was used, such as musical instruments, staircases, &c. The word thyinum is a name for the citron tree, known to the ancients, and very much esteemed for its sweet odour and great beauty. It came from Mauritania.

ALMünECAR, a small city of the province of Granada, in Spain. The soil around it is productive of all the tropical vegetables. Sugar-canes grow as large and as juicy as in the West Indies, the cotton is of excellent quality, and the rum made here is deemed equal to that θf Jamaica.

It contains 2100 inhabitants. Long. 3. 54. W. Lat. 36. 42. N
