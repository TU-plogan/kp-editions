ALCAMO, a city of Sicily, on the river Freddo or St Bartholomew, in the intendancy of Trapani. It is a parliamentary city, in a district of peculiar fertility, which produces some of the best wines of the island. It contains a very strong castle, many churches and monasteries, and 13,000 inhabitants. Near to it are remains of the ancient Segesta, with its temple and theatre in good preservation; and near the sea are some celebrated warm baths.
