AMBITUS, in Roman Antiquity, the setting up for some magistracy or office, and formally going round the city to solicit the interest and votes of the people. Ambitus differed from ambition, as the former lies in the act, the latter in the mind. Ambitus was of two kinds; one lawful, the other infamous. The first, called also ambitus popularis, was when a person offered his service to the republic frankly, leaving it to every body to judge of his pretensions as they found reasonable. The means and instruments here made use of were various: 1. Amici, or friends, under different relations, including cognati, affines, necessarii, familiares, vicini, tribules, clientes, municipes, sodales, collegae ; 2. Nomenclatura, or the calling and saluting every person by his name; to which purpose, the candidates were attended by an officer, under the denomination of interpres, or nomenclator ; 3. Blanditia, or obliging persons, by serving them or their friends, patrons, or the like, with their vote and interest on other occasions; 4. Prensatio, the shaking every person by the hand, offering him his service, friendship, &c. The second kind was that wherein force, cajoling, money, or other extraordinary influence, was made use of. This was held infamous, and severely punished as a source of corruption and other mischiefs. Ambitus was practised not only at Rome and in the forum, but in the meetings and assemblies of other towns in Italy, where numbers of citizens were usually found, on account of trade and business. The practice ceased in the city from the time of the emperors, as offices were not then to be obtained by courting the people, but by favour of the prince. Persons who had causes depending practised the same, going about among the judges to implore their favour and mercy. They who practised this were called Ambitiosi. Hence we also meet with ambitiosa decreta, and ambitiosa justa, used for such sentences and decrees as were thus procured from the judges, contrary to reason and equity, either gratuitously or for money.
