ALAMOS, Balthasar, a Spanish writer, born at Medina del Campo, in Castile. After having studied the law at Salamanca, he entered into the service of Anthony Perez, secretary of state under Philip II. He was in high esteem and confidence with his master, upon which account he was imprisoned after the disgrace of this minister. He was kept in confinement 11 years, when Philip III. coming to the throne, set him at liberty, according to the orders given by his father in his will. Alamos continued in a private capacity till the duke of Olivarez, the favourite of Philip IV., called him to public employments. He was a man of wit as well as judgment, but his pen was superior to his tongue. He died in the 88th year of his age. His Spanish translation of Tacitus, and the aphorisms which he added in the margin, gained him great reputation. This work was published at Madrid in 1014, and was to have been followed, as mentioned in the kingâ€™s privilege, with a commentary, which, however, has never yet appeared. The author composed the whole during his imprisonment.
