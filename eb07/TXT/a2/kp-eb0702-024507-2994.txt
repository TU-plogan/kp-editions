AGIOSYMANDRUM, a wooden instrument used by the Greek and other churches, under the dominion of the Turks, to call together assemblies of the people. The agiosymandrum was introduced in the place of bells, which the Turks prohibited their Christian subjects the use of, lest they should make them subservient to sedition.
