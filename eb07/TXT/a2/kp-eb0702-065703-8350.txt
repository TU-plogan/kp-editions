AMISUS, in Ancient Geography, the chief city of the ancient kingdom of Pontus. It was built by the Milesians, and peopled partly by them and partly by a colony from Athens. It was at first a free city, like the other Greek cities in Asia; but afterwards subdued by Pharnaces, king of Pontus, who made it his metropolis. It was taken by Lucullus in the Mithridatic war, who restored it to its ancient liberty. Close by Amisus stood another city, called Eupatoria, from Mithridates Eupator, its founder. Amisus is now called Samsoon.
