AEGYPTILLA, in Natural History, the name of a stone described by the ancients, and said by some authors to have the remarkable quality of giving water the colour and taste of wine. This seems a very imaginary virtue, as are indeed too many of those in former ages attributed to stones. The descriptions left us of this remarkable fossil tell us, that it was variegated with, or composed of, veins of black or white, or black and bluish, with sometimes a plate or vein of whitish red. The authors of these accounts seem to have understood by this name the several stones of the onyx, sardonyx, and cameo kind; all which we have at present common among us, but none of which possesses any such strange properties.
