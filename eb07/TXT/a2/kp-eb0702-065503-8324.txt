AMETHYST, a transparent gem of a purple colour, which seems composed of a strong blue and a deep red; and, according as either of these prevails, affording different tinges of purple, sometimes approaching to violet, and sometimes even fading to a pale rose colour. Though the amethyst is generally of a purple colour, it is nevertheless sometimes found naturally colourless, and may at any time be easily made so by putting it into the fire; in which pellucid or colourless state it so resembles the diamond, that its want of hardness seems the only way of distinguishing it. Some derive the name amethyst from its colour, which resembles wine mixed with water; while others, with more probability, think it got its name from its supposed virtue of preventing drunkenness,—an opinion which, however imaginary, prevailed to that degree among the ancients, that it was usual for great drinkers to wear it about their necks. Be this as it may, the amethyst is scarcely inferior to any of the gems in the beauty of its colour, and in its purest state is of the same hardness, and at least of equal value, with the ruby and sapphire. It is found of various sizes, from the bigness of a small vetch to an inch and a half in diameter, and often to much more, than that in length. Its shape is extremely various, sometimes roundish, sometimes oblong, and at others flatted, at least on one side; but its most common appearance is in a crystalliform figure, consisting of a thick column composed of four planes, and terminated by a flat and short pyramid of the same number of sides; or else of a thinner and longer hexangular column; and sometimes of a long pyramid without any column. It makes the gayest figure in the last of these states, but is hardest and most valuable in the roundish and pebble-like form. The amethyst is found in the East and West Indies, and in several parts of Europe; the oriental ones, at least some of the finer specimens, being so hard and bright as to equal any of the coloured gems in value. However, by far the greater number of amethysts fall infinitely short of these; as all the European ones, and not a few of those brought from the East and West Indies, are very little harder than common crystal.

Counterfeit or Factitious AMETHYST. Spars and crystals tinged red and yellow, &c. are sold for amethysts. The false ones come from Germany, are tinged by vapours in the mines, and contain lead.

Amethysts may be counterfeited by glass, to which the proper colour or stain is given. There were fine ones made in France about the year 1690, which may even impose on connoisseurs, unless the stone be taken out of the collet.

Amethyst, in Heraldry, a term for the purple colour in the coat of a nobleman, in use with those who blazon with precious stones instead of metals and colours. This, in a gentleman’s escutcheon, is called Purpure; and in those of sovereign princes, Mercury.
