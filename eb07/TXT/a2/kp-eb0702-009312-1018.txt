ACHATES, the companion of Aeneas, and his most faithful friend, celebrated in Virgil.

Achates, in Natural History, the same as Agate. Achates, in Ancient Geography, a river of Sicily, now the Drillo ; which runs from north to south, almost parallel with, and at no great distance from the Gela; and rises in the north of the territory of Noto. It gave name to the achates, or agate, said to be first found there.
