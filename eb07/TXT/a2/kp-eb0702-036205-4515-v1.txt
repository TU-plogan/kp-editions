AHITHOPHEL, a native of Gillo, was for some timethe counsellor of King David, whom he at length deserted by joining in the rebellion of Absalom. This prince, upon his being preferred to the crown by the greater part of the Israelites, sent for Ahithophel from Gillo (2 Sam. xv. 12) to assist him with his adviee in the present state of his affairs; for at that timeΛhithopheΓs eounselswerc received as the oracles of God himself (ehap. xvi. ult. y ). Nothing gave David more uneasiness than this event; and when Hushai his friend came to wait on him and attend him in his flight, he entreated him to return ratlιer to Jerusalem, make a show of offering his services to Absalom, and endeavour to frustrate the prudent measures which should be proposed by Ahithophel. When Absalom was come to Jerusalem, he desired Ahithophel to deliberate with his other counsellors upon the measures whieh were proper for him to take. Ahithophel advised him, in the first place, to abuse his father’s concubines; so that when his party should understand that he had dishonoured his father in this manner, they might conclude that there were no hopes of a réconciliation, and therefore espouse his interest more resolutely. A tent, therefore, being prepared for this purpose upon the terrace of the king’s palace, Absalom, in the sight of all Israel, lay with his father’s concubines. The next thing Ahithophel proposed was in the terms following: “Let me now choose out 12,000 men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night; and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and ali the people that are with him shall flee, and I will smite the king only; and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekcst is as if all returned; so all the people shall be in peace.” This adviee was very agreeable to Absalom and all the elders of Israel. However, Absalom desired Hushai to be called to have his opinion. Hushai being come, and hearing what advice Ahithophel had given, said, “The counsel whieh Ahithophel has given is not good at this time; what, for the present, in my opinion, may do better, is this: “Let all Israel be gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and put thyself in the midst of them; and wherever David is, we will fall upon him, and overwhelm him with our numbers, as the dew falleth upon the ground.” The last advice[7:2:363], being more agreeable to Absalom and all the elders of Israel, was preferred; upon which Ahithophel saddled his ass, went to his house at Gillo, hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. He foresaw, without doubt, all that would happen in consequence of Hushai’s advice, and was determined to prevent the death which lie had deserved, and which David would probably have inflicted on him as soon as he should be resettled on his throne.
