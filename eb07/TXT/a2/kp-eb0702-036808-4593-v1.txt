AITON, William, an eminent botanist and gardener, was born at a village near Hamilton in Scotland in 1731. Having been regularly trained to the profession of a gardener, he came into England in the year 1754, and soon obtained the notice of the celebrated Philip Miller, then superintendent of the physic garden at Chelsea, who engaged him as an assistant. His industry and abilities recommended him to the princess-dowager of Walesas a fit person to manage the botanical garden at Kew. In 1759 he was appointed to this office, in which he continued during life, and which was the source of his fame and fortune. The garden at Kew, under the auspices of his present Majesty, was destined to be the grand repository of all the vegetable riches which could be accumulated by regal munificence, from researches through every quarter of the globe. These treasures were fortunately committed to the hands of Mr Aiton, whose care and skill in their cultivation, and intelligence in their arrangement, acquired him high reputation among the lovers of the science, and the particular esteem of his royal patrons. Under his superintendence many improvements took place in the plan and edifices of Kew gardens, which rendered them the principal scene of botanical culture in the kingdom. In 1783 his merit was properly rewarded with the lucrative office of managing the pleasure and kitchen gardens of Kew, which he was allowed to retain with the [7:2:369] botanical department. In 1789 he published his Hortus Kewensis, or a Catalogue of the Plants cultivated in the Royal Botanical Garden at Kcw, in 3 vols. 8vo, with 13 plates; a work which had been the labour of many years. The number of species contained in this work amounted to between five and six thousand, many of which had not before been described. A new and curious article in it relates to the first introduction of particular exotics into the English gardens. The system of arrangement adopted is the Linnaean, with improvements, which the advanced state of botanical science required. Mr Aiton, with candour and modesty, acknowledges the assistance he received in this work from the two eminent Swedish naturalists, Dr Solander and Mr Jonas Dryander. Indeed, his character was such as secured him the friendship and good offices of the most distinguished names in science of his time. He was for many years peculiarly honoured by the notice of Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society. The Hortus Kewensis was received with avidity by the botanic world, and a large impression was soon disposed of.

Notwithstanding the singular activity and temperance of Mr Aiton, he fell into that incurable malady, a schirrous liver, of which he died in 1793, in his 62d year. His eldest son, devoted to the same pursuits, was, by the king’s own nomination, appointed to all his father’s employments. Mr Alton’s private character was highly estimable for mildness, benevolence, piety, and every domestic and social virtue. He was interred in the church-yard of Kew, amidst a most respectable concourse of friends.
