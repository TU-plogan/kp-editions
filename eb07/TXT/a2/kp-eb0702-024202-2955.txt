AGATHIAS, or, as he calls himself in his epigrams, Agathius, distinguished by the title of Scholasticus, a Greek historian in the sixth century, in the reign of Justinian. He was born at Myrina, a colony of the ancient Aeolians, in Asia the Less, at the mouth of the river Phythicus. He was an advocate at Smyrna. Though he had a taste for poetry, he was yet more famous for his history, which begins with the 26th year of Justinian’s reign, where Procopius ends. It was printed in Greek and Latin by Vulcanius, at Leyden, 1594, in 4to; and at Paris, at the king’s printing house, 1660, in folio.
