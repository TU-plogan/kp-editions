ALKALI, in Chemistry, denotes a particular class of salts. The word alkali is of Arabian origin, and was introduced into chemistry after it had been applied to a plant which still retains the name of kali. When this plant is burnt, the ashes washed in water, and the water evaporated to dryness, a white substance remains, which is called alkali. See Chemistry.
