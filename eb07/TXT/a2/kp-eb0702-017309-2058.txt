AEOLIAE Insulae, now Isoli Lipari, in Ancient Geography, seven islands situated between Sicily and Italy; so called from Aeolus, who reigned there about the time of the Trojan war. The Greeks call them Hephoestiades ; and the Romans Vulcaniae, from their fiery eruptions. They are also called Liparaeorum Insulae, from their principal island Lipara. Dionysius Periegetes calls them ∏λura∕, because circumnavigable.
