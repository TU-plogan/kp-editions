ABAS, a weight used in Persia for weighing pearls. It is one-eighth less than the European carat.

Abas, in heathen mythology, was the son of Hypothoon and Meganira, who entertained Ceres, and offered a sacrifice to that goddess; but Abas ridiculing the ceremony, and giving her opprobrious language, she sprinkled him with a certain mixture she held in her cup, on which he became a newt or water lizard.
