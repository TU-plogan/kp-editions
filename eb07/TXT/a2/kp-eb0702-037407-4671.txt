ALASCO, John, a Polish nobleman of the 16th century, who, imbibing the reformed opinions, was expelled his country, and became preacher to a Protestant congregation at Embden; but foreseeing persecution there, he came to England about the year 1551, while the reformation was carrying on under Edward VI. The publication of the Interim driving the Protestants to such places as afforded them toleration, 380 were naturalized here, and obtained a charter of incorporation, by which they were erected into an ecclesiastical establishment, independent on the church of England. The Augustine friars church was granted them, with the revenues, for the maintenance of Alasco as superintendent, with four assistant ministers, who were to be approved of by the king; and this congregation lived undisturbed until the accession of Queen Mary, when they were all sent away. Thèy were kindly received, and permitted to settle at Embden; and Alasco at last, after an absence of 20 years, by the favour of Sigismund, returned to his own country, where he died in 1560. Alasco was much esteemed by Erasmus, and the historians of his time speak greatly in his praise. We have of his writing, De Coena Domini, liber ; Epistola continens Summam controversiae de Coena Domini, &c. He had some particular tenets; and his followers are called Alascani in church history. »
