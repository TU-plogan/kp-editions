ANAPLORETICS, medicines that promote the growth or granulation of the flesh in wounds, ulcers, &c.

ĂNARCHI (Avagxw), in Antiquity, a name given by the Athenians to four supernumerary days in their year, during which they had no magistrates. The Attic year was divided into 10 parts, according to the number of tribes, to whom the presidency of the senate fell by turns. Each division consisted of 35 days; what remained after the expiration of these, to make the lunar year complete, which according to their computation consisted of 354 days, were employed in the creation of magistrates, and called αvαξ ι ∙χpι r ∣ μiξaι, and αgχα∕gεtf∕o∕.
