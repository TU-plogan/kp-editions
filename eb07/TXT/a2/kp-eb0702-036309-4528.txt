AJAN, a coast and country of Africa, has the river Quilimanci on the south; the mountains from which the river springs, on the west; Abyssinia or Ethiopia, and the strait of Babelmandel, on the north; and the Eastern or Indian Ocean on the cast. The coast abounds with all the necessaries of life, and has plenty of very good horses. The whole sea-coast, from Zanguebar to the strait of Babelmandel, is called the coast of Ajan; and a considerable part of it is styled the Desert coast.
