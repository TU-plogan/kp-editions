ALMAZARRON, a town of Murcia in Spain, on the coast of the Mediterranean. In its vicinity is found a fine red earth without any mixture of sand, called alma-gri, which is very much valued by the polishers of mirrors, and is mixed with all the snuff in the royal manufactory of Seville. This production is supposed by Bowles to be of volcanic origin.
