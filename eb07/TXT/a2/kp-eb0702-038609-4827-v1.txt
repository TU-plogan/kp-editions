ALCASSAR do Sal, a town of Portugal, in Estremadura, which has a castle said to be impregnable. It is indeed very strong, both by art and nature, being built on the top of a rock which is exceedingly steep on all sides. Here is a salt-work, which produces very white salt, from whence the town takes its name. The fields produce large quantities of a sort of rushes, of which they make mats, which are transported out of the kingdom. Long. 9. 10. W. Lat. 38. 18. N.

Alcassar, a city of Barbary, seated about two leagues from Larache, in Asga, a province of the kingdom of Fez. It was of great note, and the seat of the governor of this part of the kingdom. It was built by Jacob Al-manzor, king of Fez, about the year 1180, and designed for a magazine and place of rendezvous for the great preparations he was making to enter Granada in Spain, and to make good the footing which Joseph Almanzor had got some time before. It is said his father first invaded Spain with 300,000 men, most of whom he was obliged to bring back to Africa to quell a rebellion that had broke out in Morocco. This done, he returned to Spain again with an army, as is said, of 200,000 horse and 300,000 foot. The city is now fallen greatly to decay, so that of fifteen mosques there are only two that they make use of. The reason, probably, is the bad situation of the town; for it stands so low, that it is excessively hot in summer, and almost overflowed with water in the winter. This they affirm to be owing to the curse of one of their saints. Here are a great number of storks, which live very familiarly with the people, walking about the town, possessing the tops of the houses and mosques without molestation; for they esteem them sacred birds, and account it sinful to disturb them. At present the bashaw of Tetuan appoints a governor to this town, which is the last of his dominions towards Mequinez. Near this city there is a high ridge of mountains running towards Tetuan, whose inhabitants were never brought entirely under subjection; and whenever it was attempted, they revenged themselves by infesting the roads and robbing and destroying the travellers. When they were pursued, they retired into their woody [7:2:387] mountains, where none could safely follow them. Not far from hence is the river Elmahassen, famous for the battle fought between Don Sebastian, king of Portugal, and the Moors, in which the Portuguese were defeated, and their king slain. Long. 12. 35. W. Lat. 35.15. N.
