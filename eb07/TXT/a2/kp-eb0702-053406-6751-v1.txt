ALMERIA, a city of Spain, in the province of Granada, in Andalusia. It is situated on a rocky promontory hear Cape de Gat, and from the strength of the port was deemed by the Moorish kings of Granada the most valuable of their fortresses and commercial ports; from whence their cruisers overawed the Catalans and Italians, and the merchants conveyed their various merchandise to Africa, Egypt, and Syria. In its vicinity are found sapphires, cornelians, jaspers, agates, and other precious stones. Near it is the Sierra de Gador, a most enormous mass of marble, whose top rises above the level of the sea to the height of more than 7500 feet, and is covered with snow three quarters of the year. Almeria is the see of a bishop, and has a splendid cathedral. This place contains 7200 inhabitants. There are here manufactories of tar and saltpetre. Long. 1. 44. 54. W. Lat. 36. 51. N.
