ALBAN, St, is said to have been the first person who suffered martyrdom for Christianity in Britain; he is therefore usually styled the protomartyr of this island. He was born at Verulam, and flourished towards the end of the third century. In his youth he took a journey to Rome, in company with zlmphibalus, a monk of Caerleon, and served seven years as a soldier under the emperor Dioclesian. At his return home he settled at Verulam, and, through the example and instructions of Amphibalqs, renounced the errors of Paganism, in which he had been educated, and became a convert to the Christian religion. It is generally agreed that Alban suffered martyrdom during the great persecution under the reign of Dioclesian; but authors differ as to the year when it happened. Bede and others fix it in 286; some refer it to the year 296; but Usher reckons it amongst the events of 303. The story and circumstances relating to his martyrdom, according to Bede, are as follows :—Being yet a Pagan (or at. least it not being known that he was a Christian), he entertained Amphibalus in his house. The Roman governor being informed thereof, sent a party of soldiers to apprehend Amphibalus; but Alban, putting on the habit of his guest, presented himself in his stead, and was carried before that magistrate. The governor having asked him of what family he was, Alban replied, “To what purpose do you inquire of my family? if you would know my religion, I am a Christian.” Then being asked his name, he answered, “My name is Alban, and I worship the only true and living God, who created all things.” The magistrate replied, “If you would enjoy the happiness of eternal life, delay not to sacrifice to the great gods.” Alban answered, “The sacrifices you offer are made to devils; neither Can they help the needy, nor grant the petitions of their votaries.” His behaviour so enraged the governor, that he ordered him immediately to be beheaded. In his way to execution he was stopped by a river, over which was a bridge so thronged with spectators that it was impossible to cross it. The saint, as we are told, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and the stream was miraculously divided, and afforded a passage for himself and a thousand more persons. Bede does not indeed give us the name of this river ;. but, notwithstanding this omission, the miracle, we suppose, will not be the less believed. This wonderful event converted the executioner upon the spot, who threw away his drawn sword, and, falling at St Alban’s feet, desired he might have the honour to die with him. This sudden conversion of the headsman occasioning a delay in the execution till another person could be got to perform the office, St Alban walked up to a neighbouring hill, where he prayed for water to quench his thirst, and a fountain of water sprung up under his feet: here he was beheaded on the 23d ,of June. The executioner is said to have been a signal example of divine vengeance; for as soon as he gave the fatal stroke, his eyes dropped out of his head. We may see the opinion of Milton in regard to this narrative, in his History of England. His words are these, speaking of St Alban: “The story of whose martyrdom, soiled and worse martyred with the fabling zeal of some idle fancies more fond of miracles than apprehensive of the truth, deserves no longer digression.” Between 400 and 500 years after St Alban’s death, Offa, king of the Mercians, built a large and stately monastery to his memory; and the town of St Albans, in Hertfordshire, takes its name from our protomartyr.
