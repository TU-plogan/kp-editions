AMBO, or Ambon, a kind of pulpit or desk, in the ancient churches, where the priests and deacons stood to read or sing part of the service, and preach to the people; called also Analogium. The term is derived from αvα-Ca/v¢zy, to mount. The ambo was mounted upon two sides; whence some also derive the appellation from the Latin ambo, both. The ambo was ascended by steps; which occasioned that part of the office performed there to be called the Gradual. Besides the gospel, which was read at the top of the ambo, and the epistle, which was read a step lower, they likewise published from this place the acts of the martyrs, the commemoration of departed saints, and the letters of peace and communion sent by one church to another. Here, too, converts made a public
profession
of their faith, and bishops their defence, when accused: treaties also were sometimes concluded, and the coronations of emperors and kings performed, in the same place. The modern reading-desks and pulpits have been generally substituted for the ancient ambos; though in some churches remains of the ambos are still seen. In that of St John de Lateran at Rome, there are two movable ambos.
