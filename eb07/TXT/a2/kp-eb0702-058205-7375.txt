AMAK, a small island in the Baltic Sea, near Copenhagen, from which it is separated by a canal over which there is a drawbridge. Amak is about four miles long and two broad, and is chiefly peopled by the descendants of a colony from East Friesland, to whom the island was consigned by Christian II. at the request of his wife Elizabeth, sister of Charles V., for the purpose of supplying her with vegetables, cheese, and butter. From the intermarriages of these colonists with the Danes, the present inhabitants are chiefly descended; but as they wear their own dress, and enjoy peculiar privileges, they appear a distinct race from the natives. The island contains about 4000 inhabitants. It has two churches, in which the ministers preach occasionally in Dutch and Danish. The inhabitants have their own inferior tribunals, but in capital offences are amenable to the kingâ€™s court of justice at Copenhagen. The old national habit, brought by the original colony when they first migrated to the island, is still in use amongst them. It resembles the habit of the ancient Quakers, as represented in the pictures of tire Dutch and Flemish painters. The men wear broad-brimmed hats, black jackets, full glazed breeches of the same colour, loose at the knee, and tied round the waist. The women are dressed chiefly in black jackets and petticots, with a piece of blue glazed cloth bound on their heads. The island is laid out in gardens and pastures, and still, according to the original design, supplies Copenhagen with milk, butter, and vegetables. Long. 12. 35. E. Lat. 55. 30. N.
