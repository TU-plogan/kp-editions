AEGIMURUS, in Ancient Geography, an island in the bay of Carthage, about 30 miles distant from that city, (Livy); now the Goletta. This island being afterwards sunk in the sea, two of its rocks remained above water, which were called Arae, because the Romans and Carthaginians entered into an agreement or league to limit their respective boundaries by these rocks.
