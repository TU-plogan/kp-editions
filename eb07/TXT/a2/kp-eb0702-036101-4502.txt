AHASUERUS, or Artaxerxes, the husband of Esther, and, according to Archbishop Usher and F. Calmet, the Scripture name for Darius, the son of Hystaspes, king of Persia; though Scaliger supposed Xerxes to have been the husband of Esther, or the Ahasuerus of Scripture: and Dr Prideaux believes him to be Artaxerxes Longimanus. See History of Persia.
