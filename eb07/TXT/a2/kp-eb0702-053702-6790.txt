ALMUCANTARS, in Astronomy, an Arabic word, denoting circles of the sphere passing through the centre of the sun or à star, parallel to the horizon, being the same as Parallels of Altitude. Almucantar’s Staff is an instrument usually made of pear-tree or box, having an arch of 15 degrees; used to take observations of the sun, about the time of its rising and setting, in order to find the amplitude, and consequently the variation of the compass.
