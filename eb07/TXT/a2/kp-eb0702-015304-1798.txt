ADLEGATION, a term formerly used in the public law of the German empire, to denote the right claimed by the states of the empire of adjoining plenipotentiaries, in public treaties and negotiations, to those of the emperor, for the transacting of matters which relate to the empire in general; in which sense adlegation differs from legation, which is the right of sending ambassadors on a personâ€™s own account.
