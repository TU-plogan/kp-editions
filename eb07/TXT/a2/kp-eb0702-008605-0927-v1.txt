ACCIAIOLI, Donato, a native of Florence, was bom in 1428, and was famous for his learning and the honourable employments which he held. He wrote, a Latin translation of some of Plutarch’s Lives; Commentaries on Aristotle’s Ethics and Politics; and the Lives of Hannibal, of Scipio, and of Charlemagne. He was sent to France by the Florentines, to solicit aid from Louis XI. against Pope Sixtus IV., but on his journey died at Milan in 1478: his body was carried to Florence, and buried in the church of the Carthusians at the public expense. The small fortune he left his children is a proof of his probity and disinterestedness. His daughters, like those of Aristides, were portioned by his fellow-citizens, as an acknowledgement of his services. His funeral eulogium was spoken by Christopher Landíni; and an elegant epitaph, by Politian, was inscribed on his tomb.
