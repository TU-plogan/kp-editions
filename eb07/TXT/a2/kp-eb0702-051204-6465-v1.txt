ALHAMA, a city of Spain, in the province of Granada, in Andalusia. It is on an elevated plain, enjoys a most salubrious climate, and is surrounded by fields most abundantly productive of wheat and barley. Near it are some medicinal baths of great and ancient celebrity, to which invalids still resort. It was a most important fortress when the Moors ruled Granada, and its capture by the Christians was the most decisive step in the reduction of their power. It contains 4500 inhabitants, and is situated in lat. 36. 42. N. long. 2. 46. W.
