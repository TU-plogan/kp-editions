AFFIX, in Grammar, a particle added at the close of a word, either to diversify its form or alter its signification. We meet with affixes in the Saxon, the German, and other northern languages, but more especially in the Hebrew, and other oriental tongues. The Hebrew affixes are single syllables, frequently single letters, subjoined to nouns and verbs, and contribute not a little to the brevity of that language. The oriental languages are much the same as to the radicals, and differ chiefly from each other as to affixes and prefixes.
