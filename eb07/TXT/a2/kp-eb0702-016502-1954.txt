ADRIANISTS, in Ecclesiastical History, a sect of heretics, divided into two branches. The first were disciples of Simon Magus, and flourished about the year 34. Theodore! is the only person who has preserved their name and memory, but he gives us no account of their origin. Probably this sect, and the six others which sprung from the Simonians, took their name from the particular disciples of Simon. The second were the followers of Adrian Hamstead the anabaptist, and held some particular errors concerning Christ.
