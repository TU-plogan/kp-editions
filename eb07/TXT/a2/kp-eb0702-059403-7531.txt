AMBIANI, or Ambianensis Civitas, now Amiens, a city of Picardy. It is called Samarobriva by Caesar and Cicero; which, according to Valesius, signifies the brid<>âˆ™e of the Samara or Somme. Ambiani is a later name, taken from that of the people, after the usual manner of the lower age. This people, according to Caesar, furnished 5000 men for the siege of Alesia.
