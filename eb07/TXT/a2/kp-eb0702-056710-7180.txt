ALTENBURG, a duchy forming a material portion of the dominions of the duke of Saxe-Gotha, and which gives him a part of his title. Some parcels of this duchy are surrounded by the dominions of other sovereigns, and some of their territories are encircled by this part of the dominions of Saxe-Gotha. The extent is 544 square miles, or 358,160 acres. It is a well-cultivated and productive district, and more than maintains its own dense population from the fruits of its own soil. It contains nine cities, three market-towns, 566 villages and hamlets, and 105,200 inhabitants. It is divided into three bailiwicks or jurisdictions, in which are included 158 partrimonial circles of justiceship, where the hereditary judges administer the law to their peasantry according to the more ancient feudal system; a system in more primitive force in this district than in any other of the north of Germany.

The city contains 1279 houses, and 10,160 inhabitants, who are industrious[7:2:568] and frugal, and who make some silk and more woollen goods, tapes, pottery, tobacco, brushes, starch, carriages, and musical instruments. There are several institutions for education, for the poor, and for the sick. Long. 12. 18. 17. E. Lat. 51. 0. 11. N.
