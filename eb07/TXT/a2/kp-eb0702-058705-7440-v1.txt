AMAZIAH, the eighth king of Judah, succeeded his father Joash in the 25th year of his age. At the commencement of his reign hc showed some reverence for the divine authority, but, in the language of Scripture, “not with a perfect heart.” He speedily inflicted capital punishment on the murderers of his father; but from respect to the law of Moses he spared their families, an extension of clemency not very common in those times. He gave early proof of his military spirit, by collecting a numerous army to attack the Edomites. This force was composed not only of all his own subjects capable of bearing arms, but of a powerful body of auxiliaries hired from the children of Israel. By the advice of a prophet, however, the Israelites, amounting to 100,000 men, were dismissed, and lie prosecuted his enterprise with the remainder of his army. Having engaged the Edomites in the valley of Salt, he defeated them with a loss of 10,000 men, and following up his victory, he made himself master of Selah, their metropolis. He also possessed himself of the enemy’s idols, and impiously made them the objects of his adoration. Meanwhile the Israelites, whom he had discharged, either offended by their dismissal, or disappointed of their hope of plunder, turned their arms against the kingdom of Judah, and plundered many of the cities. Amaziah, elated by his success, sent a hostile challenge to Joash, king of Israel, to which Joash contemptuously replied in a fable. (2 Kings, xiv. 9.) Indignant at the insult, Amaziah immediately took the field, and encountering the Israelites at Bethshemesh, was defeated and taken prisoner. After his victory, Joash proceeded to Jerusalem, carrying along with him his vanquished enemy; and having broken down part of the wall of the city, and plundered the temple and palace, he returned with the spoils to Samaria. This misfortune seems to have damped the military ardour of Amaziah; for although he reigned 15 years after his defeat, we are not informed of his engaging in any hostility with his neighbours. He fell by the hands of conspirators, in the 29th yéar of his reign. (2 Kings, xiv.; 2 Chron. xxv.)
