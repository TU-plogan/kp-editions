ACCOUNTANT, or Accomptant, in the most general sense, is a person skilled in accounts. In a more restricted sense, it is applied to a person or officer appointed to keep the accounts of a public company or office; as the South Sea, the India Company, the Bank, the Excise, &c.

ACCOUNTANT-general, a new officer in the court of chancery, appointed by act of parliament to receive all moneys lodged in court, instead of the masters, and convey the same to the bank of England for security.
