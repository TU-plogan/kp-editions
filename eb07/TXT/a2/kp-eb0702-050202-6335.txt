ALGEZIRAS, a city of Spain, in the province of Seville, in Andalusia. It is a fortified place, on the western side of the bay of Gibraltar, and opposite to that fortress. It is situated at the foot of a prodigious mountain called the Trocha, over which there is only one road of communication, which is excessively bad. It has become a place of consideration as the rendezvous of a large force, which it has been deemed politic to maintain there to watch the movement of the English garrison on the opposite shore. The population amounts to about 4000. Long. 4. 55. 4. W. Lat. 36. 8. N.
