ADY, in Natural History, a name given to the palm-tree of the island of St Thomas. It is a tall tree, with a thick, bare, upright stem, growing single on its root, of a thin light timber, and full of juice. The head of this tree shoots into a vast number of branches, which being cut off, or an incision being made therein, afford a great quantity of sweet juice, which, fermenting, supplies the place of wine among the Indians. The fruit of this tree is called by the Portuguese caryoces and cariosse, and by the black natives abanga. This fruit is of the size and shape of a lemon, and contains a kernel, which is good to eat. The fruit itself is eaten roasted, and the raw kernels are often mixed with mandioc meal. These kernels are supposed very cordial. An oil is also prepared from this fruit, which answers the purpose of oil or butter. This oil is also used for anointing stiff and contracted parts of the body.
