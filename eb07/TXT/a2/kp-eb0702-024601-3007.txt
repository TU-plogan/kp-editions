AGISTMENT, Agistage, or Agistation, in Law, the taking· in of other people’s cattle to graze at so much per week. The term is peculiarly used for the taking of cattle to feed in the king’s forests, as well as for die profits arising from that practice. It is also used, in a metaphorical sense, for any tax, burden, or charge; thus, the tax levied for repairing the banks of Romney Marsh was called agistamentum.
