ALEUTIAN, Aleutic, or Aleutsky Islands, so called from the Russian word aleut, signifying a bold rock, is the name given by the Russian discoverers to a chain of small islands situated in the Northern Pacific Ocean, and extending in an easterly direction from the peninsula of Kamtschatka, in Asiatic Russia, to the promontory of Alaska, in North America. According to the practice of the most recent Russian geographers, we have comprehended the whole of this archipelago under one general name, although it has been sometimes divided into three several groups; those nearest to the eastern coast of Kamtschatcha being properly called Aleutian, the central group the Andreanofskie or Andrenovian, and those nearest to the American promontory the Fox Islands. The Russian geographers usually separate Behring’s and Copper Island, which are at the western extremity of this chain, from the other parts of it, included by them under the general name of Aleutian Islands;^[1. Mr Pinkerton appears to be mistaken when he says, that “the nearest Aleutian Isles of the Russians are those which we term Behring’s and Copper.” {Geog. 3d edit. vol. ii. p. 423.) We do not find that the term Aleutian has ever been applied to the two islands, above mentioned. That name was first given by the early Russian discoverers to the small group of islands situated to the southeast of Behring’s Island; and the islands composing this group were sometimes called the nearest Aleutian Isles, to distinguish them from the more easterly and remote parts of the chain. (See Coxe’s Russian Discoveries, chap, ii.)] but as there seems no good reason for this exception, it certainly would be better to comprehend the whole under one general denomination.

The first voyage of discovery in this remote and dangerous archipelago was projected by Peter the Great, whose enterprising mind appears to have been strongly [7:2:402] excited by the question, then much agitated, relative to the distance between the Asiatic and American continents; the solution of which seemed to be facilitated by the recent conquest of Kamtschatka. A short time previous to the death of that monarch, which took place in 1725, he drew up instructions, with his own hand, for the conduct of an expedition, which was to be intrusted to the command of an officer named Behring, who had already made several voyages in the sea of Kamtschatka by order of the crown. In 1728 Behring set sail from the mouth of the Kamtschatka River, and coasted the eastern shores of Siberia, as far to the northward as lat. 67. 18., but made no discovery of the opposite continent. In 1729 he again set sail, for the purpose of prosecuting the same enterprise, but with no better success. A third voyage was undertaken by order of the empress Anna in 1741, and Behring was again selected as chief of the expedition, another vessel being intrusted to the command of Tschirikoff. This enterprise proved more fortunate, and led the way to all the subsequent important discoveries of the Russians in those seas; although the immediate results of the voyage, upon the whole, were not deemed commensurate with the time and expense employed in fitting out the expedition. The principal object of the undertaking, however, appears to have been accomplished. Tschirikoff discovered the coast of America in the 56th degree of latitude; and Behring, who was separated from his companion in a storm, saw it in lat. 58. 28. On his voyage back to Kamtschatka, Behring’s ship was driven on the island which now bears his name, where he soon afterwards died.

The two uninhabited islands, Behring’s and Copper Island, now became known to the natives of Kamtschatka, who frequently resorted thither for the purpose of hunting sea-otters, and other animals affording valuable furs, with which they carried on a lucrative traffic. Some of the vessels which sailed upon these expeditions were driven by stormy weather to the south-east, by which means the group of Aleutian Islands came to be discovered. These islands seem to have been first visited in the year 1745, and continued to be resorted to for some time by private individuals, without attracting the attention of the Russian government. In the above-mentioned year a vessel called the Eudokia was fitted out at the expense of some private adventurers, and the command given to Michael Nevodtsikof, a native of Tobolsk. Having discovered three unknown islands, they ventured upon one of them, in order to kill sea-otters, of which they found a large quantity. These islands were undoubtedly the nearest Aleutian Islands, and were found well inhabited. The Russians continued upon this island until the 14th September 1746, when, having incurred the enmity of the natives by their arbitrary and hostile proceedings, they put to sea with the view of looking out for some uninhabited islands. Being overtaken, however, by a violent storm, they were driven about until the 30th October, when their vessel was wrecked upon the rocky shore of the island of Karaga, the inhabitants of which were of the Koriac tribe, and tributary to the Russian empire.

From this period the zeal or avarice of individual adventurers prompted them to undertake repeatedvoyages to the new-discovered islands, in some of which they penetrated as far eastward as the Fox Islands, where they collected a quantity of valuable skins; but, in consequence of their own rapacity and misconduct, they were frequently embroiled in fatal quarrels with the natives. One of the most remarkable of these voyages was that of the St An- ( drean and Natalia, fitted out by the merchant Andrean Tolstyk, which sailed from the mouth of the Kamtschátka River on the 27th September 1760, and on the 29th reached Behring’s Island. Having been driven on shore by a violent autumnal storm, they were here obliged to pass the winter; and after refitting, they put to sea again on the 24th June 1761. They passed by Copper Island, which lies about 150 versts from the former, and steered south-east towards the Aleutian Isles, which they did not reach before the 6th August. From thence they proceeded on the 19th in quest of some more distant islands, for the purpose of exacting tribute, steering their course north-east and north-east by east, and were driven by a gale of wind towards an island, where, on the 30th August, they anchored in a safe bay. This island they called Ayagh or Kayaka, and another, which lay at the distance of about 20 versts, Kanaga. The Russians persuaded the inhabitants of these islands to become tributary to the empress, to which they made no great objection. Four other islands were discovered in the neighbourhood, and the crew remained here in great tranquillity until the year 1764, but met with no great success in their hunting excursions. This group of islands, which lies somewhat to the north-west of the Fox Islands, was denominated, in honour of the vessel which made the discovery, the Andreanofskie or Andrenovian Isles.

From the year 1758 to 1760 several vessels visited the Fox Islands, and obtained considerable cargoes of seaotter and fox skins. But the crews appear to have behaved with the most shameful inhumanity towards the natives; and little information was derived from these voyages, except a few particulars which transpired during the course of a judicial investigation into their conduct. In 1762 four vessels sailed for the Fox Islands, of which only one returned safe to Kamtschatka. The first was the Zacharias and Elizabeth, fitted out by Kulkof and Company of Vologda, under the command of Drusinin, with a crew of thirty-four Russians and three Kamtschadals. This vessel touched at the Aleutian Islands, and in the beginning of September 1763 arrived at Umnak, one of the most considerable of the Fox Islands. On the 22d September they proceeded to Unalashka, where the vessel was brought into a safe harbour. Here the crew formed themselves into hunting parties, but were soon afterwards attacked separately by the natives, and cut off, with the exception of four individuals, who, after defending themselves with astonishing courage and intrepidity, and suffering incredible hardships, succeeded in making their escape from the island in a baidar, their own vessel having been destroyed by the savages. One of these four died during the home voyage; but the other three returned safe to Kamtschatka, and gave an account of their adventures.

The second vessel which sailed from Kamtschatka in 1762 was the Trinity, fitted out by the trading company of Nikiphor Trapesnikof, a merchant of Irkutsk, under the command of Ivan Korovin, and manned with thirty-eight Russians and six Kamtschadals. In the month of October they cast anchor before the south side of Behring’s Island, where they resolved to winter, on account of the late season of the year. On the first of August 1763 Korovin sailed from Behring’s Island, in company with Dennis Medvedef, who commanded a vessel^[2. This was the fourth vessel which sailed in 1762; but, as the whole crew were massacred by the natives, we have no distinct account of the voyage.] fitted out by Jacob [7:2:403] Protassof, merchant of Tiumen. On the 15th the former vessel made Unalashka, and Medvedef reached Umnak. After having reconnoitred the coast, and received hostages from the Toigons or Chiefs, Korovin sent out several hunting parties; but the natives soon began to exhibit hostile intentions, and three Kamtschadals belonging to Kulkofs ship arrived with accounts of the destruction of that vessel, and the massacre of the crew. On the 10th December the savages assembled in large bodies, and invested the hut which the Russians had constructed, and continually annoyed them with their darts. Korovin finding himself thus harassed by the natives, ordered the hut to be destroyed, and retired to his vessel, which was removed to the distance of a hundred yards from the beach, where they lay at anchor from the 5th March to the 26th April 1764. Here the natives attempted to surprise the vessel; but Korovin, having been warned of their approach, compelled them to retreat. On the 26th April Korovin sailed from Unalashka, and, after being driven about by contrary winds, the vessel was at length stranded on the 28th, m a bay of the island of Umnak. Having got on shore, the crew attempted to secure themselves between their baidar and some empty barrels, with the sails spread over them in the form of a tent. Next morning before the break of day they were surprised by a large body of the natives, who attacked them with their darts, and wounded every one of the crew. Korovin, however, sallied out, in company with four Russians, and put the savages to flight, although he and his party were so severely wounded, that they had scarcely sufficient strength to return to the tent. During the night the vessel was dashed to pieces by the storm. On the 30th of April they were again attacked by the natives, who, however, were soon put to flight by the fire of the Russians. On the 21st of July, Korovin, with the remainder of his crew, which was now reduced to the number of twelve persons, including six Kamtschadals, put to sea in a baidar ; and, having landed upon another part of the same island, they discovered the remains of a vessel which had been burnt, and at a small distance, a deserted Russian dwelling, containing twenty dead bodies in their clothes; among which they recognised several of those individuals who had sailed in Protassofs vessel, and distinguished, among the rest, the commander Medvedef. Korovin afterwards joined Glottofs vessel (of whose proceedings we shall immediately give some account), which he quitted in the month of April 1765, and went over, with five other Russians, to Soloviof, with whom hc returned the following year to Kamtschatka.

The third voyage from Kamtschatka in 1762, and the most fortunate and most remarkable of the whole, was that of the Andrean and Natalia, which was fitted out by Tercnty Tsebaeffskoi and Company, under the command of Stephen Glottof, an experienced and skilful seaman of Yarensk. This vessel sailed on the 1st October, with a crew of thirty-eight Russians and eight Kamtschadals. Having wintered at Copper Island, they set sail from thence on the 26th July 1763, and steered for the Fox Islands. In consequence of storms and contrary winds, they were thirty days on the voyage to Umnak, where they arrived on the 24th August, and without dropping anchor, sailed farther in quest of new islands, of which they passed eight contiguous to each other, and separated by straits from 20 to 100 versts broad. Glottof, however, did not land until he reached the most eastward of these islands, called by the inhabitants Kadyak. Here and in the neighbouring islands they passed the winter, and collected a considerable quantity of furs; but as the conduct of the natives, at first decidedly hostile, was al ways suspicious, Glottof did not think it prudent to prolong his stay; and accordingly, having taken on board all the peltry and stores, he left Kadyak on the 24th May 1764, and sailed for Umnak, where he arrived on the 3d July. He remained here two years, sending out hunting parties through the islands of Umnak and Unalashka, and commenced his voyage homewards in the month of July 1766, In the month of August he arrived safe in Kamtschatka River with a rich cargo.

Soloviof, to whose voyage we have already alluded, sailed from Kamtschatka on the 25th of August 1764, in a ship called the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, fitted out by Jacob Ulednikof and Company, merchants of Irkutsk. This vessel reached Unalashka on the 17th September, where Soloviof passed two winters; and having succeeded, notwithstanding the continual hostility of the natives, in collecting a considerable cargo of peltry, he returned to Kamtschatka in the month of July 1766.

Having thus traced an outline of the gradual progress of early discovery in this archipelago, it seems unnecessary to proceed with an enumeration of the subsequent voyages performed by private individuals. These were undertaken merely for commercial purposes: the accounts brought home by the adventurers were generally imperfect and incorrect, and rather tended to excite than to gratify the curiosity of those who might be desirous of obtaining more accurate and more ample information. We shall therefore now turn to the conduct of those expeditions which were fitted out by the state for the express purpose of discovery.

In the year 1768 Captain Krenitzin and Lieutenant Levashef sailed from the mouth of the Kamtschatka River by order of the empress Catharine, to examine the chain of Aleutian Islands. This commission theyaccordinglyexe-cuted very carefully, having surveyed the whole of this archipelago, from Behring’s Island to the promontory of Alaska; and, after spending thewinter among the FoxIslands, they returned to Kamtschatka in the autumn of 1769.

But our great navigator Captain Cook communicated more accurate scientific information respecting these islands, as well as the coasts of the two continents, than all the previous voyages of the Russian discoverers had afforded. During his third and last voyage, in the year 1778, he surveyed the eastern portion of this archipelago, accurately determined the positions of some of the most, remarkable islands, and corrected many errors of former navigators.

In the year 1785 a fresh expedition was set on foot by the Russian government, the command of which was intrusted to Captain Billings, an English naval officer in the Russian service, who had accompanied Captain Cook in his last celebrated voyage to the Pacific Ocean. This expedition appears to have been suggested by Mr Coxe, who was at that time at St Petersburg, and whose Account of the Russian Discoveries between Asia and America had already attracted the attention of the Russian government. During this voyage, which was not completed until the year 1796, Captains Billings and Sarytschef explored the whole chain of the Aleutian Islands, particularly that part of it which had been visited by Captain Cook, and some parts of the adjacent western coast of America. Ample details of the conduct of this expedition have been published in the narratives of Martin Sauer, who officiated as secretary to Captain Billings, and of Admiral Sarytschef.

Some years after the termination of the expedition under Captain Billings, the attention of the Russian American Company was turned towards the best means of supplying their settlements on the north-west coast of Arne-rica[7:2:404] with provisions and stores of all kinds; and it was resolved to try whether the conveyance by sea would not answer the purpose better than the long and tedious journey by land to Ochotsk. With the view of ascertaining the practicability of the project, Captain Krusenstern, an experienced Russian naval officer, who had served for a long period in the British navy, suggested the plan of an expedition from Cronstadt, round Cape Horn, to the Aleutian Islands and the north-west coast of America. This plan was approved of by Count Romanzof, the minister of commerce, and Admiral Mordwinof, minister of the marine, and obtained the sanction of his Imperial Majesty. Two vessels, called by the Russians the Na-deslιda and the Neva, were accordingly purchased in London for the voyage. The command of the expedition was intrusted to Captain Krusenstern, the original author of tlιe plan, and Captain Lisiansky was appointed to the Neva. These two vessels accordingly sailed in company from Cronstadt, in the month of August 1803, and, after a short stay at Falmouth, proceeded to the Brazils, from whence they sailed round Cape Horn to the Sandwich Islands. Here they separated, the Nadeshda being ordered on a distinct mission to Japan and China, while Captain Lisiansky, in the Neva, proceeded to Kadyak and tlιe American settlements. Of this voyage very full and interesting accounts have been lately published by Captains Krusenstern and Lisiansky, and by Dr Langsdorff, who accompanied the expedition in the quality of physician.

From the ample sources of information to which we have alluded in the foregoing narrative, we shall now proceed to exhibit an enumeration and general description of the islands composing this singular chain, which appears tobe a prolongation of either continent. We shall begin with the more westerly part of the chain, consisting of those islands which lie nearest to Kamtschatka, and proceed eastwards to the American promontory. The first is Commodore or Behring’s Island, situate, according to Cook’s reckoning, in 55° of latitude and 6° of longitude from the harbour of Petropaulowska in the bay of Awat-ska. It is from 70 to 80 versts long, and stretches from north-west to south-east. Ten leagues from the south-east point of this island, in the direction of east by south, or east-south-east, lies Mednoi Ostroff, or Copper Island, so called from large masses of native copper being found upon the beach. To the south-east of Copper Island lie three small islands, Attak or Attoo, Semitshi, and Agattoo, called by the Russians Plishme Ostrova, or the nearest Aleutian Islands. Of these Attak is the largest; it is nearly of the same shape as Behring’s Island, but rather more extensive, stretching from west to east to the length of 18 leagues. These islands are situated between 54° and 55° of north latitude. Attak has two harbours, one of which lies on the southern coast. From the eastern extremity of the Aleutian Islands properly so called, another group runs south-eastward, continuing the chain as far as the western extremity of the Fox Islands. These are called the Andreanofskie Islands; but we have less accurate information respecting this central part of the chain than regarding the eastern and western groups. They are said to lie within the 52d and 54th degrees of north latitude, to be of inconsiderable extent or importance, and therefore seldom visited by recent navigators. The most remarkable are, Takavangha, which has in its centre, near the northern coast, a burning mountain; Kanaghi or Kanaga, likewise with a high smoking mountain; Ayag, which has a number of good bays and anchoring-places; and Tshetchina, on which a high white mountain overtops the rest, which apparently is an extinct volcano, as there are still hot springs on this island. At-shak or Atchka, and Amlac, are also usually reckoned among the number of the Andrenovian Isles. The former greatly resembles Copper Island, and is provided with a commodious harbour.

By far the most important and best explored portion of this archipelago is the most easterly group, called by die Russians Lyssie Ostrova, or the Fox Islands. Of these islands the most considerable are, Umnak, Unalashka or Oonalashka, and Unimak, the last of which is separated by a narrow strait from the promontory of Alaska. Beyond these, to the north-east, lies the large island of Kadyak or Kodiak, which is generally included among the group called Schumagin’s Islands.

The whole of the islands composing this chain are bare and mountainous; their coasts are rocky and surrounded by breakers, which renders the navigation of those seas exceedingly dangerous. The land rises immediately from the coasts to steep bald mountains, gradually ascending higher behind each other, and assuming the appearance of chains of mountains, with a direction lengthwise of the island. Springs take their rise at the bottom of the mountains, and either flow in broad and rapid streams into the neighbouring sea, or, collecting in the rocky vales and glens, form ample lakes, which send off their superfluous waters by natural canals into the adjacent bays. These islands bear evident marks of volcanic formation, and several of them have still active volcanoes, which continually emit smoke, and sometimes flames. No traces of metals have been discovered on these islands, but cameoles and sardonyxes are brought from thence. Their soil is said to be similar to that of Kamtschatka, and affords the same kinds of edible wild berries and roots, excepting some few vegetables which seem to be of foreign origin. No wood of any considerable growth has been perceived upon any of these islands, except a very small quantity on Unalash-ka. The land animals are bears, wolves, river-otters, river-beavers, and ermines. The sea-otter, so valuable on account of its skin, is frequently caught; but the number of these animals, it is believed, is much diminished of late. On the Fox Islands they have a great variety of foxes, black, grey, red, and brown. The sea abounds with all sorts of seals, dolphins, and whales; sea-lions and porpoises are rare, and sea-cows not at all to be seen. Salmon are caught in great abundance and variety, and halibut of an immense size are frequently taken. The winter upon these islands is tolerably mild, but the summer is equally short and unpleasant. The inhabitants are pretty numerous, and tributary to Russia, from whence vessels are sent out, and establishments formed upon these islands, on account of the very profitable chace of sea-otters and foxes.

Unalashka, one of the largest of the Fox Islands, was visited by Captain Cook during his last voyage, and seems to merit particular notice. This island stretches from north-east to south-west, and is from 70 to 80 versts in length, but of very unequal breadth. On the north and north-east sides there are many bays and creeks, in some of which are very secure harbours for vessels. A part of the south-west shore consists of very high, steep, inaccessible cliffs, and another part has remained hitherto wholly unexplored. The whole island consists of a mass of rocks, covered only with a very thin coat of earth; tlιe hills are of very unequal height, and are intersected by irregular valleys, the soil of which is commonly argillaceous, or an earth which appears washed down from the hills. In the lower valleys there is great abundance of grass, which would furnish very good food for cattle; [7:2:405] indeed, Captain Cook was of opinion that cattle might subsist at Unalashka all the year round, without being housed; and the soil, in many places, appeared capable of producing grain, roots, and vegetables. But the Russian traders and the natives seem satisfied with what nature brings forth. No wood grows on this and the neighbouring islands; only low bushes, and shrubs of dwarf birch, willow, and alder. For all the timber used for the purposes of building, &c. they are indebted to the sea, which wafts it to their shores from the adjacent continent of America. The inhabitants are rather low in stature, but plump and well-shaped, with short necks, swarthy chubby faces, black eyes, small beards, and long, straight, black hair, which the men wear loose behind and cut before,'but the women tie up in a bunch. With regard to their character, Captain Cook describes them as, to all appearance, the most inoffensive people he ever met with, and perfect patterns of honesty. But according to the accounts of the first discoverers, this does not seem to have been their original disposition; and recent travellers have observed, that although generally kind-hearted and peaceable, yet, when roused to anger, they become exceedingly malevolent, and indifferent to all danger, even to death itself. The clothing of the men and women is nearly the same, and consists of a sort of frock or shirt, called parka, fastened round the neck with a broad stiff collar, and descending below the knee. These garments are made of the skins of seals, prepared in a manner peculiar to themselves, and sewed together very ingeniously. Though simple in their form, they are ornamented in a variety of ways,—with glass beads, beaks of sea-parrots, long white goats’ hair brought from Siberia, or small red feathers. Over the frock the men sometimes wear a kαndeika or rain-garment. This is made of gut, which is water-proof, and has a hood to it, which draws over the head, and is tied under the chin. When on shore, the men wear boots made of seal-skin; and they all have a kind of oval-snouted cap, made of wood, with a rim to admit the head. These caps are dyed with green and other colours, and are very fancifully ornamented with ivory figures, carved from the teeth of the sea-cow, with glass or amber beads, and with the bristles from the beard of the sea-lion. They make use of no paint: tatooing was formerly very much in use among them, particularly among the women; but their intercourse with the Russians has rather brought this practice into disrepute. Both men and women, particularly the latter, bore the under lip, and insert pieces of bone or other ornaments; but this practice has also decreased of late. The women, for the most part, go barefooted: they wear bracelets of glass beads just above the wrists and ankle-joints, and are very fond of rings upon their fingers. The principal food of these islanders consists of fish, sea-animals, birds, roots, and berries. They dry large quantities of fish in summer, which they lay up in small huts for winter use; and roots and berries are also preserved for the same time of scarcity. Among the fish, the most common and most abundant are several sorts of salmon, cod, herrings, and halibut. Tlιe last is the most esteemed, and is sometimes caught of an enormous size. The fat of the whale is also a favourite species of food; when it grows old and rancid, it serves to light and warm their houses. They eat almost every thing raw; but of late they have learnt some simple modes of cookery from the Russians. Vegetable food does not appear to be held in much esteem by the Unalashkans. The sweet plant, the Siberian parsnip {Heracleum Sibericum), is but little eaten, any more than the bulb of the Sαrαnnα, or Kamtschadale lily. Berries of an eatable quality abound, such as bramble-berries, cran-berries, hurtle-berries, heath∙,berries, and several others. Of late the Russians have begun to plant potatoes, which succeed extremely well, and are much liked by the people. The habitations of the Unalashkans are holes dug in the earth, covered with a wooden roof, over which they throw grass and earth; so that a village has the appearance of a European church-yard full of graves. The entrance into these huts is from the roof; some of the largest, however, which are inhabited by the Russians, have a low door in the side. The light is also admitted by the roof, through an opening or window covered over with seals’ entrails, or dried fish-skin. Several divisions are made within, by means of seal-skins or straw-mats, which separate the apartments of the different families that occupy the habitation. Their household furniture consists of bowls, spoons, buckets, piggins or cans, matted baskets, and perhaps a Russian kettle or pot. The knife, and the hatchet, or rather a small flat piece of iron, made like an adze by fitting it into a crooked wooden handle, are the only iron tools found amongst them. Yet all their instruments and utensils are made with the greatest neatness and the most exact symmetry. The needles with which they sew their clothes and embroider are made of the wing-bone of the gull, with a very nice cut round the thicker end instead of an eye, to which they tie the thread so skilfully, that it follows the needle without any obstruction. Their thread is made of the sinews of the seal, the fibres of which they split to the thickness which each sort of work requires. All sewing is performed by the women: they are the tailors, shoemakers, and boat-builders or boat-coverers. At their leisure hours, particularly in long winter evenings, they make fine mats, little baskets, and pocket-books of straw, that are both beautiful and strong. Indeed, Captain Cook observes, there is a neatness and perfection in most of their work, that shows they neither want ingenuity nor perseverance. Their houses have no fire-place, but are heated as well as lighted by lamps. These are made of a flat stone, hollowed on one side like a plate: in the hollow part they put the oil, mixed with a little dry grass, which serves the purpose of a wick. They produce fire both by collision and by attrition; the former by striking two stones one against another, one of them being previously rubbed with brimstone. The latter method is with two pieces of wood; one of which is a pointed stick, and the other a flat piece. The pointed end of the stick they press upon the other, whirling it nimbly round as a drill; thus producing fire in a few minutes.

The principal occupations of the Aleutians are fishing and hunting, and preparing tlιe implements necessary for both. Their baidars, baidarkas, or boats, resemble the canoes of other savages. They consist of a skeleton of wood, over which is stretched a leather covering made of seal-skins. The boats of the Unalashkans are much superior in point of beauty to those of any of the other islands: some of them appear so transparent that one might trace the formation of the inside, and the manner in which the rower sits. In their form they are long and narrow, and commonly hold only one person; sometimes they are made to hold two, and very rarely three; each person sitting in a round hole just fitted to the size of the body. The whole canoe is so extremely light, even when sodden with water, that it may be carried with ease in one hand. They are impelled by means of double paddles, seven or eight feet long, which are managed with great dexterity. Experienced navigators will sometimes venture out a considerable way to sea in these boats, even in very stormy weather. The darts, or javelins, with which they kill their game, are formed with the same neatness as their other instruments, and adapted with the greatest judgment [7:2:406] to the different objects of the chase. For land animals, a single barbed point; for birds, three points of light bone, spread and barbed; for seals, &c. they use a false point, inserted in a socket at the end of the dart, which parts on the least effort of the animal to dive, remaining in its body. A string of considerable length is fastened to this barbed point, and twisted round the wooden part of the javelin. This serves as a float to direct them to the seal, which having the stick to drag after it, soon tires, and becomes an easy prey. These darts are not shot from a bow, but slung from a small plank, about 18 inches long and two inches broad. In order that the weapon may be held the faster, they have a sort of handle at the lower end, and an opening through which the fore-finger is thrust. At the other end is a small channel, into which the javelin fits, with a little knob which serves to retain it. When the javelin is to be thrown, the plank is held horizontally, and the aim being taken, the weapon is directed by the middle finger and thumb. This is done with so much dexterity, and the motion given to it is so powerful and so rapid, that the object aimed at is rarely missed; even whales are killed without any other weapon.

Their favourite amusement appears to be dancing, in which, however, they do not seem to exhibit any particular exertion of strength or expression of elegance, the only motion being a sort of hop, the performer scarcely moving from the place he first takes up. Their music is exceedingly rude, consisting of a small drum or tambour, and a rattle made of the bladder of a sea-dog, filled with peas or small pebbles. In their leisure hours they amuse themselves with making these little drums and rattles, which are frequently ornamented with a good deal of ingenuity and elegance; and with cutting out from the teeth of the sea-cow small figures of men, fish, sea-otters, and other objects, in a manner that appears very extraordinary, considering that the sea-cow’s teeth are much harder than ivory, and that they have no proper tools to work with.

The religion of these islanders, like that of most uncivilized nations, consists in superstitious observances and a belief in charms. Many of them have been baptized, and are nominally professors of the Greek faith; of which, however, they understand nothing more than making the sign of the cross. They have no marriage ceremony: every man may have as many wives as he can conveniently maintain: if his means decrease, he sends first one, then another, back to their parents; and these women become perfectly at liberty to look out for other husbands. Sometimes the same woman lives with two husbands; and it is not uncommon for men to sell or exchange wives. Boys, if they happen to be very handsome, are often brought up entirely in the manner of girls, instructed in the arts of female blandishment, and used as concubines. This shocking, unnatural, and immoral practice has prevailed here even from the remotest times. Such men are known under the name of sclιopans. The bodies of the dead, especially of the men, were formerly interred in places set apart for the purpose, and with particular ceremonies. Their best javelins and clothes, with a portion of trainoil and other articles of food, were laid with them in the grave; and sometimes even slaves of both sexes were slaughtered upon the occasion. These customs are now, however, entirely laid aside.

The population of Unalashka and the neighbouring islands appears to have been considerable, amounting to several thousands. In 1790 Sarytcheff reckoned it at 1300. According to the most recent accounts, it does not appear to amount to more than 300. This rapid depopulation is ascribed partly to the practice of sending the best hunters from hence to a distance, to chace the large sea-otters, few of whom ever return to their families; and partly to the state of oppression under which the natives live, and the change which has taken place in their modes of living. Captain Cook seems to consider the natives of these islands as originally of the same extraction with the Greenlanders and Esquimaux. When first discovered by the Russians they were under the government of Tοigons, or chiefs, who, however, possessed little superior distinction or dignity, and had no revenue. At present they are all subject to the government of the Russian settlers.

Throughout the whole of the Aleutian Islands, on the island of Kadyak, and the western coast of America, the Russians have formed settlements, for the purpose of hunting and collecting furs, with which they carry on a lucrative commerce, particularly with the Chinese. The most valuable fur is that of the sea-otter; an animal which has now become rare on these islands, in consequence of the extreme eagerness with which they have been hunted and killed. Besides the sea-otter, there are numbers of foxes, especially on the Fox Islands. The black foxes found on these islands are not so valuable as those of Siberia. The Arctic, or ice fox, called also the rock fox, and the blue fox, from the natural colour of the fur, which is of a bluish grey, is very common. From the first discovery of these islands by Behring and Tscherikoff, in 1741, the fur-trade was carried on for a long period entirely by private adventurers, and appears to have been productive of great abuses. The natives were frequently treated in the most cruel and barbarous manner; and the keenness displayed by these rapacious hunters threatened to extirpate the race of animals upon which the trade depended. Convinced of the extreme necessity of putting a stop to this destructive plan of proceeding, Schelikoff, an intelligent Russian merchant, took considerable pains to unite the different partakers of this trade into a company, in order that it might be conducted with prudence and precaution, npon some plan that might prove advantageous to all parties. In 1785 he succeeded in joining company with the Golikoffs. They increased their capital, and fitted out several ships, which the enterprising Sche-likoff commanded in person. Factories, protected by forts, were established in almost all the Aleutian Islands, as far eastward as Kadyak; and during several years they continued this lucrative trade in conjunction, by which they acquired considerable wealth. The success of this connection induced several merchants to unite like Schelikoff and the Golikoffs; and in this manner was laid the foundation of the present Russian American Company. The irregular manner, however, in which the trade was still carried on, and the cruelty which was frequently exercised by the Russian merchants towards the natives of the islands, drew upon them great and well-founded censure; insomuch that the emperor Paul determined to put an end to the company and the trade at the same time. This determination would have infallibly been carried into effect, but for the interference of Μ. von Resa-noff, who had married Schelikoff ’ s daughter, and was personally interested in the successful continuance of the American Company. In consequence of his active interposition, the new-established company was formally confirmed in 1799, with considerable privileges.
