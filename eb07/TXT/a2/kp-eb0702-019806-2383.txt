AESYMNIUM, in Antiquity, a monument erected to the memory of the heroes by Aesymnus the Megarean. He, consulting the oracle in what manner the Megareans might be most happily governed, was answered, If they held consultation with the more numerous ; whom he taking for the dead, built the said monument, and a senate-house that took within its compass the monument, imagining that thus the dead would assist at their consultations. (Pausanias.)
