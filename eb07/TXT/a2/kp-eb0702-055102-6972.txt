ALPHERY, Mxkipher, an English divine, was born in Russia, and of the imperial line. When that country was distracted by intestine commotions in the latter end of the 16th century, this gentleman and his two brothers were sent over to England, and recommended to the care of Mr Joseph Bidell, a Russia merchant. Mr Bidell, when they were of age fit for the university, sent them to Oxford, where the small-pox unhappily prevailing, two of them died of it. We know not whether this surviving brother took any degrees or not, b,ut it is very probable he did, since he entered into holy orders, and in the year 1618 was presented to the rectory of .Wooley in Huntingdonshire, a living of no very considerable value, being rated under L.10 in the king’s books. Here he did his duty with great cheerfulness and alacrity; and although he was twice invited back to his native country by some who would have ventured their utmost to have set him on the throne of his ancestors, he chose rather to remain with his flock, and to serve God in the humble station of a parish priest. Yet in 1643 he underwent the severest trials from the rage of the fanatics, who, not satisfied with depriving him of his living, insulted him in the most barbarous manner. Having left Huntingdonshire, he came to Hammersmith, where he resided till

• the Restoration put him in possession of his living again. He returned on that occasion to Huntingdonshire, where he did not stay long; for being upwards of 80, and withal very infirm, he could not perform the duties of his function. Having, therefore, settled a curate, he retired to his eldest son’s house at Hammersmith, where soon after he died, much honoured and respected, and affording a remarkable instance of the vicissitudes of the world.
