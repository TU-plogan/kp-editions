ALAE, the plural number, is used to signify those petals or leaves of papilionaceous flowers placed between those others which are called the vexillum and carina, and which make the top and bottom of the flowers. Instances of flowers of this structure are seen in those of peas and beans, in which the top leaf or petal is the vexillum, the bottom the carina, and the side ones the alae.

Alae is also used for those extremely slender and membranaceous parts of some seeds which appear as wings placed on them. It likewise signifies those membranaceous expansions running along the stems of some plants, which are therefore called alated stalks. Alâ…›, in Anatomy, a term applied to the lobes of the liver, the cartilages of the nostrils, &c.

Alae, in the Roman Art of War, were the two wings or extreme parts of the army drawn up in order of battle.
