AMPHIARAUS, in Pagan Mythology, a celebrated prophet, who possessed part of the kingdom of Argos. He was believed to excel in divining by dreams, and is said to have been the first who divined by fire. Amphiaraus, knowing by the spirit of prophecy that he should lose his life in the war against Thebes, hid himself in order to avoid engaging in that expedition; but his wife Eriphyle, being prevailed upon by a present, discovered the place in which he had concealed himself, so that he was obliged to accompany the other princes who marched against Thebes. This proved fatal to him; for the earth being split asunder by a thunderbolt, both he and his chariot were swallowed up in the opening. Amphiaraus, after his death, was ranked among the gods; temples were dedicated to him; and his oracle, as well as the sports instituted to his honour, was very famous.
