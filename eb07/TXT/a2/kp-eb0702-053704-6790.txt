ALMUGGIM, Almiggim, or Almug Tree, a certain kind of wood mentioned in the first book of Kings (x. 11), which the Vulgate translates ligna thyina, and the Septuagint wrought wood. The Rabbins generally render it coral; others, ebony, brazil, or pine. But it is observed, that the almug tree can by no means be coral, because that is not fit for the purposes for which the Scripture tells us the almug tree was used, such as musical instruments, staircases, &c. The word thyinum is a name for the citron tree, known to the ancients, and very much esteemed for its sweet odour and great beauty. It came from Mauritania. The almug tree, or almuggim, dr simply gummim, taking αl for a kind of article, is therefore, by the best commentators, understood to be an oily and gummy sort of wood, and particularly that sort of tree which produces the gum ammoniac, which is also thought to be the same with the shittim wood so frequently mentioned by Moses.

ALMünECAR, a small city of the province of Granada, in Spain. The soil around it is productive of all the tropical vegetables. Sugar-canes grow as large and as juicy as in the West Indies, the cotton is of excellent quality, and the rum made here is deemed equal to that of Jamaica. The harbour is good, and the entrance well defended; but during the long war, lately terminated, its principal capital was employed in the productions which America, in peace, usually furnishes to Spain. It contains 2100 inhabitants. Long. 3. 54. W. Lat. 36. 42. N
