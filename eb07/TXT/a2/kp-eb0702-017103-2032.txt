AEGINETA, Paulus, a celebrated surgeon of the island of Aegina, from whence he derived his name. According to Μ. le Clerc’s calculation, he lived in the fourth century; but Abu]faragius the Arabian, who is allowed to give the best account of those times, places him with more probability in the seventh. His knowledge in surgery was very great, and his works are deservedly famous. Fabricius ab Aquapendente has thought fit to transcribe him in a great variety of places. Indeed, the doctrine of Paulus Aegineta, together with that of Celsus and Albucasis, make up the whole text of this author. He is the first writer who takes notice of the cathartic quality of rhubarb; and, according to Dr Milward, is the first in all antiquity who deserves the title of man-midwife.
