AMPHIBOLOGY, in Grammar and Rhetoric, a term used to denote a phrase susceptible of two different interpretations. Amphibology arises from the order of the phrase, rather than from the ambiguous meaning of a word. Of this kind was that answer which Pyrrhus received from the oracle: âˆš4ro te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere posse ; where the amphibology consists in this, that the words te and Romanos may either of them precede, or either of them follow, the words posse vincere, indifferently.
