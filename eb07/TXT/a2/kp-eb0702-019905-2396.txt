AETION, a celebrated painter, who left an excellent picture of Roxana and Alexander, which he exhibited at the Olympic games. It represents a magnificent chamber, where Roxana is sitting on a bed of a most splendid appearance, which is rendered still more brilliant by her beauty. She looks downwards in a kind of confusion, being struck with the presence of Alexander standing before her. A number of little Cupids flutter about, some holding up the curtain, as if to show Roxana to the prince, whilst others are busied in undressing the lady; some pull Alexander by the cloak, who appears like a young bashful bridegroom, and present him to his mistress. He lays his crown at her feet, being accompanied by Hephaestion, who holds a torch in his hand, and leans upon a youth, who represents Hymen. Several other little Cupids are represented playing with his arms: some carry his lance, stooping under so heavy a weight; others bear along his buckler, upon which one of them is seated, whom the rest carry in triumph; another lies in ambush in his armour, waiting to frighten the rest as they pass by. This picture gained Aetion so much reputation, that the president of the games gave him his daughter in marriage.
