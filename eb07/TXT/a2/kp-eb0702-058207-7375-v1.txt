AMALARIC was the son of Alarie II. and king of the Visigoths. Deprived of his father when an infant, he would have been bereft of his crown, had not his grandfather Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, interposed in his behalf. In defence of the royal infant, Theodoric expelled from the throne his natural brother, who had usurped the government; and, ruling the kingdom during his life, preserved the crown to the natural heir. In 526 the grandfather died, and Amalaric assumed the royal authority. In 527 he married Clotilda, the daughter of Clovis, an amiable lady, who inherited both the piety and orthodoxy of her mother, who was of the same name. The Catholic historians relate, that the king being violently attached to the Arian cause, used means indicative rather or a cruel than of a pious disposition, to compel his queen to embrace the same opinions. With all the firmness of a great mind, and the amiable patience of a Christian, she endured her wrongs for a considerable period; but at [7:2:583] length, worn out with injurious treatment, she was forced to apply to her brothers for assistance, and sent them a handkerchief stained with her blood, in proof of her cruel usage. In order to relieve their sister, one of them, Childebert, king of Paris, entered the territories of Ama-laric, who then resided with his court at Narbonne; and their forces having joined battle, the troops of Amalaric were totally defeated, and the king himself forced to save his life by flying into Spain, A. n. 531. It is reported that, when endeavouring to regain Narbonne, he was either slain by an assassin employed by Theudis, his successor, or fell in battle. Some historians say that he dicd in Barcelona.
