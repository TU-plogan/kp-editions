ALGIABARH, a Mahometan sect of predesţinarians, who attribute all the actions of men, good or evil, to the agency or influence of God. The Algiabarii stand opposed to the Alkadarii. They hold absolute decrees and physical promotion. For the justice of God in punishing the evil he has caused, they resolve it wholly into his absolute dominion over the creatures.
