ALBUM, in Antiquity., a kind of white table or register, wherein the names of certain magistrates, public transactions, &c. were entered. Of these there were various sorts; as the album decurionum, album senatorum, album judicum, album praetoris, &c.

Album Decurionum was the register wherein the names of the decuriones were entered. This is otherwise called rnatriculatio decurionum. Album Senatorum,the ∖∖s↑, of senators’ names, which was first introduced by Augustus, and renewed yearly.

Album Judicum, that wherein the names of the persons of those decuriae who judged at certain times were entered.

Album Praetoris, that wherein the formula of all actions, and the names of such judges as the pretor had chosen to decide causes, were written.

The high-priest entered the chief transactions of each year into an album, or table, which was hung up in his house for the public use.

Album is also used, in later times, to denote a kind of table, or pocket-book, wherein the men of letters with whom a person has conversed inscribed their names, with some sentence or motto.

Album Graecum, the white dung of dogs, formerly prescribed for inflammations of the throat, &c. but now disused, and chiefly employed by leather-dressers to soften leather after the application of lime.
