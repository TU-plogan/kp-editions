AMAND, Mark Antony Gerard, Sieur de St, a French poet, was born at Rouen, in Normandy, in 1594. In the epistle dedicatory to the third part of his works, he tells us that his father commanded a squadron of ships in the service of Elizabeth, queen of England, for 22 years, and was for three years a prisoner in the Black Tower at Constantinople. He mentions also that two brothers of his had been killed in an engagement with the Turks. His own life was spent in a continual succession of travels, which proved of no advantage to his fortune. The miscellaneous poems of this author are chiefly of the burlesque and the amorous kind; and though they abound in blemishes, yet his manner of reading them was so agreeable, that they were universally admired. Amand wrote also a very devout piece, entitled Stances a Μ. Corneille, sur son Imitation de Jesus Christ, which was printed at Paris in 1656. Μ. Brossette relates that he composed a poem upon the moon, in which he paid a compliment to Louis XIV. upon his skill in swimming, a favourite amusement of that monarch in his youth. The king, however, conceived such an antipathy to this production, that he would not permit it to be read in his presence, a disappointment which is reported to have hastened the death of its author. He was admitted a member of the French academy, when it was first founded by Cardinal Richelieu, in the year 1633; and Μ. Pellisson informs us that, in 1637, at his own desire, he was relieved from the obligation of making a speech, which each member was obliged to make in rotation, on condition that he should collect [7:2:586]the burlesque terms, and compile the comic part of the dictionary which the academy had undertaken. For this task he was peculiarly adapted, his writings proving him to be extremely conversant in these terms, which he seems to have diligently collected from the market-places, and other resorts of the populace. He died in1661, being 67 years of age.
