ALSTON, Charles, Îœ. D. a botanical and medical writer, was born in the west of Scotland in the year 1683. He began his studies at the university of Glasgow; and about this time he had the good fortune to be taken under the patronage of the duchess of Hamilton, which afforded him an opportunity of pursuing the bent of his inclination, by attaching himself to the study of physic. About the age of 33, along with his friend and companion the celebrated Alexander Monro, he went to Leyden, and studied three years under Boerhaave. On their return to their native country, they, in conjunction with Rutherford, Sinclair, and Plummer, undertook departments in the college of Edinburgh, and by their abilities and industry laid the foundation of that school of physic. The branches of botany and materia medica were long the favourite studies of his life, consequently he undertook that department, and continued to lecture on them with increasing reputation until his death, which happened in November 1760, at the age of 77 years. His talents appear to have been naturally strong, which he improved and strengthened with great assiduity and industry, and employed successfully in the service of science. In the year 1753, his dissertation on the sexes of plants, in which he combats the doctrine of Linnaeus, was published m the first volume of the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays. The general plan of the work is conducted with much ingenuity, supported by some strong experiments; and although, in the opinion of the learned, it has failed in its principal design, yet it must be acknowledged to be one of the best argued pieces on that side of the question. An asperity of language is sometimes used, very unsuitable to a scientific topic; but it is proper to remark, that Linnaeus had given some reasons for this conduct, by the nature of some of his descriptions. In the fifth volume of the Edinburgh Medical Essays, we have a short paper by Dr Alston, on the efficacy of the powder of tin to destroy or expel worms from the bowels. He informs us that he received the prescription from an empiric, who was renowned for his skill in curing persons afflicted with that disease. The patient received, the first morning, one ounce of tin reduced to powder, and half an ounce each on the two following mornings, and was then purged with the infusion of senna and manna. He speaks with great confidence of the efficacy of this medicine, which certainly has considerable power in these cases, and may be given to the most delicate subjects with perfect safety. Dr Alston also engaged in a chemical controversy respecting quicklime with Dr Whytt. But the most valuable of all his works are his lectures on the Materia Medica, which were published in the year 1770, in two volumes 4to. The number of curious and useful facts contained in this book will tend to secure its reputation, although considerable additions and improvements have been made since that period in this branch of science.
