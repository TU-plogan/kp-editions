ABA (or rather Abau) *Hanifah or Hanf a, surnamed Al-Nooma, was the son of Thabet, and born at Coufah, in the 80th year of the Hegira. He is the most celebrated doctor of the orthodox Mussulmans, and his sect is the most esteemed of the four which they indifferently follow. Almansor caused him to be imprisoned at Bagdad, for having refused to subscribe to the opinion of absolute predestination, which the Mussulmans call Cadha; but afterwards Abou Joseph, who was the sovereign judge or chancellor of the empire under the caliph Hadi, brought his doctrine into such credit, that it became a prevailing opinion, That to be a good Mussulman was to be a Hanifite. He died in the 150th year of the Hegira, in the prison of Bagdad: and it was not till 335 years after his death, that Melick Schah, a sultan of the Selgiucidan race, erected to his memory a magnificent monument in the same city, and a college for his followers, in the 485th year of the Hegira, and anno Christi 1092.

Aba, Abas, Abos, or Abus, in Ancient Geography, the name of a mountain in Greater Armenia, situated between the mountains Niphatos and Nibonis. According to Strabo, the Euphrates and Araxes rose from this mountain; the former running eastward, and the latter westward. It is in N. lat. 39½. and connects at its eastern extremity with Mount Ararat Aba. See Abae. Aba, Albon, or Ovon, a king of Hungary. He married the sister of Stephen I. and was elected king on the deposition of Peter in 1041. The emperor Henry III. preparing to reinstate Peter on the throne, Aba made an incursion into his dominions, and returned loaded with booty; but was next year obliged to make restitution, by paying a large sum, in order to prevent a threatened invasion from the emperor. He indulged in great familiarity with the lower class of the people; on account of which, and his severity to their order, he became universally odious to the nobility. The fugitive nobles, aided by the emperor, excited a revolt against him. After a bloody battle, Aba was put to flight; and was murdered by his own soldiers in 1044, having reigned three years.
