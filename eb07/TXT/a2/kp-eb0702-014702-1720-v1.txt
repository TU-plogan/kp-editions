ADDITION, in Music, a dot marked on the right side of a note, signifying that it is to be sounded or lengthened half as much more as it would have been without such mark.

Addition, in Law, is that name or title which is given to a man over and above his proper name and surname, to show of what estate, degree, or mystery he is; and of what town, village, or country.

Additions of Estate or Quality are, Yeoman, Gentleman, Esquire, and such like.

ADDITIONS of Degree are those we call names of dignity; as Knight, Lord, Earl, Marquis, and Duke.

Additions of Mystery are such as Scrivener, Painter, Mason, and the like.

Additions of Place are, of Thorpe, of Dale, of Wood-stock. Where a man hath household in two places, he shall be said to dwell in both, so that his addition in either may suffice. By stat. 1 Hen. V. cap. 5. it was ordained, that in such suits or actions where process of outlawry lies, such addition should be made to the name of the defendant, to show his estate, mystery, and place where he dwells; and that the writs not having such additions should abate if the defendant take exception thereto, but not by the office of the court. The reason of this ordinance was, that one man might not be troubled by the outlawry of another; but by reason of the certain addition, every person might bear his own burden.

Additions, in Distilling, a name given to such things as are added to the wash or liquor while in a state of fermentation, in order to improve the vinosity of the spirit, procure a larger quantity of it, or give it a particular flavour. All things, of whatever kind, thus added in the time of fermentation, are called by those of the business who speak most intelligently, additions; but many confound them with things of a very different nature, under the name of ferments. Additions, in Heraldry, some things added to a coat-of-arms, as marks of honour; and therefore directly opposite to abatements. Among additions we reckon Bordure, Quarter, Canton, Gyron, Pile, &c.
