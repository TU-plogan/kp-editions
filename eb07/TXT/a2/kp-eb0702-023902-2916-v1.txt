AFRICAN INSTITUTION. This institution was formed in 1807. Its general objects, and the views which influenced its formation, are clearly stated in the following resolutions, adopted at the constituent meeting, held on the 14th of April 1807.

“1. That this meeting is deeply impressed with a sense of the enormous wrongs which the natives of Africa have suffered in their intercourse with Europe; and, from a desire to repair those wrongs, as well as from general feelings of benevolence, is anxious to adopt such measures as are best calculated to promote their civilisation and happiness.

“2. That the approaching cessation of the slave-trade, hitherto carried on by Great Britain, America, and Denmark, will, in a considerable degree, remove the barrier which has so long obstructed the natural course of social improvement in Africa; and that the way will be thereby opened for introducing the comforts and arts of a more civilized state of society.

“3. That the happiest effects may be reasonably anticipated from diffusing useful knowledge and exciting industry among the inhabitants of Africa, and from obtaining and circulating throughout this country more ample and authentic information concerning the agricultural and commercial faculties of that vast continent; and that, through the judicious prosecution of these benevolent endeavours, we may ultimately look forward to the establishment, in the room of that traffic by which Africa has been so long degraded, of a legitimate and far more extended commerce, beneficial alike to the natives of Africa and to the manufacturers of Great Britain and Ireland.”

The particular means which this society proposes to employ for promoting civilisation and improvement in Africa, are of the following kind :—∙

“1. To collect and diffuse, throughout this country, accurate information respecting the natural productions of Africa, and, in general, respecting the agricultural and commercial capacities of the African continent, and the intellectual, moral, and political condition of its inhabitants.

“2. To promote the instruction of the Africans in letters and in useful knowledge, and to cultivate a friendly connection with the natives of that continent.

“3. To endeavour to enlighten the minds of the Africans with respect to their true interests, and to diffuse information amongst them respecting the means whereby they may improve the present opportunity of substituting a beneficial commerce in place of the slave-trade.

“4. To introduce amongst them such of the improvements and useful arts of Europe as are suited to their condition.

“5. To promote the cultivation of the African soil, not only by exciting and directing the industry of the [7:2:240] natives, but by furnishing, where it may appear advantageous to do so, useful seeds and plants, and implements of husbandry.

“6. To introduce amongst the inhabitants beneficial medical discoveries.

“7. To obtain a knowledge of the principal languages of Africa, and, as has already been found to be practicable, to reduce them to writing, with a view to facilitate the diffusion of information among the natives of that country.

“8. To employ suitable agents, and to establish correspondences as shall appear advisable, and to encourage and reward individual enterprise and exertion in promoting any of the purposes of the institution.”

The management of the affairs of this institution is vested in a patron and president, 20 vice-presidents, a treasurer, and a board of 36 directors. These officers are chosen annually from among that class of the subscribers who are called governors of the institution. Those who subscribe 60 guineas at one time become hereditary governors; but 30 guineas subscribed at one time makes the subscriber a governor for life; or three guineas annually, a governor during the continuance of this annual subscription. Every subscriber of one guinea becomes an ordinary member, and continues so during •the continuance of his subscription.

The proceedings of the society are fully detailed in its annual reports, which are regularly published. These reports contain much valuable and interesting information in regard to Africa, and the means of civilizing it.
