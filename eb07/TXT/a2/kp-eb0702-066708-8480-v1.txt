AMPHILOCHUS, son of Amphiaraus and Eriphyle, was a celebrated diviner. He had an altar erected to him at Athens, and an oracle at Mallos in Cilicia, which city was founded by him and Mopsus. The answers of this oracle were given by dreams; the party inquiring used to pass a night in the temple, and that night’s dream was the answer.
