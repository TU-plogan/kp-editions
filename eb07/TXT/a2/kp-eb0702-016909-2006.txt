AEACUS, the son of Jupiter by Aegina. When the isle of Aegina was depopulated by a plague, his father, in compassion to his grief, changed all the ants upon it into men and women, who were called Myrmidones, from ∕Aug, ⅛ijξ, an ant. The foundation of the fable is said to be, that when the country had been depopulated by pirates, who forced the few that remained to take shelter in caves, Aeacus encouraged them to come out, and by commerce and industry recover what they had lost. His character for justice was such, that, in a time of universal drought, he was nominated by the Delphic oracle to intercede for Greece, and his prayer was answered. See the article Aegina. The Pagans also imagined that Aeacus, on ac [7:2:170] count of his impartial justice, was chosen by Pluto one of the three judges of the dead; and that it was his province to judge the Europeans.
