AGER Picenus, or Picenum, in Ancient Geography, a territory of Italy, to the south-east of Umbria, reaching from the Appennines to the Adriatic. The people are called Picentes (Cicero, Livy), distinct from the Picentini on the Tuscan Sea, though called by Greek writers ∏∕κimvo∕. This name is said to be derived from the bird picus, under whose conduct they removed from the Sabines, of whom they were a colony.
