ALBORAK, amongst the Mahometan writers, the beast on which Mahomet rode in his journeys to heaven. The Arab commentators give many fables concerning this extraordinary mode of conveyance. It is represented as of an intermediate shape and size between an ass and a mule. A place, it seems, was secured for it in paradise at the intercession of Mahomet; which, however, was in some measure extorted from the prophet, by Alborak’s refusing to let him mount when the angel Gabriel was come to conduct him.
