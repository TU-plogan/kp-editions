AGARD, Arthur, a learned English antiquary, born at Foston, in Derbyshire, in the year 1540. His fondness for English antiquities induced him to make many large collections; and his office as deputy chamberlain of the exchequer, which he held 45 years, gave him great opportunities of acquiring skill in that study. Similarity of taste brought him acquainted with Sir Robert Cotton and other learned men, who associated themselves under the name of The Society of Antiquaries, of which society Mr Agard was a conspicuous member. He made the Domesday book his peculiar study, and composed a work purposely to explain it, under the title of Tractatus de Usu et obscurioribus Verbis libri de Domesday. He also compiled a book for the service of his successors in office, which he deposited with the officers of the kingâ€™s receipt, as a proper index for succeeding officers. All the rest of his collections, containing at least 20 volumes, he bequeathed to Sir Robert Cotton; and died in 1615.
