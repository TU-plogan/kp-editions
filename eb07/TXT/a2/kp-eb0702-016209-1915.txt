ADRAMMELECH, one of the gods of the inhabitants of Sepharvaim, who were settled in the country of Samaria in the room of those Israelites who were carried beyond the Euphrates. The Sepharvaites made their children pass through the fire in honour of this idol and another called Anammelech. It is supposed that Adramme-lech meant the sun, and Anammelech the moon: the first signifies the magnificent king, the second the gentle king.
