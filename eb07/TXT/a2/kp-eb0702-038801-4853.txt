ALCMAN, a lyric poet, who flourished in the 27th Olympiad, about 670 years before Christ. He was born at Sparta, and composed several poems, of which only some fragments are remaining, quoted by Athenaeus and some other ancient writers. He was very amorous, accounted the father of gallant poesy, and is said to have been the first that introduced the custom of singing lovesongs in company. He is reported to have been one of the greatest eaters of his age; upon which Mr Bayle remarks, that such a quality would have been extremely inconvenient, if poetry had been at that time upon such a footing as it has been often since, not able to procure the poet bread. He died of a strange disease, for he was eaten up with lice.
