AMIANTHUS, or Earth-flax, in Mineralogy, a fibrous, flexible, elastic, mineral substance, consisting of short, abrupt, and interwoven filaments. It is found in Germany, in the strata of iron ore, sometimes forming veins of an inch in diameter. Its fibres are so flexible that cloth has been made of them, and the shorter filaments that separate in the washing of the stone may be made into paper in the common manner.

Amianthus is classed by Mr Kirwan in the muriatic genus of earth, because it contains about a fifth part of magnesia. Its other constituents are, flint, mild calcareous earth, barytes, clay, and a very small proportion of iron. . It is fusible per se in a strong heat, and also with the common fluxes.
