ABBE’, in a monastic sense, the same with Abbot. Abbe' , in a modern sense, the denomination of a class of persons which has been popular in France. They were not in orders; but having received the ceremony of tonsure, were entitled to enjoy certain privileges in the church. The dress of abbés was that of academics or professed scholars. In colleges they were the instructors of youth, and were employed as tutors in private families. Many of them have risen to a distinguished rank in the state, while others have been no less eminent in science and literature.
