ADEN, a city on the Arabian coast, to the east of the Straits of Babelmandel. It is situated in Lat. 12. 50. N. Long. 45. 10. E. According to the Arabians, it derives its name from Aden, the son of Saba, and grandson of Abraham. Be this as it may, it was once the most flourishing city of Arabia, though it now presents little more than a heap of ruins surrounded with miserable huts. But it is nevertheless a place of considerable consequence on that coast, from the superiority of its harbour, .and its other advantages for trade. It is accessible at all times of the year; and from it a constant intercourse may be maintained with the coast of Africa. Coffee of the best quality, and all the other articles which enter into the commerce of the Red Sea, may be procured at this port. In particular, it is the chief mart for the gums brought over from the north-eastern districts of Africa; on which account this drug may be procured here at a cheaper rate than at Mocha. The English traders are much in favour at Aden. —See Salt’s Voyage to Abyssinia, and Milburn’s Oriental Commerce.
