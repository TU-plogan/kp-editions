ACELDAMA, in Scripture history, a place without the south wall of Jerusalem,, beyond the brook of Siloam, which was called the Potterâ€™s Field, because clay of which pots were made was dug out of it. It was afterwards bought with the money with which the high-priests and rulers of the Jews purchased the blood of Jesus Christ; arid hence it was called Aceldama, the field of blood.
