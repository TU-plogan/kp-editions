AGRIOPHAGI, in Antiquity, a name given to those who fed on wild beasts. The word is Greek, being compounded of ayg/o¢, wild, savage, and φαχω, I eat. The name is given, by ancient writers, to certain people, real or fabulous, said to have fed altogether on lions or panthers. Pliny and Solinus speak of Agriophagi in Ethiopia, and Ptolemy of others in India on this side the Ganges.
