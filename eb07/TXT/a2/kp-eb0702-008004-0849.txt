ACAMAS, son of Theseus, followed the rest of the Grecian princes to the siege of Troy; and was deputed, with Diomedes, to the Trojans, in order to get Helen restored. Laodice, Priamâ€™s daughter, fell in love with, and had a son by him, called Munitus. He was one of the heroes who concealed themselves in the wooden horse. One of the tribes of Athens was called Acamantides from him, by the appointment of the oracle; and he founded a city in Phrygia Major, called Acamantium. Homer mentions two other heroes of this name: one a Thracian prince, who came to succour Priam; another a son of Antenor.
