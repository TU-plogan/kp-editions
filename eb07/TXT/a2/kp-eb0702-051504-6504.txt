ALICANTE, a city of Spain, in the province of Valencia, with a port on the Mediterranean Sea. The city forms a half-moon on the sea-shore, and is defended by a castle 1000 feet in height, built on a rock; and the bay in which vessels are anchored is well protected by various batteries. The commerce of this port is very considerable, and its exports are consigned to every port of the north of Europe. Two lakes on the coast furnish a large supply of salt made from evaporation, which is conveyed by English and Swedish ships. A fertile plain called the Luerta, near the city, which has been furnished with the means of irrigation at a vast expense, is covered with vines, which produce excellent wines; with mulberry trees, which rear silk-worms; and with great quantities of almonds, olives, figs, and raisins, that supply articles for foreign commerce. On the coast near this city, the island of Plana, a barren rock, supplies the most beautiful marbles in great varieties. The coast furnishes large quantities of barilla, which is one of the most important branches of the commerce of the city. As the exportable commodities engage the principal attention of the agriculturists, the quantity of corn grown is insufficient for the consumption of the city and its vicinity, though rice might be raised to a vast extent; and the wheat is brought partly from La Mancha, and partly by sea from Africa and from Italy. The castle of Alicante is in long. 0. 3. 51. E. and in lat. 38. 20. 41. N. This city contains I cathedral, 3 parish churches, 6 hot springs, and [7:2:516]17,345 inhabitants. It is the seat of a bishop, and there are here manufactories of linen and woollen cloths, and of esparto. The harbour is one of the best in the Mediterranean Sea.
