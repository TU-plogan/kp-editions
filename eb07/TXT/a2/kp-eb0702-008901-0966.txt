ACCOLE’E, sometimes synonymous with Accolade. It is also used in various senses in heraldry: sometimes iţ is applied to two things joined; at other times, to animals with crowns or collars about their necks, as the lion in the Ogilvys’ arms; and, lastly, to keys, batoons, maces, swords, &c. placed saltierwise behind the shield.
