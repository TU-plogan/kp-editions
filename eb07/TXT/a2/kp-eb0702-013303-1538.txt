ACTUAL, something that is real and effective, or that exists truly and absolutely. Thus, philosophers use the terms actual heat, actual cold, &c. in opposition to virtual or potential. Hence, among physicians, a red-hot iron, or fire, is called an actual cautery, in distinction from cauteries, or caustics, that have the power of producing the same effect upon the animal solids as actual fire, and are called potential cauteries. Boiling water is actually hot; brandy, producing heat in the body, is potentially hot, though of itself cold.

Actual Sin, that which is committed by the person himself, in opposition to original sin, or that which he contracted from being a child of Adam.
