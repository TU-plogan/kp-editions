AGATHO, the Athenian, a tragic and comic poet, was the disciple of Prodicus and Socrates, and applauded by Plato, in his Dialogues, for his virtue and beauty. His first tragedy obtained the prize; and he was crowned, in the presence of upwards of 30,000 persons, in the fourth year of the 90th Olympiad. There is nothing now extant of his works, excepting a few quotations in Aristotle, Athenaeus, and others.
