AMALFI, an ancient city of Italy, situated in long. 14. 20. E. lat. 40. 35. N. It is said to have derived its origin from a number of Roman families, who, about the middle of the fourth century, either from private views of emolument, or in consequence of compulsory orders from the emperor, had left Rome, and embarked for Constantinople; but meeting with storms on their passage, were cast away on the shores of Salerno, and deprived of the means of pursuing their voyage. In this state of perplexity they long remained; but at last came to the resolution of settling on the present site of Amalfi, where they expected to enjoy security, and sufficient plenty of the necessaries of life. The earliest notice of them in this settlement dates no higher than the latter end of the sixth centuιy. Impervious mountains and inaccessible coasts preserved their infant state from the first fury of the Lombards, who seldom attempted the conquest of a maritime people.

In the year 825, when this little republic had, under the patronage of the eastern emperors, attained a degree of wealth and reputation sufficient to excite the ambition of its neighbours, Sico, prince of Salerno, marched a body of troops by night, surprised Amalfi, and carrying off the greater part of the inhabitants, compelled them to fix at Salerno, which had lately suffered a great loss of people by an epidemical disorder. But before the fourth year of their captivity was expired, the Amalfitans took advantage of the absence of the Salernitan chiefs, who were then carrying on a war with the Beneventans; armed themselves; and, after burning and plundering Salerno, marched back in triumph to their own country.

Here they framed a better system of government, and reformed many abuses in their former legislation; adopting various measures that were likely to promote internal concord, and defeat the evil intentions of foreign enemies. Their first plan was to vest the supreme authority in a temporary prefect; but the experience of a few years caused them to prefer lodging that power in the hands of a duke elected for the term of his natural life. Under these governors Amalfi attained the summit of its military and commercial glory. It extended its territory, which reached eastwardfrom Vico Vecchio, and westward to the promontory of Minerva, including likewise the island of Capreae, and the two islands of the Galli. Towards the north, it comprehended the cities of Lettere, Gragnana, Pimontio, and Capule di Franchi; towards the south, those of Scala, Ravelli, Minori, Majuri, Atrani, Tramonti, Agenda, Citara, Prajano, and Rosilano.

Leo IV. found the Amalfi tans a useful ally in his wars with the infidels, and honoured the commonwealth with the title of Defender of the Faith. The Neapolitans, with whom, as Greek vassals, they were united in strict bonds of friendship, experienced many signal favours at thθ ιr hands; and the Mussulmans themselves found it expedient to court their alliance, and to enter into treaty with them. Their situation had from the beginning given them a turn.

for commerce, and by their attention to naval affairs they had acquired such consequence in the eyes of their protector theemperorofConstantinople,thatbyhis orders acourt was established at Amalfi, for the decision of all controversies arising in maritime transactions. Its code and reports became the general rule in those cases throughout this part of Europe; its precedents and decrees were allowed to be good authority to found judgment upon even in foreign tribunals. To crown the mercantile and naval glory of the republic, it was reserved for an Amalfitan to make, or at least to perfect, the most important discovery ever made for the improvement of navigation. Pasitano, a village which stands on the shore, a few miles west of Amalfi, boasts of having given birth to Flavius Gioia, the inventor of the mariner’s compass.

The merchants of this town engrossed the trade of the Levant, and transacted the commercial business of the world in a lucrative and exclusive manner. The Pisans, Venetians, and Genoese rose upon their ruin; and, after monopolizing the emoluments of trade for some ages, made way for the more comprehensive and daring spirit of the present maritime powers.

At present Amalfi is subject to Naples, and is the see of an archbishop. It is but a shadow of what it was in its flourishing state, when it extended over the stupendous rocks that hang on each side, still crowned with battlemented walls and ruined towers. Its buildings, Mr Swinburne says, are not remarkable for elegance or size, and contain at most 4000 inhabitants, who seem to be in a poor line of life. The cathedral is an uncouth building. Under the choir is the chapel and tomb of the apostle St Andrew, to whose honour the edifice was dedicated, when Cardinal Capuano, in 1208, brought his body from Constantinople.
