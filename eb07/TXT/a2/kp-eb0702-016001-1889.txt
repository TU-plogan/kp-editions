ADONISTS, a sect or party among divines and critics, who maintain that the Hebrew points ordinarily annexed to the consonants of the word Jehovah are not the natural points belonging to that word, nor express the true pronunciation of it, but are the vowel points belonging to the words Adonai and Elohim, applied to the consonants of the ineffable name Jehovah, to warn the readers, that instead of the word Jehovah, which the Jews were forbidden to pronounce, and the true pronunciation of which had been long unknown to them, they are always to read Adonai. They are opposed to Jehovists ; of whom the principal are Drusius, Capellus, Buxtorf, Alting, and Reland, who has published a collection of their writings On this subject.
