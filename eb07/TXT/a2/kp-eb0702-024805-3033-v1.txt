AGNUS Dei, in the church of Rome, a cake of wax stamped with the figure of a lamb supporting the banner of the cross. These being consecrated by the pope with great solemnity, and distributed among the people, are supposed to have great virtues; as, to preserve those who carry them worthily, and with faith, from all manner of accidents; to expel evil spirits, &c. The name literally signifies Lamb of God; this being supposed an image or representation of the Lamb of God who took away the sins of the world. They cover it up with a piece of stuff cut in the form of a heart, and carry it very devoutly in their processions.

Agnus Dei is also a popular name for that part of the mass wherein the priest, striking his breast three times, rehearses, with a loud voice, a prayer beginning with the words Agnus Dei. It is said to have been first brought into the missal by Pope Sergius I.
