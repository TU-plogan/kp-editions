AMADEUS V. count of Savoy, rose to that dignity in the year 1285. In him it appeared that mental excellence can rise superior to riches or extent of territory; for although his dominions were by no - means extensive, nor his riches great, yet, in consequence of his wisdom and success, he obtained the surname of Great. The cautious prudence of Amadeus, however, enabled him greatly to increase his territory by means of marriage, purchase, and donations. In this situation, with extended dominion, and distinguished for wisdom and prudence, he rose to such eminence among the European powers, that he was constituted their umpire to settle their differences; which office he performed with much reputation to himself and advantage to them. In his character valour and wisdom were combined; for when the Turks attempted to retake the isle of Rhodes from the knights of St John of Jerusalem, he acquired great renown by the valour with which he defended it. A Maltese cross with the letters F. E. R. T. in future became the arms of Amadeus and his successors, in memory of this signal victory. The explanation of this motto is said to be, Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit, his valour preserved Rhodes. For this important service the grand-master conferred on him the grant of a palace at Lyons. Andronicus, the emperor of the East, had married his daughter; and in order to promote the views of his son-in-law, Amadeus took a journey to Avignon, to persuade Pope John XXII. to preach a crusade in favour of Andronicus. He died there in the year 1323. Deep penetration, keen discernment, consummate prudence, great valour, together with no small portion of the religious superstition of his time, appear the most striking features in his character.

Amadeus VIII; count of Savoy, succeeded his father Amadeus VII. in 1391. With the large sum of 45,000 florins of gold he purchased the country of Genevois from its last earl. Anxious to extend his territories, he purchased the city of Rumilli, upon the lake of Geneva, from the widow of the count of Genevois; and thus the house of Savoy became so powerful, that the emperor Sigismund erected Savoy into a duchy in the year 1426. Historians relate that he assisted John Paleologus against the duke of Milan, who endeavoured to wrest from him the duchy of Montferrat. Deeply sensible of the services which he had received, Paleologus not only resigned to the duke, Chivas, Brandis, and several other estates, but submitted to hold all the marquisate of Montferrat as a fief from the house of Savoy. Thèse fortunate acquisitions of territory were not yet limited; for upon the marriage of his daughter with Philip Maria, duke of Milan, he received Vercelli; and about the same time the count of Crescentino submitted to become his feodary. In his ambitious pursuit he laid claim to the sovereignty of the city of Geneva; but that claim, though enforced by the pope, was rejected by the citizens with disdain; and the emperor Sigismund, taking it under his protection, declared it an imperial city. After such an extensive acquisition of dominion, and amassing such sums of money, he formed the singular scheme of abandoning his throne and family; and for that purpose retired to a religious house at a place called Pipaille. But although he resigned the dukedom of Savoy to his eldest son Lewis, and made his youngest son Philip count of Genevois, yet their honours were merely nominal; for he constrained them to live on a very scanty allowance, while he in his retirement received all the revenues, and collected such sums of money, that he is said to have purchased the papal honours. During the previous part of his life, having assumed great sanctity of manners, the motives for his retirement were generally reckoned religious; but what was the astonishment of mankind to behold the seat of his hermitage become the scene of voluptuous pleasure and the most refined luxury! The local situation of the place was truly delightful, and it was enriched with every thing that could afford gratification to the senses; his retinue consisted of some of his most intimate friends, along with twenty faithful servants, who were the guardians of his voluptuous secrets. Instead of a religious habit, he wore purple robes; and upon his mantle was embroidered a golden cross. His table groaned under a weight of dainties, and the softest music cheered his daily feast: in short, such was the luxury of the place, that in the French language the phrase faire ripaille signifies to make exquisitely good cheer.

He instituted a secular knighthood in that place, under the appellation of St Maurice. The brethren assumed the name of hermits, wore beards, and excluded women from their community; and in other respects exhibited the character of decent epicures.

When he obtained the papal dignity, and was crowned [7:2:582]by the cardinal of Arles at Basil, all Europe was filled with astonishment in consequence of his elevation; for he had never entered into holy orders. But he had found means to remove every objection, the council confirmed his election, and with pretended reluctance he put on the pontifical ornaments, and was consecrated in the church of St Maurice, under the title of Felix V. The papal dignity was severely contested between him and Euge-nius; and, notwithstanding all the importunities of the council, the emperor refused to acknowledge his elevation. This religious dispute involved all Europe in contention. Historians relate that Germany remained neutral, while France, England, Italy, Spain, and Hungary, declared for Eugenius; but Arragon, Poland, and Bretagne, recognised the council only; at the same time that Savoy, Switzerland, Basil, Strasburg, Pomerania, and one of the duchies of Bavaria, recognised Felix. The emperor Frederick III. held a council at Frankfort, before which both the popes urged their respective rights by means of deputies. This attempt; however, to establish peace in Europe proving unsuccessful, the emperor repaired to the vicinity of Basil, and had a personal interview with Felix. Amadeus, that he might the more freely indulge his sensual appetite, again repaired to his favourite retreat; and after the fathers of the council had frequently solicited him in vain to reside at Basil, he prevailed upon them to remove to Lyons, which was near the seat of his pleasures. During the contest Eugenius had excommunicated Felix, the council, and several of the German princes, so that the whole church was then filled with confusion and disorder. The struggle, however, was terminated by the death of Eugenius, when the cardinals at Rome elected Thomas de Sarzan, who assumed the name of Nicholas V. In this state of affairs Amadeus deemed it prudent to enter into a negotiation for the resignation of his papal crown; and such was the policy and address displayed by him in this transaction, that Nicholas was induced to annul all that Eugenius had done to his dishonour, or that of his associates; to confirm the determination of the council of Basil to appoint him perpetual apostolical legate in Savoy, Piedmont, and the other places of his own dominions; and even added to these the honour of being bishop of Basil, Lausanne, Strasburg, and Constance. Nor did his vanity forsake him even in this political transaction, for he provided that he should continue to wear the pontifical dress, unless in a very few particulars. In order to gratify the same haughty disposition, he stipulated that he should not be obliged to go to Rome to attend any general council; and that when he had occasion to approach the pope, he should rise to receive him, and instead of kissing his toe, he should be permitted to kiss his cheek. Amadeus retired to Lausanne, and died there at the age of 60, in the year 1451.

Amadeüs IX. count of Savoy, succeeded his father Lewis, in his dominion and honours. His bodily constitution was weak, and he was afflicted with the fallingsickness; yet, on account of his piety, virtue, benevolence, and justice, he was surnamed the Happy. The clemency of his temper was such that he readily pardoned those who offended him, and in few instances was he induced to punish. In his character the virtue of benevolence shone with peculiar splendour among the other virtues of the Christian. In 1472, in the seventh year of his reign, and the thirty-seventh of his life, he died universally lamented by all his loyal subjects.
