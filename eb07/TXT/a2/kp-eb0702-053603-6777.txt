ALMORAVIDES, the name of an Arab tribe, who took possession of a district of Africa under the pretence of living in retirement, that their minds might not be distracted from the rigid observance of the precepts of the Koran. Hence they assumed the name of Morabites, which was changed by the Spaniards into that of Almo-ravides. Abubeker ben Omar, called by the Spanish authors Abu Texefien, was the first chief of this tribe. Supported by a powerful army of malcontents from the provinces of Numidia and Libya, which was assembled by the influence of the Morabites or Marabouts, he founded the dynasty of the Almoravides in Barbary, in the year 1051. Texefien was succeeded by his son Yusef or Joseph, who, after having reduced to a state of vassalage the kingdoms of Tremecen, Fez, and Tunis, passed over into Spain during the time of the civil wars, vigorously repulsed the Christians, and soon saw the greater part of the kingdoms of Murcia, Granada, Cordova, Leon, and some parts of Valencia, subjected to his power. He then returned into Africa, and left his newly acquired dominions, with a considerable army, under the government of his nephew Mohammed. On his arrival in Africa, with a view to prosecute and extend his conquest in Spain, he announced, in a public declaration, a general gazie, or religious war; assembled a numerous army, with which he embarked at Ceuta; and rejoining his nephew in Andalusia, soon laid waste that province with fire and sword.

In the year 1107, five years afterwards, he undertook another invasion, penetrated into the kingdom of Portugal, and reduced the city of Lisbon, with a considerable part of the kingdom. At this time he lost the cities of Alguazir and Gibraltar, which he had formerly taken. On his return to Barbary he was defeated at sea. This induced him to propose a truce, which was agreed to only on condition of his submitting to become the tributary of the Spanish king. Indignant at these humiliating terms, Yusef made a vow that he would never desist in his attempts till he had utterly rooted out the Christian religion in Spain. Accordingly he made preparations for a fresh invasion, embarked his army, and landing at Malaga, marched into the enemyâ€™s country. His progress was ,rapid; but his measures were inconsiderately planned and rashly executed. In the famous battle of the Seven Counts he was indeed victorious, but after a terrible slaughter, and the loss of a great part of his army. This disastrous victory obliged him to return to Africa; and he died soon after at his capital of Morocco. Ali, his son, succeeded to the sovereignty in 1110. This prince, who seems to have been of a less warlike disposition than his father, neglecting his Spanish conquests, turned his attention to the arts of peace, and erected many sumptuous buildings, and in particular the great mosque of Morocco. Alphonso, then king of Arragon, retook from him some considerable cities, which obliged him to undertake an expedition to Spain in support of the Moorish princes. But all his attempts proved unfortunate; and in his last enterprise, though powerfully assisted by the Moorish chiefs, with the loss of 30,000 men he was defeated and slain by Alphonso, in the sixth year of his reign.

He was succeeded by his son Al Abraham, who devoted himself entirely to pleasure. His subjects were harassed and oppressed with heavy taxes, which excited discontent and open rebellion. A revolution was soon effected, and, in the 25th year of his reign, the government was transferred from the tribe of the Almoravides to the Almohedes. See ALMOHEDES. [7:2:537]
