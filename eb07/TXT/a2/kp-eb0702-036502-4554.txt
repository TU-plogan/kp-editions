AILMER, or Aethelmare, earl of Cornwall and Devonshire in the reign of King Edgar. It is not known of what family he was. His authority and riches were great, and so also in appearance was his piety. He founded the abbey of Cernel, in Dorsetshire; and had so great a veneration for Eadwald, the brother of St Edmund the Martyr, who had lived a hermit in that country, near the Silver Well, as it is called, that, with the assistance of Archbishop Dunstan, he translated his relics to the old church of Cemel. In 1016, when Canute, the son of Sueno, invaded England, and found himself stoutly opposed by that valiant Saxon prince Edmund Ironside, the son of Aethelred, this Earl Ailmer, with that arch-traitor Eadric Streone, earl of Mercia, and Earl Algar, joined the Dane against their natural prince, which was one great cause of the Saxons’ ruin. He did not long survive this; and we find mentioned in history only one son of his, whose name was Aethelward, earl of Cornwall, who followed his father’s maxims, and was properly rewarded for it; for in 1018, Canute, reaping the benefit of their treasons, and perceiving that the traitors were no longer useful, caused the infamous Eadric Streone and this Earl Aethelward to be both put to death.
