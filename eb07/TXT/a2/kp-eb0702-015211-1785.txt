ADIT, in a general sense, the passage to, or entrance of, any thing.

Adit of a Mine, the hole or aperture whereby it is entered and dug, and by which the water and ores are carried away. The term is sometimes used for the airshaft, which is a hole driven perpendicularly from the surface of the earth into some part of the mine, to give entrance to the air.
