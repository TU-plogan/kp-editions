ALLUMINOR, from the French allumer, to lighten, is used for one who coloureth or painteth upon pâpér or parchment; and the reason is, because he gives light and ornament by his colours to the letters or other figures. Such ornaments are styled illuminations. The word is used in statute 1 Richard III. cap. 9. But now such a person is called a limner.
