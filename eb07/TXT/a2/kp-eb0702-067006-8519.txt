AMPLIATION, in a general sense, denotes the act of enlarging or extending the compass of a thing. On a medal of the emperor Antoninus Pius, we find the title Ampliator Civium given him, on account of his having extended the jus civitatis, or right of citizenship, to many states and people before excluded from that privilege. Indeed it is generally supposed that this prince made the famous constitution, whereby all the subjects of the empire were made citizens of Rome.

Ampliation, in Roman Antiquity, was the deferring to pass sentence in certain causes. This the judge did, by pronouncing the word amplius ; or by writing the letters N. L. for non liquet ; thereby signifying, that, as the cause was not clear, it would be necessary to bring further evidence.
