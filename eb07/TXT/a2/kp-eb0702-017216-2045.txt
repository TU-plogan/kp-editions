AEMILIUS, Paulus, the son of Paulus Aemilius who was killed at the battle of Cannae. He was twice consul. In his first consulate he triumphed over the Ligurians, and in the second subdued Perseus, king of Macedonia, and reduced that country to a Roman province, on which he obtained the surname of Macedonicus. He returned to Rome loaded with glory, and triumphed for three days. He died 168 years before Christ.

Aemilius, Paulus, a celebrated historian, born at Ve [7:2:173]rona, who obtained such reputation in Italy, that he was invited into France by the cardinal of Bourbon, in the reign of Louis XII., in order to write the history of the kings of France in Latin, and was presented to a canonry in the cathedral of Paris. He died at Paris on the 5th of May 1529. His work entitled De Rebus gestis Franco-rum was translated into French by Renard in 1581, and it has also been translated into Italian and German.
