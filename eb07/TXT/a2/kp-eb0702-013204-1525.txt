ACTIUM, in Ancient Geography, a town situated on the coast of Acarnania, in itself inconsiderable, but famous for a temple of Apollo, a Safe harbour, and an adjoining promontory of the same name, in the mouth of the Sinus Ambracius, opposite to Nicoolis, on the other side of the bay. It became famous on account of Augustusâ€™s victory over Antony and Cleopatra, and for quinquennial games instituted there, called Actia, or Ludi Actiaci. Hence the epithet Actius, given to Apollo. (Virgil.) Actiaca oera, a computation of time from the battle of Actium.
