AMORITES, a people descended from Amorrhaeus, according to the Septuagintand Vulgate; Emoraeus, according to other expositors; Haemori, according to the Hebrew; or Emorites, according to our version of the Bible, who was the fourth son of Canaan. (Gen. x. 16.) The Amo-rites first peopled the mountains lying to the west of the Dead Sea. They had likewise establishments to the east of the same sea, between the brooks of Jabbok and Arnon, from whence they expelled the Ammonites and Moabites. (Numb, xiii. 30, xvi. 29, Josh. v. 1, and Judges xi. 19, 20.) Moses made a conquest of this country from their kings Sihon and Og, in the year of the world 2553. The prophet Amos (ii. 9), speaking of the gigantic stature and valour of the Amorites, compares their height to that of cedars, and their strength to that of an oak. The name √Åmorite is often taken in Scripture for Canaanites in general. The lands which the Amorites possessed on this side Jordan were given to the tribe of Judah, and those which they had enjoyed beyond this river were divided between the tribes of Reuben and Gad.
