ADROGATION, in Roman Antiquities, a species of adoption, whereby a person who was capable of choosing for himself was admitted by another into the relation of a son. The word is compounded of ad, to, and rogare, to ask, on account of a question put in the ceremony of it, Whether the adopter would take such a person for his son? and another to the adoptive, Whether he consented to become such a personâ€™s son?
