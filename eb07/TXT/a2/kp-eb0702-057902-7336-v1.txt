ALVARES de Luna, treasurer and favourite of John II. king of Castile, celebrated for the powerful ascendency which he gained over this prince. He was a natural son of Don Alvaro de Luna, lord of Canete in Arragon, and of a woman of infamous character. He was born in 1388, and named Peter; but Pope Benedict XIII. who was charmed with his wit though yet a child, changed Peter to Alvares. He was introduced to court in 1408, and made a gentleman of the bed-chamber to King John, in whose service he acquired the most distinguished favour. In 1427 the hostility of the courtiers compelled him to retire from court: they complained that a man of no military skill, and without any virtue to recommend him, should by mere artifice and dissimulation Be advanced to the highest honours; and, by the assistance of a few upstart men, whom he had raised, and attached to his interest, - should rule as absolutely as if he were king. Their efforts against him proving successful, Alvares was banished from court a year and a half. His banishment was a source of the utmost affliction to the king, who could now speak or think of nothing but Alvares. He was therefore recalled; and being invested with his former authority, he revenged himself severely upon his enemies, by persuading the king to banish them. He spent 45 years at court, and during 30 of them maintained such an ascendency over the king, that nothing could be done without his concurrence: nay, it is related by Mariana, that the king could not change an officer or servant, or even his clothes or diet, without the approbation of Alvares. In short, he wanted nothing to complete his grandeur but the name of king: he had all the places in the kingdom at his disposal; he was master of the treasury, and had so gained the affections of the subjects by his profusion, that the king, though his eyes were now opened, and his favour withdrawn, was afraid to complain. A day of retribution however was at hand; the popular favour, as well as the affections of the monarch, declined, and Alvares was thrown into prison. Being brought to trial and condemned, hc was removed to Valladolid, and there beheaded in the market-place. He met his fate with the utmost intrepidity.
