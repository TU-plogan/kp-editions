ALCINOUS, king of the Phaeacians, in the island now called Corfu, was son of Nausithous, and grandson of Neptune and Periboea. It is by his gardens that this king has chiefly immortalized his memory. He received Ulysses with much civility, when a storm had cast him on his coast. The people here loved pleasure and good cheer, yet were skilful seamen; and Alcinous was a good prince.
