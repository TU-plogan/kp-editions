ANAeDEIA, in Antiquity, a denomination given to a silver stool placed in the Areopagus, on which the defendant, or person accused, was seated for examination. The word is Greek, Avα∕δi∕α, which imports impudence ; but, according to Junius’s correction, it should rather be Αva ∣ ∏a, q. d. innocence. The plaintiff or accuser was placed on an opposite stool called hybris, or injury. Here he proposed three questions to the party accused, to which positive answers were to be given; the first, Are you guilty of this fact? the second, How did you commit the fact? the third, Who were your accomplices?
