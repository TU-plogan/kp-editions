ALGAROTTI, Count, a celebrated Italian, was born at Padua; but the year is not mentioned. Led by curiosity, as well as a desire of improvement, he travelled early into foreign countries; and was very young when he arrived in France in 1736. Here he composed his Newtonian Philosophy for the Ladies, as Fontenelle had done his Cartesian Astronomy, in the work entitled The Plurality of Worlds. He was noticed by the king of Prussia, who gave him marks of the esteem he had for him. He died at Pisa the 23d of May 1764, and ordered his own mausoleum, with this inscription to be fixed upon it, Hic jacet Algarottus, sed non omnis. He is allowed to have been a very great connoisseur in painting, sculpture, and architecture. He contributed much to the reformation of the Italian opera. His works, which are numerous, and upon a variety of subjects, abound with vivacity, elegance, and wit. They were printed at Leghorn in 1765, in 4 vols. 8vo.
