AMES, William, D. D. a learned independent divine, celebrated for his controversial writings, was born in 1576, and educated at Christ’s College, in Cambridge. In the reign of King James I. he left the university, and soon after the kingdom, on account of his being unwilling to conform to the rules of the church; and retired to the Hague, where he had not been long before he was invited to accept of the divinity chair in the university of Franeker, in Friesland, which he filled with admirable abilities for above twelve years. He from thence removed to Rotterdam for a change of air, which his health required; and here he continued during the remainder of his life. His controversial writings, which compose the greater part of his works, are chiefly against Bellarmine and the Arminians. He also wrote, 1. A fresh Suit against the Ceremonies; ⅛. Lectiones in Psalmos Davidis ; 3. Medulla Theologies ; and several pieces relative to the sciences. He died of an asthma, at Rotterdam, in November 1633.
