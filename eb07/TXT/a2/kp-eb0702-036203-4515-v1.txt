AHUAH, the prophet of Shiloh. He is thought to be the person who spoke twice to Solomon from God; once while he was building the temple (1 Kings vi. 11), at which time he promised him his protection; and at another time (id. xi. 6) after his falling into all his irregularities, when God expressed his indignation with great threatenings and reproaches. Ahyah was one of those who wrote the annals or history of this prince (2Chr.ix.29).

The same prophet declared to Jeroboam that he would usurp the kingdom (1 Kings xi. 29, &e.), and that two heifers should alienate him from the Lord, meaning the golden calves erected by Jeroboam, one at Dan, the other at Bethel. About the end of Jeroboam’s reign, towards the year of the world 3046, Abijah, the son of that prince, fell sick; upon whieh Jeroboam sent his wife to this prophet to inquire what would become of the child. The queen therefore went to Ahijah’s house in Shiloh, disguised; but the prophet, upon hearing the sound of her feet, said, “Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam, why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to tlιee with heavy tidings.” Then he commanded her to go and tell Jeroboam all the evil that the Lord had declared he would bring upon his house for his impieties; that so soon as she should enter into the eity her son Abijah should die, and should be the only one of Jeroboam’s house that should come to the grave or receive the honours of a burial. Ahijah in all probability did. not long survive the time of this last prophecy; but with the time and manner of his death we are not acquainted.
