ALASCANI, in Church History, a sect of Anti-Luther-ans, whose distinguishing tenet, besides their denying baptism, is said to have been this, that the words, This is my body, in the institution of the eucharist, are not to be understood of the bread, but of the whole action or celebration of the Supper. They are said to have taken the name from one Joannes Alasc√¥, a Polish baron, superintendent of the church of that country in England. See the next article.
