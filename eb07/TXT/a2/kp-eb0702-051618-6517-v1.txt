ALKORAN. See Alcoran. ALL-Hallow, or All-Saints, a festival celebrated on the first of November, in commemoration of all the saints in general. The number of saints being so excessively multiplied, it was found too burdensome to dedicate a feast-day to each. In reality, there are not days enough, scarce hours enough, in the year, for this purpose. Hence an expedient was had recourse to, by commemorating such in the lump as had not their own days. Boniface IV., in the ninth century, introduced the feast of AllSaints in Italy, which was soon after adopted in the other churches.

ALL-Saints, islands near Guadaloupe, in the West Indies.

ALL-Saints, a parish in Georgetown district, South Carolina, containing 2225 inhabitants, of whom 429 are whites, and 1795 slaves. It sends a member to each house of the state legislature.

ALL-Saints Ray, a spacious harbour near St Salvador in Brazil, in South America, on the Atlantic Ocean. Long. 49. W. Lat. 12. S.

ALL-Saints’ Ray, a captainship in the middle division of Brazil, so called from the harbour of that name; bounded on the north by the Rio Real, on the south by that of Ilheos, - on the east by. the ocean, and on the west by three unconquered nations of Indians. It is reckoned one of the richest and most fertile captainships in all Brazil, [7:2:517] producing great quantities of eotton and sugar. The bay itself is about two and a half leagues over, interspersed with a number of small but pleasant islands, and is of prodigious advantage to the whole country. It has several cities and towns, particularly St Salvador, whieh is its capital. All-Saints’ Bay lies in lat. 12. 3. S. long. 40. 10. W.

ALL-Souls, in the Calendar, denotes a feast-day, held on the seeond of November, in commemoration of all the faithful deceased. The feast of All-Souls was first introduced in the eleventh century, by Odilon, abbot of Cluny, who enjoined it on his own order; but it was not long before it became adopted by the neighbouring ehurches.
