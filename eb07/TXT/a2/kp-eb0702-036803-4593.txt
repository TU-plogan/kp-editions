AIRING, a term peculiarly used for the exercising of horses in the open air. It purifies the blood, purges the body from gross humours, and, as the jockies express it, teaches the horse how to make the wind rake equally, and keep time with the other motions of his body. It also sharpens the stomach, and keeps the creature hungry, which is a thing of great consequence, as the stomach of hunters and racers is very apt to fall off, either from want of exercise, or from the too violent exercise which they are often exposed to. If the horse be over-fat, it is best to air him before sunrise and after sunsetting; and in general it is allowed by all that nothing is more beneficial to those creatures than early and late airings. Some of our modern manegers, however, dispute this: they say that the cold of these times is too great for the creature; and that if, in particular, he is subject to catarrhs, rheums, or the like complaints, the dews and cold fogs, in these early and late airings, will be apt to increase all those disorders. Nature, we see, also points out the sun-beams as of great use to these animals, those which are kept hardy and he out all night always running to those places where the sunshine comes, as soon as it appears in a morning. This should seem to recommend those airings that are to be made before sunset, and a little time after sunrise. As to the caution so earnestly inculcated by Markham, of using these early and late airings for fat horses, it is found unnecessary by many; for they say that the same effect may be produced by airings at warmer times, provided only that they are made longer; and that, in general, it is from long airings that we are to expect to bring a horse to a perfect wind and sound courage.
