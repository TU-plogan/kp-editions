AELIAN, Claudius, born at Praeneste, in Italy. He taught rhetoric at Rome, according to Perizonius, under the emperor Alexander Severus. He was surnamed Msa∕yλωΛΓoς, Honey-mouth, on account of the sweetness of his style in his discourses and writings. He was likewise honoured with the title of Sophist, an appellation in his days given only to men of learning and wisdom. He loved retirement, and devoted himself to study. He greatly admired and studied Plato, Aristotle, Isocrates, Plutarch, Homer, Anacreon, Archilochus, &c. and, though a Roman, gives the preference to the writers of the Greek nation. His curious and entertaining work entitled Variae Historiae has been frequently republished. The edition published at Amsterdam in 1731, by Gro-novius, cum notis variorum, consists of two 4to volumes. His treatise De Natura Animalium has also been several times reprinted. A very useful edition, in all respects indeed the best, was published by Schneider, at Leipsic, in 1784, in 8vo. Besides the above, the collated edition of his works, published by Gesner, contains his Epistolae Busticae.
