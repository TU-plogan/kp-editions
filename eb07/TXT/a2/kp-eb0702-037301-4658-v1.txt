ALAMANDUS, Lewis, in French Aleman, archbishop of Arles, and cardinal of St Cecilia, was one of the, greatest men of the 15th century. The cardinal presided in tlιe council of Basil, which deposed Eugenius IV. and elected the antipope Felix V. He is much commended by Aeneas Sylvius, as a man extremely well formed for presiding in such assemblies,—firm and vigorous, illustrious by his virtue, learned, and of an admirable memory in recapitulating all that the orators and disputants had said. At the request of the canons and Celestine monks of Avignon, and the solicitation of the cardinal of Clermont, legate a latere of Clement VH., he was beatified by the pope in the year 1527.
