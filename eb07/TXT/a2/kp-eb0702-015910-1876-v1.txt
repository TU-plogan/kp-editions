ADONIA, in Antiquity, solemn feasts in honour of Venus, and in memory of her beloved Adonis. The Adonia were observed with great solemnity by the Greeks, Phoenicians, Lycians, Syrians, Egyptians, &c. From Syria they are supposed to have passed into India. The prophet Ezekiel^[1. Ch. viii. 14.] is understood to speak of them. They were still observed at Alexandria in the time of St Cyril, and at Antioeh in that of Julian the Apostate, who happened to enter that city during the solemnity, which was taken for an ill omen. The Adonia lasted two days; on the first of which certain images of Venus and Adonis were carried, with all the pomp and ceremonies practised at funerals: the women wept, tore their hair, beat their breasts, &c. imitating the cries and lamentations of Venus for the death of her paramour. This lamentation they called A δωνιασμος. The Syrians were not contented with weeping, but subjected themselves to severe discipline, shaved their heads, &c. The Egyptian Adonia are said to have been held in memory of the death of Osiris; by others, of his sickness and recovery. Bishop Patrick dates their origin from the slaughter of the first-born under Moses.
