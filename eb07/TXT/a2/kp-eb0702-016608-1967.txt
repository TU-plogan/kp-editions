ADULE, or Adulis, in Ancient Geography, a town of Egypt, built by fugitive slaves, distant from its port on the Red Sea 20 stadia. Pliny calls the inhabitants Adulitae. The epithet is either Adulitanus, as Monumentum Adu-litanum, on the pompous inscription of the statue of Ptolemy Euergetes, published by Leo Alatius at Rome in 1631, and to be found in Spon and Thevenot; or Adulicus, as Adulicus Sinus, a part of the Red Sea.
