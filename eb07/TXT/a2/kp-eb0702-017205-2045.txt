AEGOSPOTAMOS, in Ancient Geography, a river in the Thracian Chersonesus, falling with a south-east course into the Hellespont, to the north of Sestos; with a town, and a station or road for ships, at its mouth. Here the Athenians under Conon, through the fault of his colleague Isocrates, received a signal overthrow from the Lacedemonians under Lysander, which was followed by the taking of Athens, and put an end to the Peloponnesian war.
