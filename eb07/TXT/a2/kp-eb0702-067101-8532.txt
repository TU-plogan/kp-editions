AMPULLA, in Antiquity, a round big-bellied vessel which the ancients used in their baths, to contain oil for anointing their bodies; also the name of a cup for drinking out of at table.

Ampulla, among ecclesiastical writers, denotes one of the sacred vessels used at the altars. Ampullae were also used for holding the oil used in chrismation, consecration, coronation, &c. Among the ornaments of churches we find frequent mention made of ampuls or vials.

Knights of St AMPULLA belong to an order instituted by Clovis I. king of France. At the coronation they bear Ï€p the canopy under which the ampulla is carried in procession.
