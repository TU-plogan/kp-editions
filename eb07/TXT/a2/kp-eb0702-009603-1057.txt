ACHERON, feigned by the poets to have been the son of Ceres, whom she hid in hell for fear of the Titans, and turned into a river, over which souls departed were ferried in their way to Elysium.

Acheron, in Ancient Geography, a river of Thesprotia, in Epirus; which, after forming the lake Acherusia, at no great distance from the promontory of â€™ Chimerium, falls into the sea opposite to the isle of Paxo.

Acheron, or Acheros, a river of the Bruttii in Italy, running from east to west, where Alexander, king of Epirus, was slain by the Lucani, being deceived by the oracle of Dodona, which bade him beware of Acheron.
