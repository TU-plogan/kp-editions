ALKAHEST, or Alcahest, among alchemists, derived from a word which signifies spirit of salt or all spirit, was supposed to be a universal menstruum, capable of resolving all bodies into their principles. Van Helmont pretended he was possessed of such a menstruum. It is likewise used by some authors for all fixed salts volatilized.
