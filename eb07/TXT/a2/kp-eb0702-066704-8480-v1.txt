AMPHICTYONS, in Grecian Antiquity, an assembly composed of deputies from the different states of Greece. Some suppose the word hμ<1nν,τιοης to be formed of αμφι, about, and ×τιuν or κrzζszv, in regard the inhabitants of the country round about met here in council; others, with more probability, from Amphictyon, son of Deucalion, whom they suppose to have been the founder of this assembly; though others will have Acrisius, king of the Argives, to have been the first who gave a form and laws to it.

Authors differ in their accounts of the number of the Amphictyons, as well as of the states who were entitled to have their representatives in this council. According to Strabo, Harpocratĩon, and Suidas, they were twelve from their first institution, sent by the following cities and states: the Ionians, Dorians, Perrhaebians, Boeotians, Magnesians, Achaeans, Phthians, Malians, Dolopians, Aenianians, Delphians, and Phocians. Aeschincs reckons no more than eleven: instead of the Achaeans, Aenianians, Delphians, and Dolopians, he only gives the Thessalians, Oetians, and Locrians∙ Lastly, Pausanias’s list contains only ten, viz. the Ionians, Dolopians, Thessalians, Aenianians, Magnesĩans, Malians, Phthians, Dorians, Phocians, and Locrians.

In the time of Philip of Macedon the Phocĩans were excluded the alliance for having plundered the Delphian temple, and the Lacedaemonians were admitted in their place; but the Phocians, 60 years after, having behaved gallantly against Brennus and his Gauls, were restored to their seat in the Amphictyonie council. Under Augustus the city Nicopolis was admitted into the body; and to make room for it, the Magnesians, Malians, Phthians, and Aenianians, who till then had distinct voices, were ordered to be numbered with the Thessalians, and to have only one common representative. Strabo speaks as if this council were extinct in the times of Augustus and Tiberius; but Pausanias, who lived many years after, under Antoninus Pius, assures us it remained entire in his time, and that the number of Amphictyons was then 30∙

The members were of two kinds. Each city sent two deputies, under different denominations; one called ^ii1ομrr l μοη, whose business seems to have been more im mediately to inspect what related to sacrifices and ceremonies of religion; the other, ∏uλαyogας, charged with hearing and deciding causes and differences between private persons. Both had an equal right to deliberate and vote in all that related to the common interests of Greece. The hieτomnemon was elected by lot, the pylagσras by plurality of voices.

Though the Amphictyons were first instituted at Ther-mopylae, Μ. de Valois maintains that their first place of residence was at Delphi, where, for some ages, the tranquillity of the times found them no other employment than that of being, if we may so call it, church-wardens of the temple of Apollo. In after-times the approach of hostile armies frequently drove them to Thermopylae, where they took their station, to be nearer at hand to oppose the enemies’ progress, and order timely succour to the cities in danger. Their ordinary residence, however, was at Delphi. Here they decided all public differences and disputes between any of the cities of Greece; but before they entered on business, they jointly sacrificed an ox cut into small pieces, as a symbol of their union. Their determinations were received with the greatest veneration, and were even held sacred and inviolable.

The Amphictyons, at their admission, took a solemn oath never to divest any city of its right of deputation; never to avert its running waters: and if any attempts of this kind were made by others, to make mortal war against them; more particularly, in case of any attempt to rob the temple of any of its ornaments, that they would employ hands, feet, tongue, their whole power to revenge it. This oath was backed with terrible imprecations against such as should violate it; e. g. May they meet all the vengeance of Apollo, Diana, Minerva, &c., their soil produce no fruit, their wives bring forth nothing but monsters, &c.

The stated terms of their meeting were in spring and autumn. The spring meeting was called Ecψyjj ∏∪λα∕α, that in autumn Mεroffωj∕vη. On extraordinary occasions, however, they met at any time of the year, or even continued sitting all the year round.

Philip of Macedon usurped the right of presiding in the assembly of the Amphictyons, and of first consulting the oracle, which was called ∏so ι ααm∕α∙
