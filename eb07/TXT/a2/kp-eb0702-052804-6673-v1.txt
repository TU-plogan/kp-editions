ALLOCUTIO, an oration or speech of a general addressed to his soldiers, to animate them to fight, to appease sedition, or to keep them to their duty. A mount of earth was raised upon the occasion, as it were a kind of a tribunal of turf. From this the general pronounced his harangue to the army, which was ranged in several squadrons around him, with their captains at their head. When the time and circumstances would not admit of a formal harangue, the general went through the ranks, and called each by his name, putting them in mind of their courage upon former occasions, mentioning the victories they had won, and making a promise of plunder.
