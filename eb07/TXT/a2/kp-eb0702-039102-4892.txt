ALCOVE, in Architecture, a recess, or part of a chamber separated by an estrade or partition of columns, and other corresponding ornaments, in which is placed a bed of state, and sometimes seats to entertain company. These alcoves are frequent in Spain, and the bed is raised two or three ascents, with a rail at the foot.
