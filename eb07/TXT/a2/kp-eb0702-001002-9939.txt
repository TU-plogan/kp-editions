ABANTES, a people who came originally from Thrace, and settled in Phoces, a country of Greece, where they built a town which they called Aba, after the name of Abas their leader; and if we may credit some ancient authors, the Abantes went afterwards into the island Euboea, now called Negropont : others say the Abantes of Euboea came from Athens. The Abantes were a very warlike people, closing with their enemies, and fighting hand to hand.
