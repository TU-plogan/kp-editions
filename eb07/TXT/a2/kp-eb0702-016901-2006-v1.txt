ADVOWSON, or Advowzen, in Common Law, signifies a right to present to a vacant benefice. Advowson is so called because the right of presenting to the church was first gained by such as were founders, benefactors, or maintainers of the church. Though the nomination of fit persons to officiate in every diocese was originally in the bishop, yet they were content to let the founders of churches have the nomination of the persons .to the churches so founded, reserving to themselves a right to judge of the fitness of the persons nominated.—Advow-sons formerly were most of them appendant to manors, md the patrons were parochial barons. The lordship of the manor and patronage of the church were seldom in 1ifferent hands, until advowsons were given to religious houses. But of late times the lordship of the manor and ìdvowson of the church have been divided.—Advow-sons are preseηtative, collative, or donative: preseηtative, where the patron presents or offers his clerk to the bishop jf the diocese, to be instituted in his church; collative, where the benefice is given by the bishop, as original patron thereof, or by means of a right he has acquired by lapse; donative, where the king or other patron does, jy a single donation in writing, put the clerk into possession, without presentation, institution, or induction.

Sometimes, anciently, the patron had the sole nomination of the prelate, abbot, or prior, either by investiture {i. e. delivery of a pastoral staff) or by direct presentation to the diocesan; and if a free election was left to the brotherhood, yet a conge d'elire, or licence of election, was first to be obtained of the patron, and the person elected was confirmed by him. If the founder’s family became extinct, the patronage of the convent went to the lord of the manor.—Advowsons are temporal inheritances and lay fees: they may be granted by deed or will, and are assets in the hands of heirs or executors. Presentations to advow- 1 sons for money or other reward are void. (31 Eliz. cap.' 6.) In Scotland this right is called patronage.
