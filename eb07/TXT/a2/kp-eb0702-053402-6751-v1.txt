ALMEIDA, a strong fortress of Portugal, in the province of Beira. It is situated between the rivers Coa and the Duas Casas, which forms a branch of the Agueda. The capture of it by the duke of Wellington, after it had fallen into the hands of the French, was deemed one of the most brilliant exploits of the peninsular war. It is about four leagues from the Spanish fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo. It is well fortified, though till the late war it was not considered so important as it was then deemed. The Spanish engineers did not estimate it as a defence to Lisbon, but merely covering the province of Beira, into which, according to their judgment, a Spanish army ought never to attempt to penetrate. This place contains 550 houses, 2750 inhabitants, an hospital, one monastery, one church, and a poor-house.
