AIX-LA-CHAPELLE (or in German Aachen), a circle in the government of Coblentz, in the Prussian province of the Lower Rhine. Its extent is 1452 square miles, and it comprehends 21 cities, 14 market towns, 781 villages, and 627 hamlets. The inhabitants amount to 310,620, of whom 299,800 adhere to the Catholic religion, and the remainder, except 1500 Jews, are Lutherans.

The chief city, of the same name, is very ancient, and was formerly populous; but the present inhabitants amount only to 34,400 persons. It was the seat of the government of Charlemagne, and continued to be the place for the coronation of the emperors of Germany till 1531. It is finely situated in a most fertile soil, and the environs are pleasing; but the city itself bears all the marks of decline. The chief objects of attention are the cathedral, with its brazen gates brought back from Paris, and a number of relies, which are highly venerated by Catholics; the town-house, built by Charlemagne, which is still in good preservation; and the baths, wlιose curative properties attract to them numerous visitors in the autumn of each year. Every seven years, from the 11th to the 25th of July, the holy relics are exhibited; and this has commonly drawn to the city more than 50,000 votaries.

Of late years manufactories have been introduced, which afford employment to a great number of workmen. The products are, linen and woollen goods, needles, pins, leather, snuff, Prussian blue, brass, soap, thimbles, and various small articles.

This place is remarkable as the theatre of diplomatic affairs, and for the treaties of 1668, 1748, and 1819. Long. 6. 3. E. Lat. 50. 15. N.
