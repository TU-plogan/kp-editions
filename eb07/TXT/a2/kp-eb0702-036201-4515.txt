AHAZIAH, the son and successor of Ahab, king of Israel, reigned two years, part alone, and part with his father Ahab, who ordained him associate in the kingdom a year before his death. Ahaziah imitated his father’s impieties (1 Kings xxii. 52, seq. ), and paid his adoration to Baal and Astarte, the worship of whom had been introduced into Israel by Jezebel, his mother. The Moabites, who had been always obedient to the kings of the ten tribes ever since their separation from the kingdom of Judah, revolted after the death of Ahab, and refused to pay the ordinary tribute. Ahaziah had not leisure or power to reduce them (2 Kings i. 1, 2, &c.); for about the same time, having fallen through a lattice from the top of his house, he hurt himself considerably, and sent messengers to Ekron, in order to consult Baalzebub, the god of that place, whether he should recover of the indisposition occasioned by this .accident. But the prophet Elijah went to Ahaziah, and declared that he should not recover from his illness; and accordingly he died in the year of the world 3108, and Jehoram his brother succeeded to the crown.

Ahaziah, king of Judah, the son of Jehoram and Athaliah, succeeded his father in the kingdom of Judah, in the year of the world 3119. He walked in the ways of Ahab’s house, to which he was allied. He reigned only one year. He was slain by Jehu the son of Nimshi.
