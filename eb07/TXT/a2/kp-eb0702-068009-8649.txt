ANACHARSIS, a Scythian philosopher, who lived about 600 years before Christ. His father was one of the chiefs of his nation, and married a woman of Greece. Instructed in the Greek language by his mother, he prevailed upon the king to intrust him with an embassy to Athens. Arrived in that renowned city, he was introduced to Solon by one of his own countrymen, named Eoxaris. From such a well-qualified master Anacharsis rapidly acquired a knowledge of the wisdom of Greece, and the literature then in circulation. By the influence of Solon he was introduced to the principal characters of Athens, and was the first stranger who was honoured with the title of citizen by the Athenians. After he had resided several years at Athens, he travelled through different countries in quest of knowledge, and then returned to his native country inflamed with the desire of instructing them in the laws and the religion of the Greeks. But his countrymen were not prepared to profit by his instructions; and while he was performing sacrifice to the goddess Cybele, in fulfilment of a vow which he had made on his way home, he was slain by an arrow, said to have proceeded from the king’s own hand. Thus fell the Scythian philosopher a victim to the folly and ignorance of his countrymen, who wantonly rejected the wisdom and learning of Greece. His energetic mode of expressing himself gave birth to the proverbial saying, “Scythian eloquence.”
