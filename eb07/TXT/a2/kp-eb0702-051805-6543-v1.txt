ALLATTUS, Leo, keeper of the Vatiean library, a native of Seio, and a celebrated writer of the 17th century. He was of great serviee to the gentlemen of Port Royal in the controversy they had with Μ. Claude touching the belief of the Greeks with regard to the eucharist. No Latin was ever more devoted to the see of Rome, or more inveterate against the Greek schismatics, than Alla-tius. He never was married, nor did he take orders; and Pope Alexander VII. having asked him one day why he did not enter into orders, he answered, “Because [7:2:519] I would be free to marry.” The pope rejoined, “If so, why do you not marry?” “Because,” replied Allatius, “I would be at liberty to take orders.” Thus, as Mr Bayle observes, he passed his whole life, wavering between a parish and a wife; sorry, perhaps, at his death, for having chosen neither of them; when, if he had fixed upon one, he might have repented his choice for 30 or 40 years. If wc believe John Patricius, Allatius had a very extraordinary pen, with which, and no other, he wrote Greek for forty years; at the loss of which he was so grieved as to lament it with tears. He published several manuscripts, several translations of Greek authors, and several pieces of his own composing. In his works he discovers more erudition and industry than sound judgment. His manner of writing is diffuse and perplexed, m akin g frequent digressions from one subject to another. He died at Rome in 1669, aged 83.
