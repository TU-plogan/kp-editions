+=====================================================================+


AMES (Fisher), a native of the United States, was born April 9, 1758, at Dedham, a small town 'about nine miles south of Boston. His father, Dr Nathaniel Ames, who practised as a physician in Bridgewater, died in 1764, leaving his mother with four sons and one daughter. Of these Fisher was the youngest; and though his mother was left in narrow circumstances, she determined to educate him with the utmost care. He accordingly began the study of Latin when he was six years of age; and in July 1770, soon after he was twelve years old, he was admitted to Harvard College; previous to which he was examined by a gentleman accustomed to teach the languages, who expressed surprise at his uncommon quickness and accuracy. At the university, the singular modesty and mildness of his character, joined to the pleasantness and vivacity of his manners, endeared him both to his companions and to his instructors. He was scrupulous in his attention to his studies, and equally so in the choice of his associates; by which means he soon acquired the character of shining parts, and of unblemished morals.

Among the students who attended this seminary, a society was formed for speculative discussion, and Mr Ames here first displayed his talents for extemporaneous eloquence. But though he was resolved to embrace the profession of the law, several years passed away before he entered on a course of professional study. During this period he appears to have maintained himself chiefly by teaching a school; and his intervals of leisure were filled up by a diligent perusal of the works of classical writers, both ancient and modern.

He at length commenced his professional career at Dedham, his native place, in the year 1781; and he soon began to be distinguished by his eloquence as a pleader. At this time, however, his attention was attracted to public events, which began to be unusually interesting, and to threaten the rupture which afterwards took place between the colonies and the mother country. Mr Ames espoused the cause of the former; and though he was not of an age at the commencement of the contest to take any active part, he watched its progress with all the anxiety of a genuine patriot. In the course of this eventful struggle, the provisional rulers of America were greatly distressed for the means of paying the troops, and of defraying the other necessary expenses of the state; and they were therefore induced to have recourse to the most exceptionable expedients. Among these, the issue of a depreciated paper currency formed a standing resource, and this measure was also accompanied by an arbitrary regulation of prices. Of all these projects Mr Ames was a zealous opposer. At a meeting of a convention of delegates assembled at Concord, he pointed out the certain mischiefs which would result from attempts of this nature; expatiating, in strong terms, on the futility and injustice of endeavouring to regulate by force the value of that which must be fixed in the market by the voluntary consent of the buyer and the seller.

In the convention for ratifying the federal constitution in 1788, Mr Ames acted a conspicuous part. He was chosen the same year a member of the House of Representatives, and for eight years he continued a firm supporter of Washington’s administration. In the contests occasioned in Europe by the progress of the French revolution he appears to have been a keen partisan of the powers combined against France; and in the controversy which took place between Britain and America respecting the privilege of the neutral powers during war, he espoused the cause of the belligerent, pleading warmly for the exercise of the maritime rights of Britain in their fullest extent. In his zealous hostility against France, he advised his countrymen, both in his political speeches and writings, to submit to all the restrictions imposed by this country on the commerce of the neutral powers.

In the year 1796 he retired from public business in consequence of his declining health; but he still continued a diligent writer of political essays. The purpose of these publications was generally to support the declining cause of the federalists, to vindicate the policy of Britain, and to awaken the jealousy of his countrymen against the hostile and ambitious views of France. His health, however, which had been on the decline since the year 1795, was now broken; and though he was chosen president of Harvard College, he was obliged to decline the office. He continued for two years in a state of extreme debility, and on the 4th July 1804 he expired. When intelligence of his death reached Boston, a meeting of the citizens took place to testify their respect for his services and character, and, at their request, his remains were brought to the capital for interment.

In America the literary character of Fisher Ames appears to be held in high estimation; and some of his countrymen have even been absurd enough to compare [7:2:655] him to Burke. We perused his essays with a curiosity greatly excited by so ambitious a comparison, but without being able to discover one trait of resemblance to that great master of political philosophy and eloquent composition; without perceiving any thing much above mediocrity, either in thought or expression; and with frequent feelings of tedium and disgust, excited by abortive strains after imagery and eloquence. Having said thus much, we think it but right to add the opinion delivered by perhaps the ablest American writer of the present day, “that Ames, both as an orator and an author, would have reflected lustre on any country; and may be considered as the most perfect model for youthful emulation, which the United States have produced.” (American Peview, vol. i. p.89.)

His works, with an account of his life, were published at Boston in 1809, in an octavo volume; and the writer to whom we have just alluded pronounces this volume “not only a treasure of political wisdom, but a literary monument, which every American should contemplate with gratitude and patriotic pride.” (f.)
