AMHERST, a military post and commercial station established by the East India Company in 1826. It is situated on the eastern frontier of our Indian empire, in the Gulf of Martaban; and was fixed upon as a proper situation for a town in lieu of Martaban, which was restored by the treaty of 1826 to the Burmese. In January 1827 this new establishment contained 1600 inhabitants, and a great increase both of trade and population is anticipated, from its convenient position as a depot of British goods, from which they may be dispersed among the Burmese, Chinese, and the other nations beyond the Ganges. It has a spacious and secure harbour, with a depth of 3 fathoms at low water neap tides; and ships may lie within 100 yards of the shore. Long. 97. 25. E. Lat. 16. 5. N. (Hamiltonâ€™s East India Gazetteer.) (f.)
