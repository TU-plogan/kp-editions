AERARIUS, a name given by the Romans to a degraded citizen, who had been struek off the list of his eentury. Sueh persons were so ealled, because they were liable to all the taxes (<εra), without enjoying any of its privileges.

The aerarii were incapable of making a will, of inheriting, of voting in assemblies, or of enjoying any post of honour or profit in effeet, they were only subject to the burdens, without the benefits of society; yet they retained their freedom, and were not reduced to the condition of slaves. To be made an aerarius was a punishment inflicted for some offenee, and reputed one degree more severe than to be expelled a tribe, tribu moveri. Aerarius was likewise an officer instituted by Alexander Severus, for the distribution of the money given in largesses to the soldiery or people.

Aerarius was also used for a person employed in coining or working brass. These are sometimes ealled aerarii fusores. At other times, aerarius is distinguished from fusor ; the former answering to what we now eall coppersmiths, the latter to founders.

Aerarius was also applied to a soldier who receives pay.
