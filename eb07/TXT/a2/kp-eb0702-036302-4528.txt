AHRWEIL, a circle in the department of Coblentz, and the Prussian province of the Lower Rhine. It extends over 96 square miles, or 61,440 acres; contains 24,745 inhabitants, all Catholics except 400 Protestants, in three cities, two market towns, and 186 villages. The Rhine washes its eastern border, and receives the water of the Ahr, which issues out of a fertile valley, near Sinzig, whence some good wine from the sides of the hills is produced. The rest of the district is poor in agriculture, and only somewhat better in breeding cattle, and furnishing fish, game, wood, and stone. The capital is a small city of the same name. It is built on the banks of the Ahr, containing 400 houses, and 2079 inhabitants, chiefly tanners, curriers, and makers of wine.
