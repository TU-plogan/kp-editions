ALNAGER, Alneger, or Aulneger, signifies a sworn public officer, who, by himself or deputy, was to look to the assize of woollen cloth made throughout the land, «. e. the length, width, and work thereof; and to the seals for that purpose ordained. The office of king’s alnager seems to have been derived from the statute of Richard I. A. D. 1197, which ordained that there should be only one weight and one measure throughout the kingdom; and that the custody of the assize or standard of weights and measures should be committed to certain persons in every city and borough. His business was, for a certain fee, to measure all cloths made for sale, till the office was abolished by statute 11 and 12 William III. cap. 20.
