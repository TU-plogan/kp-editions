ALENTEJO, one of the provinces into which the kingdom of Portugal is divided, deriving its name from its situation on the banks of the Tagus, in the Portuguese language Tejo. On the north it is bounded by the Portuguese Estremadura and Begra; on the east by Spanish Estremadura and Andalusia; on the south by Algarve; and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, except in that part where the district of St Ubcs, which is a port of Portuguese Estremadura, interposes betwixt it and the sea. Its extent is 883 square leagues, and in 1798 the number of its inhabitants was 380,480. It is the largest province in the kingdom. Its surface is very unequal: towards Spanish Estremadura the soil is moderately fruitful, but towards Algarve the country is covered with extensive forests of oak, cork, holm, and other trees, especially on the northern sides of the Sierras de Monchique and Caldeiraon. The climate is considered unhealthful, especially in the summer months, when the waters, which are abundant, become stagnant. The province produces abundance of cattle; it yields more wheat than it consumes, and in part supplies Lisbon with that necessary. It grows sufficient wine for its own consumption, but is deficient in oil, which is occasionally supplied from Spanish Estremadura and Andalusia. The natural boundary, on the side of Spain, is the river Guadiana; but the territory of 01ivenza, extending over 110 square leagues, on the eastern side of that river, has, ever since the thirteenth century, been a part of Portugal; and the possession of it has been and still is an object of greater jealousy to the two nations, than its value to either will justify. The only rivers of this province which empty themselves into the ocean are the Tagus and the Odcmira: the latter enters it near Villa Nova de Milfontes, and is navigable five leagues from its mouth to the town of its own name. The other streams run, some to the Guadiana, and the others to the Tagus. As this province presents a frontier to Spain, it is most abundantly provided with fortified places, which, if in a good state and well garrisoned, would become formidable auxiliaries in cither offensive or defensive warfare; but in the late invasion by the armies of France, they were found to be of little practical benefit. This province is between 37. 20. and 39. 34. north latitude.
