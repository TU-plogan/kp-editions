AMAMA, Sixtinus, professor of the Hebrew tongue in the university of Franeker, a man of great learning, was born in Friesland, and studied under Drusius. He published a criticism upon the translation of the Pentateuch; collated the Dutch translation of the Bible with the original and the most accurate translations; and wrote a censure of the Vulgate translation of the historical books of the Old Testament, Job, the Psalms, and Canticles. It is impossible to answer the reasons whereby he shows the necessity of consulting the originals. This he recommended so earnestly, that some synods, being influenced by his reasons, decreed, that none should be admitted into the ministry but such as had a competent knowledge of the Hebrew and Greek text of the Scriptures. He died in 1629.
