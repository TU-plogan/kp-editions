AGA, in the Turkish language, signifies a great lord or commander. Hence the aga of the janizaries is the commander-in-chief of that corps; as the general of horse is denominated spachiclar aga. The aga of the janizaries is an officer of great importance. He is the only person who is allowed to appear before the grand signior without his arms across his breast in the posture of a slave. Eunuchs at Constantinople are in possession of most of the principal posts of the seraglio: the title aga is given to them all, whether in or out of employment. This title is also given to all rich men without employ, and especially to wealthy landholders.

We find also agas in other countries. The chief officers under the khan of Tartary are called by this name; and among the Algerines we read of agas chosen from among the boluk bashis (the first rank of military officers), and sent to govern in the chief towns and garrisons of that state. The aga of Algiers is the president of the divan or senate. For some years the aga was the supreme officer, and governed the state in place of the bashaw, whose power dwindled to a shadow. But the soldiery rising against the boluk bashis or agas, massacred most of them, and transferred the sovereign power to the caliph, with the title of Dey or King.
