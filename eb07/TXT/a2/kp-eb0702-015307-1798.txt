ADMINICLE, a term used chiefly in old law-books to imply an aid, help, assistance, or support. The word is Latin, adminiculum; and derived from adminiculor, to prop or support.

Adminicle, in Scotish Law, signifies any writing or deed referred to by a party, in an action of law, for proving his allegations.
