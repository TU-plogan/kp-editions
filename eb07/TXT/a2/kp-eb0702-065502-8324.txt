AMESBURY, a market-town in the hundred of the same name, in the county of Wilts, 78 miles from London, and 8 from Salisbury. It is situated in a narrow valley on the river Avon, on Salisbury plain. It is an ill-built town, but there is in it the beautiful house built by Inigo Jones, formerly belonging to the duke of Queensberry, but now occupied as a nunnery by Catholic ladies. Near the town stands that druidical assemblage of stones so familiar to antiquaries by the name of Stonehenge. The population in 1801 was 721; in 1811, 723; and in 1821, 810.
