AEGIS, in Ancient Mythology, a name given to the shield or buckler of Jupiter and Pallas. The goat Amal-thaea, which had suckled Jove, being dead, that god is said to have covered his buckler with the skin; whence the appellation aegis, from α∕ξ, αιγος, she-goat. Jupiter afterwards restored the animal to life, covered it with a new skin, and placed it among the stars. He made a present of his buckler to Minerva; whence that goddess’s buckler is also called aegis. Minerva having killed the Gorgon Medusa, nailed her head in the middle of the aegis, which henceforth had the faculty of converting into stone all those who looked upon it; as Medusa herself had during her life. Others suppose the aegis not to have been a buckler, but a cuirass or breastplate; and it is certain that the aegis of Pallas, described by Virgil, Aen. lib. viii. ver. 435, must have been a cuirass, since that poet says expressly that Medusa’s head was on the breast of the goddess. But the aegis of Jupiter, mentioned a little higher, ver. 354, seems to have been a buckler. The words—
Cum saepe nigrantem
Aegìda concuteret dextra,

are descriptive of a buckler, but not at all of a cuirass or [7:2:172] breastplate. Servius makes the same distinction on the two passages of Virgil; for on verse 354 he takes the aegis for the buckler of Jupiter, made, as above mentioned, of the skin of the goat Amalthaea; and on vcrse 435 he describes the aegis as the armour which covers the breast, and which in speaking of men is called cuirass, and aegis in speaking of the gods. Many authors have overlooked these distinctions for want of going to the sources.
