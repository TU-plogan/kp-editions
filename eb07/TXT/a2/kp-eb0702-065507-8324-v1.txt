AMHURST, Nicholas, an English poet and political writer of the 18th century, was born at Marden in Kent, and entered of St John’s College, Oxford; from whence he was expelled for irregularity of conduct and libertine principles. Retaining great resentment against the university on this account, he abused its learning and discipline, and some of the most respectable characters in it, [7:2:656] in a poem published in 1724, called Oculus Brìtannioe, and in a book entitled Terrae Filius. He published a Miscellany of Poems, sacred and profane; and the Convocation, a poem in five cantos, which was a satire on the bishop of Bangor’s antagonists. But he is best known for the share he had in the political paper called The Craftsman ; though, after having been the drudge of his party for nearly 20 years, he was as much forgotten in the famous compromise of 1742 as if he had never been born; and, when he died in that year of a broken heart, was indebted to the charity of his booksellers for a grave.
