AERARIUM, the treasury or place where the public money was deposited amongst the Romans.

Aerarium Ilithyae, or Jdnonis Lucinae, was where the moneys were deposited which parents paid for the birth of each child.

Aerarium Privatum was the emperorâ€™s privy purse, or the place where the money arising from his private patrimony was deposited.

Aerarium Sanctius contained the moneys arising from the twentieth part of all legacies: this was kept for the extreme necessities of the state.

Aerarium Vicesimarum, the place where the money arising from the taxes levied from foreign countries was laid up; so called because it most commonly consisted of a twentieth part of the produce.

There are several other treasuries mentioned in history, as the Aerarium Juventutis, Veneris, &c. The temple of

Saturn was the public treasury of Rome, either because Saturn first taught the Italians to coin money, or, which is most likely, because this temple was the strongest and most secure, and therefore the fittest place for that purpose.

Aerarium differs from Fiscus, as the first contained the public money, the second that of the prince. The two are, however, sometimes indiscriminately used for each other.
