AGADES, a kingdom and city of Negroland, in Africa. It lies nearly under the tropic of Cancer, between Gubur and Cano. The town stands on a river that falls into the Niger; it is walled, and the king’s palace is in the midst of it. The king has a retinue, who serve as a guard. The inhabitants are not so black as other negroes, and consist of merchants and artificers. Those that inhabit the fields are shepherds or herdsmen, whose cottages are made of boughs, and are carried about from place to place on the backs of oxen. They are fixed on the spot of ground where they intend to feed their cattle. The houses in the city are stately, and built after the Barbary fashion. This kingdom was, and may be still, tributary to the king of Timbuctoo∙ It is well watered; and there is great plenty of grass, cattle, senna, and manna. The prevailing religion is the Mahometan, but it is not rigidly practised. Long. 9. 19. E. Lat. 26. 10. N.
