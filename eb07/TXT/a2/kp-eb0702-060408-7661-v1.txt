AMELOT de la Houssai, Nicholas, born at Orleans in 1634, was much esteemed at the court of France, and appointed secretary of an embassy which that court sent to the commonwealth of Venice, as appears by the title of his Translation of Father Paul’s History of the Council of Trent; but he afterwards published writings which gave such offence that he was imprisoned in the Bastile. The first works he printed were the History of the Government of Venice, and that of the Uscoks, a people of Croatia. In 1683 he published his translations into French of Machiaveľs Prince, and Father Paul’s History of the Council of Trent, and political Discourses of his own upon Tacitus. These performances were well received by the public. He did not prefix his own name to the two last-mentioned works, but concealed himself under that of La Mothe Josseval. His translation of Father Paul was attacked by the partisans of the pope’s unbounded power and authority. In France, however, it met with great success; all the advocates for the liberty of the Gallican church promoting the success of it to the utmost of their power, though at the same time there were three memorials presented to have it suppressed. When the second edition of this translation was published, it was violently attacked by the Abbé St Real, in a letter which he wrote to M .Bayle, dated October 17, 1685. Amelot defended himself in a letter to the same gentleman. In 1684 he printed, at Paris, a French Translation of Balthasar Gracians Courtier, with the title of Ľ Homme de Cour. In 1686 he printed La Morale de Tacite de la Flatterie, in which work he collected several particular facts and maxims, [7:2:605] which represent in a strong light the artifiees of courtflatterers, and the misehievous effeets of their poisonous discourses. Frederiek Leonard, a bookseller at Paris, having proposed in the year 1692 to print a eolleetion of all the treaties of peace between the kings of France and all the other prinees of Europe, sinee the reign of Charles VII. to the year 1690, Amelot published a small volume, in duodecimo, eontaining a preliminary diseourse upon these treaties, wherein he endeavours to show, that most princes, when they enter into a treaty, think more how to evade than how to perform the terms to which they subscribe. He published also an edition of Cardinal d’Õssaťs letters in 1697, with several observations of his own; whieh, as he tells us in his advertisement, may serve as a supplement to the history of the reigns of Henry III. and Henry IV., kings of Franee. He wrote several other works; and died at Paris in 1706, at the age of 73. Amelot was at one time eonfined in the Bastile, probably on aeeount of his political writings.
