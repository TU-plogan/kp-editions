ALCORANISTS, among Mahometans, those who adhere strictly to the letter or text of the Alcoran, from an opinion of its ultimate sufficiency and perfection. The Persians are generally Alcoranists, as admitting the Alcoran alone for their rule of faith. The. Turks, Tartars, Arabs, &c. besides the Alcoran, admit a multitude of traditions. The Alcoranists, among Mahometans, amount to much the same with the Textuaries among the Jews. The Alcoranists can find nothing excellent out of the Alcoran; are enemies of philosophers, metaphysicians, and scholastic writers. With them the Alcoran is every thing.
