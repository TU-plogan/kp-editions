AKHM ETSCHET, or Simferopol, one of the six circles into which the Russian government or province of Taurien is divided. It is the richest and most fruitful part of the peninsula, extending from long. 32. 31. to 33. 46. E. and from lat. 44. 30. to 45. 9. N. About two-thirds of the district is hilly, and gives rise to the rivers Katscha, Belbak, and Alma, as well as many smaller streams, by whose water fertility is dispersed in the valleys and plains. The circle is estimated to contain about 50,000 inhabitants.

Akhmetschet, a city, the capital of the circle of the same name, in the province of Taurien. It is composed of two parts; the old town, a mere heap of Tartar booths; and the new, built on a regular plan, since the extinction of the former government, with a few good public edifices. It contains three mosques, a Russian, Arminian, and Greek church, with 900 houses, and, according to Usewoloske, 20,000 inhabitants, of various nations and religions. A regiment of Russians is constantly in garrison in the city, which is only moderately fortified. It is in long. 34.1. Ã‰. and lat. 44. 59. N.
