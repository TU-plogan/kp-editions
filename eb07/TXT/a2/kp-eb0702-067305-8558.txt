AMYOT, James, bishop of Auxerre and grand almoner of France, was born of an obscure family at Melun, the 30th of October 1514, and studied philosophy at Paris, in the college of Cardinal le Moine. He was naturally dull and heavy; but diligence and application made amends for these natural defects. He left Paris at the age of 23, and went to Bourges with the Sieur Colin, who had the abbey of St Ambrose in that city. At the recommendation of this abbot, a secretary of state took Amyot into his house to be tutor to his children. The great improvements they made under his direction induced the secretary to recommend him to the Princess Margaret, duchess of Berry, only sister of Francis I.; and by means of this recommendation Amyot was made public professor of Greek and Latin in the university of Bourges. It was during this time he translated into French the Amours of Theagines and Charielea, which Francis I. was so pleased with, that he conferred upon him the abbey of Bellosane. He also translated Plutarch’s Lives, which he dedicated to the king; and afterwards undertook that of Plutarch’s Morals, which he ended in the reign of Charles IX. and dedicated to that prince. Charles conferred upon him the abbey of St Cornelius de Compiegne, and made him grand almoner of France and bishop of Auxerre. He died in 1593, aged 79.
