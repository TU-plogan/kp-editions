ABSINTHIATED, any thing tinged or impregnated with absinthium or wormwood. Bartholin mentions a woman whose milk was become absinthiated, and rendered, as bitter as gall, by the too liberal use of wormwood.

Vinum absinthites, or poculum absinthiatum, “wormwood wine,” is much spoken of among the ancients as a wholesome drink, and even an antidote against drunkenness. Its medical virtues depend on its aromatic and bitter qualities. Infused in wine or spirits, it may prove beneficial in cases of indigestion or debility of the stomach.
