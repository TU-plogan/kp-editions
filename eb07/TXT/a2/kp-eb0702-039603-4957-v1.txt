ALEANDER, Jerome, cardinal and archbishop of Brindisi, was born in 1480, and distinguished himself at the beginning of the Reformation by the opposition he made to Luther; for being sent into Germany as the pope’s nuncio in 1519, he acted, as occasion served, in the character of both ambassador and doctor, and declaimed three hours together against Luther’s doctrine before the diet at Worms, but could not prevent that celebrated reformer from being heard in that diet. He published several works, and died at Rome in 1542.

Aleander, Jerome, nephew of the former, a learned man of the seventeenth century, born in the principality of Friuli, of the same family with the preceding. When he went to Rome, he was employed as secretary under Cardinal Octavius Bandini, and discharged this office with great honour for almost twenty years. He afterwards, by the persuasion of Urban VIIL, who had a great esteem for him, became secretary to Cardinal Barberini, whom he accompanied to Rome when he went thither in the character of legate a latere, and in whose service he died in 1631. He was one of the first members of the Academy of Humorists, wrote a learned treatise in Italian on the device of the society, and displayed his genius on many different subjects. Barber ini gave him a magnificent funeral at the academy of Humorists; the academists carried his corpse to the grave, and Gaspar de Simeonibus, one of the members, made his funeral oration.
