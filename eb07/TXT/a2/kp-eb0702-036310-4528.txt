AJAX, the son of Oileus, was one of the principal generals who went to the siege of Troy. He ravished Cassandra, the daughter of Priam, even in the temple of Minerva, where she thought to have found sanctuary. It is said he made a serpent of 15 feet long so familiar with him, that it ate at his table, and followed him like a dog. The Locrians had a singular veneration for his memory.

Ajax, the son of Telamon, was, next to Achilles, the most valiant general among the Greeks at the siege of Troy. He commanded the troops of Salamis, and performed many great actions, of which we have an account in the Iliad, in Dictys Cretensis, and in the 23d book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. He was so enraged that the arms of Achilles were adjudged to Ulysses, that he immediately became mad. The Greeks paid great honour to him after his death, and erected a magnificent monument to his memory, upon the promontory of Rhetium.

Ajax, in Antiquity, a furious kind of dance, in use among the Grecians; intended to represent the madness of that hero after his defeat by Ulyases, to whom the Greeks had given the preference in his contest for Achilles’s arms. Lucian, in his treatise of Dancing, speaks of dancing the Ajax. — There was also an annual feast called Ajantia, Αιαντεια, consecrated to that prince, and observed with great solemnity in the island of Salamis, as well as in Attica; where, in memory of the valour of Ajax, a bier was exposed, set out with a complete set of armour.

Ajazzo, a seaport town of Natolia, in the province of Caramania, anciently Cilicia, seated on the coast of the Mediterranean, 30 miles north of Antioch, and 50 west of Aleppo, where the city of Issus anciently stood, and near which Alexander fought his second battle with Darius Long. 36. 10.
