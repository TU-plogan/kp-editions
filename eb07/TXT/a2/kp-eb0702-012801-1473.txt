ACRISIUS, in fabulous history, king of Argos, being told by the oracle that he should be killed by his grandchild, shut up his only daughter Danae in a brazen tower; but Jupiter coming down in a golden shower, begot Perseus by her. After Perseus had slain the Gorgons, he carried Medusaâ€™s head to Argos; which Acrisius seeing, was turned into a statue.
