ALADSCHAHISSAR, a Turkish pachalic (Sand-schah), part of the ancient Bulgaria, a mountainous district, in which the river Moravia rises in two branches, and runs into the Danube. It extends from long. 21. 45. to 22. 30. E. and from lat. 42.30. to 43.30. N. The greatroad from Belgrade passes through the northern part of the province. It is productive of wine, feeds much cattle, and has some rivers near Camplina. The capital, of the same name, sometimes called Kruschevarz, is the seat of a Greek bishop, and has a castle; once the residence of the predatory chief Von Serf, and conquered from him by the Sultan Murad the Second. It is near the east bank of the river Moravia.
