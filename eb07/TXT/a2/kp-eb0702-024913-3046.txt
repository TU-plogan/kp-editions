AGRA, a province of Hindostan, chiefly situated between the 25th and 28th degrees of N. lat. On the north it is bounded by the province of Delhi, on the south by that of Malwah, on the east by the provinces of Oude and Allahabad, and on the west by that of Ajmeer. It is estimated to be 250 miles in length, and in average breadth to be 180. The following are the principal geographical and political divisions:—1. Agra district; 2. the Doab; 3. the district of Etaweh; 4. the Furruckabad district; 5. Cal-pee, Gohud, and Gualior; 6. the Bhurtpoor territories; 7. Alvar or Machery; 8. the Alighur district.

This province has an unequal surface. To the north-east of the Jumna the country is flat and open, and rather bare of trees; but to the south of the Chumbul, and also towards the western frontier, it rises into hills, and is interspersed with jungle. Owing to the elevation of the ground, it has for the greater part of the year a temperate climate. In summer, while the hot winds prevail, it is intensely hot, and the climate is unhealthful, especially among the hills. But these winds do not continue for any length of time; and in the winter months it is actually cold, especially during the night. The province is indifferently watered. The chief rivers are the Jumna, the Chumbul, and the Ganges, besides other streams of inferior note. Except in the vicinity of the large rivers, water is scarce for the purposes of irrigation. Rice, which requires an abundant supply of moisture, is not cultivated. The soil is particularly adapted to the cultivation of indigo, cotton, and sugar, the production of which is annually increasing in the country under the jurisdiction of the British: in that which is still subject to the native chiefs, agriculture is in a backward state. There are no remarkable mineral productions in the province of Agra. The animals differ in no respect from those found in other parts of Hindostan; and the breed of horses is much esteemed. The principal article manufactured is coarse cotton cloth; but no great quantity is exported. The most fertile part of the province is the Doab, or the territory included between the Ganges and the Jumna, which exports indigo, sugar, and cotton. The country to the north-west of Agra, which is under the dominion of the native chiefs, being scantily supplied with water, is of a very inferior quality, and comparatively unproductive. This province is not nearly so populous as Bengal, Jaupore, and the more flourishing parts of the British territory. It does not contain above six millions of inhabitants, of whom the greater proportion live under the British jurisdiction; the remainder under Scindia and others of the native princes. The chief towns, besides Agra, the capital, are Alvar or Aloor, the capital of a native rajah; Bhurtpoor, one of the strongest fortresses in India, which the British carried by storm in 1826; Deeg, another strong fortress; Mathura, Kanoje, Etaweh, Gualior, Gohud, Calpee, Narwar, and Furruckabad. The natives are in general a robust and handsome race of people, and consist of a mixture of Hindoos and Mahometans. The Hindoo religion and language are predominant, although the country has been subject to the Mahometans since the thirteenth century.

Agra, the capital of the preceding province, is situated on the south-west side of the Jumna, from the banks of which it extends upward in a vast semicircle. It is a large, old, and ruinous city, with little to attract attention beyond that picturesque confusion of houses, balconies, and projecting roofs, common to all Indian towns. The houses consist of several stories, and the streets are so narrow as scarcely to admit a palanquin. The greater part of this once flourishing city is now a heap of ruins, and uninhabited. It is still, however, estimated to contain 60,000 inhabitants; and as its commerce improves, which it is likely to do, from the facilities which it affords to the trade of [7:2:250]western Hindostan, its population is likely to increase also. Since 1818, indeed, in consequence of the tranquillity of the neighbouring province of Rajpootana or Ajmeer, the produce of the customs has continued progressively to increase. It has a fort, which is very large and ancient, and is surrounded with high walls and towers of red stone, of the hardness and colour of jasper, which command some noble views of the city, its neighbourhood, and the windings of the Jumna. The fort has a ditch of great depth, and a double rampart, the inner one being of an enormous height, with bastions at regular distances. Agra is famed for some beautiful edifices, the most remarkable of which is the Jagemahal, a tomb erected by the emperor Shah Jehan, to the memory of Begum Novr-jehan, his beloved wife. Bishop Heber mentions, that after all he had heard of this celebrated mausoleum, its beauty rather exceeded than fell short of his expectations. It is of white marble, and is placed on an elevated terrace of white and yellow marble, with four tall minarets of the same material rising at each of its angles. The interior, containing a central hall, in which are the tombs of the emperor and his wife, is remarkable for its exquisite finish; the pavement being laid with alternate squares of marble, and the walls, screens, and tombs, crowned with flowers and inscriptions executed in beautiful Mosaic of cornelian, lapis lazuli, and jasper. The general effect of the whole is solemn and impressive rather than gaudy. There is a tomb erected to another of the emperors, now used as a court of justice, which is a splendid edifice. Agra contains, besides, a beautiful mosque of white marble, carved with exquisite simplicity and elegance, and the palace, built by Acbar chiefly of the same material, and now used as warehouses, offices, and lodging-rooms for the garrison. At Secundra, a ruinous village about six miles from Agra, is the magnificent tomb of the emperor Acbar, which, Bishop Heber remarks, is the most splendid building in its way that he had seen in India.

Agra was greatly enlarged and embellished by Acbar, who made it his capital. The city, which was under the rule of Scindia, surrendered to the British army under Lord Lake in 1803. It was soon after made the scat of the civil establishment for the collection of the revenue and the administration of justice. The fortifications have been lately strengthened and improved. 137 miles travelling distance from Delhi. Long. 77. 53. E. Lat. 27. 11. N.
