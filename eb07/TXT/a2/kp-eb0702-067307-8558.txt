AMYRAUT, Moses, an eminent French Protestant divine, born at Bourgueil in Touraine in 1596. He studied at Saumur, where he was chosen professor of divinity; and his learned works gained him the esteem of Catholics as well as Protestants, particularly of Cardinal Richelieu, who consulted him on a plan of reuniting their churches, which, however, as may well be supposed, came to nothing. He published a piece, in which he attempted to explain the mystery of predestination and grace, which occasioned a controversy between him and some other divines. He also wrote An Apology for the Protestants, A Paraphrase on the New Testament, and several other books. This eminent divine died in 1664.
