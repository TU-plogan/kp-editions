ALEXIPHARMICS, in Medicine, are properly remedies for expelling or preventing the ill effects of poison; but some of the moderns having imagined that the animal spirits in acute distempers were affected by a malignant poison, the term has been understood to mean medicines adapted to expel this poison by the cutaneous pores, in the form of sweat. In this sense, alexipharmics are the same as sudorifics.
