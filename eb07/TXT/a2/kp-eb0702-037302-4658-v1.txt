ALAMANNI, Lewis, was born at Florence, of a noble family, on the 28th of October 1495. He was obliged to fly his country for a conspiracy against Julius de’ Medici, who was soon after chosen pope under the name of Clement VII. During this voluntary banishment he went into France, where Francis I., from a love to his genius and merit, became his patron. This prince employed him in several important affairs, and honoured him with the collar of the order of St Michael. After the death of Francis, Henry, duke of Orleans, who succeeded him in 1537, showed no less favour to Alamanni, and in the year 1551 sent him as his ambassador to Genoa. This was his last journey to Italy; and being returned to France, he died at Amboise on the 18th of April 1556, being in the 61st year of his age. He left many beautiful poems, and other valuable performances, in the Italian language. We have also some notes of his upon Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey: those upon the Iliad were printed in the Cambridge edition of Homer in 1689, and Joshua Barnes has also inserted them in his fine edition of Homer in 1711.
