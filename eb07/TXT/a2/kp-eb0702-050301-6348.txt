ALGIERS, a kingdom of Africa, now one of the states 'of Barbary. According to the latest and best computations, it extends 460 miles in length from east to west, but is very unequal in breadth, some places being scarcely 40 miles broad, and others upwards of 100. It lies between long. 0. 16. and 9. 16. W. and extends from lat. 36. 55∙ t0 44. 50. N. It is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean, on the east by the river Zaine, the ancient Tusea, which divides it from Tunis; on the west by the Mulvya and the mountains of Trava, which separate it from Morocco; and on the south by the Sahara, Zaara, or Numidian Desert.

f The kingdom of Algiers is at present divided into three provinces or districts, viz. the eastern, western, and southern. The eastern or Levantine government, which is by far the most considerable of the three, contains the towns of Bona, Constantina, Gigeri, Bujeiah, Stessa, Tebef, Za-moura, Biscara, and Necanz, in all which the Turks have garrisons: besides which, it includes the two ancient kingdoms of Cuco and Labez, though independent of the Algerine government, to whose forces their country is inaccessible; so that they live under their own sheikhs, chosen by each of their adowars or hordes. The western government has the towns of Oran, Tremecen, Mostagan, Tenez, and Secrelly with its castle and garrison. The southern government has neither town, village, nor even a house, all the inhabitants living in tents.

The inhabitants along the sea-coast are a mixture of different nations: a great proportion consists of Moors and Morescos driven out of Catalonia, Arragon, and other parts of Spain. Here are also great numbers of Turks, who come from the Levant to seek their fortune; and till lately there were multitudes of Jews and Christians, taken by piracy, brought hither and sold as slaves. The Berbers are the most ancient inhabitants of the country: they are dispersed all over Barbary, and divided into a multitude of tribes under their respective chiefs. Most of them inhabit the mountainous tracts; some range from place to place, and live in tents or portable huts; others in scattered villages. They have nevertheless kept themselves for the most part unmixed with other nations. Many of the Berbers are rich, well clothed, and carry on a large traffic in cattle, hides, wax, honey, iron, and other commodities. They have also some artificers in iron, and some manufacturers of cloth. But the most numerous inhabitants are the Moors and Arabians. The former are very stout and warlike, and skilful in horsemanship, but so addicted to robbery, that one cannot safely travel through the country at a distance from the towns without a guard, or at least a marabout or saint, for a protector; tor as they look upon themselves to be the original proprietors of the country, and not only as dispossessed by the rest of the inhabitants, but reduced by them to the lowest state of poverty, they make no scruple to plunder all they meet, by way of reprisal. The inhabitants in general have a pretty fair complexion; they are robust and well proportioned. People of distinction wear the beard; they have rich clothes made of silk, embroidered with flowers of gold, and turbans enriched with jewels. The Turks, who compose the military force, have great privileges, pay no taxes, are never punished in public, and rarely in private. I he lowest soldier domineers over the most distinguished Moors at pleasure. If he finds them better mounted than himself, he exchanges horses without ceremony. 1he Turks alone have the privilege of carrying fire-arms. M an y good qualities, however, distinguish them, in spite of this excess of despotism. They never game, and never profane the name of the Deity. They soon forget their private quarrels; and after the first paroxysm of resentment is over, it is infamy for a Turk to keep in remembrance the injuries he has received.

The climate of Algiers is in most places so temperate that a constant verdure is maintained, the leaves of the trees being neither parched by heat in summer, nor nipped by the winter’s cold. They begin to bud in February; in April the fruit attains its full size, and is commonly ripe in May. The soil, however, is excessively various; some places being very hot, dry, and barren; on which account they are generally suffered to lie uncultivated by the inhabitants, who are very indolent. These barren places, especially those in the south, and at a distance from the sea, harbour vast numbers of wild animals, as lions, tigers, buffaloes, wild boars, stags, porcupines, monkeys, ostriches, &c. On account of their barrenness they have but few towns, and those thinly peopled; though some of them are advantageously situated for trading with Biledulgerid and Negroland, and drive a considerable traffic with those countries.

The most considerable rivers of Algiers are the Shel-liff, which passes through Lake Titterie, and falls into the sea at Mostagan; the Ziz, which crosses the province of Tremecen; the Mina, which falls into the sea near Ar-zew; and the Hued-al-quivir, which forms a good harbour near Bujeiah.

The Algerine kingdom made formerly a considerable part of the Mauritania Tingitana, which was reduced to a Roman province by Julius Caesar, and from him also called Mauritania Coesariensis. The Romans were driven out of that continent by the Vandals; these by Belisarius, the Greek emperor Justinian’s general; and the Greeks in their turn by the Saracens. This last revolution happened about the middle of the seventh century; and the Arabs continued masters of the country, divided into a great number of petty kingdoms or states, under chiefs of their own choosing, till the year 1051. In this year one Abubeker-ben-Omar, or, as the Spanish authors call him, Abu-Texefien, an Arab of the Zinhagian tribe, gathered, by the help of his marabouts or saints, a most powerful army of malcontents, in the southern provinces of Numidia and Libya. His followers were named Ma-rabites or Morabites, by the Spaniards Almoravides, probably from their being assembled principally by the saints, who were also called Morabites. The caliph’s forces were at this time employed in quelling other revolts in Syria, Mesopotamia, &c.; and the Arabs in Spain were engaged in the most bloody wars; so that Texefien having nothing to fear from them, had all the success he could wish against the Arabian sheikhs or petty tyrants, whom he defeated in many battles, and at last drove them not only out of Numidia and Libya, but out of all the western districts, reducing the whole province of Tingitania under his dominion.

Texefien was succeeded by his son Yusef or Joseph, a brave and warlike prince. He founded the city of Morocco; and engaging in war with the Zeneti, a powerful tribe who inhabited Tremecen, defeated them in repeated engagements, and finally almost exterminated them. He then extended his conquests over almost all Barbary.

Thus was founded the empire of the Morabites, which, however, was of no long duration, that race being in the twelfth century driven out by Mohavedin, a marabout. This race of priests was expelled by Abdulac, governor of Fez; and he in the thirteenth century was stripped of his new conquests by the sherifs of Hascen, the descendants of those Arabian princes whom Abu-Texefien had formerly expelled.
[7:2:504]

The better to secure their new dominions, the sherifs divided them into several little kingdoms or provinces; and among the rest, the present kingdom of Algiers was divided into four, namely, Tremecen, Tenez, Algiers Proper, and Bujeiah. The first four princes laid so good a foundation for a lasting balance of power between their little kingdoms, that they continued for some centuries in mutual peace and amity; but at length the king of Tremecen having ventured to violate some of their articles, Abul-Farez, king of Tenez, declared war against him, and obliged him to become his tributary. This king dying soon after, and having divided his kingdom among his three sons, new discords arose, which Spain taking advantage of, sent a powerful fleet and army against Barbary, under the count of Navarre, in 1505. This commander soon made himself master of the important cities of Oran, Bujeiah, and some others. Finally, he landed a number of forces near Algiers, and obliged that metropolis to become tributary to Spain.

To this galling yoke the Algerines were obliged to submit till the year 1516, when, hearing of the death of Ferdinand, king of Spain, they sent an embassy to Aruch Barbarossa, who was at that time no less dreaded for his valour than for his surprising success, and was then sent on a cruise with a squadron of galleys and barks. The purport of the embassy was, that he should come and free them from the Spanish yoke; for which they agreed to pay him a gratuity answerable to so great a service. Upon this Barbarossa immediately dispatched 18 galleys and 30 barks to the assistance of the Algerines, while he himself advanced towards the city with 800 Turks, 3000 Jigelites, and 2000 Moorish volunteers. Instead of taking the nearest road to Algiers, he directed his course towards Shershel, where Hassan, another famed corsair, had established himself. Him he surprised, and obliged to surrender, not without a previous promise of friendship; but no sooner had Barbarossa got him in his power, than he beheaded him, and obliged all Hassan’s Turkish adherents to follow him in his new expedition.

On Barbarossa’s approach to Algiers, he was welcomed by all the people of that metropolis, who looked for deliverance from this daring bandit, whom they accounted invincible. Elated beyond measure with this kind reception, Barbarossa formed a design of becoming king of Algiers; and fearing Some opposition from the inhabitants, on account of the excesses he suffered his soldiers to commit, he murdered their prince Eutemi, and caused himself to be proclaimed king; his Turks and Moors crying out as he rode along the streets, “Long live King Aruch Barbarossa, the invincible king of Algiers, the chosen of God to deliver the people from the oppression of the Christians; and destruction to all that shall oppose or refuse to own him as their lawful sovereign.” These threatening words so intimidated the inhabitants, already apprehensive of a general massacre, that he was immediately acknowledged as king.

Barbarossa was no sooner seated on the throne, than he treated his subjects with such cruelty, that they used to shut up their houses and hide themselves when he appeared in public. In consequence of this, a plot was soon formed against him; but having discovered it, he caused twenty of the principal conspirators to be beheaded, and their bodies to be buried in a dunghill, and laid a heavy fine on those who survived. This so terrified the Algerines, that they never afterwards durst attempt any thing against either Barbarossa or his successors.

In the mean time the son of Prince Eutemi, having fled to Oran, and put himself under the protection of the marquis of Gomarez, laid before that nobleman a plan for put ting the city of Algiers into the hands of the king of Spain. Cardinal Ximenes, having approved of it, sent a ' fleet with 10,000 land forces, under the command of Don Francisco, or, as others call him, Don Diego de Vera to drive out the Turks, and restore the young prince; but the fleet no sooner came within sight of land than it was dispersed by a storm, and the greater part of the ships dashed against the rocks. Most of the Spaniards were drowned, and the few who escaped to the shore were either killed by the Turks or made slaves.

Though Barbarossa had nothing to boast on this occasion, his pride and insolence had now risen to such a pitch, that he imagined himself invincible. He found little difficulty in conquering the kingdoms of Tenez and Tremecen. Abuchen Men, however, the exiled sovereign of Tremecen, had recourse to Charles V. then lately arrived in Spain with a powerful fleet and army. That monarch immediately ordered the young king a succour of 10,000 men, under the command of the governor of Oran, who, under the guidance of Abuchen Men, began his march towards Tremecen; and in their way they were joined by Prince Selim, with a great number of Arabs and Moors. The tyrant kept close in his capital, being embarrassed by his fears of a revolt, and the politic delays of the king of Fez, who had not sent the auxiliaries he promised. Being now informed that Abuchen Men and his Arabs, accompanied by the Spaniards, were in full march to lay siege to Tremecen, he thought proper to come out at the head of 1500 Turks and 5000 Moorish horse, in order to break his way through the enemy; but he had not proceeded far from the city before his council advised him to return and fortify himself in it. This advice was now too late, the inhabitants being resolved to shut him out, and open their gates to their own lawful prince as soon as he appeared. In this distress Barbarossa saw no resource but to retire to the citadel. Here he defended himself vigorously; but his provisions failing, he took advantage of a subterraneous path, which he had caused to be dug, and, taking his immense treasure with him, stole away as secretly as possible. His flight, however, was soon discovered; and he was so closely pursued, that to amuse, as he hoped, the enemy, he caused a great part of his money, plate, jewels, &c. to be scattered on the way, thinking they would delay their pursuit in gathering it up. This stratagem, however, failed through the vigilance of the Spanish commander, who being himself at the head of the pursuers, obliged them to march on, till he came up close to him on the banks of the Huexda, about eight leagues from Tremecen. Barbarossa had just crossed the river with his vanguard, when the Spaniards came up with his rear on the other side, and cut them all off; and then crossing the water, overtook him at a small distance from it. Here a bloody engagement ensued, in which the Turks fought like lions; but being at length overpowered by numbers, they were all cut in pieces, and Barbarossa among the rest, in the 44th year of his age, and four years after he had raised himself to the royal tide of Jigel.

The news of Barbarossa’s death spread the utmost consternation among the Turks at Algiers; however, they caused his brother Hayradin to be immediately proclaimed king. The Spanish commander now sent back the emperor’s forces, without making any attempt upon Algiers, by which he lost the opportunity of driving the Turks out of that country; while Hayradin, justly dreading the consequences of the tyranny of his officers, sought the protection of the grand signior. This was readily granted, and he himself appointed bashaw or viceroy of Algiers; by which means he received such considerable reinforcements, [7:2:505]that the unhappy Algerines could attempt no resistance; and such numbers of Turks resorted to him, that he. was able not only to keep the Moors and Arabs in subjection at home, but to annoy the Christians at sea.

Hayradin next undertook to build a strong mole for the protection of his ships. In this he employed 30,000 Christian slaves, whom he obliged to labour without intermission for three years, in which time the work was completed. Hayradin soon became dreaded, not only by the Arabs and Moors, but also by the maritime Christian powers, especially the Spaniards. The viceroy failed not to acquaint the grand signior with his success, and obtained from him a fresh supply of money, by which he was enabled to build a strong fort, and to erect batteries on all places that might favour the landing of an enemy. All these have since received greater improvements from time to time.

In the mean time the sultan, either out of a sense of the great services Hayradin had rendered, or perhaps out of jealousy lest he should make himself independent, raised him to the dignity of bashaw of the empire, and appointed Hassan Aga, a Sardinian renegado, an intrepid warrior, and an experienced officer, to succeed him as bashaw of Algiers. Hassan had no sooner taken possession of his new government, than he began to pursue his ravages on the Spanish coast with greater fury than ever, extending them to the Ecclesiastical State, and other parts of Italy. Pope Paul III. exhorted the emperor Charles V. to send a powerful fleet to suppress these frequent and cruel piracies; and, that nothing might be wanting to render the enterprise successful, a bull was published by his holiness, in which a plenary absolution of sins, and the crown of martyrdom, were promised to all those who either fell in battle or were made slaves. The emperor accordingly set sail at the head of a powerful fleet, consisting of 120 ships and 20 galleys, having on board 30,000 chosen troops, and an immense quantity of money, arms, ammunition, &c. In this expedition many young noblemen and gentlemen attended as volunteers, and among these many knights of Malta, so remarkable for their valour against the enemies of Christianity. Even ladies of birth and character attended Charles in his expedition; and the wives and daughters of the officers and soldiers followed them with a design to settle in Barbary after the conquest should be completed.· The expedition meeting with a favourable wind, soon appeared before Algiers; every ship displaying the Spanish colours on the stern, and another at the head, with a crucifix to serve for a pilot.

By this prodigious armament the Algerines were thrown into the utmost consternation. The city was surrounded only by a wall, with scarcely any outworks. The whole garrison consisted of 800 Turks and 6000 Moors, without firearms, and poorly disciplined and accoutred; the rest of their forces being dispersed in the other provinces of the kingdom, to levy the usual tribute on the Arabs and Moors. The Spaniards landed without opposition, and immediately built a fort, under the cannon of which they encamped, and diverted the course of a spring which supplied the city with water. Being now reduced to the utmost distress, Hassan received a summons to surrender at discretion, on pain of being put to the sword with all the garrison.. He was on the point of surrendering the city, when advice was brought to him that the forces belonging to the western government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was resolved to defend it to the utmost. Charles, in the mean time, resolving upon a general assault, kept up a constant firing upon the town; which, from the weak defence made by the garrison, he looked upon as already in his hands. But while the douwan, or Algerine senate, were deliberating on the most proper means of obtaining an honourable capitulation, a mad prophet, attended by a multitude of people, entered the assembly, and foretold the speedy destruction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhorting the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was soon accomplished in a very surprising and unexpected manner; for on the 28th of October 1541 a dreadful storm of wind, rain, and hail, arose from the north, accompanied with violent shocks of earthquake, and a dismal and universal darkness both by sea and land; so that the sun, moon, and elements seemed to combine together for the destruction of the Spaniards. In that one night, some say in less than half an hour, 86 ships and 15 galleys were destroyed, with all their crews and military stores, by which the army on shore was deprived of all means of subsistence. Their camp also, which spread itself along the plain under the fort, was laid quite under water by the torrents which descended from the neighbouring hills. Many of the troops, in endeavouring to remove into some better situation, were cut in pieces by the Moors and Arabs; while several galleys and other vessels, seeking to gain some neighbouring creeks along the coasts, were immediately plundered, and their crews massacred, by the inhabitants.

The next morning Charles beheld the sea covered with the fragments of his numerous ships, and the bodies of men and horses floating on the waves. Seeing his affairs desperate, he abandoned his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, and marched in no small disorder towards Cape Malabux, in order to re-embark his troops in the few vessels which had survived the tempest. But Hassan, who had caused his motions to be watched, allowed him just time to get to the shore, when he sallied out and attacked the Spaniards in the midst of their confused and hasty embarkation, killing great numbers, and bringing away a still greater number of captives; after which he returned in triumph to Algiers, where he celebrated with great rejoicings his happy deliverance.

Charles having reached the port of Bujeiah, remained there no longer than till the 16th of November, when he set sail for Carthagena, which he reached on the 25th of the same month. In this unfortunate expedition upwards of 120 ships and galleys were lost, with above 300 colonels and other land and sea officers, 8000 soldiers and marines, besides those destroyed by the enemy on the re-embarkation, or drowned in the last storm. The number of prisoners was so great, that the Algerines sold some of them, by way of contempt, for an onion per head.

Hassan, elated with this victory, in which he had very little share, undertook an expedition against the king of Tremecen, who, being now deprived of the assistance of the Spaniards, was forced to procure a peace by paying a large sum of money, and becoming tributary to him. The bashaw returned to Algiers laden with riches, and soon after died of a fever, in the 66th year of his age.

From this time the Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines in any considerable degree. In 1555 they lost the city of Bujeiah, which was taken by Salha Rais, Hassan’s successor, who next year set out on a new expedition, which was suspected to be intended against Oran; but he had scarcely got four leagues from Algiers, when the plague, which at that time raged violently in the city, carried him off in 24 hours.

The dignity of bashaw passed through several hands, when it was occupied by Hassan, the son of Hayradin. Immediately on his arrival, he engaged in a war with the Arabs, by whom he was defeated with great loss. Next year the Spaniards undertook an expedition against [7:2:506]Mostagan, under the command of the count d’Alcandela; 'but were utterly defeated, the commander himself killed, and 12,000 men taken prisoners.

Hassan engaged in the siege of Marsalquiver, situated near the city Oran, which he designed to invest immediately after. The army employed in tl>is siege consisted of 26,000 foot and 10,000 horse, besides which he had a fleet consisting of 32 galleys and galliots, together with three French vessels laden with biscuit, oil, and other provisions. The city was defended by Don Martin de Cordova, brother of the count d’Alcandela, who had been taken prisoner in the battle where that nobleman was killed, but had obtained his liberty from the Algerines with immense sums, and now made a most gallant defence against the Turks. The city was attacked with the utmost fury by sea and land, so that several breaches were made in the walls. The Turkish standards were several times planted on the walls, and as often dislodged; but the place must have in the end submitted, had not Hassan been obliged to raise the siege in haste, on the news that the famed Genoese admiral Doria was approaching with considerable succours from Italy.

In 1567 Hassan was recalled to Constantinople, where he died three years after. He was succeeded by Mahomet, who gained the love of the Algerines by several public-spirited actions. He incorporated the janizaries and Levantine Turks together, and by that means put an end to their dissensions, which paved the way for making Algiers independent on the Porte. He likewise added some considerable fortifications to the city and castle, which he designed to render impregnable. At this time one John Gascon, a bold Spanish adventurer, formed a design of surprising the whole piratical navy in the bay, and setting them on fire in the night-time. For this he had not only the permission of King Philip IL, but was furnished by him with proper vessels, mariners, and fireworks, for the execution of his plot. He came accordingly, unperceived by any, to the very molc-gate, and dispersed his men with their fire-works; but, to their great surprise, they found these so ill mixed, that all their art could not make them take fire. In the mean time Gascon took it into his head, by way of bravado, to go to the mole-gate, and give three loud knocks with the pommel of his dagger. This he had the good fortune to do without meeting with any disturbance or opposition; but it was not so with his men; for on finding their endeavours unsuccessful, they made such a noise as quickly alarmed the guard posted on the adjacent bastion, from which the alarm quickly spread through the whole garrison. Gascon now finding himself in the utmost danger, sailed off with all possible haste; but he was pursued, overtaken, and brought back a prisoner to Mahomet, who no sooner got him into his power than he immediately caused a gibbet of considerable height to be erected on the spot where Gascon had landed, ordering him to be hoisted up, and hung by the feet to a hook, so that he died in exquisite torture.

Mahomet, being soon after recalled, was succeeded by the renegado Ochali, who reduced the kingdom of Tunis, which, however, remained subject to the viceroy of Algiers only till the year 1586, when a bashaw of Tunis was appointed by the Porte.

The kingdom of Algiers continued to be governed, till the beginning of the 17th century, by viceroys or bashaws appointed by the Porte, whose avarice and tyranny were intolerable both to the Algerines and the Turks themselves. At last the Turkish janizaries and militia became powerful enough to depose these petty tyrants, and set up officers of their own. They sent a deputation of some of their chief members to the Porte, to complain of the avarice and oppression of these bashaws, and represent' how much more honourable, as well as more economical, it would be for the grand signior to permit them to choose from among themselves their own dey or governor, whose interest it would be to see that the revenue of the kingdom was duly employed in keeping up its forces complete, and in supplying all other exigencies of the state, without any further charge or trouble to the Porte than that of allowing them its protection. On their part, they engaged always to acknowledge the grand signior as their sovereign, to pay him their usual allegiance and tribute, to respect his bashaws, and to lodge and maintain them and their retinue. All concerns which related to the government of Algiers were to be left under the direction of the dey and his douwan.

These proposals having been accepted by the Porte, the deputies returned highly satisfied; and having notified their new privileges, the great douwan immediately proceeded to the election of a dey from among themselves. Altercations, however, frequently happened between the bashaws and deys, the one endeavouring to recover their former power, and the other to reduce it.

In the year 1601 the Spaniards, under the command of Doria, the Genoese admiral, made another attempt upon Algiers, in which they were more fortunate than usual, their fleet being only driven back by contrary winds, so that they came off without loss. In 1609 the Moors, being expelled from Spain, flocked in great numbers to Algiers; and as many of them were very able sailors, they undoubtedly contributed to raise the Algerine fleet to that formidable condition which it soon after reached; though it is probable the frequent attempts made on their city would also induce them to increase their fleet. In 1616 it consisted of 40 sail of ships between 200 and 400 tons, their flag-ship having 500 tons. It was divided into two squadrons, one of 18 sail, stationed before the port of Malaga, and the other at the cape of Santa Maria, between Lisbon and Seville, both of which attacked all Christian ships, both EngIísh and French, with whom they pretended to be in friendship, as well as Spaniards and Portuguese, with whom they were at war.

The Algerines were now become very formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards, who were most in danger, and least able to cope with them, solicited the assistance of England and other states, and of the pope. The French, however, were the first who dared to show their resentment of these outrages; and in 1617 Μ. Beaulieu was sent against the Algerines with a fleet of 50 men of war, who defeated their fleet and took two of their vessels, while their admiral sunk his own ship and crew rather than fall into his enemies’ hands.

In 1620 a squadron of English men of war was sent against Algiers, under the conduct of Sir Robert Mansel; but of this expedition we have no other account than that it returned without effecting any thing; and the Algerines, becoming more and more insolent, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only excepted, to whom, in 1625, they sent a proposal directed to the prince of Orange, that in case they would fit out 20 sail of ships the following year, upon any good service against the Spaniards, they would join them with 60 sail of their own.

The next year the Coulolies or Cologlies (the children of such Turks as had been permitted to marry at Algiers), who were enrolled in the militia, having seized on the citadel, had nearly made themselves masters of the city, but were attacked by the Turks and renegadoes, who defeated them with terrible slaughter. Many of them were put to death, and their heads thrown in heaps [7:2:507]upon the city-walls, without the eastern gate. Part of the citadel was blown up; and the remaining Coulolies were dismissed from the militia, to which they were not again admitted till long after.

In the year 1623 Algiers and the other states of Barbary threw off altogether their dependence on the Porte. No sooner was this resolution taken, than the Algerines began to make prizes of several merchant ships belonging to powers at peace with the Porte. Having seized a Dutch ship and polacre at Scanderoon, they ventured on shore; and finding the town abandoned by the Turkish aga and inhabitants, they plundered all the magazines and warehouses, and set them on fire. About this time Louis XIII. undertook to build a fort on their coasts, in the room of one formerly built by the Marsilians, which they had demolished. This, after some difficulty, he accomplished, and it was called the Bastion of France ; but the situation being afterwards found inconvenient, the French purchased the port of La Calle, and obtained liberty to trade with the Arabians and Moors. The Ottoman court, in the mean time, was so much embarrassed with the Persian war, that there was no leisure to check the Algerine piracies. This gave an opportunity to the vizier and other courtiers to compound with the Algerines, and to share their prizes, which were very considerable. However, for form’s sake, a severe reprimand, accompanied with threats, was sent them; to which they replied, that “these depredations deserved to be indulged to them, seeing they were the only bulwark against the Christian powers, especially against the Spaniards, the sworn enemies of the Moslem name adding, that “if they should pay a punctilious regard to all that could purchase peace, or liberty to trade with the Ottoman empire, they would have nothing to do but set fire to all their shipping, and turn camel-drivers for a livelihood.”

In the year 1635 four younger brothers of a good family in France entered into an undertaking so desperate, that perhaps the annals of knight-errantry can scarcely furnish its equal. This was no less than to retort the piracies of the Algerines upon themselves, and this with a small frigate of ten guns! In this ridiculous undertaking 100 volunteers embarked: a Maltese commission was procured, together with an able master and 36 mariners. They had the good fortune, on their first setting out, to take a ship laden with wine on the Spanish coast, with which they were so much elated, that three days after they madly encountered two large Algerine corsairs, one of 20 and the other of 24 guns, both well manned, and commanded by able officers. These vessels attacked the frigate so furiously that she soon lost her main-mast; notwithstanding which, the French made so desperate a resistance, that the pirates were not able to take them, till the noise of their fire brought up five more Algerines, when the French vessel, being almost torn in pieces, was boarded and taken. The young knights-errant were punished for their temerity by a dreadful captivity, from which they redeemed themselves in 1642 at the price of 6000 dollars.

4he Algerines prosecuted their piracies with impunity, to the terror and disgrace of the Europeans, till the year 1652, when a French fleet being accidentally driven to Algiers, the admiral took it into his head to demand a release of all the captives of his nation, without exception. This being refused, the Frenchman without ceremony carried off the Turkish viceroy, and his cadi or judge, who had just arrived from the Porte, with all their equipage and retinue. The Algerines, by way of reprisal, surprised the Bastion of France already mentioned, and carried off the inhabitants to the number of 600, with all their effects; which so provoked the admiral, that he sent them word that he would pay them another visit the next year with his whole fleet.

The Algerines, undismayed by the threats of the French admiral, fitted out a fleet of 16 galleys and galliots, well manned and equipped, under the command of Admiral Hali Pinchinin. The chief design of this armament was to capture the treasure of Loretto, which, however, they were prevented by contrary winds from reaching. They then made a descent on Puglia, in the kingdom of Naples, where they ravaged the whole territory of Necotra, carrying off a vast number of captives. Thence steering towards Dalmatia, they scoured the Adriatic; and, having collected immense plunder, left these coasts in the utmost consternation and resentment.

At last the Venetians, alarmed at such terrible depredations, equipped a fleet of 28 sail, under the command of Admiral Capello, with express orders to burn, sink, or take, all the Barbary corsairs he should meet. An engagement ensued, in which the Algerines were defeated, and five of their vessels disabled, with the loss of 1500 men, Turks and Christian slaves, besides 1600 galley-slaves who regained their liberty. Pinchinin, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where he was again watched by Capello; but the latter had not lain long at his old anchorage before he received a letter from the senate, desiring him to make no further attempt on the pirates at that time, for fear of a rupture with the r Porte. The brave Venetian was forced to comply; but resolving to take such a leave of the Algerines as he thought they deserved, attacked them with such bravery, that, without any great loss, his men towed out their 16 galleys, with all their cannon, stores, &c. To conceal this, Capello was ordered to sink all the Algerine ships he had taken, except the admiral’s, which was to be conducted to Venice, and laid up as a trophy. Capello came off with a severe reprimand; but the Venetians were obliged to purchase, with 500,000 ducats, a peace from the Porte.

The news of ihis defeat and loss filled Algiers with the utmost grief and confusion. The whole city was on the point of a general insurrection, when the bashaw and douwan issued a proclamation, forbidding complaints and outcries, under the severest penalties. In the mean time they applied to the Porte for an order that the Venetians settled in the Levant should make up their loss. But with this the grand signior refused to comply, and left them to repair their losses, as well as build new ships, in the best manner they could.

Our pirates did not long continue in their weak and defenceless state; being able, at the end of two years, to appear at sea with a fleet of 65 sail. Admiral Pinchinin equipped four galliots at his own expense, with which, in conjunction with the chiayah, or secretary of the bashaw of Tripoli, he made a second excursion. This small squadron, consisting of five galleys and two brigantines, fell in with an English ship of 40 guns, which, however, Pinchinin’s captains refused to engage; but being afterwards reproached by him for their cowardice, they swore to attack the next Christian ship that should come in their way. This happened to be a Dutch merchantman of 28 guns, which, however, beat them off with great loss. But though Pinchinin thus returned in disgrace, the rest of the fleet quickly returned with vast numbers of slaves, and an immense quantity of rich spoils; insomuch that the English, French, and Dutch, were obliged to court the mighty Algerines, who sometimes vouchsafed to be at peace with them, but swore eternal war against Spain, Portugal, and Italy, whom they looked upon as the greatest enemies to the Mahometan name. At last [7:2:508]Louis XIV., provoked by the grievous outrages committed by the Algerines on the coasts of Provence and Languedoc, ordered, in 1681, a considerable fleet to be fitted out against them, under the marquis du Quesnc, vice-admiral of France. His first expedition was against a number of Tripolitan corsairs, who had the good fortune to escape him, and shelter themselves in the island of Scio, belonging to the Turks. This did not, however, prevent him from pursuing them thither, and making such a terrible fire upon them as quickly destroyed fourteen of their vessels, besides battering the walls of the castle.

This severity seemed only to be designed as a check to the piracies of the Algerines; but, finding they still continued their outrages on the French coast, he sailed to ‘ Algiers in August 1682, cannonading and bombarding it so furiously, that the whole town was in flames in a very short time. The great mosque was battered down, and most of the houses laid in ruins, insomuch that the inhabitants were on the point of abandoning the place; when on a sudden the wind changed, and obliged Du Quesne to return to Toulon. The Algerines immediately made reprisals, by sending a number of galleys and galliots to the coast of Provence, where they committed the most dreadful ravages, and brought away a vast number of captives; upon which a new armament was ordered to be prepared at Toulon and Marseilles against the next year; and the Algerines, having received timely notice, put themselves in as good a state of defence as the time would allow.

In May 1683, Du Quesne, with his squadron, cast anchor before Algiers; where, being joined by the marquis d’Aftranville at the head of five stout vessels, he resolved to bombard the town next day. Accordingly, 100 bombs were thrown into it the first day, which did terrible execution; while the besieged made some hundred discharges of their cannon without doing any considerable damage. The following nights the bombs were again thrown into the city in such numbers, that the dey’s palace and other great edifices were almost destroyed; some of their batteries were dismounted, and several vessels sunk in the port. The dey and Turkish bashaw, as well as the whole soldiery, alarmed at this dreadful devastation, sued for peace. As a preliminary, the immediate surrender of all Christian captives who had been taken fighting under the French flag was demanded; which being granted, 142 of them were immediately delivered up, with a promise of sending the remainder as soon as they could be got from the different quarters of the country. Accordingly Du Quesne sent his commissary-general, and one of his engineers, into the town; but with express orders to insist upon the delivery of all the French captives without exception, together with the effects taken from the French; and that Mezo-morto, the admiral, and Hali Rais, one of their captains, should be given as hostages.

This last demand having embarrassed the dey, he assembled the douwan, and acquainted them with it; upon which Mezomorto broke out into a violent passion, and told the assembly that the cowardice of those who sat at the helm had occasioned the ruin of Algiers; but that, for his part, he would never consent to deliver up any thing that had been taken from the French. He immediately acquainted the soldiery with what had passed; which so exasperated them, that they murdered the dey that very night, and next day chose Mezomorto in his place. The new dey immediately cancelled all the articles of peace, and hostilities were renewed with greater fury than ever.

The French admiral now kept pouring in such volleys of bombs, that in less than three days the greater part of the city was reduced to ashes; and the fire burnt with such vehemence, that the sea was illumined by it for more than two leagues around. Mezomorto, unmoved at all these disasters, and the vast number of the slain, whose blood ran in rivulets along the streets, or rather growing furious and desperate, sought only revenge; and, not content with causing all the French in the city to be cruelly murdered, ordered their consul to be tied hand and foot, and fastened alive to the mouth of a mortar whence he was shot away. By this piece of inhumanity Du Quesne was so exasperated, that he did not leave Algiers till he had utterly destroyed their fortifications, shipping, almost all the lower, and above two-thirds of the upper part of the city, by which means it became little else than a heap of ruins.

The haughty Algerines were now thoroughly convinced that they were not invincible; they therefore immediately sent an embassy into France, begging in the most abject terms for peace, which Louis immediately granted, to their inexpressible joy. They now began to pay some regard to other nations, and to be a little cautious how they wantonly incurred their displeasure. The first bombardment by the French had so far humbled the Algerines, that they condescended to enter into a treaty with England, which was renewed upon terms very advantageous to the latter in 1686. It is not to be supposed, however, that the rooted perfidy of the Algerines would at once disappear. Notwithstanding this treaty, they lost no opportunity of making prizes of the English snips which they could conveniently reach. Upon some outrage of this kind, Captain Beach drove ashore and burnt seven of their frigates in 1695, which produced a renewal of the treaty five years after; but it was not till the taking of Gibraltar and Port Mahon that Britain could have a sufficient check upon them to enforce the observation of treaties, and they have since paid a greater deference to the English than to any other European power.

The eighteenth century furnishes no very remarkable events with regard to Algiers, except the taking of the city of Oran from the Spaniards in 1708 (which, however, they regained in 1737), and the expulsion of the Turkish bashaw, and uniting his office to that of dey, in 1710. This introduced the form of government which still continues in Algiers.

The dey is now absolute monarch, and transmits to the Porte only some annual presents. His own income probably rises and falls according to the opportunities he has of fleecing both natives and foreigners; whence it is variously computed by different authors. Dr Shaw computed the taxes of the whole kingdom to bring into the treasury no more than 300,000 dollars; but he supposed that the eighth part of the prizes, the effects of those persons who die without children, joined to the yearly contributions raised by the government, presents from foreigners, fines and oppressions, may bring in about as much more· Both the dey and officers under him enrich themselves by the same methods of rapine and fraud.

The first deys were elected by the militia, who were then called the douwan i or common council. This elective body was at first composed of 800 militia officers, without whose consent the dey could do nothing; and upon some urgent occasions all the officers residing in Algiers, amounting to above 1500, were summoned to assist. But since the deys have become more powerful, the douwan is principally composed of thirty chiah bashaws or colonels, with the mufti and cadi upon some emergencies; and on the election of a dey, the whole soldiery are allowed to give their votes. All the regulations of state ought to be determined by that assembly before they [7:2:509]pass into a law, or the dey has power to put them in execution: but for many years back the douwan has been of little account, and has been only convened for form’s sake, to give assent to what the dey and his chief favourites have previously concerted. The method of gathering the votes in this august assembly is perfectly agreeable to the character of those who compose it. The aga or general of the janizaries, or the president pro tempore, first proposes the question, which is immediately repeated with a loud voice by the chiah bashaws, and from them eehoed again by officers called bashaidalas. From these the question is repeated from one member of the douwan to another, with strange contortions and the most hideous growlings if it does not meet their approbation. These assemblies seldom end without some tumult or disorder. As the whole body of the militia is coneemed in the election of a new dey, it is seldom carried on without blows and bloodshed; but when once the choice is made, the person elected is saluted with the words Alla Barick, “God bless and prosper you;” and the new dey usually causes all the officers of the douwan who had opposed his election to be strangled, filling up their places with those who had been most zealous in promoting it. From this account of the election of the deys, it cannot be expected that their government should be at all secure. As they arrive at the throne by tumult, disorder, and bloodshed, they are generally deprived of it by the same means, scarcely one in ten having the good fortune to die a natural death.

The officer next in power to the dey is the aga of the janizaries, who is one of the oldest officers in the army, and holds his post only for two months. He is then succeeded by the chiah, or next senior officer. During the two months in which the aga enjoys his dignity, the keys of the metropolis are in his hands, all military orders are issued out in his name, and the sentence of the dey upon any offending soldier, whether capital or not, can only be executed in the court of his palace. As soon as he has gone through this short office, he is considered as mazoul, or superannuated; receives his pay regularly, like the rest of the militia, every two months; is exempted from all further duties, except when called by the dey to assist at the grand council, which he has, however, a right to attend at all times, though he has no longer a vote.

The religion of the Algerines is chiefly distinguished from that of the Turks by a greater variety of superstitious rites. The Koran is their acknowledged rule of faith and practice; but they are not very scrupulous in the observance of it. The mufti or high-priest, the cadi or chief judge, and the grand marabout, are the three principal officers who preside in matters of religion.

The corsairs or pirates form a number of small republics, of each of which the rais or captain is the supreme bashaw, who, and the officers under him, compose a kind of douwan, in which every question relating to the vessel is decided. These eorsairs carry on likewise the commerce of Algiers, importing whatever commodities are brought into the kingdom, either by way of merchandise or prizes. These consist chiefly of gold and silver stuffs, damasks, cloths, spices, tin, iron, plated brass, lead, quicksilver, cordage, sail-eloth, bullets, cochineal, linen, tartar, alum, rice, sugar, soa P> cotton raw and spun, copperas, aloes, brazil and logwood, vermilion, &c. Very few commodities, however, are exported from this part of the world; the oil, wax, hides, pulse, and corn produced, being but barely sufficient to supply the country; though before the loss of Oran the merchants have been known to ship off from one or other of the ports of Barbary several thousand tons of corn. The consumption of oil, though produced in great abundance, is internally so considerable, that it is seldom permitted to be exported to Europe. The other exports consist chiefly in ostrich feathers, copper, rugs, silk sashes, embroidered handkerchiefs, dates, and Christian slaves. Some manufactures in silk, cotton, wool, leather, &c. are carried on in this Country, but mostly by the Spaniards settled there, especially about the metropolis. Carpets are also a manufacture of the country; and, though much inferior to those of Turkey both in beauty and fineness, are preferred by the people on account of their being both cheaper and softer. There are also at Algiers looms for velvet, taffetas, and other wrought silks; and a coarse sort of linen is likewise made in most parts of the kingdom. The country furnishes no materials for ship-building. They have neither ropes, tar, sails, anchors, nor even iron. When they can procure enough of new wood to form the main timbers of a ship, they supply the rest from the materials of prizes which they have made, and thus produce new and swift-sailing vessels from the ruins of the old.

The population of Algiers cannot be ascertained with much accuracy; but the following estimate of its amount, and the classes into which it is divided, has just appeared in the Annales des Voyages: —

Moors and Arabs, husbandmen and artisans,... 1,200,000 Independent Arabs, 400,000

Berbers settled in villages, 200,000

Jews, 30,000

Turks and renegadoes composing the ruling power,,.20,000 Descendants of the above, but of an inferior class,..20,000

1,870,000

The Barbary corsairs, in the course of the eighteenth century, had ceased to exercise their vocation on the same extended scale*as formerly. Their strength, in consequence of the vast increase in the naval power of the great European states, had been reduced to comparative insignificance. They no longer domineered over the high seas, nor attempted to annoy the vessels belonging to any of the great powers; nor did the latter any longer deign to purchase immunity by a disgraceful tribute. Yet there were still within the circle of the Mediterranean several populous and wealthy, yet feeble states, which lay an easy prey to their ravages. These were particularly the kingdoms of the Sicilies and Sardinia. Not content with capturing their vessels in the open sea, the corsairs made descents upon their shores, sweeping off not only property, but all persons of every age, sex, and rank, who could be valuable in the market as slaves. Europe, engrossed by the mightier evils in which it was involved during thirty years of war, bestowed comparatively little attention on this partial distress. At the Congress of Vienna, however, when the peace of the Continent appeared to be established on a permanent basis, the attention of the sovereigns was laudably drawn to every quarter from which it could suffer disturbance. That in question, by which numerous individuals, often of a respectable place in society, were torn from their homes, immured in dungeons, and exposed to every outrage which barbarous bigotry and brutal licence might prompt, could not fail to appear of the first magnitude. The Congress, having been unexpectedly broken up, did not come to any final decision. The subject, however, continued to be agitated in the councils of Britain, and her gallant officers who had been employed' in the Mediterranean strongly represented the propriety of interference. The Dutch, at the same time, her now friendly neighbours, cordially concurred in promoting this common interest of humanity.

The first step taken was to send squadrons under Lord Exmouth to Algiers, and Sir Thomas Maitland to Tunis, [7:2:510]with a demand for the general liberation of the slaves actually in bondage, and the entire discontinuance, for the future, of this detestable trade. Overawed by the immense power with which they knew these demands to be supported, they returned a conciliatory answer. They dismissed a number of slaves actually in the>r hands, and engaged that only the final sanction of the Porte should be wanting to abolish for ever the system of Christian slavery. The British commanders then returned to England with their fleets, which were immediately laid up.

Tunis, which had imbibed some portion of European humanity and civilisation, and was better aware of its real interests and position, adhered very tolerably to the terms stipulated. But Algiers, bred in rapine, furiously repelled a system which opened to its rovers the fearful prospect of being obliged to earn a subsistence by honest industry. So dreadful was the ferment, that a plan, it is said, had been formed to assassinate Lord Exmouth on his way to the ship. The dey, raised from the dregs of the soldiery, and sharing all their barbarism, allowed full scope to their violence, and sought only to secure himself against its effects. He formed alliances with the Porte, the emperor of Morocco, and other leading Mussulman potentates; he strengthened Algiers with new works, and prepared to brave the utmost fury of the Christian powers. Under these precautions, the system of Christian piracy was commenced with redoubled activity, to compensate for the late suspension, and to repair the loss of the slaves who had been given up. The Algerine soldiery, in their blind fury, had recourse to an outrage still more terrible. A number of vessels, belonging to Naples and other Mediterranean states, had been in the practice of assembling at Bona to carry on the pearl fishery, in which, upon payment of an annual tribute, they were protected by the Algerine state. Suddenly these peaceful and industrious fishermen were surrounded by a band of Moors, who commenced an indiscriminate massacre, which could not be justified on any ground or pretence, and seems to have had no object but to show their implacable hatred to the Christian name.

As soon as the tidings of this dreadful outrage arrived in England, they kindled at once a just indignation, and a determination to follow up to the utmost the measures projected against this common pest of the civilized world. Lord Exmouth’s fleet was re-equipped with almost incredible dispatch. Early in July 1816 he sailed with five ships of the line and eight smaller vessels, and arrived at Gibraltar in the beginning of. August, when he was joined by a Dutch fleet of six frigates under Admiral Capellen. Having remained at Gibraltar a short time, to make some necessary preparations, Lord Exmouth sent forward Captain Dashwood, of the Prometheus, to bring away, if possible, the consul and his family.. Captain Dashwood was strictly interrogated as to Lord Exmouth’s armament, of which the dey had received information from a French vessel, and from other quarters. He contrived to evade the questions; and, though he found it impossible to obtain the consul’s release, managed to bring off his wife and daughter, disguised in the uniform of naval officers. An attempt was also made to carry off his infant child in a basket, but it betrayed itself by its cries; however, the dey, with unusual humanity, allowed the child to follow its mother. The consul himself was thrown into close confinement. The dey, meantime, was exerting himself in the most extraordinary manner to put the place in a posture of defence. The batteries on the mole, and all other points commanding the harbour, were strengthened and enlarged; and armed men, to the number of forty thousand, were brought in from the surrounding country.

Lord Exmouth, being detained by calms and contrary winds, did not anchor in front of Algiers till the 26th, when he sent in a flag of truce under cover of the Severn gunbrig, with a peremptory demand of certain conditions, which, however, were extremely moderate. They consisted in the final abolition of Christian slavery—the immediate liberation of all slaves now within the territory of Algiers—the repayment of all ransoms obtained since the commencement of the year—the liberation of the consul and all British subjects now in confinement. On the Severn arriving in front of the mole, the captain of the port came out to meet the English, and invited them to enter the city. Salame, the interpreter, declined, but presented the conditions, demanding that an answer should be sent within an hour. The captain, not without some reason, replied that this was a period wholly inadequate to decide on so important a demand. Hereupon two or three hours were allowed; and two were declared by the captain to be sufficient. Meantime, a favourable breeze having sprung up, Lord Exmouth moved forward his ships to within a mile of the harbour, where he held himself ready for action. Salame waited three hours and a half, when no boat appearing from the land, he steered for the fleet, making signals of the failure of his mission; after which, steps were immediately taken for commencing operations.

Algiers was fortified in the strongest manner, and by all the resources of nature and art. The mole, considered a masterpiece of defensive architecture, was encircled by four batteries, respectively of 44, 48, 66, and 60 guns. All the range of steeps facing the sea, on which the city was built, were covered with batteries, which could keep up a united fire on an assailing fleet. Lord Exmouth, undismayed, bore up into the centre of this mighty line of defence, and placed the Queen Charlotte within fifty yards of the mole,—a bold and happy position, where her own fire was more effective than elsewhere, and many of the principal Turkish guns could not bear upon her. The other ships took their stations in line; while the Dutch squadron, which could not find room in front of the mole, was detached to the flanks, to occupy the fire of batteries which might otherwise have borne on the English. The fleets were placed in this formidable array, yet all was still silent, and the surrounding heights were crowded with spectators, who came as to a show. Lord Exmouth began to hope that the dey was yet to yield, when three shots were fired from the batteries. They were instantly returned, and a fire commenced, as animated and well supported as was ever witnessed. The British navy, pitched against these iron walls, underwent as hard and doubtful a struggle as it had ever maintained against the strongest array of hostile fleets. The atmosphere was filled with so thick a smoke, as to render it impossible for one ship to discern the position of another. About sunset Admiral Milne communicated that his vessel, the Impregnable, had lost 150 killed and wounded, and that he stood in urgent need of a frigate to divert some part of the fire now directed against them. Soon, however, the enemy’s efforts began to slacken; the principal batteries were successively silenced; ship after ship caught fire, till the flame spread over the whole fleet, and reached the arsenal; the harbour and bay were illumined by the mighty and united blaze. At ten o’clock, seven hours after the commencement of this hard combat, the destruction of the Algerine naval force was complete; but as some distant batteries still kept up a harassing fire, Lord Exmouth gave the signal to steer out into the bay, which was speedily accomplished.

Next morning Lord Exmouth, confident that the dey [7:2:511]was now sufficiently humbled, sent a letter, in which, after enumerating the heavy wrongs which had called forth this signal chastisement, he repeated the moderate terms already offered; adding, that in the event of their being now accepted, three guns should be fired as a signal. This letter was sent in the same boat as the day before, with instructions to wait three hours. As soon as the English boat was seen, another came out having on board the captain of a frigate, who received the letter, and intimated that there was no doubt of its terms being complied with; pretending even that, had a little longer time been allowed the day before, the conflict would have been unnecessary. Accordingly, in an hour and a half three shots were fired, and a boat immediately came out, on board of which were the captain of the port and the Swedish consul. All the demands were granted; and the dey in vain attempted, on various pretexts, to evade or delay their execution. The captives, to the number of 1083, were set at liberty; ransoms amounting to 383,500 dollars were repaid to Sicily and Sardinia; the consul was liberated, and received a compensation for the insults he had endured: in fine, a treaty was signed, by which the dcy bound himself to discontinue the practice of Christian slavery, and hereafter to treat prisoners of war according to the established practice of civilized nations.

In this desperate contest the English lost 128 killed and 690 wounded, the Dutch 13 killed and 52 wounded. Lord Exmouth received two slight hurts, and his clothes were cut with several balls. The enemy lost four frigates, five large corvettes, and 30 gun-boats. All their arsenals were consumed, and their principal batteries reduced to a state of ruin. The city also was greatly injured, Salame having counted no less than thirty shots which had passet! through the walls of the consul’s house.

The Algerines, notwithstanding this severe and merited chastisement, did not long adhere to sentiments of moderation. No time was lost and no effort spared to place the city in a more formidable,state of defence than ever; and they considered themselves again in a condition to set even the great powers at defiance. Annoyances were begun against the French trade; and the consul having made remonstrances on the subject, was grossly insulted. France then declared war, and sent a fleet against Algiers; but the fortifications on the sea-side were so strong, that for more than a year her ships could only prolong an ineffective blockade. At length war on a great scale was resolved on. A large fleet under Admiral Duperre, and a land force of upwards of 30,000 men under General Bourmont, then minister at war, sailed from Marseilles in the end of May 1830. After some delay in the bay of Palma in Majorca, this armament reached the coast of Africa, and the troops began to land on the morning of the 14th June, upon the western side of the peninsula of Sidi Ferruch, in the bay of Torre Chica. The disembarkation began at a quarter past four, and continued till twelve. The Algerines at first showed only flying parties of horse, which retreated before the fire of two steam-vessels. Afterwards they opened a somewhat brisk fire from several batteries, which having kept up for several hours, not without some loss on the part of the French, they retreated.

The army continued for some days landing their provisions and stores, with only slight annoyance from flying troops of cavalry. On the 19th, however, the Turkish troops m Algiers being reinforced by the contingents of the beys of Constantina, Oran, and Titterie, a general attack was made with a force of 40,000 or 50,000 men. They advanced, outflanking the French army, and charged with such impetuosity as to penetrate the line at several points. After a very obstinate conflict they were compelled to re treat, and their camp taken and plundered. The French admit a loss of 60 killed and 450 wounded; and the son of the commander-in-chief died of his wounds.

The Algerine troops renewed their attacks on the 24th and 25th, when, after hard combats, they were again repulsed. The French then advanced upon Algiers, on the 29th the trenches were opened, and at four in the morning of the 4th July the batteries began their fire, which was returned with much vigour. At ten the fort called Emperor, being no longer defensible, was blown up by the enemy, with a tremendous explosion. The French commander took possession of its ruins, where he received a flag of truce: before the close, of the day a treaty whs concluded for the entire surrender of Algiers; and next day, 5th July, the French flag waved on its forts. Twelve ships of war, 1500 brass cannon, and a large treasure, came into the hands of the conquerors. The Turkish troops were permitted to go wherever they pleased, provided they left Algiers; and the dey chose Naples for his place of retirement, while most of the soldiers desired to be landed in Asia Minor. The bey of Titterie submitted, but the French have not as yet (August 1830) made any attempt to penetrate into the interior.

Algiers, the capital of the above kingdom, is probably the ancient lcosium ; by the Arabians called Al-gezair, or rather Al-Jezier or Al-Jezerah, i. e. the island, because there was an island before the city, to which it has since been joined by a mole. It is built of white stone, on the declivity of a hill fronting the sea, in the form of an amphitheatre, and from the sea resembles a ship under sail. The houses rise above each other in such a manner that each from its flat roof commands a view of the sea. The streets are so narrow as scarcely to admit two persons to walk abreast. There is no good water in the city; and though there is a tank or cistern in every house, yet a want of water is often felt, because it rains but seldom. The chief supply is from a spring on a hill, the water of which is conveyed by pipes to above a hundred fountains. The dcy’s palace and the seraglio form the finest buildings, and are curiously adorned with marble pillars. The houses are square, and built of stone and brick, with a square court in the middle, and galleries all around. There are said to be about 80,000 inhabitants in the city, comprehending 5000 Jewish families, besides Christians. The armed Turks amounted to above 6000, who, with the Moorish troops, raised the garrison to 14,000 or 15,000 men, 2000 of whom were cavalry. Without the city there is a great number of sepulchres, as also cells or chapels dedicated to marabouts or reputed saints. Long. 3. 30. E. Lat. 36. 49. N.
