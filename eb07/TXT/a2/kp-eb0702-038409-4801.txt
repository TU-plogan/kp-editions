It is represented as of an intermediate shape and size between an ass and a mule. A place, it seems, was secured for it in paradise at the intercession of Mahomet; which, however, was in some measure extorted from the prophet, by Alborakâ€™s refusing to let him mount when the angel Gabriel was come to conduct him.
