ADAMSON, Patrick, a Scotish prelate, archbishop of St Andrews, was born in the year 1543 in the town of Perth, where he received the rudiments of his education; and afterwards studied philosophy, and took his degree of master of arts, at the university of St Andrews. In 1566 he set out for Paris as tutor to a young gentleman. In the month of June of the same year, Mary Queen of Scots being delivered of a son, afterwards James VI. of Scotland and I. of England, Mr Adamson wrote a Latin poem on the occasion. In this poem he gave the prince the title of king of France and England; and this proof of his loyalty involved him in difficulties, for the French court was offended, and ordered him to be arrested; and he was confined for six months. He was released only through the intercession of Queen Mary and some of the principal nobility, who interested themselves in his behalf. As soon as he recovered his liberty, he retired with his pupil to Bourges. He was in this city during the massacre at Paris; and the same persecuting spirit prevailing among the Catholics at Bourges as at the metropolis, he lived concealed for seven months in a public house, the master of which, upwards of 70 years of age, was thrown from its top and had his brains dashed out, for his charity to heretics. Whilst Mr Adamson lay thus in his sepulchre, as he called it, he wrote his Latin poetical version of the book of Job, and his tragedy of Herod in the same language. In the year 1573, he returned to Scotland, and, having entered into holy orders, became minister of Paisley. In the year 1575, he was appointed one of the commissioners, by the general assembly, to settle the jurisdiction and policy of the church; and the following year he was named, with Mr David Lindsay, to report their -proceedings to the earl of Morton, then regent. About this time the earl appointed him one of his chaplains; and, on the death of Bishop Douglas, promoted him to the archiepiscopal see of St Andrews, a dignity which brought upon him great trouble and uneasiness; for now the clamour of the Presbyterian party rose very high against him, and many inconsistent absurd stories were propagated concerning him. Soon after his promotion, he published his catechism in Latin verse, a work highly approved even by his enemies; but, nevertheless, they still continued to persecute him with great violence. In 1578 he submitted himself to the [7:2:141] general assembly, which procured him peace but for a very little time; for, the year following, fresh accusations were brought against him. In the year 1582, being attacked with a grievous disease, in which the physicians could give him no relief, he happened to take a simple medicine from an old woman, which did him service. The woman, whose name was Alison Pearson, was thereupon charged with witchcraft, and committed to prison, but escaped out of her confinement; however, about four years afterwards, she was again found and burnt for a witch. In 1583 King James came to St Andrews; and the archbishop, being much recovered, preached before him, and disputed with Mr Andrew Melville, in presence of his Majesty, with great reputation; which drew upon him fresh calumny and persecution. The king, however, was so well pleased with him, that he sent him ambassador to Queen Elizabeth, at whose court he resided for some years. His conduct during his embassy has been variously reported by different authors. Two things he principally laboured, viz. the recommending the king his master to the nobility and gentry of England, and the procuring some support for the episcopal party in Scotland. His eloquent preaching drew after him such crowds of people, and raised in their minds so high an idea of the young king his master, that Queen Elizabeth forbade him to enter the pulpit during his stay in her dominions. In 1584 he was recalled, and sat in the parliament held in August at Edinburgh. The Presbyterian party was still very violent against the archbishop. A provincial synod was held at St Andrews in April 1586: the archbishop was here accused and excommunicated. He appealed to the king and the states, but this availed him little; for the mob being excited against him, he durst scarcely appear in public. At the next general assembly, a paper being produced containing the archbishop’s submission, he was absolved from the excommunication. In 1588 fresh accusations were brought against him. The year following he published the Lamentations of the prophet Jeremiah in Latin verse, which he dedicated to the king, complaining of his hard usage. In the latter end of the same year he published a translation of the Apocalypse in Latin verse, and a copy of Latin verses, addressed also to liis Majesty, deploring his distress. The king, however, was not moved by his application, for the revenue of his see was granted to the duke of Lennox; so that the prelate and his family were literally reduced to the want of bread. During the remaining part of his unfortunate life he was supported by charitable contribution, and he died in 1591. The character of this prelate has been variously represented, according to the sentiments of religion and politics which prevailed. But there is little doubt that he encouraged and supported, under the authority of the king, oppressive and injurious measures. His learning was unquestioned, and he acquired great reputation as a popular preacher. In his adversity he submitted with pious resignation to his hard fate. The panegyric of the editor of his works, Mr Wilson, is extravagant and absurd. He says, that “he was a miracle of nature, and rather seemed to be the immediate production of God Almighty, than born of a woman.”
