ALI, the son of Abu Taleb, is one of the most celebrated characters in Mahometan history. He was cousin to Mahomet, and at the age of fourteen engaged with youthful ardour in his cause. When Mahomet first revealed his prophetic character to his friends, and inquired who among them would undertake to be his companion Ali exclaimed, “O prophet, I will be thy attendant; the man who dares to rise against thee I will break his legs, pluck out his eyes, dash out his teeth, and even rip up his belly.” Mahomet accepted his services, and honoured him with the titles of brother, vicegerent, and Aaron to a new Moses. He was remarkable both for eloquence and valour; and the latter obtained him the surname of “the Lion of God, always victorious." He succeeded to the chief dignity of the renowned house of Hashem, and was also hereditary guardian of the temple and city of Mecca. Mahomet gave him his daughter Fatimah in marriage, and the grandfather lived to embrace the children of his daughter. These advantages induced Ali to cast a wistful eye towards the regal succession; however, Abubeker, Omar, and Othman, reigned before him. But after the death of the latter, he was saluted caliph by the chiefs of the tribes and companions of the prophet, when he was repairing to the mosque of Medina at the hour of prayer, A. n. 655, hcgira 35.

Ayesha, the widow of the prophet, strenuously opposed his succession; and under her influence two powerful chiefs soon raised the standard of rebellion. Ali greatly increased his difficulties by the imprudent removal of all the governors of provinces from their stations. Telha and Zobcir, two chiefs of great influence, collected a numerous army, and induced Ayesha to attend them to the field of battle; but Alĩ gained a complete victory, and took Ayesha prisoner. Telha fell in the field, and Zobeir was assassinated after surrendering upon promise of quarter. This dastardly action was severely reprehended by Ali. He likewise kindly treated the captive widow, and sent her back to the tomb of the prophet.

Ali next attacked Moawiyah, who had been proclaimed caliph, and strongly supported by a powerful and numerous party. When the two armies approached each other, Ali proposed to decide the matter by single combat; but to this his opponent would not agree. Several skirmishes were fought with considerable loss on both sides; but at length a pious fraud produced a division of sentiment in the army of Ali. They fixed to the points of lances a number of copies of the Koran, carried them before the troops, and exclaimed, “This is the book which forbids Mussulmans to shed each other’s blood, and ought therefore to decide our disputes.” Ali was constrained to yield, and umpires were mutually chosen; on the side of Ali, Abu Moussa; Amru, the conqueror of Egypt, on the part of Moawiyah. The day of final decision arrived. Abu Moussa ascended the pulpit, and cried, “As I draw this ring from my finger, so I depose both Ali and Moa-wiyah from the caliphate.” When Amru ascended, he cried, “As I put on this ring, so I invest Moawiyah with the caliphate, and also depose Ali.” He also added, that Othman, the former caliph, had declared Moawiyah both his successor and avenger. Thus began that memorable contest among the Mahometans, which was long agitated with considerable violence by both parties.

Ali was highly enraged at this injustice; but, constrained for the present to yield, he retired to Kufa. A sect of enthusiasts, called the Kharejites, revolted against Ah; but he quickly reduced them to subjection, and again obtained possession of Arabia. But Syria, Persia, and Egypt fell to the share of his rival.

An unexpected event terminated the existing disputes. Three Kharejites one day conversing together concerning the blood which had been shed, and the impending calamities, resolved to assassinate Ali, Moawiyah, and Amru, the three authors of the present disasters. They provided themselves with poisoned swords, and hastened [7:2:515] to accomplish their purpose. Moawiyah was wounded, 'but the wound did not prove fatal. A friend of Amru fell in his stead. Ali was fatally wounded at the door of the mosque; and, in the 63d year of his age, he expired on the fifth day after his wound, A. d. 660, hegira 40.

Ali had eight wives besides Fatimah, and left a numerous family, who were very remarkable for their valour. He also rose to high eminence for learning and wisdom; and of his works there are still extant a hundred maxims, a collection of verses, and a prophecy of all the great events which are to happen to the end of time.

The Mussulmans term Ali the heir of Mahomet, and the accepted of God ; and his particular followers have possessed various states in Africa and Asia, and the Persian part of the Usbec Tartars; and some sovereigns of India are at present of the sect of Ali. A monument is raised upon his tomb near Kufa, which the kings of Persia have successively decorated and religiously revered. Near the ruins of Kufa, a city named Meshed Ali has been built to his memory. Some of his deluded followers imagine that he is still alive, and that he will revisit the earth and fill the same with justice. A green turban still continues to distinguish the descendants of Ali.

Alī Bey, an eastern adventurer, is said to have been a native of Mount Caucasus, and about the age of twelve or fourteen he was sold for a slave in Cairo. The two Jews who became his masters presented him to Ibrahim, tlιen one of the most respectable men in the kingdom. In the family of this powerful man he received the rudiments of literature, and was also instructed in the military art. Both in letters and military skill he made rapid improvement. He gradually gained the affection of his patron to such a degree, that he gave him his freedom, permitted him to marry, promoted him to die rank of governor of a district, and afterwards by election he was raised to the elevated station of one of the governors of provinces. Deprived of his protector by death, and engaging in the dangerous intrigues that pave the way to power in that unstable government, he procured his own banishment to Upper Egypt. Here he spent two years in maturing his schemes for future greatness; and in 1766, returning to Cairo, he either slew or expelled the beys, and seized the reins of government.

Emboldened by success, he rescued himself from the power of the Porte, coined money in his own name, and assumed the rank of sultan of Egypt. Occupied in more important concerns, the Porte made no vigorous opposition to his measures, and Ali Bey seized this favourable opportunity to recover a part of the Said, or Upper Egypt, which had been taken away by an Arab sheik. Next lie sent out a fleet from Suez, which seizing upon Djedda, entered the port of Mecca; while a body of cavalry, commanded by Mohammed Bey, his favourite, took and plundered Mecca itself. A young Venetian merchant laid before him a plan of reviving the ancient trade to the East Indies through the Mediterranean and Red Sea. Having formed an alliance in 1770 with one Sheik Daher, a rebel against the Porte in Syria, he aimed at the conquest of all Syria and Palestine. He first endeavoured to secure Gaza; then his army, forming a junction with that of Daher at a place called Acre, advanced to Damascus. On the 6th of June 1771 a battle was fought at this place with the Turkish pachas, and Mohammed and Daher, the commanders of Ali Bey, touted them with great slaughter. They instantly took possession of Damascus, and the castle itself had also capitulated, when all on a sudden Mohammed hastened back to Egypt with all his Mamelukes. Some ascribe this strange conduct to an impression made upon Mohammed by the Turkish agents, and others to a report of the death of Ali Bey.

Although unsuccessful, Ali Bey never lost sight of his favourite object; and Mohammed, losing his confidence, was forced to save his life by exile. Mohammed, however, quickly returned with an army, and drove Ali Bey from Cairo. In this unfortunate s.tate of affairs Ali Bey fled to Daher, and, combining their forces, they attacked the Turkish commander at Sidon, and came off victorious, although the Turkish army was three times their number. After a siege of eight months, they next took the town of Jaffa. Deceived by letters from Cairo, which were only intended to ensnare him, and stimulated with recent victories, he returned to Cairo. Entering the deserts which divide Gaza from Egypt, he was furiously attacked by a thousand chosen Mamelukes led on by Murad Bey, who was enamoured with the beauty of All’s wife, and had obtained the promise of her, provided that he could take Ali Bey captive. Murad wounded and made Ali Bey prisoner, and carried him up to Mohammed, who received him with affected respect; but in three days, either in consequence of poison or the effects of his wounds, Ali breathed his last.
