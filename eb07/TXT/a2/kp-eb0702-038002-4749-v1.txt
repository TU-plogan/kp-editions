ALBANS, St, a large town of great antiquity, in the hundred of Cashio, in the county of Hertford. It was the ancient Verulam of the Romans and the Watlingcester of the Saxons, and celebrated in more recent times by having conferred a title, by its ancient name, on the great Lord Bacon. The abbey church, now parochial, is of a remote date, built originally of Roman bricks, but since covered with stone. It is 800 feet in length and 174 in its greatest breadth, and contains statues, monuments, and inscriptions of remote origin, which have engaged the attention of artists and antiquaries. The town is finely situated, in part on the dèclivity of a hill, at the foot of which the river Ver runs through some pleasant meadows.

It is surrounded by a district highly fruitful, especially in wheat. The municipal government is in a mayor and bur· gesses. It returns two members to parliament, who are chosen by the householders paying king’s and parochial taxes. The town is divided into four parishes, with churches dedicated to St Alban, St Michael, St Peter, and St Stephen. The only manufacture now carried on is that of plaiting straw for hats. The market, which is large, is on a Saturday. The population has been as follows: in 1801, 3038; in 1811, 3653; and in 1821, 4472. Thegreat increase may be attributed to its being the thoroughfare to the northern parts of, the kingdom. It is distant 22 miles from London.
