AMALGAMATION, the operation of making an amalgam, or mixing mercury with any metal.

For the combination of one metal with another, it is generally sufficient that one of them be in a state of fluidity. Mercury being always fluid, is therefore capable of amalgamation with other metals without heat; nevertheless, heat considerably facilitates the operation.

To amalgamate without heat requires nothing more than rubbing the two metals together in a mortar; but the metal to be united with the mercury should be previously divided into very thin plates or grains. When heat is used (which is always most effectual, and with some metals indispensably necessary), the mercury should be heated till it begin to smoke, and the grains of metal made red-hot before they are thrown into it. If it be gold or silver, it is sufficient to stir the fluid with an iron rod for a little while, and then to throw it into a vessel filled with water. This amalgam is used for gilding or silvering on copper, which is afterwards exposed to a degree of heat sufficient to evaporate the mercury.

Amalgamation with lead or tin is effected by pouring an equal weight of mercury into either of these metals m a state of fusion, and stirring with an iron rod. Copper amalgamates with great difficulty, and iron not at all.
