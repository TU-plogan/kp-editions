AENEAS, in fabulous history, a famous Trojan prince, the son of Anchises and Venus. At the destruction of Troy, he bore his aged father on his back, and saved him from the Greeks; but, being too solicitous about his son and household gods, lost his wife Cre√ºsa in the escape. Landing in Africa, he was kindly received by Queen Dido; but quitting her coast, he arrived in Italy, where he married Lavinia, the daughter of King Latinus, and defeated Turnus, to whom she had been contracted. After the death of his father-in-law, he was made king of the Latins, over whom he reigned three years; but joining with the Aborigines, he was slain in a battle against the Tuscans. Virgil has rendered the name of this prince immortal, by making him the hero of bis poem.

Aeneas Sylvius, Pope. See Pius II.
