ALME, or Alma, singing and dancing girls in Egypt, who, like the Italian lmprovisatori, can occasionally pour forth “unpremeditated verse.” They are called Alme i from having received a better education than other women. They form a celebrated society in that country. To be received into it, according to Μ. Savary, it is necessary to have a good voice, to understand the language well, to know the rules of poetry, and be able to compose and sing couplets on the spot, adapted to the circumstances. The Almé know by heart all the new songs. Their memory is furnished with the most beautiful tales. There is no festival without them, no entertainment of which they do not constitute the ornament. They are placed in a rostrum, from whence they sing during the repast. They then descend into the saloon, and form dances which have no resemblance to ours. They are pantomime ballets, in which they represent the usual occurrences of life. The mysteries of love, too, generally furnish them with scenes. The suppleness of their bodies is inconceivable. One is astonished at the mobility of their features, to which they give at pleasure the impression suited to the characters they play. The indecency of their attitudes is often carried to excess.
[7:2:534]

The common people have also their Almé. They are girls of the second class, who try to imitate the former; but they have neither their elegance, their graces, nor their knowledge. They are everywhere to be met with. The public places and the walks about Grand Cairo are full of them. As the populace require allusions still more strongly marked, decency forbids us to relate the licentiousness of their gestures and attitudes.
