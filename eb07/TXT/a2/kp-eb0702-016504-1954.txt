ADRIANUM, or Adriaticum Mare, in Ancient Geography, now the Gulf of Venice, a large bay in the Mediterranean, between Dalmatia, Sclavonia, Greece, and Italy. It is called by the Greeks A¾∕ας Koanos, and Adria by the Romans, (as Arbiter Adriae Notus, Hor.) Cicero calls it Hadrianum Mare, Virgil has Hadriaticas Undas. It is commonly called Mare Adriaticum, without an aspiration; but whether it ought to have one, is a dispute. If the appellation is from Hadria, the town of the Piceni, it must be written Hadriaticum, because the emperor’s name who thence derives his origin is on coins and stones Hadrianus ; but if from the town in the territory of Venice, as the more ancient, and of which that of the Piceni is a colony, this will justify the common appellation Adriaticum. It extends from latitude 40. to 45.55. north, between the coasts of Italy and Illyria. The tides in this sea are distinguishable, but the ebb and flow is inconsiderable, though greater than in the Mediterranean.
