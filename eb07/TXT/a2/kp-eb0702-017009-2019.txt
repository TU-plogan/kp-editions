AEGEAN Sea, in Ancient Geography, now the Archipelago, a part of the Mediterranean, separating Europe from Asia Minor; washing, on the one hand, Greece and Macedonia; on the other, Caria and Ionia. The origin of the name is greatly disputed. Festus advances three opinions: one, that it is so called from the many islands therein appearing at a distance like so many goats; another, because Aegea, queen of the Amazons, perished in it; a third, because Aegeus, the father of Theseus, threw himself headlong into it.
