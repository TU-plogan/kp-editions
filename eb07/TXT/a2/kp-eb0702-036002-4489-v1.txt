AGUILLANEUF, or Augillaneuf, a form of rejoicing used among the ancient Franks on the first day of the year. The word is compounded of the French A, to, gui, misletoe, and lan neuf, the new year. Its origin is traced from a druid ceremony: the priests used to go yearly in December, which with them was reputed a sacred month, to gather misletoe of the oak, in great solemnity. The prophets marched in the front, singing hymns in honour of their deities; after them came a herald with a caduceus in his hand; these were followed by three druids abreast, bearing the things necessary for sacrifice; last of all came the chief or arch druid, accompanied with the train of people. The chief druid, climbing the oak, cut off the misletoe with a golden sickle, and the other druids received it in a white cloth. On the first day of the year it was distributed among the people, after having blessed and consecrated it by crying A gui Γαη neuf, to proclaim the new year.
