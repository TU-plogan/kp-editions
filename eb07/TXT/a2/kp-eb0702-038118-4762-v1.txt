ALBI, a city of France, in the department of the Tarn, the capital of the Albigeois, in Upper Languedoc. The cathedral is dedicated to St Cecilia, and has one of the finest choirs in the kingdom. Here is a very valuable silver shrine, of exquisite workmanship, of the mosaic kind; it contains the relics of St Clair, the first bishop of this city. The chapel of this pretended saint is magnificent, and adorned with paintings. La Lice is a fine large walk without the city. What distinguishes this from all others is a terrace above a deep mall, which serves instead of a fosse: it is bordered with two rows of very fine trees, which are kept in excellent order. There are foúr gates, through which you may view all the beauties of a delightful plain. At one end of this is the convent of the Dominicans. The archbishop’s palace is very beautiful. The river washes its walls, and serves both for an ornament and defence. This city is seated on the river Tarn, 35 miles north-east of Toulouse, and contained 9860 inhabitants by the last census. . Long. 2. 9. E. Lat. 43. 56. N.

The Axbigeois is a small territory, about twenty-seven [7:2:382] milés in length and twenty in breadth, abounding in corn, wood, grapes, saffron, plums, and sheep; and the inhabitants have a great trade in dried prunes, grapes, a cóarse sort of cloth, and wine of Gaillac. These wines are the only sort hereabouts that are fit for exportation: they are carried down to Bourdeaux, and generally sold to the British. They have likewise several coal-mines.
