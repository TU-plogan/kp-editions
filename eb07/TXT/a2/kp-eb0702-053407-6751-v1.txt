ALMEYDA, Don Francis, was the son of the count d’Abrantes, a grandee of Portugal, who served with great distinction in the war of Ferdinand of Castile with Granada; and in consequence of his important services he became highly esteemed in the court of his sovereign. Without any solicitation on his part he was nominated* the first governor-general and viceroy of the newly conquered countries in the East Indies, and set sail from Lisbon in March 1505-6 with a powerful fleet. To give dignity and influence to his elevated station, a body of guards was appointed to attend his person, several chaplains were assigned to him, together with every other appendage of grandeur. He touched at the Cape Verde islands, doubled the cape at a considerable distance to the south, and arrived at Guiloa. From thence he proceeded to Mombaza, a well-fortified city in an island, which he reduced, and proceeded to the Angediva islands, not far from Goa, where he built a fort: he likewise erected and garrisoned another fort at Cananore, and arriving at Cochin, he secured it to the Portuguese interest. The island of Madagascar was discovered during his government; and his son Don Lorenzo first surveyed the Maidive islands, and about the same time discovered the fine island of Ceylon, the principal sovereign of which he brought under submission to the crown of Portugal. Returning from this expedition, while employed in the fleet destined against Calicut, he lost his life in a sea-fight against the Zamorin. His father sustained his loss with an heroic firmness, saying that “Lorenzo could not diejbetter than in the service of his country.” On the arrival of Alphonso d’Albuquerque, who was destined to be his successor, Almeyda yielded to the impressions of jealousy; and under the pretence of misconduct he confined him in the citadel of Cananore. He engaged in 1508 the whole force of the Mahometans in the port of Diu; and, gaining a complete victory, facilitated the enterprises of Albuquerque his successor, by contributing to break that formidable league by which the Zamorin was in hopes of being able to compel the Portuguese to abandon their Indian conquests. Returning home with the great riches which he had acquired, he unfortunately touched at Saldanha Point, on the coast of Africa, where some of the sailors, in quest of water, quarrelled with the natives, who attacked and drove them to their ships. With a view to revenge this pretended affront, they persuaded Almeyđá himself to go ashore, with a body of 150 men, armed only with swords and lances. While stepping into the boat, Almeyda exclaimed, “Whither do you carry my 60 years ?” The Portuguese furiously rushed on to attack the natives, whose numbers were greatly augmented; and Almeyda, with fifty-seven of his men, was killed in this rash and unprovoked attempt.
