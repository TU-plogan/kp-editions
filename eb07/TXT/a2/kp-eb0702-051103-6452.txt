ALGONQUINS, a nation in North America, who formerly possessed great tracts of land along the north shore of the river St Lawrence. For a long time they had no rivals as hunters and warriors, and were long in alliance [7:2:512]with the Iroquois, whom they agreed to protect from all invaders, and to let them have a share of their venison. The Iroquois, on the other hand, were to pay a tribute to their allies, out of the culture of the earth, and to perform for them all the menial duties, such as flaying the game, curing the flesh, and dressing the skins. By degrees, however, the Iroquois associated in the hunting matches and warlike expeditions of the Algonquins; so that they soon began to fancy themselves as Well qualified, either for war or hunting, as their neighbours. One winter a large detachment of both nations having gone out a hunting, and secured, as they thought, a vast quantity of game, six young Algonquins and as many Iroquois were sent out to begin the slaughter. The AIgonquins, probably becoιAE a little jealous of their associates, upon seeing a few elks, desired the Iroquois to return, on pretence that they would have sufficient employment in flaying the game they should kill ;· but after three days’ hunting, having killed none, the Iroquois exulted, and in a day or two privately set out to hunt for themselves. The Algonquins were so exasperated at seeing their rivals return laden with game, that they murdered all the hunters in the night-time. The Iroquois dissembled their resentment; but, in order to be revenged, applied themselves to study the art of war as practised among those savage nations. Being afraid of engaging with the Algonquins, at first they tried their prowess on other inferior nations, and, when they thought themselves sufficiently expert, attacked the Algonquins with such diabolical fury as showed they could be satisfied with nothing less than the extermination of the whole race; which, had it not been for the interposition of the French, they would have accomplished.
