AMBASSADOR, or Embassador, a public minister sent from one sovereign prince, as a representative of his person, to another.

Ambassadors are either ordinary or extraordinary. Ambassador in ordinary is he who constantly resides in the court of another prince, to maintain a good understanding, and look to the interest of his master. Till about two hundred years ago, ambassadors in ordinary were not heard of: all, till then, were ambassadors extraordinary; that is, such as are sent on some particular occasion, and who retire as soon as the affair is dispatched.

At Athens ambassadors mounted the pulpit of the public orators, and there opened their commission, acquainting the people with their errand. At Rome they were introduced to the senate, and delivered their commissions to the fathers.

By the civil law, the movable goods of an ambassador, which are accounted an accession to his person, cannot be seized, either as a pledge or for payment of a debt, or by order or execution of judgment, or by the king’s leave or that of the state where he resides, as some conceive: if, therefore, he has contracted any debt, he is to be called upon kindly; and if he refuses payment, then letters of request are to be sent to his master. Ambassadors cannot be defended when they commit any thing against that state, or the person of the prince with whom they reside; and if they are guilty of treason, felony, &c. or any other crime against the law of nations, they lose the privilege of an ambassador, and may be subject to punishment as private aliens.

In Vattel’s excellent treatise on the Law of Nations (b. iv. c. 7), there is a clear and comprehensive exposition of the rights and immunities of ambassadors and other public ministers. Wicquefort’s learned work, entitled L' Ambassadeur et ses fonctions, is replete with information on the institution generally, and its effects in modern times. This work was originally published in 1681, in two vols. 4to, and has been often reprinted.
