ADRASTUS, in Ancient History, king of Argos, son of Talaus and Lysianassa, daughter of Polybius, king of Sicyon, acquired great honour in the famous war of Thebes, in support of Polynices his son-in-law, who had been excluded the sovereignty of Thebes by Eteocles his brother, notwithstanding their reciprocal agreement. Adrastus, followed by Polynices, and Tydeus his other son-in-law, by Capaneus and Hippomedon his sister’s sons, by Aι⅛ phiaraus his brother-in-law, and by Parthenopaeus, marched against the city of Thebes; and this is the expedition of the Seven Worthies, which the poets have so often sung. They all lost their lives in this war except Adrastus, who was saved by his horse called Arion. This war was revived ten years after by the sons of those deceased warriors, which was called the war of the Epigones, and ended with the taking of Thebes. None of them lost their lives except Aegialeus, son of Adrastus; which afflicted him so much that he died of grief in Megara, as he was leading back his victorious army.
