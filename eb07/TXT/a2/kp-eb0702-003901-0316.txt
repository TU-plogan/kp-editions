ABOARD, the inside of a' ship. Hence any person who enters a ship is said to go aboard : but when an enemy enters in the time of battle, he is said to board ; a phrase which always implies hostility To fall aboard of is to strike or encounter another ship when one or both arc in motion, or to be driven upon a ship by the force of the wind or current.â€” Aboard-main-tack, the order to draw the main-tack, i. e. the lower corner of the main-sail, down to the Chess-tree.
