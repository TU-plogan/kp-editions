ADVENTURER, in a general sense, denotes one who hazards something.

Adventurers is particularly used for an ancient company of merchants and traders, erected for the discovery of lands, territories, trades, &c. unknown. The society of adventurers had its rise in Burgundy, and its first establishment from John duke of Brabant in 1248, being known by the name of the Brotherhood of St Thomas a Becket. It was afterwards translated into England, and successively confirmed by Edwards III. and IV. Richard III. Henries IV. V. VI. and VII. who gave it the appellation of Merchant Adventurers.
