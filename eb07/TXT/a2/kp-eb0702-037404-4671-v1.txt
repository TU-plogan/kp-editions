ALARIC, a famous general of the Goths. He entered Thrace at the head of 200,000 men, and laid waste all the country through which he passed. He marched next to Macedonia and Thessaly. The Thessalians met him near the mouth of the river Peneus, and killed about 3000 of his army; nevertheless he advanced into Greece, and after having ravaged the whole country, returned to Epirus loaded with immense spoils. After staying here five years, he resolved to turn his arms to the west. He marched through Pannonia, and, finding little resistance, entered Italy, in the consulship öf Stilicho and Aurelianus, a. D. 400. After various battles and treaties, he at last took Rome by treachery, and permitted his soldiers to plunder it: this happened a. d. 400. Alaric, having laid waste a great part of Italy, intended to pass into Sicily; but a storm obliging him to land again, he besieged the city of CoSenza; and, having taken it, he died there in 411, eleven years after he first entered Italy.
