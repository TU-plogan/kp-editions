AMRAPHEL, the king of Shinar or Babylonia, confederated with Chedorlaomer, king of the Elamites, and two other kings, to make war against the kings of Pentapolis; that is to say, of Sodom, Gomorrah, and the three neighbouring cities. The kings who were in league with Am-raphel worsted those of Pentapolis, plundered their city, and carried off abundance of captives, among whom was Lot, Abrahamâ€™s nephew; but Abraham pursued them, retook Lot, and recovered all the spoil.
