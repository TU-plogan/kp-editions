AMPHILOCHIUS, bishop of Iconium in the fourth century, was the friend of St Gregory Nazianzen and St Basil. He assisted at the first general council of Constantinople in 381, presided at the council of Sida, and was a strenuous opposer of the Arians. He died in 394; and his works were published in Greek and Latin at Paris, 1644, by Francis Combefis. '
