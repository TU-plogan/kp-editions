AGGERHUUS, one of the four provinces or sees into which the kingdom of Norway is divided. It extends over 32,790 square miles, with a population of no more than 394,G05 inhabitants. It is a very mountainous but most romantic district, abounding in woods, rivers, cascades, and lakes, with some moderately fruitful spots in the narrow valleys. The climate is raw and cold, and the frosts usually continue till May. The corn is scarcely sufficient for the consumption, though fish and potatoes are extensively used as food. The chief trade is in deals, pitch, and tar, with some iron, butter, tallow, and hides. The inhabitants all speak the peculiar language of Norway, a dialect of the Teutonic mixed with the Celtic; and are all of the Lutheran confession, and have 307 parish churches and chapels.

Aggeriiuus, a bailiwick in the see of the same name, in Norway. It is in the middle of the see, near the lake of Christiana, and comprehends 2 cities, 5 market towns, 22 parishes, and G7,808 inhabitants.
