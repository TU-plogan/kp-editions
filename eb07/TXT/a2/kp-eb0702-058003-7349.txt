ALVEOLI, in Anatomy, the sockets in the jaws, wherein the teeth are fixed. Some writers speak of teeth growing without alveoli. Pliny mentions a person who had a tooth in his palate. Eustachius relates that he saw a man at 60 who had a tooth growing out of the middle of his fauces. Haller gives an instance of a person whose teeth were of a piece with his jaws, without any insertion into alveoli.

Alveolus, in Natural History, the name of the waxen cells in bee-hives. Also the name of a sea-fossil of a conical figure, composed of a number of cells like beehives, joined into each other with a pipe of communication.
