ANAK, the father of the Anakims, was the son of Arba, who gave his name to Ki≈ójath-arba, or Hebron. (Josh. xiv. 15.) Anak had three sons, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai (chap. xv. 14, and Numb, xiii. 22), all of gigantic size; their posterity were remarkable, not only for their extraordinary stature, but for their fierceness, and were called Anakims; in comparison of whom, the Hebrews who were sent to view the land of Canaan reported that they were but as grasshoppers, Numb. xiii. ult. Caleb, assisted by the tribe of Judah, took Kirjath-arba, and destroyed the Anakims (Judges i. 20, and Joshua xv. 14), in the year of the world 2559.
