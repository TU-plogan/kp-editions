AMBURY, or Anbury, among Farriers, denotes a tumour, wart, or swelling, which is soft to the touch, and full of blood.

This disorder of horses is cured by tying a horse-hair very tightly about its root; and when it has fallen off, which commonly happens in about eight days, strewing some powder of verdigris upon the part, to prevent the return of the complaint. If the tumour be so low that nothing can be tied about it, they cut it out with a knife, or else burn it off with a sharp hot iron; and in sinewy parts, where a hot iron is improper, they eat it away with oil of vitriol, or white sublimate.
