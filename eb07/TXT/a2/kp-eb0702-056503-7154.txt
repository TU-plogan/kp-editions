ALSTEDIUS, John Henry, a German Protestant divine, and one of the most indefatigable and voluminous writers of the 17th century. He was some time professor of philosophy and divinity at Herborn, in the county of Nassau. From thence he went into Transylvania, to be professor at Alba Julia, where he continued till his death, which happened in 1638, in the 50th year of his age. His Encyclopoedia, the most considerable of the earlier works of that class, was long held in very high estimation. It was published in 1630, in two large folio volumes. His Thesaurus Chronologicus is by some considered as one of his best works, and has gone through several editions. He also wrote Triumphus Blblicus, to show that the principles of all arts and sciences are to be found in the Scriptures. He was a Millenarian, and published, in 1627, a treatise De Mille Annis, in which he asserted that the reign of the saints on earth was to begin in 1694.
