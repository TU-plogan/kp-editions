AI, in Ancient Geography, a town in Judea, to the north of Jericho, called An*α by Josephus, and the inhabitants Ainatae. Joshua having sent a detachment of 3000 men against Ai, God permitted them to be repulsed on account of Achan’s sin, who had violated the anathema pronounced against the city of Jericho. But after the expiation of this offence, God commanded Joshua (chap, viii.) to march with the whole army of the Israelites against Ai, and treat this city and the kingdom thereof as he had treated Jericho, with this difference, that he gave the plunder of the town to the people. Joshua sent by night 30,000 men to lie in ambush behind Ai, having first well instructed those who had the command of them in what they were to do; and the next day, early in the morning, he marched against the city with the remainder of his army. The king of Ai perceiving them, sallied hastily out of the town with all his people, and fell upon the forces of the Israelites, who, upon the first onset, fled, as if they had been under some great terror.

As soon as Joshua saw the enemy all out of the gates, he raised his shield upon the top of a pike, which was the signal given to the ambuscade; whereupon they immediately entered the place, which they found without defence, and set fire to it. The people of Ai perceiving the smoke ascending, were willing to return, but discovered those who had set fire to the city in their rear; while Joshua and those who were with him turning about, fell upon them, and cut them in pieces. The king was taken alive, and afterwards put to death.
