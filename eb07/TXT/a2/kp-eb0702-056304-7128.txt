ALREDUS, Alured, or Aluredus, of Beverley, one of the most ancient English historians, was born at Beverley, in Yorkshire. He wrote in the reign of Henry I.; but no circumstance of his life is known with any degree of certainty. It is generally believed that he was educated at Cambridge, and that he afterwards became one of the canons and treasurer of St John’s at Beverley; and we learn from a note of Bishop Tanner’s, that, for the sake of improvement, he travelled through France and Italy, and at Rome became domestic chaplain to Cardinal Othoboni. He died in the year 1128 or 1129, leaving behind him the following works :—1. The Annals of Alured of Beverley, published at Oxford in 1716, by Mr Hearne, from a manuscript which belonged to Thomas Rawlinson, Esq. It contains an abridgement of our history from Brutus to Henry I., written in Latin, and with great accuracy, elegance, and perspicuity. 2. Libertates Ecclesiae S. Johannis de Beverlac, &c. a manuscript in the Cottonian library. It is a collection of records relative to the church of Beverley, translated from the Saxon language.
