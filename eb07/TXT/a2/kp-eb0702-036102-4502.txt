AHAUS, a circle in the department of Munster, and Prussian province of Westphalia, formed out of the old lordships of Bocholt and Horstmar. It is 301 square miles, or 192,640 acres, in extent, comprehending three cities, six market towns, and 58 parishes, with 33,470 inhabitants. The soil is moderately fertile, and yields moderate crops of corn, buck-wheat, and flax. It is watered by the Aa, the Berkel, the Bechta, the Dinkel, and several smaller streams. The most valuable products are cattle, and especially sheep. There is some little spinning and weaving of linen; but the higher wages paid in Holland induce the labourers to go to that country, in the seasons of hay and corn harvest, to save the means of subsistence for the winter.â€”The chief city of the circle, of the same name, is the residence of the count, now mediatized; and contains, besides his castle, 300 houses, and 1103 inhabitants.
