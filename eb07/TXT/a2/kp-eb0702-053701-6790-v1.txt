ALMS, a general term for what is given out of charity to the poor. In the early ages of Christianity, the alms of the charitable were divided into four parts; one of which was allotted to the bishop, another to the priests, and a third to the deacons and subdeacons, which formed their whole means of subsistence; the fourth part was employed in relieving the poor, and in repairing the churches. No religious system is more frequent or warm in its exhortations to almsgiving than the Mahometan. The Koran represents alms as a necessary means to make i>rayer be heard. Hence that saying of one of their ca-iphs: “Prayer carries us half-way to God, fasting brings us to the door of his palace, and alms introduces us into the presence-chamber.” Hence many illustrious examples of this virtue among the Mahometans.

Alms also denotes lands or other effects left to churches or religious houses, on condition of praying for the soul of the donor. Hence Free Alms, that which is liable to no rent or service.

Reasonable Alms, a certain portion of the estates of intestate persons, allotted to the poor.

Alms Box or Chest, a small chest or coffer, called by the Greeks K/ĉar/oµ, wherein anciently the alms were collected, both at church and at private houses.

The alms-chest, in English churches, is a strong box, with a hole in the upper part, having three keys, one to be kept by the parson or curate, the other two by the church-wardens. The erecting of such alms-chest in eVery church is enjoined by the book of canons, as also the manner of distributing what is thus collected among the poor of the parish.
