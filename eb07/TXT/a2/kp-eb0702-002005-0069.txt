ABCHASIEN, a province of the Asiatic Russian empire, on the border of the Black Sea, comprehended between Lat. 42. 30. and 44. 45. N., and between Long. 37. 3.'and 40. 36. E. The high mountains of Caucasus on the north and north-west divide it from Circassia; on the south-west it is bounded by Mingrelia; and on the south, south-west, and north-west by the Black Sea. The extent is about 5080 square miles. The climate is generally mild, being defended from the northerly winds by the lofty range of mountains. The sea-coast is in many parts a sandy soil; but in many of the vallies which run up between the projections of the Caucasus the land is fertile, but better adapted for pasturage than for the growth of corn; and hence the greater part of the inhabitants are in the pastoral state. The grape and all other fruits come to perfection. Under the Turkish dominion the trifling commerce was with the Asiatic provinces of that power; but its course is now changed, and passes towards the north. The number of inhabitants is estimated at 56,500, of whom 40,000 are aboriginal. The Turcomans, Nogay Tartars, with the Greeks, Armenians, and Jews that occupy the towns and ports on the coast, are reckoned to be 15,000, and the Russians and Cossacks 1500. In early times the Abchasiens were heathens, but adopted Christianity under the Emperor Justinian, who built a church to the Virgin Mary in 550, and sent missionaries. Under the Turks their Christianity gradually disappeared; and at present the higher classes adhere to Mahomedanism, whilst the mass of the people follow each a separate species of idolatry. Though by the peace of 1812 Russia entered into all the rights enjoyed by the Turks, it scarcely interfered with the interior authority of the several chiefs, who by force gain the superiority; nor does it draw any revenue from the country, but is satisfied with possession of a few commanding fortresses, and with the trade which falls into the new channels from the effect of the political changes.
