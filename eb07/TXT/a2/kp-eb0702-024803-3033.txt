AGNOMEN, in Roman Antiquity, a kind of fourth or honorary name, given to a person on account of some extraordinary action, virtue, or other accomplishments. Thus the agnomen Africanus was bestowed upon Publius Cornelius Scipio on account of his great achievements in Africa.â€”The agnomen was the third in order of the three Roman names: thus, in Marcus Tullius Cicero, Marcus is the praenomen, Tullius the nomen, and Cicero the agnomen.
