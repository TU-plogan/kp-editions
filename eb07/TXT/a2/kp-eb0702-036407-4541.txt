AIGLE, a bailiwick in the territory of Romand in Switzerland, consists of mountains and valleys, the principal of which are the Aigle and Bex. Through these is the great road from Valais into Italy. When you pass by Villeneuve, which is at the head of the lake of Geneva, you enter into a deep valley three miles wide, bordered on one side with the Alps of Switzerland, on the other side with those of Savoy, and crossed by the river Rhone. Six miles from thence you meet with Aigle, a town containing 2500 inhabitants, seated in a wide part of the valley, where there are vineyards, fields, and meadows. The governorâ€™s castle is on an eminence that overlooks the town, and has a lofty marble tower. This government has nine large parishes; and is divided into four parts, Aigle, Bex, Olon, and Ormont. This last is among the mountains, and joins to Rougemont. It is a double valley, abounding in pasture lands. Ivorna, in the district of Aigle, was in part buried by the fall of a mountain, occasioned by an earthquake, in 1584.

Aigle, a city in France, in the arrondissement of Mor-tagne, and department of the Orne. It is situated on the river Rille, which divides it into three parts; one on each side of the river, and one in an island formed by two channels of it. It contains 844 houses, and 5780 inhabitants. It is an industrious place, with manufactures of linen, cotton, paper, leather, cutlery, needles, bottles, and other wares.
