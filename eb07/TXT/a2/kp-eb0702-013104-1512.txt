ACTIAN Games, in Roman antiquity, were solemn games instituted by Augustus, in memory of his victory over Mark Antony at Actium, held every fifth year, and celebrated in honour of Apollo, since called Î‘ctius. Hence Action Years, an era commencing from the battle of Actium, called the Era of Augustus. Virgil insinuates them to have been instituted by Aeneas, from that passage, Aen. iii. V. 280:

Actiaque Iliacis celebramus 1ittora ludis.

But this he only does by way of compliment to Augustus; attributing that to the hero from whom he descended, which was done by the emperor himself; as is observed by Servius.
