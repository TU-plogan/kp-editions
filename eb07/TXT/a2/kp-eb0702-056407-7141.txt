ALSOP, Anthony, an English divine and poet, was educated at Westminster School, and from thence elected to Christ Church, Oxford, where he took the degree of Μ. A. in March 1696, and of B. D. in December 1706. On his coming to the university, he was very soon distinguished by Dean Aldrich, and published Fabularum Aesopicarum Delectus, Oxon. 1698, 8vo, with a poetical dedication to Lord Viscount Scudamore, and a preface in which he took part against Dr Bentley in the famous dispute with Mr Boyle. He passed through the usual offices in his college to that of censor with considerable reputation, and for some years had the principal noblemen and gentlemen belonging to the society committed to his care. In this employment he continued till his merit recommended him to Sir Jonathan Trelawney, bishop of Winchester, who appointed him his chaplain, and soon after gave him a prebend in his own cathedral, together with the rectory of Brightwell, in the county of Berks, which afforded him ample provision for a learned retirement, from which he could not be drawn by the repeated solicitations of those who thought him qualified for a more public character and a higher station. In 1717 an action was brought against him by Mrs Elizabeth Astrey of Oxford, for the breach of a marriage contract; and a verdict was obtained against him for L.2000, which probably obliged him to leave the kingdom for some time. His death, which happened on the 10th June 1726, was occasioned by his falling into a ditch that led to his garden door. A quarto volume was published in 1752, under the title of Antonii Alsopi, Aedis Christi οlim Alumni, 0darum libri duo. Four English poems of his are in Dodsley’s Collection, one in Pearch’s, several in the early volumes of the Gentleman’s Magazine, and some in The Student. Mr Alsop is respectfully mentioned by the facetious Dr King as having enriched the commonwealth of learning by Translations of Fables from Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic; and not less detractingly by Dr Bentley, under the name of “Tony Alsop, a late editor of the Aesopean Fables.”

Alsop, Vincent, an English nonconformist divine, was born in Northamptonshire, and educated at St John’s College, Cambridge, where he took the degree of master of arts. When he received deacon’s orders, he went to Rutlandshire, and settled at Oakham, where he was an assistant to the master of the free-school. As lie was a man of a sprightly turn, he fell into indifferent company; but was reclaimed by the frequent admonitions of the reverend Mr Benjamin King. He afterwards married that gentleman’s daughter, and becoming a convert to his principles, received ordination in the Presbyterian way, not being satisfied with that which he had from the bishop. He was settled at Wilbee, in the county of Northampton, whence he was ejected in 1662 for nonconformity. After this he ventured to preach sometimes at Oakham, and at Wellingborough, where he lived, and was once six months in prison for praying by a sick person. A book which he wrote against Dr Sherlock, in a humorous style, made him well known to the world, and induced Mr Cawton, an eminent nonconformist in Westminster, to recommend him to his congregation for his successor. On receiving this call he quitted Northamptonshire, and came to London, where he preached constantly, and wrote several pieces which were extremely well received by the public. Living in the neighbourhood of the court, he was exposed to many inconveniences; but these ended with the reign of Charles ∏∙ or at least in the beginning of the next reign, when Mr Alsop’s'son engaging in treasonable practices, was freely pardoned by King James. After this our divine went frequently to court, and is generally supposed to have been the person who drew up the Presbyterians’ address to that prince for his general indulgence. After the Revolution, Mr Alsop gave public testimonies of his attachment to government; yet upon all occasions he spoke very respectfully of King James, and retained a very high sense of his [7:2:565]clemency in sparing his only son. The remainder of his life he spent in the exercise of his ministry, preaching once every Lord’s day; besides which he had a Thursday lecture, and was one of the lecturers at Pinners Hall. He lived to a great age, and, preserving his spirits to the last, died in May 1703. On grave subjects he wrote with a becoming seriousness; but where wit might properly be shown, he displayed it to great advantage. His funeral sermon was preached by Mr Slater, and his memory will be always preserved by his own learned and elegant writings. Of these the most remarkable, besides his sermons, are, 1. Antisozzo; in vindication of some great truths opposed by Dr William Sherlock, 1675, 8vo; 2. Melius Inquirendum; in answer to Dr Goodman’s Compassionate Inquiry, 1679, 8vo; 3. The Mischief of Impositions; in answer to Dr Stillingfleet’s Mischief of Separation, 1680; 4. A Faithful Reproof to a False Report, with reference to the Differences among the United Ministers in London, 8vo.
