AE, or AE, a diphthong compounded of A and E. Authors are by no means agreed as to the use of the ae in English words. Some, out of regard to etymology, insist on its being retained in all words, particularly technical ones, borrowed from the Greek and Latin; while others, from a consideration that it is no proper diphthong in our language (its sound being no other than that of the simple e), contend that it ought to be entirely disused; and in fact the simple e has of late been adopted instead of the Roman ae, as in the word equator, &c.
