ADANA, a town of Asia Minor, in Natolia, and in the province of Carainania. It is situated on the river Choquen, on the banks of which stands a small but strong castle, built on a rock. It has a great number of beautiful fountains brought from the river by means of water-works. Over the river there is a stately bridge of fifteen arches, which leads to the water-works. The climate is pleasant and healthy, and the winter mild and serene; but the summer is so hot as to oblige the principal inhabitants to retire to the neighbouring mountains, where they spend six months among shady trees and grottos, in a most delicious manner. The adjacent country is rich and fertile, and produces melons, cucumbers, pomegranates, pulse, and herbs of all sorts, all the year round; besides corn, wine, and fruits in their proper season. It is 30 miles north-east of Tarsus, on the road to Aleppo. Long. 36. 12. E. Lat. 38. 10. N.
