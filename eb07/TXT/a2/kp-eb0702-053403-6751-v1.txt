ALMEISAR, a celebrated game among the ancient Arabs, performed by a kind of casting of lots with arrows, strictly forbidden by the law of Mahomet, on account of the frequent quarrels occasioned by it. The manner of the game was thus: A young camel being brought and killed, was divided into a number of parts. The adventurers, to the number of eleven, being met, eleven arrows were provided without heads or feathers; seven of which were marked, the first with one notch, the second with two, the third with three, &c.; the other four had no marks. These arrows were put promiscuously into a bag, and thus drawn by an indifferent person. Those to whom the marked arrows fell, won shares in proportion to their lot; the rest, to whom the blanks fell, were entitled to no part of the camel, but obliged to pay the whole price of it. Even the winners tasted not of the flesh themselves more than the losers, but the whole was distributed among the poor.
