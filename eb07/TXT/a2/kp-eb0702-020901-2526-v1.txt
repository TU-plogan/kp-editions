AFER, Domitius, a famous orator, born at Nismes, flourished under Tiberius, and the three succeeding emperors. Quintilian makes frequent mention of him, and commends his pleadings. But he disgraced his talents, by turning informer against some of the most distinguished personages in Rome. Quintilian, in his youth, cultivated the friendship of Domitius very assiduously. He tells us that his pleadings abounded with pleasant stories, and that there were public collections of his witty sayings, some of which he quotes. He also mentions two books of his On Witnesses. Domitius was once in great danger from an inscription he put upon a statue erected by him in honour of Caligula, wherein he declared that this prince was a second time consul at the age of 27. This he intended as an encomium, but Caligula taking it as a sarcasm upon his youth and his infringement of the laws, raised a process against him, and pleaded himself in person. Domitius, instead of making a defence, repeated part of the emperor’s speech with the highest marks of admiration; after which he fell upon his knees, and begging pardon, declared that he dreaded more the eloquence of Caligula than his imperial power. This piece of flattery succeeded so well, that the emperor not only pardoned, bet also raised him to the consulship. Afer died in the reign of Nero, A. d. 59.
