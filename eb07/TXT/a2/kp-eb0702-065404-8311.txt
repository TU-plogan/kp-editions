AMERSHAM, or Agmondesham,âˆ™ a market and borough town in the hundred of Burnham, in the county of Buckingham. It consists of one long street, with very few good buildings. It has a well-frequented market on Tuesday. It is an ancient borough, and returns two members to parliament, who are nominally chosen by the householders paying taxes, but really by the Drake family, who are proprietors of a large majority of the houses. There are some moderate establishments for manufacturing cotton goods. The population in 1801 was 2130; in 1811, 2370; and in 1821, 2612.
