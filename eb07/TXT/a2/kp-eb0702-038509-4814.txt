ALCAICS, in Ancient Poetry, a denomination given to several kinds of verse, from Alcaeus, their inventor.

The first kind consists of five feet, viz. a spondee or iambic, an iambic, a long syllable, a dactyle, another dactyle. Such is the following verse of Horace:
Omnes ∣ eo∣dem ∣ cogimur, ∣ omnium
Versa|tur ur|na | serius, | ocius,
Sors exitura.

The second kind consists of two dactyles and two trochees; as,
Exili|um imposi|tura ∣ cymbae.

Besides these two, which are called dactylic Alcaics, there is another, simply styled Alcaic, consisting of an [7:2:386] epitrite, a choriambus, another choriambus, and a bacchius. The following is of this species:
Cur timet fla|vum Tibcrim ∣ tangere, cur ∣ olivum?

Alcaic Ode, a kind of manly ode, composed of several strophes, each consisting of four verses; the first two of which are always alcaïcs of the first kind; the third verse is a dimeter hypercatalectic, or consisting of four feet and a long syllable; and the fourth verse is an alcaïc of the second kind. The following strophe is of this species, which Horace calls minaces Alcaei camenae.
Non possidentem mnlta vocaveris
Recte beatnm; rectius occupat
Nomen beati, qui deorum
Muneribus sapienter uti, &c.
