ACROTERIA, in Architecture, small pedestals, usually without bases, anciently placed at the middle or two extremes of pediments or frontispieces, serving to support the statues, &c. It also signifies the figures placed as ornaments on the tops of churches, and the sharp pinnacles that stand in ranges about flat buildings with rails and balusters.â€”Among ancient physicians, it signified the larger extremities of the body, as the head, hands, and feet. It has also been used for the tips of the fingers, and sometimes for the eminence or processes of bones.
