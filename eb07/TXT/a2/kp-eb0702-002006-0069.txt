ABDALLA, the son of Abdalmotalseb, was the father of the prophet Mahomet. He was the most beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth; and when he married Amina, of the noble race of the Zahrites, 200 virgins are said to have died of jealousy and despair. Several other Arabians of eminence bore the same name.
