ADNATA, in Anatomy, one of the coats of the eye, which is called also conjunctiva and albuginea. Adnata is also used for any hair, wool, or the like, which grows upon animals or vegetables.

Adnata, or Adnasceηtia, among gardeners, denote those offsets which, by a new germination under the earth, proceed from the lily, narcissus, hyacinth, and other flowers, and afterwards become true roots.
