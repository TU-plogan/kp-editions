AIKMAN, William, a painter of considerable eminence, was bom in Scotland, October 24. 1682. He was the son of William Aikman, Esq. of Cairney, and was intended by his father to follow his own profession, which was that of an advocate at the Scotish bar. But the genius of the son led him to other studies. He devoted himself to the fine arts, especially that of painting; and having for some time prosecuted his studies in Britain, in the year 1707 he went to Italy, resided in Rome for three years, afterwards travelled to Constantinople and Smyrna, and in 1712 returned to his own country. About the year 1723 he fixed his residence in London, where he followed the profession of painting, and had the good fortune to be patronised by the duke of Argyle, the earl of Burlington, Sir Godfrey Kneller, and other liberal en-couragers of the arts. He painted many portraits of persons of the first rank in England and Scotland, and a large picture of the royal family for the earl of Burlington, now in the possession of the duke of Devonshire, which was unfinished at his death. Some of his portraits painted in Scotland are in the possession of the duke of Argyle, the duke of Hamilton, and others. Mr Aikman died in London, June 4. 1731. Six months previous to his death he had lost a son at the age of 17. The remains of both were removed to Edinburgh, and were interred in the Greyfriars church-yard on the same day. Mr Somerville, the author of the Chace, Mr Mallet, Mr Allan Ramsay the Scotish poet, and Mr Thomson, were among Mr Aikman’s intimate acquaintance; and the muse of each, in elegiac numbers, offered a warm tribute to the memory of their departed friend. The following epitaph, from the pen of Mr Mallet, was engraved on his tomb:
Dear to the good and wise, disprais’d by none,
Here sleep in peace the father and the son;
By virtue, as by nature, close ally’d,
The painter’s genius, but without the pride;
Worth unambitious, wit afraid to shine,
Honour’s clear light, and friendship’s warmth divine.
The son, fair rising, knew too short a date;
But, oh! how more severe the father’s fate!
He saw him torn untimely from his side,
Felt all a father’s anguish—wept, and died.

Mr Aikman’s style of painting was an imitation of the pleasing simplicity of nature. It is distinguished by softness of light, mellowness of shade, and mildness and harmony of colouring. His compositions have more placid tranquillity of ease than boldness of touch and brilliancy of effect. His portraits are supposed to have some resemblance to those of Kneller, not only in the imitation of the dresses of the time, but in the similarity of tint and manner of working.
