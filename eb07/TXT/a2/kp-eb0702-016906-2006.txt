ADZE, or Addice, a cutting tool of the axe kind, having its blade made thin and arching, and its edge at right angles to the handle; chiefly used for taking off thin chips of timber or boards, and for paring away certain irregularities which the axe cannot come at. The adze is used by carpenters, but more by coopers, as being convenient for cutting the hollow sides of boards, &c. It is ground from a base on its inside to its outer edge; so that, when it is blunt, they cannot conveniently grind it without taking its helve out of the eye.
