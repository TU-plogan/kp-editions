ADRIANOPLE, a city of Turkey in Europe, called by the inhabitants Edrené. It is in the province of Romania or Romelia, on the river Marizza, at the spot where the Tundscha and Arda empty their waters into that stream. It is well fortified, and has a strong citadel; and, next to Constantinople, is the largest and most populous city in the Turkish dominions. The streets are irregular, unpaved, and filthy; but some of the buildings, especially the two palaces of the emperor, the seraglio, and the mosque of Sultan Selim II. are in the most magnificent style of Turkish architecture. The dwellings are 16,000, the inhabitants about 105,000, nearly one-half of whom are Greeks, with many Jews and Armenians. These several people are the chief manufacturers, and produce large quantities of silk goods, of Turkish curried red leather, of tanned leather, of woollens of various kinds, of hard ware, and of the best preparations of opium. The trade is extensive, both to Constantinople by caravans of camels, and by sea with other countries. It is supplied with fresh water by means of a noble aqueduct, carried by arches over an extensive valley, which supplies 22 public baths, 52 fountains, and 16 copious wells. It is in Long. 22. 31. E. and Lat. 4L 47. N.
