ADONIS, son of Cinyras, king of Cyprus, the favourite of Venus. Being killed by a wild boar in the Idalian woods, he was turned into a flower of a blood-colour, supposed to be the anemone. Venus was inconsolable’; and no grief was ever more celebrated than this, most nations having perpetuated the memory of it by a train of anniversary ceremonies.^[1. See Adonia.] The text of the Vulgate, in Ezekiel viii. 14, says that this prophet saw women sitting in the temple and weeping for Adonis; but according to the reading of the Hebrew text, they are said to weep for Thammuz, or the hidden one. Among the Egyptians, Adonis was adored under the name of Osiris, the husband [7:2:160] of Isis. But he was sometimes called by the name of Ammuz, or Thammuz, the concealed, to denote probably his death or burial. The Hebrews, in derision, call him sometimes the dead, Psal. cvi. 28. and Lev. xix. 28. because they wept for him, and represented him as one dead in his coffin; and at other times they call him the image of jealousy, Ezek. viii. 3. 5. because he was the object of the god Mars’jealousy. The Syrians, Phoenicians, and Cyprians, called him Adonis; and F. Calmet is of opinion that the Ammonites and Moabites gave him the name of Baal-peor.

Adonis, Adonius, in Ancient Geography, a river of Phoenicia, rising in Mount Lebanon, and falling into the sea, after a north-west course, at Byblus; famous in fable as a beautiful shepherd youth loved by Venus, slain by a boar, and turned into a river.

Adonis, in Botany, Bird's Eye, or Pheasant's Eye.
