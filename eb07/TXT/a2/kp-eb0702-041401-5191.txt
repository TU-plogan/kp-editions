ALEXANDRIAN, in a particular sense, is applied to all those who professed or taught the sciences in the school of Alexandria. In this sense Clemens is denominated Alexandrinus, though born at Athens. The same may be said of Apion, who was born at Oasis; and Aristarchus, by birth a Samothraciam The chief Alexandrian philosophers were, Ammonius, Plotinus, Origen, Porphyry, Jamblicus, Sopater, Maximus, and Dexippus.

Alexandrian is more particularly understood of a college of priests, consecrated to the service of Alexander Severus after his deification. Lampridius relates, that notwithstanding Severus was killed by Maximin, the senate prosecuted his apotheosis, and, for regularity of worship, founded an order of priests or sodales, under the denomination of Alexandrìm. Alexandrian Manuscript, a famous copy of the Scriptures, consisting of four volumes, in a large quarto size, which contains the whole Bible in Greek, including the Old and New Testament, with the Apocrypha and some smaller pieces, but not quite complete. This manuscript is now preserved in the British Museum. It was sent as a present to King Charles I. from Cyrillus Lucaris, patriarch of Constantinople, by Sir Thomas Rowe, ambassador from England to the grand signior, about the year 1628. Cyrillus brought it with him from Alexandria, where probably it was written. In a schedule annexed to it he gives this account,—that it was written, as tradition informed them, by Thecla, a noble Egyptian lady, about 1300 years ago, not long after the council of Nice. But this high antiquity, and the authority of the tradition to which the patriarch refers, have been disputed; nor are the most accurate Biblical writers agreed about its age. Grabe thinks that it might have been written before the end of the fourth century; others are of opinion that it was not written till near the end of the fifth century, or somewhat later.

Alexandrian, or Alexandrine, in Poetry, a kind of verse consisting of 12, or of 12 and 13 syllables alternately; so called from a poem on the life of Alexander, written in this kind of verse by some French poet. Alexandrines are peculiar to modern poetry, and seem well adapted to epic poems. They are sometimes used by most nations of Europe, but chiefly by the French, whose tragedies are generally composed of Alexandrines.
