AILSA, an insulated rock on the western coast of Scotland, between the shores of Ayrshire and Cantyre. It is two miles in circumference at the base, is accessible only at one place, and rises in a pyramidi cal form to the height of 940 feet. A few goats and rabbits pick up a subsistence among the grass and furze; but it is frequented by immense numbers of soland geese and other birds, which are valued for their flesh or feathers. The depth of water around the base is from 7 to 48 fathoms. On one part of the rock are the remains of an old castle, which is said to have been erected by Philip II. of Spain, about the time that the Spanish armada invaded Britain.
