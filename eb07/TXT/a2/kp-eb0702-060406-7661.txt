AMELAND, an island in the North Sea, being a part of the province of Friesland, in the Netherlands, from which it is separated by a strait called the Wat. It contains three villages, one hamlet, and 2970 inhabitants, who chiefly subsist by fishing, by freight, by burning lime from mussel-shells, and by some agricultural pursuits. Some corn is grown, and the cows produce both butter and cheese.
