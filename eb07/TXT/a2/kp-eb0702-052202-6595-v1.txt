ALLEIN, Joseph, the son of Tobias Allein, was born at Devizes, in Wiltshire, in 1633, and educated at Oxford. In 1655 he became assistant to Mr Newton, in Taunton Magdalen, in Somersetshire; but was deprived for nonconformity. He died in 1668, aged 35. He was a man of great learning, and greater charity; preserving, though a nonconformist, and a severe sufferer on that account, great respect for the church, and loyalty to his sovereign. He wrote several books of piety, which are highly esteemed; but his Alarm to Unconverted Sinners is more famous than the rest. There have been many editions of this little pious work, the sale of which has been very great; of the edition 1672 there were 20,000 sold ∙' of that of 1675, with this title, A Sure Guide to Heaven 50,000. There was also a large impression of it with its first title in 1720.

Allein, Richard, an English nonconformist divine, a native of Ditchet, in Somersetshire, was born in the year 1611. His father was rector of Ditchet, and conducted the education of his son until he was prepared for the university. There he soon obtained the degree of master of arts; and after he entered into holy orders, first as an assistant to his father, and afterwards as rector of Batcomb, in Somersetshire, he discharged the duties of a clergyman with great industry and singular fidelity. From his education he conceived an early predilection for the sentiments of the Puritans, and, consequently, in the contest between Charles I. and the parliament he firmly adhered to the latter. Having adopted these sentiments, he sometimes received a little disturbance from the king’s forces; but he never carried his opposition to any undue length. He, along with several others, signed a paper entitled, “The testimony of the Ministers of Somersetshire to the truth of Christ,” in which their declared principles and becoming candour were amply displayed. Along with his father, he was employed by the commissioners appointed by parliament for ejecting scandalous ministers; a commission which was executed with rigour, and originated in intolerance.

Upon the Restoration he manifested a disposition to loyalty, but, unable with a good conscience to unite in the act of conformity, he resigned his living after enjoying it for 20 years, and ranked with the meritorious band of sufferers, to the number of 2000, commonly denominated the ejected ministers. In the house of Mr More, who had been a member of the parliament, he exercised the duties of his ministerial office under the penalty of that act, and was consequently reprimanded by the magistrates and imprisoned; but his piety and exemplary conduct procured him a mitigation of punishment. But no dangers could deter him from duty; for although constrained to remove from that place in consequence of the “five-mile act,” he continued in the discharge of his ministerial office atFrome-Selwood. Here he remained until he terminated his labours by death, in 1681.

Piety, boldness, activity, and candour, shone in the character of Richard Allein. He was admired as a pathetic and practical preacher, and justly respected for the diligence with which he discharged the public and private duties of his profession. Mr Jenkins, the vicar of the parish where he resided, preached his funeral sermon, and bore an honourable testimony to his activity, moderation, and piety. Richard Allein, similar to his nonconformist brethren, chiefly confined his studies and publications to subjects of religion. His works are strongly marked with the peculiar features of the religious character then prevalent among the nonconformists. They have been frequently reprinted, and very much perused. His most celebrated work is Vindiciae Pietatis, or a Vindication or Godliness in its greatest Strictness and Spirituality; with Directions for a Godly Life. This book was published in 1665 without a printer’s name; and being unlicensed, the copies of it were seized and sent to the king’s kitchen for waste paper. The other productions of his pen are, Heaven Opened, or a brief and plain discovery of the riches of God’s Covenant of Grace, printed in 1665; the V orld Conquered, published in 8vo, in 1668; Godly Fear, printed in 8vo, in 1674; a Rebuke to Backsliders, and a Spur for Loiterers, printed in 8vo, in 1677; a Companion for Prayer, in 12mo, 1680; a Brief Character of Mr Joseph [7:2:523] Allein; and Instructions about Heart-work, what is to be done on God’s part and ours for the cure and keeping of the heart,—a posthumous piece published in 8vo, by Dr Annesley, in the year 1681.
