AETHEREAL, Aethereus, something that belongs to, or partakes of, the nature of Aether. Thus we say, the aethereal space, aethereal regions, &c. Some of the ancients divided the universe, with respect to the matter contained therein, into elementary and aethereal. Under the aethereal world was included all that space above the uppermost element, viz. fire. This they supposed to be perfectly homogeneous, incorruptible, unchangeable, &c. The Chaldees placed an aethereal world between the empyreum and the region of the fixed stars. Besides which, they sometimes also speak of a second aethereal world, meaning by it the starry orb; and a third aethereal world, by which is meant the planetary region.
