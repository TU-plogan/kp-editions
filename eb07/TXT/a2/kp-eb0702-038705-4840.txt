ALCIAT, or Alciate, Andrew, a great lawyer, who flourished in the 10th century, was born at Milan. He mixed much of polite learning in the explication of the laws, and happily drove out the barbarity of language which till then had reigned in the lectures and writings of lawyers; for which Thuanus highly praises him. He published a great many law-books, and some notes upon Tacitus. His Emblems have been much admired, and translated into French, Italian, and Spanish; and several learned men have written commentaries on them.
