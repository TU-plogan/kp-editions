GUADALAXARA, a city of New Castille, in the kingdom of Spain, in latitude 40. 33. It is the capital of a department called Alcarria, and is situated near the head of the river Tajuna, which empties itself into the Tagus. It gives name to a province which is 163 leagues in extent, and contains a population of 157,338 souls. The territory is but slightly provided with grain from its own soil, but it produces wine and oil; and there are extensive pastures, on which Merino flocks are fed. In the city there was a considerable manufactory of the best cloths, but, like most royal trading concerns, it proved very unprofitable, and, if restored with the expulsion of the French, must be in a very languishing condition. It employs 656 looms, and 4800 weavers and spinners; there is also one house for soap-boiling, which yearly produces 2250 hundredweight. This city contains 12,000 inhabitants.

Guadalaxara, an intendancy of Mexico in South America. It is bounded on the north by Sonora and Durango, on the east by Zacatecas and Guanaxuato, on the south by Valladolid, and on the west, for an extent of coast of 123 leagues, by the Pacific Ocean. Its length is estimated at about 350 miles, its breadth at about 300, and it has an extent of surface of 9612 square leagues. The eastern part of the intendancy is all table-land, and the climate is agreeable. The maritime regions abound in forests affording excellent timber for ship-building; but here the air is very hot and unhealthy. It is traversed from east to west by the Rio Grande de Santiago, which communicates with the great lake of Chapala. This intendancy was reckoned one of the most valuable in the viceroyalty. Humboldt estimated the value of its agricultural produce in 1802 to be about L.500,000, and its manufactures of woollens, calicoes, tanned hides, and soap, at L.700,000. The chief mines of Guadalaxara are those of Bolanos, Asientos de Ibarra, Hostiotipaquillo, Copalo, and Guichichila. This intendancy contains two cities, six towns, and 322 villages. Guadalaxara, the provincial capital, is situated on the left bank of the Rio de Santiago, in latitude 20. 50. north, and longitude 105. west. It was founded in 1551, and in 1570 was created an episcopal city, the see of Compostella being removed here. It possesses some flourishing manufactures, and, according to the latest accounts, the population amounts to above 70,000. If this be a correct statement, the city must have made very rapid advancement; for Humboldt, an accurate observer, states the population in 1803 at only 19,500. Compostella, the other city, claims a higher antiquity than Guadalaxara. It is situated to the south of Tepic, in latitude 21. 20. north, and longitude 106. 11. west; but little else is known of it except its situation. Indeed, information regarding this intendancy is very scanty, a considerable portion of it still remaining undescribed. There is here a volcanic mountain called Colima, which frequently throws up ashes and smoke. Its elevation is computed to be 9000 feet above the level of the sea, and it forms the western extremity of the volcanic chain which traverses Mexico
