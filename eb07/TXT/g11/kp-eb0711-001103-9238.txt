GUADALCANAL, a town of Spain, in the province of Estremadura. It is the principal mining port of the kingdom. The silver mines have been worked by private companies, most of whom were foreigners. Îœ. Vauquelin, a French chemist, discovered, in analysing some ore, that it contained one tenth of its weight in platina, a metal hitherto only found in two small spots in South America, and recently[7:11:12] in Russia. The interruption given to these mining companies, by the invasion of the French armies, has not yet permitted them to continue their labours; but at some future period they will be resumed, and most probably with great success; and there are more sanguine hopes now entertained, from the great success that, within a few years, the miners for lead have experienced.
