GUADALOUPE, an island in the West Indies, belonging to France, is situated in longitude 62. west, and latitude 16. 20. north. It consists properly of two islands, separated from each other by a narrow channel called Là Riviere Salée, which is navigable by vessels of fifty tons burden. The eastern island or division is called Grande Terre, and the western Basse Terre. Guadaloupe was discovered by Columbus, who found it inhabited by a warlike people; but they were soon subdued by the Spaniards. In 1635 it was taken possession of by the French, who commenced hostilities against the natives; but in 1640 a peace was concluded between the contending parties. For sixty years after its occupation by the French, the island made little advancement; but at length, about the beginning of the eighteenth century, it began to improve, and made rapid progress. In 1759 it was conquered by Britain, but restored to France in 1763. After this period it was twice taken by Britain; but, by the political adjustment of affairs which took place in 1814, it reverted to France, of which country it is now a colony.

Grande Terre is about six leagues in breadth and fourteen in length, and Basse Terre is fifteen leagues in length by fourteen in breadth. The small islands Desiderade on the east, Marie-Galante on the south-east, and the isles Des Saintes on the south, are subject to the government of Guadaloupe. The surface of these islands taken together has been estimated at 334,142 English acres. There are several volcanic mountains in Basse Terre, one of which, called La Soufrière, still emits volumes of smoke, and occasionally sparks of fire. This portion of Guadaloupe is agreeably diversified by hills, woods, gardens, and enclosures. It is also copiously watered, and very fruitful. The wild lemon-tree, the plant which produces gallianum, the erythrina corallodendrum, and the thorny volkameria, grow in the enclosures. The sugar-cane, although it reaches a great height, is of an inferior quality; and the coffee is not equal to that which is produced in some other of the West India islands. The principal town is called Basse Terre. It possesses many fine buildings, fountains, and public gardens, and is defended by a fort, which also commands an open road, having all the advantages of a safe harbour. Grande Terre is marshy, sterile, and flat, and also labours under a deficiency of water. The metropolis, which contains 15,000 inhabitants, is called Pointe à Pitre. It possesses a spacious port, and here the principal part of the trade is carried on. Desiderade is famed for its cotton, and coffee and sugar are raised on the hills of Marie-Galante. The exports consist chiefly of sugar, coffee, cotton, cacao, wood of various kinds, and a little cloves and spices. The value of the imports into France from Guadeloupe in 1831 was 26,642,222 francs, and the exports from France into the island amounted to 12,146,853 francs. By the returns for the same year, 195 ships, of 47,623 tons burden, were entered, and 194 ships, of 47,772 tons burden, were cleared out. According to the last census, which was for the year 1829, the population amounts to 112,111, consisting of whites and people of colour.
