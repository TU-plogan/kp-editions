GUILDFORD, a market-town of the county of Surrey, in the hundred of Woking, thirty miles from London. It is situated on the acclivity of a hill, at the foot of which the navigable river Wye runs. It is composed of three parishes, St Mary, St Nicholas, and Trinity, each of which has its respective church. One of the ancient monasteries is still in existence, but converted into dwelling-houses. The assizes for the county are held here in the summer, alternately with Croydon. It is an ancient corporation, returning two members to parliament, chosen by the householders. There is a well attended market on Saturdays. The population amounted in 1801 to 2634, in 1811 to 2974, in 1821 to 3161, and in 1831 to 3813.
