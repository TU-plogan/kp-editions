GROWTH, the gradual increase of bulk and stature which takes place in animals or vegetables during a certain period. The increase of bulk in such bodies as have no life is called expansion, swelling, &c.

The growth of animals, nay even of the human species, is subject to great variations. A remarkable instance of this was observed in France in the year 1729. At this [7:11:10]time the Academy of Sciences examined a boy who was then only seven years old, but who measured four feet eight inches and four lines in height without his shoes. His mother observed on him at two years of age, the signs of puberty, which continued to increase very quickly, and soon arrived at the usual standard. At the age of four he was able to lift and toss the common bundles of hay in stables into the horsesâ€™ racks; and at the age of six he could raise as much as a sturdy fellow of twenty. But though he thus increased in bodily strength, his understanding was not greater than is usual with children of his age, and their play-things were also his favourite amusements.

Many other instances of extraordinary growth might, if it were necessary, be collected. It is at first sight astonishing that children of such early and prodigious growth do not become giants; but when we consider that the signs of puberty appear so much sooner than they ought, it seems evident that the whole is only a more than usually rapid expansion of the parts, as in hot climates; and accordingly it is observed that such children, instead of becoming giants, always decay and die apparently of old age long before the ordinary term of human life.
