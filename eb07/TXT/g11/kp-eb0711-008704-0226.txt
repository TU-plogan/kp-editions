GURRAH, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Malwah, in a district of the same name. It had formerly a mint. It lies a hundred and forty miles north by east from Nagpoor. Long. 80. 15. E. Lat. 23. 10. N. The district is situated about the twenty-third degree of north latitude. It was formerly the seat of a considerable Hindu principality, but was conquered by the troops of the Emperor Akbar, and afterwards by Aurungzebe. It has been estimated to contain 25,000 square miles of high, mountainous, and unproductive territory. The principal towns are Gurrah, Panagur, and Mundlah; whilst the Nerbuddah, which has its source on the eastern frontier towards Gundwanah, is the chief river. It is a thinly populated and imperfectly cultivated district, though many parts of it are remarkably fertile.
