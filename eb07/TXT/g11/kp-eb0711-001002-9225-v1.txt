GRUBENHAGEN, a province called a principality of the kingdom of Hanover. It consists of three portions, the most westerly of which is surrounded by Brunswick and the province of Göttingen; the centre by the province of Hildesheim, by Brunswick, and the Prussian territory; and the eastern portion by Blankenburg and Brunswick. It extends over 537 square miles, and contains a population of 83,200 persons. The Hartz Forest forms the larger portion of the province, some of the hills of which are 2600 feet in height, and covered to their tops with pine woods. The chief object of the district is mining, which occupies the labour of most of the inhabitants, to the exclusion of agriculture, for which purpose the soil is not adapted. The chief aliments are furnished from the surrounding provinces. In a few of the warm valleys some cows are kept, and in others tobacco and hops are raised. The mines yield gold, silver, copper, lead, iron, zinc, vitriol, and sulphur, and there are some saline springs. There are several manufactories of iron, copper, and brass utensils; and the females in winter spin much linen yarn. The climate is cold, raw, and gloomy, and the inhabitants are in general in a state of great poverty. About three fourths are Lutherans, and one fourth Catholics.
