GURUDWARAH, an extensive village of Northern Hindustan, in the province of Serinagur. It is noted for a handsome temple erected by Ram Roy, the founder of the Sikks; also for a great annual fair held at the vernal equinox, and numerously attended by pilgrims from Lahore and the western countries. The surrounding district is remarkably fertile, but much oppressed by the heavy exactions of the Ncpaulese government.
