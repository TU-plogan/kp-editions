GUIDO Aretin. See Aretin. Guido Rem, an illustrious Italian painter, born at Bologna in 1595. In his early years he was the disciple of Denis Calvert, a Flemish master of good reputation; but afterwards entered himself in the school of the Caracci. He first imitated LudovicoCaracci, but fixed at last on a peculiar style of his own, that secured him the applause of his own time and the admiration of posterity. He was much honoured, and lived in splendour; but an unhappy attachment to gaming ruined his circumstances, and the reflection of his imprudence brought on a languishing disorder, which put an end to his life in 1642. There are several designs of this great master in print, etched by himself.
