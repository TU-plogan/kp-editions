GUBI, a town of Hindustan, in the rajah of Mysoreâ€™s territories. It is a mean looking place, and dirty; but it carries on a considerable trade, and many of the inhabitants are prosperous. Here is held one of the greatest weekly fairs in the country. It is said to have been founded 400 years ago, by the Polygars, who were entirely dispossessed by Tippoo, but, on his overthrow, returned to their original profession of cultivators. Long. 77. 10. E. Lat. 13. 7. N.
