GUALIOR, a strong and very celebrated fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Agra, in a very elevated situation on a hill, one and a half mile in length, but in few places exceeding 300 yards in breadth. At the north end the sides are so steep as to be nearly perpendicular, and its height is 342 feet. It has several reservoirs of good water, and a small river runs close past it. A stone parapet extends all round the slope of the hill, behind which are collected piles of round stones, which form an excellent defence, and it was judged unassailable until it was stormed in 1780 by Major Popham. The town, which stands at the bottom of the hill, is large and populous, and contains many good houses of stone, which is furnished in abundance by the neighbouring hills, that form an amphitheatre round the town and fort at the distance of from one to four miles. The town carries on an extensive trade with the Mahratta and British territories, and derives also considerable benefit from the Mahommedan pilgrims, who visit the town of Ghose al Alum, a celebrated religious person, who is interred within the fort. Gualior is of such antiquity that its origin is lost in remote tradition. It must have been at all times a military post of great consequence, both from its central situation, and its peculiar position, which in the estimation of the natives rendered it impregnable. It is first mentioned in authentic history in the year 1023, when it was summoned by Sultan Mahmoud of Ghiz-πi. It was taken by the Mahommedans in the year 1194, and was used as a state prison, in which several princes met their death from opium or the dagger. On the decline of the Mogul empire, it was taken by the Mahrattas, and afterwards by the British, as mentioned above, in 1780. It was· subsequently taken possession of by Scindia, and during the war of 1804 it again surrendered to the British troops after a breach was made in the walls. It was not, however, taken possession of by them, and by the treaty with Scindia in 1805 it was ceded to that chief. The travelling distance from Delhi is 197 miles, from Lucknow 211, from Benares 355, from Nagpour 480, from Calcutta by Birbhoom 805 miles. Long. 78. 14. E. Lat. 26. 18. N.
