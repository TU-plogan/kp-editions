GUITAR, Guitarra, a musical instrument of the stringed kind, with five double rows of strings, of which those made of brass are in the middle, except it be for the burden, an octave lower than the fourth. This instrument was first used in Spain and by the Italians. In the former country it is still greatly in vogue. There are few of that nation who cannot play on the guitar; and with this instrument they serenade their mistresses at night. In Madrid, and other cities in Spain, it is common to meet in the streets young men equipped with a guitar and a dark lanthorn, who, taking their stations under the windows, sing, and accompany their voices with this instrument; and there is scarcely an artificer or day-labourer in any of the cities or principal towns who does not entertain himself with his guitar.
