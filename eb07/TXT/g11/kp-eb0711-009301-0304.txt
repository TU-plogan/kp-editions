GUZELHISAR, a city of Asia Minor, built upon the site of the ancient Magnesia. It is situated on a hill about three miles in compass, level at the top, and having a steep declivity around. The modern city is at least four miles in circumference, and surrounded by very slight walls: the streets are broader and better laid out than is usual in Turkish cities. It is one of the most considerable towns in Asia Minor, being the residence of the pasha; and carries on a great trade, especially in cotton and cotton yarn. It has also manufactures of coarse calicoes; and considerable quantities of European goods ire imported into the country. It is the residence of Î® any rich merchants, and of opulent families, particularly beys. It has a beautiful appearance, being full of courts and gardens, planted with cypress and orange trees; and the view is beautiful over the plain of the Meander, a finely-enclosed country planted with fig and almond trees. Long. 27. 50. E. Lat. 37. 45. N.
