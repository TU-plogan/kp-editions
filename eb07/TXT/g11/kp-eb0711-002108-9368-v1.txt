GUERNSEY, an island belonging to Great Britain, on the coast of France, being only twenty-five miles from Cape La Hogue, and thirty-five from Cherbourg, whereas it is nearly sixty from Portland, the nearest point in England, and 104 from Southampton, whence the packets usually sail. The south side of the island is hilly, but it gradually descends in proceeding north. The rivulets are numerous, and as snow seldom remains, there is a constant verdant face on the land. Forest trees are rather scarce, but those bearing fruit are numerous and prolific, especially the fig and apple-trees, from the last of which more cider is obtained than the inhabitants consume. Agriculture is not pursued with much skill, but, from the mildness of the climate, and the natural fertility of the soil, enough of wheat and potatoes is raised to supply food to the inhabitants, and all the culinary vegetables are afforded in abundance. There are scarcely any sheep kept in the island; and the cows, though a valuable race for the quantity of milk they yield, are not numerous, so that beef and mutton, and also poultry, are imported from England or France. Many pigs are reared and fattened till they attain a large size, and the bacon made from them forms an important article in the food of the inhabitants. The shores abound with every variety of fish, especially mackerel and whitings.

The commerce of this island consisted chiefly in smuggling French and other spirits, with tea and tobacco, along the coast of England; but the establishment of a customhouse has driven that kind of business into other channels. In time of war, but especially during the American revolutionary war, a great number of privateers were fitted out, and many fortunes made by such adventures. Since that time, great attention has been paid to the Newfoundland fishery, and many hands and much capital have found employment in that branch of commerce. One fourth of the male inhabitants are said to be accustomed to nautical pursuits, and they are generally daring and active seamen. The cluster of islands of which Guernsey forms one, have such rapid currents among them, varying with each change of tide, and are so beset with shoals and rocks, that whoever is accustomed to sail amongst them necessarily acquires a degree of active expertness which is not obtained in less perilous navigations. The inhabitants are for the most part of the Norman race. They speak the French language of an antique dialect, mixed with a number of English words, and are with difficulty understood by the modern natives of either England or France. Amongst the higher classes English is commonly spoken, but with some foreign accentuation. The fashions, articles of fμrniture, and implements of husbandry, are more French than English. The laws are those of ancient Normandy. Their established religion is that of England, and the ecclesiastical affairs are under the Bishop of Winchester; but there are places of worship for various sects of dissenters. The island is divided into ten parishes, with a church for each, all evidently built before the Reformation. The chief town is St Pierre or St Peter’s, containing upwards of 10,000 inhabitants. It has a good harbour, formed artificially by a long pier, and there is a tolerable roadstead near the village of St Martin. The island is about nine miles in length and six in breadth, and extends over ninety-four square miles, or about 60,000 English acres. The population is very dense, having been in 1811, 21,293, in 1821, 20,827, and in 1831, 26,128, of which upwards of 2000 were sailors and strangers. It is between latitude 49. 22. and 49. 33. N., and between longitude 2. 38. and 2. 46. W.
