GUAYAQUIL, an important department of that portion of the South American continent which until recently was designated Colombia; but since the separation of that republic into three different states, Guayaquil, it is presumed, belongs now to that part of Colombia which has resumed the name of New Grenada. It extends along the shores of the Pacific Ocean for about 200 miles, but having a very irregular figure, and being separated into two parts by an arm of the sea. The breadth cannot be determined with any degree of accuracy; it does not however exceed sixty or seventy miles. The country is very fertile, particularly in cocoa, for which there has always been a demand equal to the supply. This has been estimated at 600,000 fanegas, of three bushels each, which sells sometimes at seven dollars per fancga. There are also large plantations of tobacco; timber and salt are exported in vast quantities; and in the savannahs are reared great numbers of horned cattle, mules, and horses, which are driven into the interior. The capital of this department, which bears the same name, is situated on the Bay of Guayaquil, in longitude 79. 4L 15. west, and latitude 2. 11. 30. south. It was founded by Pizarro in 1533, and is now one of the most flourishing cities in South America. The houses are irregularly but picturesquely scattered along the sides and top of a hill. They are commodious and handsome, but the public edifices are destitute of any degree of splendour. The dockyard is of very considerable extent, and vessels of great size have been built here. The fruit of this place is remarkably fine; the plantain in particular is highly relished; but animal food is of inferior quality. Guayaquil is infested with insects and reptiles of a very annoying and even dangerous description. Mosquitoes and other flies, whose bite is most tormenting, abound in the atmosphere; whilst the ground is covered with snakes, centipedes, and other filthy reptiles. The ants are so numerous, that often when articles of diet served up at table are cut open, thousands of these' animals are seen making their escape in all directions, leaving the interior a complete vacuity. Alligators and caymans swarm on the coast, and so great is their fecundity, that no exertion can limit or reduce their numbers. Guayaquil contains about 20,000 inhabitants, (r. r. r.)
