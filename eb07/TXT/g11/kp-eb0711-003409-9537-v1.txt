GUNDUCK, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapoor, in a district of the same name, forty-seven miles east from Darwar. Long. 75. 42. E. Lat. 15. 27. N. It is also the name of a river, the source of which is said to be situated to the northward of Mooktenath, in the direction of Moostang, a place of note in Upper Thibet or Bhoot, twelve days’ journey from Beeni Sheher, and not far from Kaybccni. At this latter place the breadth of the river is not above thirty yards. Four days’journey north is Mooktenath, near which the Gunduck is called Sal-grami; and here it is that are found a curious species of stones, held sacred by the inhabitants. They are mostly round, and perforated in one or more places with worms, which the Hindus, in their degraded superstition, believe [7:11:35] to have been done by Vishnu in the form of that reptile; and the stones are prized in proportion to the number of perforations or spiral curves in each. These stones are called Salgrams. A few grains of gold are occasionally separated from the sand of the Gunduck.
