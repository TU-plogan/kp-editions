GULF, or Gulph, a broad and capacious bay comprehended between two promontories, and sometimes taking the name of sea when it is very extensive, but particularly when it only communicates with the sea by means of a strait. The word comes from the French golfe, and that [7:11:34]again from the Italian golfo, which has the same signification. Some deduce these terms from the Greek xdK<κος, which Gui-shart again derives from the Hebrew 3χ3, gob. Du Cange derives them from the barbarous Latin gulfum or gulfus, which signifies the same thing.
