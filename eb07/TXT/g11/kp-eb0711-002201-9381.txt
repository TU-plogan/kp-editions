GUGAH, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Sinde, and district of Tatta. It stands on a hill, and is bounded on two sides by a rivulet. In the surrounding country there are some large trees, and the soil is remarkably fertile. The town has not much trade, but is well supplied with provisions. The country is low, and so intersected by branches of the Indus that it is flooded at particular seasons of the year. Long. 68. 7. E. Lat. 24. 45. N.
