GUATIMALA, or Guatemala, one of the new states into which the western world is divided. From the circumstance of its position, it has assumed the name of Central America. The constitution is modelled upon that of North America. This republic comprehends that portion of territory which stretches from the southern extremity of Mexico to the northern point of Colombia, from about the eighty-third to the ninety-fourth degree of west longitude. It extends about eight hundred miles in length, comprehending a great part of the isthmus of Panama, and embracing an extent of surface computed at about twenty-two thousand square leagues. This tract of country was subdued by Alvarado, who was sent thither by Cortes, the Spanish general, at that time pursuing his career of conquest in Mexico. Alvarado arrived in the year 1524, at a time propitious for the success of his enterprise, for two of the most powerful nations of the country were then at war. Too jealous of each other to unite against a common enemy, the numerous tribes or nations inhabiting Guatimala fell one by one under the dominion of the Spaniards, notwithstanding that a formidable resistance was made to them in some quarters. The methods resorted to by the Spaniards for reducing the Indians to subjection were similar to those practised in other parts of the American continent. The people whom they subdued by treachery and the sword were not at all inferior to those of Mexico and Peru. The conquerors found large cities, well fortified by castles, and adorned with splendid palaces and other sumptuous edifices. The Guatimalans were of course idolaters, and, with the missal in the one hand and the sword in the other, the Spaniards succeeded in forcing them reluctantly to substitute the Christian worship for their own. One part of the country, however, called Vęra Paz, which baffled the efforts of the Spaniards to subdue it, received milder treatment at the hands of some pious ecclesiastics, who employed persuasion instead of force, and thus succeeded in bringing then also under the Spanish yoke. From the period of its conquest until it declared its independence, the country, under the appellation of the kingdom of Guatimala, was governed by a captain-general appointed by the court of Spain, and a royal audiencia or prétorial court. The jurisdiction of this court extended from eight to seventeen degrees north latitude, and from eighty-two to ninety-five degrees west longitude, comprehending an extent of surface computed at 26,152 square leagues, with a population of about 1,200,000 souls.^[1. Humboldt’s Political Essay, vol. iv. p. 322.] The kingdom was divided into fifteen provinces, which were governed by inferior officers, amenable to the audiencia. There was scarcely any thing like a military force kept up, but spiritual matters were managed by a competent number of ecclesiastics, under the direction of the Archbishop of Guatimala, and four suffragans. Things continued in this state until the political events which took place in various parts of South America increased the discontent which had been generated in Guatimala by some acts of despotism committed by the mother country. In the year 1821, when the fate of Mexico was decided, several meetings of the most influential individuals took place, at which it was agreed to shake themselves free of Old Spain. Several of the provinces joined together and published a manifesto to this effect; but San Salvador protested against it, and immediately formed a provisional government of its own. The government of Guatimala dispatched troops to attack San Salvador, but they were repulsed. In this emergency they solicited support from Mexico, which being granted, San Salvador yielded to General Filisola in February 1823. In March the general congress was convoked, and in the month following it met and assumed the name of Constituent Assembly. To this congress all the provinces sent deputies, with the exception of Chiapa, which continued firm in its adherence to Mexico. One of the first acts of the constituent assembly, after the nomination of an executive, was to publish a decree, declaring “these provinces independent of Spain, Mexico, and every other power, either of the old or new world.” This decree is dated the 1st of July 1823. Towards the end of the same year was published the basis of its future constitution, by which Guatimala was declared a federal republic, comprehending five states, joined together under the denomination of the United Provinces of Central America.

It was ordained that the legislative power should reside, first, in a federal congress, composed ofrepresentatives elected by the people; and, secondly, in a senate, composed ol two senators popularly elected by each state. The privileges of this body were, to sanction the acts of the federal congress, to counsel the executive on important cases, to nominate the individuals employed by the federation, and to watch over their conduct. The executive power was declared to be vested, 1. in a president popularly chosen; 2. in a vice-president; and, 3. in a supreme court of justice. The internal affairs of each state were decreed to be regulated by itself upon the following principles: 1. By an assembly of deputies properly chosen; 2. by a council, similarly elected; 3. by a chief; 4. by a vice-chief; and, 5. by a supreme court of judicature. These individuals or bodies were invested with certain definite powers, by which, it was hoped, good government would be obtained, and equal justice administered to the people. The constituent assembly now began to form a constitution, leaving, in the mean time, the different states to regulate their own concerns. The assembly subsequently had various sittings, and drew up a great number of articles, by which the government was to be regulated. Guatimala, however, like the republics in the South American continent, has never remained at rest with itself since it was erected into a free state. Continual insurrections have broken out; at one time one party, at another time another party, predominating. Peace and good order can scarcely be said to be as yet restored to it. The following table exhibits the number of departments, towns, and villages, in each state :—

I. Guatimala, consisting of thirteen departments. Capital, Guatimala.
[table]

Comprises about 114 towns and villages. Population computed at 700,000.
[7:11:17]

II. Salvador, consisting of four departments. Capital, San Salvador.
[table]

Comprehends fifty-five towns and villages. The population is computed at 350,000.

III. Honduras, consisting of twelve departments. Capital, Comayagua.
[table]

Comprehends fifty-seven towns and villages. The »population is computed at 200,000.

IV. Nicaragua, consisting of eight departments. Capital, Leon.
[table]

Comprehends fifty-three towns and villages. The population is computed at 200,000.

V. Costa Rica, consisting of eight departments. Capital San José.
[table]

Comprehends twenty-one towns and villages. The population is computed at 50,000.

These five states, taken together, exhibit the figure of an irregular triangle, the vertex of which is in the province of Panama, and the base in the line that separates the country from New Spain. They are bounded on the west and north-west by Mexico, on the south-east by the province of Veraguas, on the north by the Atlantic, and on the south and south-west by the Pacific. Our knowledge of the physical geography of Guatimala is imperfect. Generally speaking, the face of the country is covered with mountains, but their elevations, or the volcanic phenomena which they exhibit, are but little known. The mountains, in some places bordering on the Atlantic, in others coasting the Pacific, and again in situations traversing the middle of the isthmus, give their own peculiar character to the country. The prevailing rocks are granite and porphyry; and in crossing them the traveller often feels himself transferred from a hot to a cold and chilling temperature. The productions, of course, vary in their nature, according to the elevations where they grow. At a height of from twelve to fourteen hundred feet, indigo, cotton, and cocoa flourish. At an elevation of from four to five thousand feet the productions of the temperate zone exhibit themselves. Wheat is cultivated upon lands from six to nine thousand feet above the level of the ocean; and on the tops of the highest mountains the hardy pine is to be found. There are a number of volcanoes, which have at different times spread terror and destruction over the contiguous country. In the valley of Guatimala stands the three-peaked Volcan de Fuego, from which the old city has repeatedly suffered injury, and which still, by occasionally emitting smoke and flame, seems to threaten an eruption. Other seven volcanoes exhibit the same phenomena, and may be said to remain still in a state of activity. These are Tajamulco, in the province Quezaltenango; Izalco, near Sonzonate; Momotombo and Mazaya, in Nicaragua; St Vincent and St Salvador, in the state of the same name; and Atitan, situated in one of the interior provinces, and which sent forth an eruption 'in 1827. It was accompanied by an earthquake; and throughout Guatimala earthquakes are frequent. The rivers are numerous, but not in general navigable, except by canoes. They are, besides, rapid, owing to the steep acclivity of their course, and their entrance is obstructed by bars. The largest river is the Lempa, which runs chiefly through the province of San Salvador. At its lowest ebb it is an hundred and forty yards in breadth, and its current is very rapid. Of lakes there are three of considerable size and depth. The Lake of Nicaragua is of vast extent; and should the proposal of a junction between the Pacific and it take place, it will become of great importance in a commercial point of view. Lake Peten is said to be twenty-six leagues in circumference, and in some parts thirty fathoms deep. Lake Atitan covers eight leagues from east to west, and four from north to south. Its depth has not been fathomed; and although several rivers flow into it, there is no visible outlet for the waters which it thus receives. These, and numerous other sheets of water, abound in fish; in many of them there are little islands, picturesquely wooded, and in some instances inhabited. On the banks of the rivers, and on the shores of one or two of the lakes, salt is collected in, large quantities, and constitutes a considerable branch of trade in some of the provinces. Medicinal and other springs, both cold and hot, are found in various parts of the country.

Of the zoology of Guatimala little is known. Of the quadrupeds usually found in such climates there is abundance; and of the feathered tribes there is an infinite variety, from the minute and beautiful humming-bird to the heavy-winged vulture. The quezal, from the beauty of its plumage, is perhaps the most remarkable. The guacamaya, or great macaw, the wild peacock, the raxon, the chiőn, and the chulpilchoc, also attract the traveller of the woods by the splendour of the colours which they exhibit. In the warmer provinces serpents and reptiles infest every bush; and those smaller animals which .come under the head of entomology are of every genus and species. In short, every branch of the animal kingdom of Guatimala abounds in objects of interest. Nor is the vegetable kingdom less productive. During the whole of the year the greater part of the mountains and plains are covered with a profusion of beautiful flowers. Forty genera of fruits are reckoned to grow spontaneously upon the hills. There are numerous thick forests, in which valuable woods of great size are to be found in abundance. Cedars are met with exceeding five fathoms in circumference, and mahogany trees of little less magnitude. Resins, balsams, and medicinal herbs, are also abundant. Of almost every production, both of a tropical and intertropical climate, may be enumerated amongst grains, maize, producing in some places three hundred fold, and sometimes two or three crops annually; wheat, barley, and rice. Potatoes, greens, and all other kinds of vegetables, are also abundant. Amongst fruits may be enumerated several species of plantains, apples, pine-apples, peaches, and apricots; whilst pears, melons, grapes, oranges, figs, cherries, pines, and a great many others little known in Europe, are everywhere to be met with. To these maybe added, as productions of the country, bark, sarsaparilla, cinnamon, hellebore, coffee, ginger, cassia, tamarinds, aniseed, Brazil wood, indigo, cocoa, cochineal, vanilla, sugar, flax, tobacco, cotton of various species, pepper, sulphur, saltpetre, musk, and a multitude of other articles.
[7:11:18]

We shall now give a brief account of the different provinces. Guatimala is the central province, comprehending the great chain of volcanic mountains, and the slope downwards from them to the sea. Within these mountains is situated what is called the great valley of Guatimala, which consists properly of nine valleys. There is great variety of climate, and the productions of the country are found in the highest perfection. ∙ The city of Guatimala, the present capital of the republic, is situated in the midst of the plain of La Virgen, which is five leagues in diameter, and forms part of the valley of Mexico, one of the nine small valleys. The city lies in 14. 37. north latitude, and 90. 30. west longitude, and is ninety leagues from the Atlantic, twenty-six from the Pacific, and four hundred from the city of Mexico. The valley is very fertile, being watered by several streams; and the city is surrounded by numerous villages, which supply its markets with fruits and vegetables. The houses consist only of one storey, and occupy a great space of ground; so that, to the eye of a European, the city, when viewed from a distance, appears to be much more populous and extensive than it really is. It contains about sixty manaznas i or squares of houses, formed by the intersection of streets at right angles, which vary in extent from a hundred and fifty to three hundred and fifty yards in front; and these are arranged so as to form one large square. On each side of the city, as the suburbs have increased, other houses have been erected, without much regard to uniformity. The streets are broad, but ill paved; and sloping downwards from each side, they form a gutter in the middle. The market-place is a square extending about one hundred and fifty yards each way, with a fountain in the middle. Besides the daily market, there are numerous temporary stalls; and the square is surrounded by buildings, offices, and shops. The public edifices are numerous, consisting of a university with twelve professorships, five convents, four nunneries, a cathedral, four parish churches, and fifteen other churches or chapels of minor importance. There are also a treasury, mint, government offices, and a spacious prison. The style of architecture is in general good, and some of the buildings are handsomely decorated. The houses are well built and commodiously arranged, and there is generally attaehcd to them a stone reservoir for containing water. The city is remarkably well supplied with water. From a spring in the mountains it is conducted by pipes into twelve public reservoirs, from which it is distributed to every private dwelling. There are here two public or endowed schools for boys, and the girls are taught in the convents; but the Guatimalans in general are very imperfectly educated. Literature is at a very low ebb, although there are various printing establishments, and several newspapers are published. The religious processions which take place here are very numerous, but they partake more of buffoonery than solemnity. Guatimala is situated at about five hundred feet above the ocean level, in a temperate and salubrious climate, being neither exposed to the intensity of a summer’s sun, nor to the stormy blasts of winter. The average heat during the day is about 69 degrees in the shade; and throughout the year the thermometer scarcely varies. The scenery of the surrounding country is majestic and beautiful, and the soil is capable of producing all kinds of fruits and vegetables; but it is very much negleetcd. The cultivation of the cochineal insect has since 1821 been pushed to a great extent. Large plantations are situated in the neighbourhood of the city. Earthquakes sometimes occur; but they are not so destructive now, ås, from the accounts of the early historians, we are led to believe that they previously were. The population has been estimated at about 35,000, consisting of European Spaniards, white Creoles, Mulattoes, and Indians.

La Antigua, or Old Guatimala, is situated some leagues nearer to the Pacific Ocean. It was formerly one of the handsomest cities in the new world, the seat of an archbishop, and the metropolis of the kingdom. Previously to 1773, it had been to a greater or less extent destroyed by earthquakes; and in that year seven successive shocks were experienced, upon which the governor issued a decree, commanding the citizens to quit their habitations, and remove farther from the volcanoes. This they were compelled to obey; and the government was accordingly transferred to New Guatimala. The old city remained in a deserted and ruinous condition for some time, until at length many of its former occupants resumed their old habitations; and again it has gradually become peopled, and partially rebuilt. It is still, however, far inferior in size and population to the new capital.

There are few other towns in Guatimala of sufficient importance to require a detailed description. The inhabitants of the province are employed, first, as carriers, in which capacity they supply all the other states; secondly, in the production of cochineal, a little indigo, about five hundred cargoes of cocoa, and some flour; and thirdly, in the manufacture of some coarse woollens, of which it is calculated a quantity equal in value to two hundred thousand dollars is furnished to the other states.

The province of Salvador, anciently called Cuscatlan, or the land of riches, is bounded on the south by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by Honduras, on the east by Nicaragua, and on the west by Guatimala. The natural productions of this province appear to be similar to those of Guatimala. It possesses mines of silver, iron, and other metals; and a considerable quantity of indigo is produced, in which consists the chief trade of Salvador. Sugar and cotton are also raised, and the inhabitants are principally employed in the cultivation of these, particularly the former article. San Salvador, the capital, was founded in 1528 by the Spaniards, who had conquered the country three years previously to that period. This city, which now ranks second in the republic, is situated in 13. 36. north latitude, and 89. 46. west longitude, at the distance of eight leagues from the Pacific Ocean. It is surrounded by hills and mountains covered with wood, and terminating on the north-east in a dormant volcano. The streets run in right angles, the houses are commodious, and the market is well supplied. It contains a population of about 16,000 inhabitants.

The province of Honduras stretches east and west on the shores of the Atlantic. It is bounded by the Bay of Honduras on the north, by Nicaragua on the south-east and east, by San Salvador on the south, and by the department of Chiquimula on the west. Its territory is for the most part rugged and mountainous, but rich in metals. The whole coast is flat, marshy, hot, and extremely unhealthy, although some parts of the interior rise into hilly and temperate tracts. In consequence of the unpropitious nature of the climate, this part of the country is thinly peopled. It abounds in thick forests, containing the most valuable mahogany and logwood trees. Comayagua, the capital of the province, is situated in a beautiful plain, in about 14. 50. north latitude, and 87. 46. west longitude, and is distant from Guatimala about a hundred and forty-four leagues. Truxillo, formerly the capital of a province, stands on an elevation of about thirty yards above the level of the sea, in latitude 15. 48. north, and longitude 86. west. This place is well fortified, but the population is small. Gracias a Dios, once a flourishing city, is situated about thirty-eight leagues from Comayagua, in latitude 14. 40. north, and longitude 88. 30. west. At present the population is small, and the city itself is in a state of great decay. The inhabitants of Honduras are principally employed in the rearing of about forty thousand head of cattle, introduced annually into San Salvador and Guatimala, and in the cultivation of tobacco. [7:11:19] The British settlement of Honduras, situated in the province of Merida or Yucutan, belonging to Mexico, is uniformly, in works upon geography, described along with Guatimala; but as it is now beyond the limits of that republic, an account of it will be given under the head of Honduras.

The province of Nicaragua is bounded on the north by Honduras, on the east by the Atlantic, on the south by Costa Rica and the Pacific Ocean, and on the west by Tegucigalpa, a department of Honduras. From west to east it extends eighty-five leagues, and from north to south about seventy-five. The chain of the volcanic Andes here terminates, and the territory is in general low and moist. It is rich in all the tropical fruits, but those peculiar to a temperate zone are not to be met with. Here there are vast savannahs, covered with herds of cattle, some of which are sent to the city of Guatimala. Leon, or San Leon de Nicaragua, is situated in latitude 12.20. north, and long. 86. 16. west. It is four leagues from the Pacific, and a hundred and eighty-three from Guatimala. Previously to the revolution, it was one of the most beautiful cities of the kingdom, and was rapidly advancing in prosperity when political animosities split the inhabitants into parties; but the city was torn to pieces by the factions, and for a time nearly deserted. Nicaragua is not very large, but occupies an advantageous position on the north-western shore. It contains about 7000 inhabitants, of whom about 1000 are Spaniards, with a college, which, in 1812, was converted into a university. Mazaya, a village containing about 6000 inhabitants, almost entirely Indian, is said to be the most trading place in the province, though inconveniently situated at the bottom of a deep rocky dell, which is almost destitute of water. The inhabitants of this province are chiefly employed in the breeding of cattle, and in raising cocoa.

Costa Rica, or Rich Coast, notwithstanding its name, is the poorest and most destitute of all the provinces. It extends an hundred and sixty leagues from west to east, and about sixty leagues from north to south. Its climate is warm but healthy, and its population very widely scattered. It has however mines of gold and silver, once said to have been rich, but now unproductive. Cartago, the ancient capital, is situated in about 9. 10. north latitude, and 82.46. west longitude, four hundred leagues east-south-east from Guatimala, thirty leagues from the Atlantic, and thirty from the Pacific. San José, to which the seat of government was transferred about the time of the revolution, has about the same amount of population. There is little trade except in mahogany and cedar, which is shipped from Peru, the inhabitants of this province raising little more of any article than is necessarily consumed within itself. The growth of maize, and the manufacture of panelas (small loaves of unrefined sugar prepared from the cane), are common to all the states.

To the east and south-east of the province of Honduras lies a tract of country called Poyais and the Mosquito shore. It consists of a vast and savage forest, beat by the burning rays of the sun, and occupied by a race of Indians, who consider themselves as under the protection of Britain, although the British government claims no territory in this part of the country. The Mosquito-men possess great muscular strength. Tall and erect, and little encumbered with clothing, with vacant countenances, and long greasy hair, they present a wild and savage appearance, and afford fine specimens of the powerful barbarian. Poyais is memorable on account of the unhappy issue of an attempt made by some Englishmen to form a settlement in this quarter, whither they had been led by the promises and representations of an adventurer, called, or calling himself, a cacique.

With regard to agriculture and commerce, Guatimala is still very far behind, considering her natural resources« ∣ One great drawback to improvement in this respect is, the great expense attending the transport of goods by land, and the want of proper ports, upon the coast. On the Pacific, the only ports frequented are Conchagua, situated a few leagues from San Salvador, which possesses an excellent harbour; and Acajutla, an unsheltered bay, five leagues from Sonzonate, which is used as the port of Guatimala. From this place it is fifty-five leagues distant, and the road lies over a rough and mountainous tract of country. Another point, however, has been fixed upon as an eligible spot for a harbour. It has been called the Port of Independencia; and, as it is situated nearer to the capital, and the road lying between the two places is better than the other, it affords every convenience and advantage for carrying on an extensive traffic in the Pacific Ocean. For some years previously to the revolution, the commerce was retrograding; but since that event occurred, it has certainly improved. The most important production of the country is indigo, which is celebrated for its excellence. Of the exact quantity raised no idea can be formed. The cultivation of cochineal has rapidly increased. In 1826, or about five years after its introduction, the harvest was estimated at ninety thousand pounds. Considerable quantities of tobacco and cotton are also raised; and sugar and cocoa are likewise cultivated, but little coffee is grown. There are some manufactures in the country; but articles of wearing apparel, and those for domestic use, are principally imported from Europe. The only remaining source of national wealth is the mines. Since the revolution some very exaggerated statements have been published as to the mineral wealth of Guatimala, and several of the mines are in the hands of companies, who are attempting to work them; but, by all accounts, the speculation will not be so profitable as was anticipated, the working of the mines being expensive. Of the amount of foreign goods imported into Guatimala only a rude guess can be formed. It has been estimated at about two millions of dollars, whilst the quantity of produce exported does not amount to two thirds of that sum. The exports consist chiefly of cochineal, indigo, cocoa, cotton, hides, and drugs. The imports are principally made by the ports of Omoa and Yzabal. The former, which is about an hundred leagues distant from Guatimala, is the principal depot for goods from the Havannah and the peninsula, with which some small trade is carried on; and the latter for British merchandise from Belize, in the British territory of Honduras. The goods are transported from one place to another by means of mules, which are rather scarce in the country. By the parliamentary papers for 1831, it appears that during that year the official value of the imports from Guatimala into Great Britain amounted to L.8065. 4s. 6d.

Notwithstanding all its advantages, the chief of which is the variety of its productions, it is much to be doubted whether Guatimala will ever attain to any very high pitch of prosperity as a nation. Indeed this will be nearly impossible, until the present inhabitants, who have little enterprise, and are very indolent, shall have their moral character elevated by a large infusion of European intellect and industry. It would seem that at present the very advantages which Guatimala possesses were the means of retarding its improvement. For, in countries where the soil is so rich and the climate so propitious as to produce spontaneously almost all the necessaries of life, which, to a considerable extent, can be appropriated at pleasure by the natives, there is an inducement held out to indolence which cannot well be resisted, especially by a population at least two fifths of whom are of a low order of intellect; individuals who are sufficiently satisfied with such articles as are necessary for their own subsistence, without[7:11:20] having any regard to personal aggrandisement or extension of individual power. Guatimala contains about one million and a half of inhabitants, who are mixed in the following proportions, according to the authorities of Humboldt and Thomson:^[2. Thomson’s Narrative of an Official Visit to Guatimala.] l
[table]

A society consisting of four different classes, which are not only distinct from one another, but which present nearly opposite characteristics, can scarcely be supposed ever to become firmly knit together so as to constitute a strong political body. Speaking generally, the strength of states results from the union of the people; and union arises from congeniality of feeling, identity of interests, similarity of habits and tastes, and such an equality of moral character as is usually met with amongst the individual races of mankind. But in Guatimala, the Europeans, proud of their Castillian blood, look with contempt upon the natives, whom they place far below them in intelligence, which the latter have no alternative but to acknowledge, though at the same time they accuse the Spanish nation of being the cause of all he evils which have distracted the country. The Europeans are chiefly composed of individuals who left their own country young, and by their talents and industry acquired wealth in Guatimala. The leading Americans, or white Creoles, are descendants of the Spaniards, who at an earlier period acquired fortunes in the same place. The latter are again divided into two parties, the liberals, and the serviles or noblesse as they call themselves, both differing widely' in feeling and in sentiment. The next class is the mulatto or mixed race, which forms as it were the physical force of the nation; for whilst they would seem to equal or nearly equal the Indians in numbers, they possess an energy and cunning, a sort of rude intelligence, to which the latter have no pretensions. This mixed people are always impressed into the service of either of the two former classes during civil dissensions. The last class, or aboriginal Indians, are the lowest of all in every respect; but they in some measure assist in balancing the other powers, for they thoroughly hate the mixed race. The greater proportion of the Indians live in villages built after the Spanish manner, and employ themselves variously in raising maize and vegetables, manufacturing mats and baskets, or as porters and carriers; a seeond portion live on farms, where they are regularly employed; and both .these classes arc governed by officers chosen from amongst themselves. There are other two classes, the Indians composing which either live in x huts or long straggling villages, or form, like the Lazzaroni of Italy, a sori of half mendicant race, lounging in idleness during the day, and sleeping at night under the piazzas of the squares. The Indians have been known at times to display considerablehardihood and daring, but they are generally characterised by pusillanimity. This, however, only applies to the interior Indians; the unsubdued Mosquito-men are remarkable for their reckless valour and invincible energy. The Indian of Guatimala, although incapable of violent effort, can endure considerable fatigue. Of his capacity for improvement by superior education, little can be said with certainty, as the experiment does not seem to have been made upon a scale ample enough to entitle us to form a correct judgment upon the subject. Some of those who have been admitted into convents have displayed ability: and others in whom talent was apparent, have been educated at the university, where they displayed some quickness of apprehension; but after a few years, they became addicted to intoxication, and relapsed into their original ( barbarism. The Indians excel in the imitative arts, and mould waxen figures with taste, ingenuity, and correctness , to nature. The only dress of the men consists of a cincture made of pita (the fibres of a plant, which, when twisted, resemble the thread made of hemp); and the women wear merely a light cotton dress from the middle downwards. The houses are nearly destitute of furniture; a mat spread on the floor, or at best a small hammock, serves for a bed. Their food consists chiefly of maize variously prepared. Thus, with his hut and his native corn, the Indian passes his days in indolence, alike ignorant of intellectual enjoyment and the luxuries and refinements of civilized life. (r. r. r.)
