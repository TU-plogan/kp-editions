VALERIUS MAXIMUS, a Latin writer of the age of Tiberius. His praenomen is by some supposed to have been Publius, by others Marcus. We learn from different passages of his own work, that he served in Asia with Sextus Pompeius, and returned to Rome after the death of Sejanus, or towards the end of the reign of Tiberius. This S. Pompeius was consul during the year when Augustus died. The work of Valerius, “Dictorum Factorumque memorabilium libri novem,” he inscribed to the successor of that emperor. It is valuable, not from any peculiar elegance of diction, but for its copious and variegated collection of ancient anecdotes of public and private life. According to the opinion of some critics, his composition has not descended to our times in its original form, but as it was reduced to an epitome, either by Julius Paris, or by Januarius Nepotianus. It is however far from being certain that his work was remodelled. See Vossius de Historicis Latinis, p. 123, and Fabricii Bibliotheca Latina, tom. ii. p. 50. edit. Ernesti.

The earliest edition of Valerius Maximus is supposed to have been printed at Strasburg by Mentelin. It is a folio volume without date, but conjectured to be at least as early as the year 1470. An edition which appeared soon after this period, has very frequently been described as the first. It was printed by P. Schoeffer de Gernshem, Mogunt. 1471, fol. And the same year produced an edition by V. de Spira, Venet. 1471, fol. After some intermediate editions, other two proceeded from the press of Aldus, Venet. 1502,1514, 8vo. Many editions afterwards appeared, several with annotations by Pighius, and a few with brief notes by Lipsius. Among the early impressions, we may specify that which contains the annotations of Pighius and Colerus, Francof. 1627, 8vo. A very elaborate and valuable edition, accompanied with a great body of notes, was at length published by Torrenius, Leidae, 1726, 4to. Several other editions have more recently appeared; and among these we may venture to recommend that of Kapp. Lipsiae, 1782, 8vo.
