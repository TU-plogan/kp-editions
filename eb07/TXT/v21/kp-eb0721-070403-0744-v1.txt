VOW, a solemn religious promise or oath. The use of vows is found in most religions. They form a considerable part of the Pagan worship, being made either in consequence of some deliverance, under some pressing necessity, or for the success of some enterprize. Among the Jews, all vows were to be voluntary, and made by persons wholly in their own power; and if such person made a vow in any thing lawful and possible, he was obliged to fulfil it. If he appointed no particular time for accomplishing his vow, he was bound to do it instantly, lest by delay he should prove less able, or be unwilling to execute his promise. Among the papists, a person is constituted a religious by taking three vows, that of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Vows among the Romans, signified sacrifices, offerings, presents, and prayers made for the Caesars, and emperors, particularly for their prosperity and the continuance of their empire. These were at first made every five years, then every fifteen, and afterwards every twenty, and were called quinquennalia, decennalia, and vicennalia.
