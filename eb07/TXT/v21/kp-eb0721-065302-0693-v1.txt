VIOLIN, a bow-instrument of considerable compass, and great powers of expression and execution. Its origin is obscure. The best violins are those of the old Cremona makers, Jerome, Anthony, and Nicholas Amati, and Stradivarius and Guarnerius, and F. and T. and G. B. Ruggiero. Next in quality are those of Jacob Steiner, and of the two Klotz, father and son, Tyrolese makers. The difference between the tone of the Cremona violins and the Tyrolese has been compared to the difference between the tone of a flute and a clarinet. The violin has four strings, tuned G, D, A, E, reckoning upwards. The lowest string is covered with fine silvered copper wire. Some persons have used silver, or even gold wire, which does not corrode like the copper. Gross impositions are often practised by unprincipled dealers in pseudo-Cremona violins. Like copies of old pictures, they deceive many purchasers. Many of the finest violins of the old makers have been destroyed by ignorant repairers, or by capricious alterations made at the desire of ignorant amateurs. See article Music.
