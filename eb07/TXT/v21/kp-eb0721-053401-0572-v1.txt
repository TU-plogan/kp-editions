V or v is properly a consonant, and as such is placed before all the vowels; as in vacant, venal, vibrate, &c. Though the letters v and u always had two sounds, they had only the form v till the beginning of the fourth century, when the other form was introduced, the inconvenience of expressing two different sounds by the same letter having long before been observed. In numerals V stands for five; and with a dash added at top, thus V̅, it signifies 5000.

In abbreviations, among the Romans, V. A. stood for veterani assignatis V. B. viro bono; V. B. A. viri boni arbitratu; V. B. F. vir bonae fidei; V. C. vir consularis; V . C. C. F. vale, conjux charissime, feliciter; V. D. D. voto dedicatur; V. G. verbi gratia; Vir . Ve. virgo vestalis; VL. videlicet; V. N. quinto nonarum.
