VAR, a department of the south-east of France, formed out of the eastern part of ancient Provence. It extends in north latitude from 43° 2' to 44° 0', and in east longitude from 5° 29' to 6’ 59' and comprehends 2854 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Lower Alps, on the north-east by Piedmont, on the south-east and the south by the Mediterranean sea, and on the west by the mouths of the Rhone. It is divided into four arron-disements, which are subdivided into thirty-five cantons, and those into 210 communes.

The population in 1836 amounted to 323,404 persons, all of whom adhere to the Romish communion, or, if there are any protestants, they are in no place so numerous as to form a congregation for public worship. The language of the common people is the Provençal, but in the cities and towns the French is gradually driving out the ancient tongue. The face of the country presents mountains, rocks, hills, valleys, and small plains, with some beautiful and even romantic prospects. The north and north-east parts are the most mountainous, as they contain a portion of the maritime Alps, proceeding out of Piedmont, which, for the most part, are bare of trees, and, especially on their south sides, exhibit naked perpendicular precipices. These are all calcareous, but a range extends from Hieres to Frejus, which are of granite, and more thick of trees, among which are cork, chesnut, cestus, myrtle, and firs. In the western part is the remarkable mountain Saint Beaume, with a labyrinth in the calcareous substance of it, that extends from the western boundary of the department, the mouths of the Rhone, to Ollioules, and is well known by the name of les faux d’Ollioules. In general the soil is far from fertile, and is more indebted to the labour of the inhabitants than to its quality for its powers of production. It is better adapted for fruits, such as grapes and olives, than for wheat, barley, or other grain.

The department is watered by numerous mountain streams. The river which gives name to the department, rises in the mountain Camelione in Piedmont, receives the water of the Esteron, forms many small islands, and, after a course of sixty miles, enters the Mediterranean; but it is not navigable in any part. Along the sea-shore are numerous pools and morasses, some of which communicate with the sea.

The climate is mild, the great heats of summer being tempered by the breezes from the sea and the mountains. Rain is unusual, except when the wind drives the clouds from the sea. With the exception of about twenty days, there is a continual spring; and even in those few days the thermometer seldom sinks to the freezing point. In January the fields are clothed with fresh green, and in February the trees put forth their blossoms.

Agriculture is in a neglected state, so that the corn produced does not supply half the consumption, and in summer the grass is so burnt up, that the cattle must be driven to the mountains for pasture. Neither cows, sheep, nor horses are abundant, but many swine are bred and fattened. The chief beasts of burden are asses and mules.

The chief productions are wine, oil, silk, and the better kinds of fruit, oranges, citrons, and lemons, some dried fruits, a few dates, and abundance of chesnuts and other kinds of nuts. Honey and wax are collected in considerable quantities. There are no minerals raised, except about 600 tons of fossil coal. On the sea-shore a sufficiency of salt is produced by the natural heat of the sun. The fishery on the coast yields abundance of tunny, anchovies, sardinias, and mackerel, with a small but delicate small fish called the monnat. The manufactures are inconsiderable, and merely for home consumption. The department elects three deputies for the legislative chamber.
