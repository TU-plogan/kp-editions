VEII, a city of ancient Etruria, and long the powerful rival of Rome; distant about 100 stadia, or twelve miles, to the north-west, and situated on a high and steep rock. It was taken after a siege of ten years by Camillus, six years before the taking of Rome by the Gauls. The spot on which it stood lies near Isola in St Peterâ€™s patrimony.
