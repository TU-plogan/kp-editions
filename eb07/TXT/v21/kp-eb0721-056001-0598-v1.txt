VARNA, a city of Turkey in Europe in the province of Silistra. It stands on the Black sea, at the mouth of the river of the same name. It is strongly fortified, and considered as one of the most important defences o∙' the southern division of Turkey in Europe. The obstinate defence of it, in the late war with Russia, shows both its strength and its consequence. The harbour is good, and is the only one [7:21:561] belonging to Turkey on that side of the Black sea. It is the seat of a Greek bishop, under whom are two churches. There are twelve mosques, 4000 houses, and about 20,000 inhabitants, among whom are a few Franks, and many Armenians, Greeks, and Jews. Varna has considerable shipping and fisheries, and much trade in corn, butter, cheese, and wine. Lat. 43. 17. 30. Long. 27.45. E.
