VIGO, a sea-port of Spain, in the province of Galicia, more remarkable for the excellence of the bay on which it stands. Vigo bay is entirely enclosed with high mountainous land, broken by cultivated valleys, which form a pleasing landscape. It is entered by a long channel, in which there are from twenty-seven to thirty-two feet of water. The beach is clear, the holding ground good, and there a ship is well sheltered from the sea by the Bayona islands. The town is surrounded by an ancient wall, and is defended by a citadel. The harbour, though so well situated, is little frequented by any but coasting vessels. Vigo contains not more than 2500 inhabitants. It is remarkable as the place where a Spanish plate-fleet took refuge in the year 1702, and was attacked by a combined fleet of the British and Dutch ships, then at war with Spain. The victory was complete, but the Spaniards set fire to the richest of the treasure-ships, which were burnt and sunk. It was to this place that General Crawford led the light division of Sir John Mooreâ€™s army, on its retreat from Spain, and embarked it with despatch and without loss. The latitude is 42. 13. 20. N. Long. 8. 33. 30. W.
