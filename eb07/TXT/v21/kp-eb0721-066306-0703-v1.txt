VOLGA, the largest river in Europe, derives its origin from two small lakes in the forest of Volkonski about 80 miles from Tver, a town in Russia. It is navigable a few miles above that town. This noble river waters some of the finest provinces in the Russian empire, and at last falls into the Caspian sea, by several mouths, below Astracan. The Volga is subject to annual inundations. In the year 1774, the inundations exceeded the lowest water mark by nearly 40 feet, since which period they have been rather on the decline; for in 1775, they rose only to 39 feet 2 inches above that mark; in 1782, they rose to 26 feet; in 1785, to 25 feet 2 inches; and in the year 1791, their r>eight was the same. Pallas is of opinion that this phenomenon may have originated from the diminished quantity of snow and rain which had fallen in the higher countries; from the greater evaporation of the Caspian sea, and the gradual extension of the different mouths of the river, or perhaps from the joint operation of all these causes.
