VAUCLUSE, a department in the south-east division of France. It has been formed out of the ancient province of Avignon, of the county of Venassin, of the principality of Orange, and of a portion of Upper Provence. It extends in north latitude from 43° 41' to 44° 26', and in east longitude from 4° 34' to 5° 38'. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Drome, on the east by that of the Lower Alps, on the south by the mouths of the Rhone, on the west by that of the Gard, and on a small part of the north-west by the Ardeche. Its extent is 1357 square miles. It comprehends four arrondisements, divided into twenty-two cantons, and those subdivided into 148 communes. In 1836 the population amounted to 246,071 persons, chiefly adhering to the Catholic church; but there are about 4000 Protestants, who have their own consistory to regulate their religious affairs. The inhabitants are of dark complexion, with penetrating eyes, spirited countenances, and are gay and lively in their appearance and manners. The face of the country in the whole of the eastern division is mountainous, and in the west is an extensive plain, which may be considered as a prolongation of the valley of the Rhone. the mountains in the eastern part may be viewed as a part of the Alps, or of spurs projected from that range. The highest point of these elevations is 6300 feet; but the main chain of the mountains can be scarcely estimated [7:21:565] higher than from 2400 to 3000 feet. These mountains are all calcareous, and for the most part sterile; but the valleys between them have a soil, partly of sand or of clay, covered with vegetable mould, which, when cultivated, is highly productive. The best soil is in the vicinity of the river Durance and of the Rhone, both of which streams deposit a rich muddy compost in their passage. The district between Carpentras and Avignon is almost covered with a mixture of pebbles.

The chief river is the Rhone, which enters the department from the Gard, and in it receives the waters of the Louzon, the Aigues, the Meyne, the Lorgues, and the Durance. The Durance, which flows from the Lower Alps, receives the waters of the Jabron and of the Cavallon before it joins the Rhone. The Rhone is the only stream that is navigable; but there are many small artificial canals, which, though chiefly designed for the purpose of irrigation, are made available for the transport of heavy goods.

The climate is mild and healthy, but subject to great changes. The trees in some seasons begin to blossom in February, but are often checked by severe cold and showers. The husbandry is in an imperfect state; green crops and even clover are not known, though lucerne is cultivated in some parts. The chief grains are wheat, barley, rye, buck wheat, and maize. The whole growth of these is annually 65,000 quarters, which is not sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants. The chief product for sale is wine. The olive trees yield some oil, which, with dried fruits and saffron, forms the chief object with which are exchanged the few foreign luxuries that are consumed. Silk worms are kept in some districts. The spinning and weaving of silk is the chief occupation of the inhabitants; and the weaving is said to employ 2600 looms. These goods form a part of the exports, to which may be added madder, which is raised and prepared for the dyers. Some springs of saline water furnish culinary salt. This department returns two members to the representative chamber. The capital is the city of Avignon, with a population, in 1836, amounting to 31,786.
