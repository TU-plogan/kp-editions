VERT, in Heraldry, the term for a green colour. It is called vert in the blazon of the coats of all under the degree of nobles; but in coats of nobility it is called emerald; and in those of kings venus . In engraving it is expressed by diagonals, or lines drawn athwart from right to left, from the dexter chief corner to the sinister base.
