VIZAGAPATAM, a considerable town and district of Hindustan, in the province of the Northern Circars. The district, principally situated between the 17th and 19th degrees of north latitude, is mountainous, and many of the hills are wild and destitute of vegetation. The principal trading towns of the district are, Vizagapatam and Bimlipatam. A considerable trade is carried on with Calcutta, Ceylon, the Maldavie islands, &c., from which are imported pepper, wheat, wine, cocoa nuts, coir, and cowries. The exports consist of wax, salt, rice, and indigo. A considerable quantity of cloth is manufactured in the adjacent country. Vizagapatam is the capital of the district. A river from the north, and turning short eastward to the sea, forms an [7:21:662]arm of land one mile and a half in length, and 600 yards in breadth, nearly in the middle of which the town and fort are situated. The town is inconsiderable, the Europeans generally residing in Watloor, a village to the south of the harbour. At Semachellum, near to this village, is a Hindu temple of great sanctity. It was here that the British had a factory in 1689, when during a rupture with Auren-zebe, our countrymen and all their warehouses were seized, and all the residents put to death. In 1757 it was taken by Îœ. Bussy. It was acquired by the British in 1765, with all the rest of the province, under the administration of Lord Clive; and it now forms one of the five districts into which the Northern Circars were divided in 1803, when the Bengal residence and judicial system were introduced. Travelling distance from Madras 483 miles; from Nagpoor 394; from Hydrabad 355, and from Calcutta 557 miles. Long. 83. 28. E. Lat. 17. 42. N.
