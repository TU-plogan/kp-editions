VELLORE, a celebrated town and fortress of the south of India, province of the Carnatic, formerly the capital of a small district of the same name. It was once a port of great importance, as it commanded the main road leading to the Upper Carnatic, from the valley of Peniambady, which is the most direct route to and from the Mysore. It is strongly fortified, the walls being built of very large stones, with bastions and round towers at short distances. A fausse bras lines the wall between them, and, with its embattled rampart and small overhanging square towel’s, produces a very handsome effect. The whole fort is surrounded by a deep and wide ditch, cut chiefly out of the solid rock, except atone entrance, where there was a causeway. Besides the usual defence, the ditch contains curiosities of rather an extraordinary character, namely, alligators of a very large size. The fortress, though strong, is commanded by the surrounding hills. It was first taken by the Mahometans in 1646, and afterwards by Sevajee in 1677. Subsequently it came into the possession of the nabob of Arcot.∙ and in 1782 was besieged by the whole [7:21:590] army of Hyder, when it was relieved by Sir Eyre Coote. After the capture of Seringapatam in 1799. It was fixed upon as the state-prison of Tippoo’s family, consisting, besides his brother, of twelve sons and eight daughters, with a numerous progeny, and an innumerable crowd of women. On the 10th July 1806, a serious mutiny took place among the garrison, principally composed of native troops, who endeavoured to murder all the Europeans they could find. The ostensible cause of the mutiny was a change of dress; but it was strongly suspected that it was instigated by the sons of Tippoo, who were in consequence removed to Bengal, where they remain under a liberal restraint. Since the conquest of Mysore, this fortress has lost much of its consequence, and its fortifications will probably be allowed to fall to decay. The district is included in the collectorship of Arcot. Travelling distance from Madras 88 miles west by south; from Seringapatam 202 miles. Long. 79∙ 13. E. Lat. 12. 55. N.
