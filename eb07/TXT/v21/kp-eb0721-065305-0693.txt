VIQUE, or Vich, a city of Spain, in the province of Catalonia. It is situated on the river Ter, above Gerona. The country around, though not naturally fertile, is rendered productive by high cultivation. The most considerable works for printing calicos are within this district, and there are in the city considerable manufactories of cotton. The hills around it have mines of topazes, amethysts, and coloured crystals, which are worked into ornamental jewellery by the jewellers of Barcelona, and form part of its traffic. Vique is the seat of a bishop, and has a splendid cathedral, with several other churches and several convents. It is situated in Lat. 41Â° 47', and contains several monasteries, and 8400 inhabitants.
