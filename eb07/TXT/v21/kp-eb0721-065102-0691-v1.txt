VILLIERS, George, duke of Buckingham, was the third son of Sir George Villiers. He was born at Brookes-by in Leicestershire, August 20, 1582. His handsome person and pleasing manners gained him the favour of James I., who, in 1615, created him a knight, with a pension of L.1000 a-year. From this time, his promotion was rapid, and his influence with King James unbounded; after whose death, he continued as great a favourite with his son. But for his transactions, which are matter of history, we refer to the article Britain. He was assassinated at Portsmouth by one Fenton, August 23, 1628.

Villiers, George, second duke of Buckingham of that family, son of the preceding, was born at Westminster, January 30,1627. During the civil wars, he served in the royal army under Prince Rupert. After the death of Charles I., he attached himself to his son, and at the restoration was made master of the horse, and was one of those confidential ministers of the king who were designated the Cabal. His public conduct was unprincipled and capricious, and his private life notorious for profligacy and crime. He died April 16, 1688, justly neglected and despised. See Britain.
