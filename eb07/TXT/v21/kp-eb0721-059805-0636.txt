VENUS, in Pagan worship, the goddess of love and beauty. Cicero mentions other two deities of this name, Venus, styled Urania and Coelestis, and the Venus Pandemos or Popularis, the wife of Vulcan, and the goddess of wanton and effeminate love. To the first the Pagans ascribed no attributes but such as were agreeable to the strictest chastity and virtue; and of this deity they admitted no corporeal resemblance, she being only represented by the form of a globe, ending conically. Her sacrifices were termed nephalia, on account of their sobriety. To her honey and wine were offered, and no animal except the heifer; and on her altars the wood of figs, vines, or mulberries, was not suffered to be burnt. The Romans dedicated a temple to this goddess, to whom they gave the name of Verticodia; because she turned the hearts of lewd women, and inspired them with modesty and virtue.

But the most famous of these goddesses is the wife of Vulcan; who is represented as springing from the froth of the sea. As soon as she was formed, she was laid in a beautiful shell embellished with pearl, and wafted by gentle zephyrs to the isle of Cythera, whence she sailed to Cyprus. At her landing, flowers rose beneath her feet; she was received by the Hours, who braided her hair with golden fillets; and then wafted her to heaven, where her charms appeared so attractive, that most of the gods desired her in marriage; but Vulcan, by the advice of Jupiter, gained possession by putting poppies into her nectar. As Venus was the goddess of love and pleasure, the poets have been lavish in the description of her beauties; and the painters and statuaries have endeavoured to give her the most lovely form. Sometimes she is represented clothed in purple, glittering with gems, her head crowned with roses, and drawn in an ivory car by swans, doves, or sparrows; at others she stands attended by the Graces; but in all positions, her son Cupid is her inseparable companion. She was honoured as the mother of Hymenaeus, Cupid, Aeneas, and the Graces, and was passionately fond of Adonis and Anchises. This goddess was principally worshipped at Paphos in Cyprus; and the sacrifices offered to her were white goats and swine, with libations of wine, milk, and honey. Her victims were crowned with flowers, or wreaths of myrtle.
