VINCULUM, in algebra, a character in form of a line or stroke drawn over a factor, divisor, or dividend, when compounded of several letters or quantities, to connect them, and shews that they are to be multiplied or divided, &c. together by the other term.

Thus *** d×a-∖-b—c shows that d is to be multiplied into a+b — c.
