VICTOR, Sextus Aurelius, a Latin historian, lived in the age of Constantius and Julian. From the terms in which he speaks of Africa, describing it as “decus terrarum,” it has been conjectured that he was a native of that region. According to his own account, he was born in the country, and was the son of a poor and unlettered father. We learn from Ammianus Marcellinus that the emperor Constantius having seen Victor the historian at Sirmium, afterwards appointed him prefect of Pannonia Secunda, and honoured him with a brazen statue. At a subsequent period, as we learn from the same authority, the office of prefect of the city was likewise conferred upon him. He is supposed to have been the same individual who in 369 was consul along with Valentinian.^[1. Relandi Fasti Consulares, p. 486. Traject. Batav. 1715, 8vo. ] It has been inferred that he was not a Christian.

Aurelius Victor appears to have been the author of a work “De Viris Illustribus Urbis Romae,” which has repeatedly been printed under the names of Cornelius Nepos, Suetonius, and the younger Pliny. The first of his illustrious men is Procas king of the Albani, the last Sextus Pompeius. Of this work, his tract “De Caesaribus” is to be regarded as a continuation. It commences with Augustus, and terminates with Julian. This tract first appeared in an edition of the author’s works published by Andreas Schottus, Antverp. 1579, 8vo. Here we likewise find the earliest impression of the tract entitled “Origo Gentis Romanae but whether it is a genuine production of the same author, has been considered as extremely doubtful. Another work commonly ascribed to him bears the title, “De Vita et Moribus Imperatorum Romanorum; excerpta ex libris Sexti Aurelii Victoris, a Caesare Augusto usque ad Theodosium Imperatorem." This title is not applicable to a work composed by Victor, but to one compiled from his writings. The materials appear to be borrowed from Suetonius, Eutropius, Ammianus, and Victor.^[2. Vossius de Historicis Latinis, p. 195, 221. Fabricii Bibliotheca Latina, tom. iii. p. 123. ]

Of the entire works ascribed to this author there are several editions, accompanied with the notes of various critics. Among these we may specify that of Leyden, Lugd. Bat. 1671, 8vo. An edition “in usum Delphini” was published by Madame Dacier, Paris. 1681, 4to. For another edition we are indebted to Pitiscus, Traj. ad Rhen. 1696, 8vo. But the best edition of Victor is that of Amzenius, Amst. 1733, 4to.
