VITERBO, a delegation or province of the papal dominions, formed out of a part of Orvieto, the duchy of Castro, and the countship of Ronaglione. It is bounded on the north by Perugia, on the north-east by Spoletto, on the east by Rieta, on the south-east by Rome, and on the south and south-west by the sea, and on the west by a part of Tuscany. The face of the country is in the north mountainous, in the middle undulating, and on the west a level [7:21:661] plain. With Civita Vecchia. It extends over 1716 square miles, and comprehends 13 cities, 24 market-towns, and ,276 villages, with 145,022 inhabitants. The chief products are wine, corn, olive-oil, and live cattle, all of which are attended to with great ignorance and indolence. The capital is the city of the same name. It stands on a plain at the foot of the mountains, is surrounded with ancient walls and towers, has straight and broad streets well paved with lava, a fine market-place, and many magnificent buildings. It is the seat of a bishop, and besides the cathedral, has 16 parish churches, in one of which, that of Santa Rosa, are some most valuable paintings, executed by Sebastiano Piombino. The population amounts to 13,100, employed in various trades, one of the most extensive of which is refining saltpetre. In the neighbourhood are sulphureous baths of great celebrity; and near the city, in the church of Madona dell Quercia, is an image to which numerous pilgrimages are annually made. Lat. 42. 24. 54. Long. 27. 59∙ 25. E.
