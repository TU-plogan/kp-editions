VESTALS, among the ancient Romans, were priestesses of the goddess Vesta, and had the perpetual fire committed to their charge. They were at first only four in number, but afterwards increased to six; and it does not appear that their number ever exceeded six, among whom was one superior to the rest, and called vestalis maxima. The vestals were chosen from six to ten years of age, and obliged to strict continency for thirty years; the first ten of which were employed in learning the ceremonies of religion, the next ten in the performance of them, and the last ten in teaching them to the younger vestals. The habit of the vestals consisted of a head-dress, called injula, which sat close to the head, and from whence hung certain laces called vitta; a kind of surplice made of white linen, and over it a purple mantle with a long train to it.
