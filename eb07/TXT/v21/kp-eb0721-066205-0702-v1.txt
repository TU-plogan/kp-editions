VLISSINGEN, a maritime town of Holland, in the province of Zealand, called by the English Flushing. It is situated at the mouth of the West Scheldt, on the south side of the island of Walcheren, and thus in some measure commands the entrance to that river, and the access to Antwerp. In 1809 it suffered much during the siege by the British army, but has been more than restored to its former condition. The fortifications are now strong, and its trade, especially that of ship-building, is flourishing. The town contains 8020 inhabitants. It was the birth-place of the celebrated Admiral De Ruyter. Lat. 51.26. 37. Long. 3.28. 16. east.
