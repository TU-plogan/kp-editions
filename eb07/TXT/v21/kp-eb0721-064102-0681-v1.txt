VIANA, a department or corregimento of the province Entre Duro e Minho in Portugal, extending along the seashore to the northward of the river Minho. It comprehends seven towns, 291 villages or parishes, 30,980 dwellings, with about 170,000 inhabitants. The capital is a city of the same name, situated at the mouth of the Minho, a river nearly choked up with sand, and only admitting vessels with a light draught of water to approach the wharfs at the highest tides. From this circumstance the trade of the city has, of late years, been transferred to Oporto. The chief traffic is in fruits and in some light wines. Viana has an extensive sea fishery, which gives occupation to 300 boats. The city is surrounded with walls defended by bastions, and the entrance from the sea is protected by two forts, St. Jago and Cao. The public buildings are two parochial churches, or religious houses, an hospital, a poor house, and a military school or college. It contains about 2000 houses and 9500 inhabitants. There is a light-house at the entrance of the river Lerna, whose latitude is in 41° 39' north.

There is another place in Portugal of this name, the town of Viana in the province of Alentejo, which contains 450 houses and 1850 inhabitants.

In the province of Navarre in Spain, is also a Viana, a city near to Estella. It stands on a hill about three miles from the river Ebro. It is surrounded with walls, and is [7:21:642] defended by an ancient castle, and contains 3,500 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in rearing black cattle, sheep, horses, and mules.
