VICTORY, the overthrow or defeat of an enemy in war or combat.

Victory, in Pagan worship, is represented by Hesiod as the daughter of Styx and Pallas; and Varro calls her the daughter of Heaven and Earth. The Romans erected [7:21:643]a temple to her, where they prayed the gods to give success to their arms. They painted her in the form of a woman, clad in cloth of gold. In some medals, she is represented with wings flying through the air, holding a laurel crown in one hand, and a palm in the other; but in other medals, she is seen standing upon a globe, with the same crown and branch of palm.
