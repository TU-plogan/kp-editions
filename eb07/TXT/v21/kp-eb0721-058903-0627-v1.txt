VEGLIA, an island in the Adriatic part of the Austrian province of Trieste, in the bay of Quarnaro. It is, including the small island Plaunich, about ninety square miles in extent, and contains a city, three market towns, and four teen villages, with 10,414 inhabitants. The island is mountainous and rocky, and on the north and east sides very barren, but in the other parts has a fertile soil, yielding abundance of fruit and of wine, but not sufficient corn. Some good oil is made, and the fishing is an important source of wealth. The capital, of the same name, is the seat of a bishop, who has a palace and a cathedral. The export of wine is the chief trade. The harbour is both small and shallow. The inhabitants do not exceed 1400. Lat. 45. 3. 20. Long. 14. 32. 40.
