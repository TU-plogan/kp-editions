VERTUMNUS, in Mythology, a god who presided over gardens and orchards, honoured among the Etruscans, from whom the worship of this deity was transmitted to the Romans. Vertumnus had a temple near the market-place at Rome, being represented as one of the tutelary deities of the merchants. The commentators on Ovid say, that he was an ancient king of Hetruria, who, by his diligent and successful cultivation of fruit and gardens, obtained the honour of being ranked among the gods.
