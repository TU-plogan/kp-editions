VAN DIEMEN’S LAND, or Tasmania. This island was long considered to form the southern termination of the great island of New Holland; and it was only ascertained to be an island in 1798, by Surgeon Bass and Lieutenant Flinders. It is situated between the parallels of 41° 20’ and 43° 40' S., and the meridians of 144° 40' and 148° 20' E. It is of an irregular shape, somewhat in the form of a heart. Its broadest part toward the north. Its greatest extent from north to south is estimated at about 210 miles, and from east to west 150 miles. It is nearly about the size of Ireland, covering an area of about 24,000 square miles. This country was first discovered by Tasman in 1642. In 1773 it was visited by Captain Furneaux, and by Captain Cook in 1777, since which period it has been visited by different navigators. Among others, Bruny d’Entrecasteaux made this coast in 1792, and afterwards revisited it in 1793. He entered a channel, which he spent some time in exploring, and which is since known by the name of D’Entrecasteaux’s channel. These discoveries were further prosecuted by subsequent navigators, and particularly by Lieutenants Bass and Flinders, who, in different voyages, in which they were occupied from 1795 to 1803, made a complete survey of this coast, and also a great part of the coast of New Holland.

In 1803, a detachment of troops under Lieutenant Bowen arrived here from Sydney, for the purpose of establishing a penal settlement; but nothing appears to have been effected at that time beyond the selection of a spot for that purpose. Early in 1804, Lieutenant-Governor Collins, having in view a settlement on the southern coast of New Holland, arrived from England with a more considerable expedition; and having altered his determination, he directed bis course to the river Derwent, when the island was formally taken possession of in the name of his Britannic Majesty. After various surveys of the Derwent, the present site of Hobart-Town was decided upon for head-quarters. Besides several individuals of respectability, he had with him about 400 pensioners, with about fifty prisoners. The colony being thus planted, continued to take r∞t, although at times suffering great hardship. For the first three years the inhabitants were wholly dependent on foreign supplies of food, and were occasionally reduced to great straits, insomuch that kangaroo meat was purchased at 1s. 6d. per lb., and sea-weed, or any other vegetable substance fit for food, likewise at a high price. About this time sheep and cattle began first to be imported into the colony; and fresh arrivals of prisoners increased the population, which still preserved the character of a penal settlement for convicted felons. In 1810 Governor Collins died, and was succeeded by his second in command, and by other three provisional governors. In 1813 Lieutenant-Colonel Davey arrived from England as lieutenant-governor; and about this period the rising importance of the colony began to be gradually developed, and its prosperity was greatly favoured by its port, from which hitherto all merchant vessels, except those from England and New South Wales, had been interdicted, being declared free to the ships of all nations. This wise and necessary measure was followed by the most beneficial effects; trade began to improve. Its surplus produce was freely exported, and such returns were received as were calculated greatly to increase the wealth of the colony. Society began to assume the appearance of civilization; and although the stream of emigration from home had not begun to flow in this direction, yet the officers of the different regiments which had been stationed in the colonv, and so remained in it, with the settlers brought from Norfolk Island on its evacuation, besides occasional arrivals from New South Wales, and emancipated convicts, formed a considerable addition to the population. A greater quantity of land was cultivated, houses multiplied in different quarters, farms were inclosed, and symptoms of growing wealth and prosperity began daily to appear. Colonel Davey’s administration lasted till the year 1817. He was succeeded by Colonel Sorell, who was intent on the internal improvement of the colony, and who directed the formation of new roads, the erection of bridges, and the establishment of schools and other institutions. In 1821 emigrants[7:21:552] began to resort in great numbers to this country; and as they brought with them an increase of capital, cultivation was rapidly extended on all sides. A regular trade was begun, distilleries and breweries were erected, the Van Diemen's bank was established, St. David’s church at Hobart-Town was completed, and every thing now indicated the rapid progress of this rising community. According to a census taken in 1821, the inhabitants were found to amount to 7185; the acres in cultivation to 14,940; sheep, to 170,000; cattle, 35,000; and horses, 350. The colony was still dependent on New South Wales, and had no regular civil or criminal courts, occasional sessions being only held by judges who arrived from New South Wales. In 1825 this defect was remedied: Van Diemen’s Land was declared by the king in council independent of the colony of New South Wales; the chief authority was vested in a lieutenant-governor and council, the latter consisting, according to the 9th Geo. IV. c. 83, of fifteen members; civil and criminal courts were established; and the sole dependency of the colony was in future on the mother country.

The prosperity of the colony was long retarded, and the lives and properties of the inhabitants endangered by a banditti of runaway convicts, who took shelter in the woods, and issued in bands from these hiding-places, to plunder the settlements and to murder their proprietors. They were known under the title of bush-rangers; and they even proceeded so far as to write threatening letters to the magistracy and the lieutenant-governor. A feeling of insecurity pervaded the more remote settlements; and the most respectable farmers, with one accord, betook themselves to the towns as the only certain refuge from the violence of these wretches, who scrupled not at conflagration, robbery, and murder. They long continued their depredations with impunity, owing to the insufficiency of the military force, the ample subsistence afforded by the abundance of game, and the superior local knowledge which they acquired in the course of their wandering life. In order to abate this growing evil, Colonel Davey proclaimed the whole island under martial law; and the military being seconded by the respectable inhabitants, succeeded in apprehending the most daring of these offenders, who were executed and hung in chains as a terror to their associates. The proclamation of a general amnesty induced others to surrender. But many of these again escaped into the woods, and renewed their lawless outrages against the persons and properties of the settlers; and it was not till the year 1817, that, by great exertions of the troops, aided by the settlers, this gang of banditti was rooted out, most of them being apprehended by the activity of the troops, and executed.

Van Diemen’s Land, seen from the coast, has a more agreeable aspect than New Holland. Many fine tracks of land are found on the very borders of the sea; and the interior is almost invariably possessed of a soil admirably adapted to all the purposes of civilized man. The island is upon the whole decidedly mountainous. In the interior it is extremely diversified in its surface; not so much, however, by continuous ranges of mountains, as by insulated peaks, with intervening tracks of table land, and extensive and fertile valleys. On the south of the island, the country presents a peculiarly bold and rude aspect, hills being piled upon hills, all densely covered with trees to the top, and presenting one impervious forest, except here and there a rocky eminence towering to a majestic height. Farther inward the country assumes a less stern and forbidding aspect, and many fine open spots meet the eye, lightly timbered and extending for miles; the prospect, however, being still closed by a background of lofty mountains. Between Hobart-Town and Launceston, towards the north, there is a fine champaign country intersected by streams, and of great extent; and towards the north coast the scenery consists of every variety of hill and dale, woodland and plain, forest and village, that forms the perfection of a rural landscape. The western parts of the island, though they have been imperfectly explored, are represented as abounding in bold and mountainous scenery, although possessing well watered and fertile plains. Here the ground generally rises to a great elevation, and has consequently a milder climate in winter than the inhabited districts towards the east. Of the mountains there are several which rise to a great height. Mount Wellington, which is only a few miles west from Hobart-Town, is 4000 feet above the level of the sea. It has a magnificent appearance; and its bold and rugged hills are diversified with occasional spots of sombre foliage. During eight months of the year it is covered with snow; but so pure is the atmosphere, that its summit is seldom obscured with clouds. Being so near Hobart-Town it has frequent visitors in summer. The southern mountains near Port Davey form a long range, which stretches into the interior for several miles, and in some places rises 5000 feet above the sea. They are covered with snow during the greater part of the year. The other principal mountains in the colony are Benlomond, distant about 100 miles from Hobart-Town, and rising 4200 feet; the Table mountains near Jericho, 3800 feet; Peak of Teneriffe, or Wylede’s Craig, 4500; Quamby's Bluff, 3500; Mount Field, 3000; St. Paul’s Dome, 2500; with several others, from 1000 to 2000 feet in elevation.

The country is well watered, numerous streams flowing from the mountains; and on the summits of many of them are large lakes, which are the sources of considerable rivers. The Derwent is a noble and magnificent stream, varying in breadth, from its entrance up to Hobart-Town, from six to twelve miles, having everywhere deep water, without rocks or sand-banks, and navigable at all seasons, even by strangers, with the most perfect ease and safety. The mouth of the Derwent is formed on the right by Brune island and D’Entrecasteaux’s channel, and on the left by Iron Pot island and the South Arm; the latter presenting for six miles a coast of highly luxuriant appearance, and then abruptly terminating in the centre of the Derwent, where the river, uniting with the waters of Double Bay, extends its width to nearly twelve miles. This river takes its rise in a lake to the westward, and flows with considcrable rapidity, receiving numerous tributary streams until it reaches New Norfolk, where it is almost as wide as the Thames at Battersea, whence it pursues its course towards the ocean, widening as it goes, with the finest scenery on its banks. The water continues fresh for about six miles below New Norfolk. The Huon is nearly of equal magnitude with the Derwent, and runs westerly until it falls into the sea in one of its arms or creeks not many miles from Hobart-Town. Though it be a navigable river. It is however of little value to the colony, the land on its banks being so heavily timbered, that it is neither arable nor fit for pasturage. It is occasionally resorted to by vessels of considerable burden for the timber on its shores, which is taken in as ballast. The Tamar, formed by two rivers, the North and South Esk, is navigable for its whole course, though, on account of a bar and other intricacies of navigation. It requires great skill and management on the part of the pilot to take up or down large vessels with safety. Among the rivers of the second class that water fine districts, and are extremely useful, though they are not navigable, may be enumerated the Shannon, the Clyde, and the Jordan, all of which fall into the Derwent, either singly, or having previously united above New Norfolk; the Coal river, which falls into the sea near Richmond; and the two Esks, which join and form the Tamar at Launceston. There is still a numerous class of smaller rivers, which have an abundant supply of water all the year round for mills, cattle, and domestic[7:21:553] use. There are the Thames or Lachlan at New Norfolk; the Plenty, the Styx, Jones’s river, and Russell’s falls, which are also tributaries of the Derwent; the Macquarrie and Elizabeth rivers, more in the interior, and which are tributaries of the Esk; Blackman's river, also in the heart of the colony. Farther north is the Lake river passing through Norfolk plains, the Western river, the Isis, and several others of less note. More to the westward are the Mersey, the Meander, the Forth, the Iris, the Leven, the Emu, the Cam, the Inglis, and numerous others, which are spread over all parts of the colony. Around the coast of the island many streams fall into the ocean, having spread fertility over the districts through which they have previously flowed. Among these may be mentioned the Carlton, Prosser’s river, Great Swan Port river, Piper’s river, &c.; also North-west Bay river, a few miles from Hobart-Town. Others again are found in desert situations in the country, where cultivation has made little progress. There are several lakes, generally in the centre of the island among the mountains, of considerable extent, which abound with water-fowl of all descriptions. Great Lake is about ninety miles north-west of Hobart-Town, and eighty feet above the level of the sea. It is twenty miles long and ten broad, with deep bays and indentations, and many promontories and peninsulas extending into it. It contains five islands, covered with a species of cedar, and numerous shrubs. Its greatest depth is only three fathoms. Around the coast are numerous bays and harbours that afford secure anchorage. The entrance from the ocean to the Derwent presents two lines of continuous bays or anchorage of unrivalled excellence. The one most commonly used leads through Storm bay, and the other through D’Entrecasteaux’s channel, which is one string of little bays or anchorages for nearly forty miles. On the eastern coast of the island is Oyster bay and Great Swan Port; on the north, Port Dalrymple, or the mouth of the Tamar, Port Sorell, and Circular Head; westward, Macquarrie harbour and Port Davey. Besides, there are many of smaller note, capable of affording secure shelter to craft of light burden.

The climate of this island is equally healthy, and more congenial to the constitution of Europeans, than that of Port Jackson, not being subject to any remarkable variations either of beat or cold. Generally speaking, throughout the summer, alternate land and sea-breezes prevail every twenty-four hours; the wind blowing from the land from sun-set till ten or eleven o’clock the following day, when it is succeeded by the sea-breeze, which continues till the evening. Its influence extends many miles inshore, and diffuses a refreshing coolness, even in the hottest days of summer. The average thermometer is 70°, although the heat is occasionally much greater, the mercury rising to 100° or 110°. This sudden heat is occasioned by the north and north-west wind, which is felt at Port Jackson, and here, though not in the same degree, though its effects are seen on the growing crops, producing blight and other injurious consequences. The rain which is almost certain to succeed in a few hours, again cools the atmosphere, and corrects the bad effects of the previous sultriness. Thunder-storms are rare, nor are they ever violent. During spring, which is in the months of September, October, and November, the weather is usually bright and clear, with occasional rain and high winds; when the average range of the thermometer is between fifty and sixty degrees. The summer, which is in December, January, and February, is generally dry; during which the vegetable productions arrive at maturity one month earlier than they would in England, namely, in December, which corresponds to June of the northern hemisphere. Autumn, which is in March, April, and May, is the pleasantest season in the year; the air being clear and bright, free from clouds and vapours, and the medium heat of the day about 65°. The nights are cool and refreshing, which indeed is generally the case in the height of summer. The winter, which is in June, July, and August, is not severe. In the high and exposed situations, the snow falls thick, and lies a good part of the year, and the frosts are severe; but in the lower valleys and plains, the sun never loses its power during the day, and under its influence, frost and snow quickly disappear; so that the winter is not regarded by the inhabitants as the cold and dismal period of the higher latitudes, but as the season of moderate and genial rain, which facilitates the labours of the husbandman in the ensuing spring. The average range of the thermometer is from forty to forty-eight degrees, though sometimes it falls lower, but seldom continues above a day or two.

Van Diemen’s Land abounds in every variety of soil, and with much less of an indifferent quality than is to be found in New Holland. Large tracks of land, perfectly free from timber or underwood, are to be found in all directions, and covered with luxuriant herbage; where the colonist, entering on the possession of the best land, incurs no expense in clearing his farm, but has only to set fire to the grass, in order to prepare his land for immediate tillage. There are other two circumstances which are extremely favourable to the colonist. The rivers have all a sufficient fall to prevent any excessive accumulation of water from heavy and continued rains, and are consequently free from those violent and destructive inundations to which the rivers of New Holland are subject; and here the colonist may settle securely without the dread of having his lands submerged and his produce swept away by the devouring flood. The seasons are more regular, and not liable to the same inequalities, and to those periodical droughts by which New Holland is visited. In the years 1813, 1814, 1815, and likewise in 1839, when the whole face of the other colony was burnt up, when vegetation was completely at a stand, and the cattle were perishing for want of rain, there were abundant harvests in this more fruitful island, and no want of rains. Within a period of about forty years since the country was settled, the crops have sustained no serious detriment from the want of rain, and the harvests have in general been productive; while the parent colony, since it Has been established, has been repeatedly in the greatest distress from dearth and from inundation. The agricultural products, with some differences arising from the climate, are nearly the same as at Port Jackson. Indian corn or maize is not cultivated here; but wheat, barley, and oats are raised of a very superior quality. Nor is there such a variety or abundance of fruit; the finer fruits of those latitudes that are nearer the equator, such as the orange, the lemon, the citron, the pomegranate, &c., which grow in the greatest perfection at Port Jackson, are not known in this island, while the peach, the nectarine, and the grape arrive at an inferior degree of maturity, and can only be raised by artificial means. But on the other hand, all the fruits, such as the apple, the currant, the gooseberry, and all vegetables and herbs that grow in the northern climate of Europe, thrive equally well in this congenial climate. The vegetable kingdom is similar to that in New South Wales. The forests abound in woods that are adapted to all the various purposes of life. In many places there is no underwood, the ground being covered with tall ungainly trees, standing at some distance from each other, and rising up to a great height, before they shoot out their branches. Much of the timber is extremely serviceable for the purpose of building; while there are ornamental woods, which are highly esteemed for cabinet work, and for fitting up and embellishing the interior of houses; and others for their hardness and durability. All the trees are evergreens, and some of them, particularly the mimosas, put forth very rich blossoms in spring. But the colour has been remarked to partake more or less of yellow. The foliage of the trees is generally dark green, [7:21:554] which gives rather a sombre aspect to the forests; the eye wandering over the wide expanse every where presented, and in vain seeking relief from any variety of hue. There is a great variety of shrubs, many of which are extremely beautiful, and some of them have very elegant flowers. Among the most valuable plants yet discovered, may be classed the pepper tree, the trunk of which contains many medicinal properties. The tea tree is also deserving of notice, the leaves serving at times as a substitute for those of the Chinese plant, and though the beverage is not equally good. It has the recommendation of being much cheaper.

The island has not yet been sufficiently explored for the discovery of its mineral treasures. Its geology is very varied. Basalt is however supposed to be the principal substratum of the soil, and all along the coast it presents itself in rocky precipitous heights, standing on beautiful columnar pedestals. Among these may be mentioned Fluted Cape at Adventure Bay. It is so called from the circular columns standing up close together, in the form of the barrels of an organ. Circular Head is another singular specimen of the basaltic formation. It is a curious rock, standing out of the sea, exactly like a huge round tower or fortress, the work of art. Mount Wellington, already mentioned, is composed of this rock, as well as the rocky banks of many of the mountain rivers. In some parts, both on the coast and in the interior, the columns appear in insulated positions, springing up from the grass or the ocean like obelisks or huge needles. There are several specimens of this curious formation on the south side of Bruné island; and the rocks on the land stand erect upon their several blocks, gradually diminishing as they rise, so that the force of a well-aimed stone would seem sufficient to drive the uppermost from its precarious base. Limestone is almost the only mineral that has been brought into general use. It has been found in abundance in most parts of the island; and a very fine species of lime, used in the better sort of plastering and stuccoing, is made in considerable quantities, by burning the oyster shells that are found in beds along various parts of the coast. Other calcareous substances occur in different parts of the island. Marble of a white mixed grey colour, susceptible of a good polish, has frequently been found. Around Hobart-Town, strata of soft clayey marl occur, which has been found very useful as a manure. Much of the common limestone is of a yellowish or reddish colour, derived from the oxide of iron with which it is mixed, and which is so generally scattered throughout the island. Of the metallic ores, that of iron abounds, of a red, brown, and black colour. In one or two instances in which it has been analyzed. It has been found to contain eighty per cent. of the pure mineral. It also occurs, though more rarely, and in smaller quantities, under the form of red chalk. Specimens of red and green copper ore, lead, zinc, manganese, and, as some say, silver and gold, have been occasionally met with. Indications of coal have been found all across the island, commencing at South Cape, and shewing themselves in various parts; at Satellite island in D’Entrecasteaux’s channel, on the banks of the Huon, at Hobart-Town, New Norfolk, the Coal river, Jerusalem, Jericho; and excellent coal and very rich iron ore have also been discovered in Richmond district and other places. The stratum of the South Cape is situated on the north side of the bay, and extends almost two miles along the coast. This coal has been analyzed, and has been found of a superior quality, and well adapted for the raising of steam. Excellent roof slate appears at a certain spot between Launceston and George-Town; and in the form of mica in large masses on the rocks round Port Davey, on the southern corner of the island, where, being much exposed to the winds and waves of the southern ocean, they have become so much worn by the weather as to exhibit the appearance of snow. Excellent sandstone for building is found in almost every part of the island, and most of the houses in Hobart-Town are now built with it, instead of badly made bricks as formerly. A quarry has also been recently discovered at Port Arthur, where the manufacture of filtering-stones is expected to be commenced. Flints are scattered in great plenty upon the hills, especially where basalt abounds. Other rarer stones have been found in different parts of the island, especially in those which appear to have been washed in former times by the ocean, and which have been deposited in certain ranges or linear positions, by the lashing of the waves and the subsiding of the waters; such as hornstone, schistus, wood-opal, bloodstone, jasper, and that other singular species called the cat’s eye, which reflects different rays of light according to its position. Petrified remains of wood and other vegetable productions, entirely converted into siliceous matter, and capable of the finest polish, are occasionally met with in different parts of the island, especially in the Macquarrie district.

The animals resemble those of New South Wales, comprising the kangaroo, of which there are three different species, the forest, the brush, and the wallapy, the chief difference between them being the size. The hyena, opossum, or tiger, measures six feet from the snout to the tail, and is exceedingly destructive among the flocks. It is beautifully striped with black and white on the back, and the belly and sides are of a grey colour. The dasyurus ursinus, known by the ordinary name of the devil, is another animal of the same species, extremely ugly, the head resembling that of the otter, but quite disproportionate to its body. It is very destructive to the flocks, issuing at night from the rocky hills which it frequents, in search of its prey. The native porcupine resembles the common hedgehog, and is quite harmless. The wombat is a singular anima), and when full grown weighs nearly forty-three pounds. The head, which is large and flattish, forms an equilateral triangle. It has extremely short legs, ears sharp and erect, eyes small and sunken, but lively, and the feet are formed like those of a badger; the tail is an inch in length. The flesh is very delicate. The platypus is an animal apparently allied to the beaver tribe. The body is about ten inches long, and about as many in circumference. This animal is very shy, and is only found in unfrequented places. Several species of wild cats are found in the woods. One is called the tiger-cat, from its resemblance to that animal; others partake of the character of the weasel. The kangaroo rat and the kangaroo mouse possess, with the size of these animals, all the characteristics of the kangaroo. There are several species of opossums, all perfectly harmless. The bandicoot is a small animal, which makes great havoc in the potato grounds when it visits them.

The feathered tribes are numerous, of every description, and many of them of the most beautiful plumage. Among the birds of prey are eagles, hawks of all sorts, kites, ravens, and the common carrion-crow. Among the water-fowl are many varieties of the gull, pelican, the kingfisher, black swans of very majestic appearance, wild ducks, also the musk duck, teal, widgeon, and a variety of others. Among that class which belong neither to birds of prey nor to water-fowl, are emus, black and white and satin cockatoos, parrots and parroquets in great variety, large black magpies, the white or the whistling magpie, the laughing jackass, so called from its singular noise; with many others of smaller size, but of more beautiful appearance. Quails, snipes, and a species of pigeon of a splendid bronze colour, in flavour resembling a partridge, are the chief birds that, in addition to water-fowl, attract the attention of sportsmen.

All the inlets and bays of the coast abound with fish. Among those which may be purchased at Hobart-Town, are the salmon, so called in the colony, but in reality a very poor fish; perch, rock-cod, bream, mullet, whitings, flat-hearts, leather-jackets, tailors, parrots, guard-fish, cray-fish, nearly[7:21:555] as good as lobsters, oysters, good and plentiful, eels, skate, and shrimps. Some years ago mackarel, of a very small species, were caught, but they have since disappeared. Black-fish are plentiful in the Mersey, and generally weigh from five to fifteen pounds; they have no scales. The interior rivers and lakes abound with very fine eels, but, except the mullet, they are of little value. The toad-fish, found in the bays and shores of the island, is a strong poison. This poison is of a powerful sedative nature, producing stupor, and acting on the nervous system. The black whale resorts during the breeding season to the deep estuaries of rivers, and to the bays and inlets around the island. This fishery is pursued with great activity and success. There are several kinds of snakes, some of them poisonous; the most common one a large black snake, the diamond snake, and a smaller brown sort. In the reptile family may be classed the guanas and lizards, said to be harmless; centipedes of two sorts, scorpions and tarantulas, the latter often met with in rotten wood. There are many curious and beautiful varieties of the beetle; three or four sorts, some of which are an inch long, and sting sharply. The wild bee is found, and a variety of spiders. All the domestic animals of Europe thrive, and increase in size.

The population here, as in New South Wales, consists of three classes, the aborigines, the convicts, and the free inhabitants. The aborigines, or blacks, more resemble in their countenance and appearance the African negro than those of New South Wales, though living under a colder climate. Their hair is woollyand their complexion black, and they are said to be inferior in ingenuity, as well as in muscular strength. For several years an inveterate hostility prevailed between them and the civilized inhabitants; and the defenceless farmers and stock-keepers were often murdered by the natives. These outrages at last roused the spirit of the whole country; and the troops, and all those that were capable of bearing arms, formed a cordon round the aborigines, with the intention of confining them in the peninsula called Tasman’s Head, where all their wants were to be supplied, and an attempt was to be made to civilize them. They however broke through this cordon like so many wild beasts; but by the humane exertions of some of the settlers, aided by a few of the more civilized aborigines of Sydney, they have been removed to Flinders Island, in Bass’s straits, where they are clothed and fed, and attempts are made to civilize them. Their numberdoes not exceed 300, and, as usually happens with savages when they are brought within the bounds of civilization, they are gradually decaying.

The convicts amount to 12,000. Every convict who is transported to Van Diemen’s Land, without any reference to previous circumstances, is either placed in the public service or is assigned to individuals immediately on landing. The first are compelled to devote their whole time to the service of the crown, and receive in return food, lodging, and clothes. Labourers and mechanics reside in barracks built for the purpose; clerks employed in the public offices are permitted to live elsewhere, and receive a small pittance; those who are assigned to individuals are still under the closest surveillance, and can go nowhere without a pass. The convict prisoners are divided into classes: 1. Such labourers or mechanics as, on account of especial good conduct, are permitted to sleep out of the barracks, and to work for themselves the whole of each Saturday. 2. Those who still lodge in the barracks, but who are allowed to work for themselves the whole of each Saturday. 3. Those who are employed on the public works, and are released from work every Saturday at noon. 4. Refractory or disorderly characters, worked in irons for crimes committed in the country, under a sentence of the magistrate. 5. Men of the most degraded and incorrigible character, worked in irons under the sentence of a magistrate, and kept entirely separate from the other prisoners. 6. Men removed for crimes to penal settlements, which are distant stations under the governments of New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land, where none but prisoners and their guards are allowed to remain, and where the former are kept to unremitting labour. The rewards to prisoners for good conduct consist of tickets of leave, which exempt the holder from compulsory labour, and emancipations, which restore freedom, but without permission to leave the country.

The free population ranges between 15,000 and 20,000. The following is an account of the population from a recent census:—Free persons, 20,686; convict ditto, 11,938; Port Arthur, 1137; Flinders’ Island (black and white), 183; other islands, 50; military (with wives,&c.), 1054. Total, 35,250. The number of emigrants that embarked from the united kingdom to this colony in 1839 only amounted to 328; while those to Sydney amounted to 8455.^[1. See Parliamentary Papers for the year 1840; copy of any Genera] Return of Emigration for the year 1839.]

The supreme authority is vested in a lieutenant-governor and executive council, consisting of the lieutenant-governor, chief-justice, colonial secretary, treasurer, chaplain, attorney-general, and collector of customs, together with eight private gentlemen of the colony, nominated by the crown for life. The governor, with the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the council, possesses the power of making laws, if not repugnant to the laws of England. He, along with the council, may also impose taxes for local purposes. The laws are administered by a supreme court, consisting of a chief-justice and one puisne judge. It is a civil and criminal court. Appeals may be made from its decisions in civil cases, only when the matter exceeds L.1000 in value, and then direct to the king in council. Either judge may hold a court of circuit in different parts of the colony, for the trial of offences, or for civil actions.

Van Diemen’s Land was originally divided into two counties, those of Buckingham and Cornwall. These indeed continue to be its only counties, although in 1826 it was divided into nineteen police districts. Orders were then received from the home government for forming this colony into counties, hundreds, and parishes, in the same manner as England. Each of these districts is under the charge of a public magistrate, and a chief and other constables, to whose exertions thé good order of the colony is mainly indebted.

The clergy of the church of England consist of a rural dcan, one senior, and seven junior chaplains. Van Diemen’s Land is included in the diocese of Australia. There are three Presbyterian ministers, one Independent, one Wesleyan; and one Roman Catholic priest, all paid by the government. The income of the senior chaplain at Hobart-Town is estimated at L.1000 a-year, arising from the glebe, fees, &c. Education is well attended to by the government, which supports the King’s Orphan Schools, one for male and another for female children, and seventeen elementary schools throughout the colony. The king’s schools are for those who are entirely destitute, or who have one parent living, or whose parents, though both alive, have not the means of giving their children education; and, lastly, for those who are able to contribute annually the sum of L.12. There are besides numerous private seminaries throughout the colony, where all the elementary branches of education are taught. The press is free, and being neither restrained by stamp duties nor taxes on the paper, is conducted with ability and spirit. There are no less than eight newspapers published at Hobart-Town, and two at Launceston, besides monthly magazines, annuals, and almanacks. Various religious, benevolent, and literary institutions are established, which contribute to the improvement of morals, as well as to the diffusion of knowledge.

The public revenue is derived from customs, duties, excise, fees, sale of land, quit-rents, &c. A duty of five per [7:21:556] cent. is imposed on the importation of British goods; of 10s. per gallon on foreign spirits; 7s. 6d. on British gins; and 6d. per pound on tobacco; L.25 a-year on a license to distil spirits; of 5s. on one to bake bread or to slaughter cattle; 5s. to keep a dog on a chain, 10s. off a chain; 5s. to keep a cart for hire. An auctioneer’s license costs L.3, 3s.; marriage license, L.4, 4s.; and there are fees, which are equivalent to stamp duties, on grants of land, on the registering of deeds, &c. The annual revenue amounts to L.90,000, of which one half arises from the customs. The expenditure amounts to about the same sum. The staple products of the colony are wool, whale oil, cattle, and provisions, the same as in New South Wales. The following table shows the progress of the trade.

Since this period the commerce from Britain does not appear to have increased. In 1838 and 1839 the number of ships that arrived was 41 and 38; the amount of the tonnage 12,598 and 11,946.^[2. See Return to an order of the House of Commons, 24th February 1810.] l

In 1834 the imports at Hobart-Town amounted in value to L.355,273, and at Launceston to L.1 15,961. The exports for the same year were, from Hobart Town, L. 117,323, of which oil amounted to L.45,513; wool, L.43,765; and whale-bone, L.8217 ;—and from Launceston, L.85,919, of which wool was L.59,015. The currency is the same as in the mother country, though dollars, rupees, and other foreign coins are in circulation. There are three banks at Hobart-Town, and one at Launceston, which issue notes, and transact all the ordinary business of money dealers, discounting bills and remitting money, also collecting debt on commission. They have generally carried on a successful business, having divided between twelve and fifteen per cent. on their capital stock.

The progress of this colony in improvement has hitherto been remarkable, and its future prospects are not less promising. With a mild climate exactly adapted to the European constitution, a fruitful soil, and an industrious population. It must continue in its course with increased rapidity. The fine wool which it produces is a great commercial staple, which must command its price in the chief manufacturing districts of Europe; and this valuable produce will increase as cultivation extends over the interior deserts; as well as its surplus produce of grain, which by the introduction of steam engines, may be easily converted into flour, and thus supply a valuable article of exportation. The nature of the country, both in point of climate and soil, presents every inducement to emigrants, who have of late been drawn thither in great numbers, bringing with them their capital, and their European skill and industry. With such external aids, and the natural vigour that exists within, the internal resources of the colony will be developed; the country will rapidly fulfil its destiny, and the time cannot be far distant when we may expect to see a populous and flourishing country redeemed from a wilderness, and exhibiting all the arts and refinements of Europe.
