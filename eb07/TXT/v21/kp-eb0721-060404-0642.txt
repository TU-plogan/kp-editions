VERSAILLES, a city of France, the capital of an arrondissement of the same name, in the department of the Seine and Oise, which extends over 331 square miles, is divided into eight cantons, and those into 114 communes, containing, in 1836, 133,551 inhabitants. This city is extensive, is divided into the new and the old town, is splendidly built, and, by the magnificence of its appearance, must have been very appropriate for the circumstances of France, when its state of society was different from what now exists; when there were nobles to occupy the splendid mansions, and more than 80,000 inhabitants of all classes. The palace was built by Louis XIV, between the years 1673 and 1680. It is a most magnificent and extensive pile of building, decorated with the remains of that correct and chaste style of architecture which was the prevailing taste of the time in which it was erected. It is however in a dilapidated condition, and its noble apartments destitute of furniture, and almost of occupants. The gardens are in tolerable[7:21:605] preservation, and especially the water-works, the exhibition of which on Sundays and holidays, still draws to Versailles a large proportion of the more vulgar of the Parisians. In 1836, the inhabitants of Versailles amounted to 29,209, among whom are many English and other foreign families, drawn to it by the cheapness with which the ornamental parts of education can be obtained. Some manufactures have been introduced, especially for fire-arms of the most luxurious kind; besides which many watches are made, some cotton goods, and many smaller articles. It is the place where, in 1783, was signed the peace with England, by which the independence of America was established. Lat. 48. 48. 21. Long. 2. 1. 17. E.
