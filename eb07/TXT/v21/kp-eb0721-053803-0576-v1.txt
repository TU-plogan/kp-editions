VALAISE, or Wallis, a canton of Switzerland, in the south-western part, a district comprehending a large portion of the Alps and the land between them and Italy. It extends in north latitude from 45° 55' to 46° 30', and in east longitude from 6° 35' to 8° 9', containing 1254 square geographical miles. It is bounded on the north-west by the Lake of Geneva and the canton of Vaud, on the north by Berne, on the north-east by Uri and Tecino, on the east, south-east, and south-west by the states of the king of Sardinia.

This canton is on every side surrounded by lofty mountains, so close to each other that the passes between them are few and very narrow. These ranges on the boundaries present some of the loftiest pinnacles of the Alps, such as Monte Rosa 14,580 feet in height, the Matterhorn orCervin 13,380 feet, St. Bernard’s 10,380 feet, the Grimsel 8580 feet, the Col de Baume 7080 feet, and the Simplon 6174 feet. The most practicable passes through these ranges, which, however, are often dangerous in winter, though kept open at a vast expense, are that by the Gemmi, the Grimsel, the Furca, and the Antonierberg, to the interior of Switzerland; that by the St. Bernard and the Simplon into Italy; and that by St. Maurice into the canton of Vaud. In the interior there are lower ranges of Alps, generally running from north to south, and thus dividing the whole surface into small vales. These vales differ much in their character; some of them are stoney and marshy, and others sterile, but others of them have valuable meadows, and land, which, when cultivated, yields profitable crops.

The climate is excessively variable. The lofty Alps protect the canton from the north wind, but the raw east wind brings frost and snow. The west wind brings heat, and the sudden changes are prejudicial to health. To these sudden and violent changes are attributed the fevers which are so prevalent; and in part is attributed to them, though in part to the Tuffa water, the great number of cretins that are to be found in the canton.

The chief products of the country are cattle, and the butter and cheese which they yield. Much of the cheese is made from the milk of goats, which are much more numerous than sheep. Horses are but rarely seen except on the great road; but many mules are used for riding as well as for purposes of husbandry. The com grown is principally barley and oats. In some of the southern valleys wine is made to a considerable extent. The growth of various fruits gives much occupation to the inhabitants. In many districts chesnuts are used as a substitute for bread. There is abundance of wood in the forests, but it is chiefly used at home for fuel or building. There are no manufactures except those of the domestic kind, which each family must manage for itself as well as it can.

The only export articles are wine, cattle, cheese, hides, wool, and dried fruits, which are sold to purchase salt, corn, iron, colonial goods, and clothing for the very few who can afford better dresses than their neighbours. In fact the commonest gratifications which in other countries have become almost necessaries, must be dispensed with, as the mass of the people are too poor to purchase any thing, and therefore must rest satisfied with what their own hands, with native materials, can provide.

The population of the canton in 1838 amounted to 75,798 persons, of whom 25,000 were of German origin, 46,000 of French, and 4750 of Italian, all speaking corrupt dialects of the several races from which they are derived. They are of the Catholic church, and no other public worship is permitted to be exercised. The ecclesiastical divisions are forty-eight parishes, and there are eight monasteries or nunneries. The bishop of Sitten, or Sion, is the head of the church under the pope.

The constitution is a pure democracy. Each male that has completed his eighteenth year has a vote; when he has completed his twenty-first may be chosen a representative, and after his twenty-fifth may become one of the executive council. The legislature assembles twice in the year, but a committee of it is permanent, and assists the landamman or governor. All the public officers are appointed for two years. Every man is enrolled in the militia. The canton is bound to furnish a contingent of 1280 men to the general confederation, and to pay a contribution to the same of 9600 francs. The whole revenue is 133,100 francs, and the annual expenditure 114,820 francs. The capital is Sitten, a small city, with 2500 inhabitants, on the Simplon road.
