VICENZA, a delegation or province of Austrian Lombardy, within the government of Venice. It is bounded on the north-west by the Tyrol, on the north-east by Belluno, on the east by Treviso, on the south-east by Padua, and on the south-west by Verona. It extends over 836 square miles, is divided into thirteen districts or circles, and these into 113 communes, containing 297,547 inhabitants, who are all of the Italian race, except those who live in seven of the Alpine districts, who are Germans; but all adhere to the Catholic religion. The land is generally level, but some spurs of the western Alps project themselves into the plain on the northern side. It is watered by several streams, which unite near the capital, and there assume the name of Bachiglione. This river is then navigable to the Brenta below Padua, and with it enters the Adriatic sea. The soil is generally good, and for the most part well cultivated, and the face of the country excites the highest gratification to one who travels through it with an agricultural eye. Maize is the chief corn crop. Wheat and rye are likewise cultivated, but are far less productive than maize, which forms almost exclusively the food of the peasantry. Flax and hemp are grown, but not extensively. The chief object of the farmers is the mulberry tree, whose number is rapidly increasing, as well as that of the silk worms that are fed with the leaves. The vines are mixed with the trees, and trained in festoons from one to the other. This has a most charming effect, but is said not to be favourable to the produce of wine, which article is in general of bad quality. A great number of sheep and oxen is fed near the streams or meadows, which are mowed three or four times in the year. The wool is fine, and that, with the cheese, forms a valuable portion of rural wealth.
