VESALIUS, Andreas, a celebrated physician and anatomist, was bom at Brussels in the year 1514. He studied physic at Paris under Sylvius, but applied himself chiefly to anatomy, which was then very little known, dissections being esteemed unlawful and impious; and it appears from his work “De Humani Corporis Fabrica,” that he perfected himself in this useful knowledge very early. About the year 1537, the republic of Venice made him professor in the university of Padua, where he taught anatomy for seven years. Charles V. called him to be his physician, as he was afterwards to Philip II., king of Spain. Vesalius was now at the height of his glory, when all of a sudden he formed the design of taking a journey to Palestine; concerning which journey we are told the following story. A young Spanish nobleman whom he had attended was supposed to be dead. Vesalius obtained leave to open him, in order to explore the true cause of his illness; but when he opened the breast, he perceived symptoms of life, and saw the heart beat. The parent, not satisfied with prosecuting him for murder, accused him of impiety to the inquisition, in hopes that tribunal would punish him with greater rigour; but the king interposing, saved him on condition of his making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He was ship-wrecked on his return, and thrown upon the island of Zante, where he perished on the 15th of October 1564. He was the author of several works, the principal of which is entitled “De Humani Corporis Fabrica, libri vu.” Basil. 1543, fol. This first edition contains excellent wood-cuts.
