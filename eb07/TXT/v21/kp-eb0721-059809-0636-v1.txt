VERCELLI, a province of the kingdom of Sardinia, in the principality of Piedmont. A part of it is mountainous, but the other portions are fertile, especially in the valleys, where much rice is produced. It contains three cities, and seventy-three towns and villages, with 99,600 inhabitants. The capital is a city of the same name. It is [7:21:599] situated on the canal of Santhia, not far from the river Lesia. It is the seat of a bishop, with a cathedral of modern style; and contains nine parish churches, ten monasteries, and seven nunneries, some of the first remarkable for their architecture. There is also an episcopal seminary, and a grammar school. It contains a population of 16,500 persons, who are chiefly occupied in raising silk, and in cultivating rice and other grain. Among the inhabitants are many noble families, who, though poor, still retain magnificent palaces. Lat. 46. 20. Long. 7. 43. E.
