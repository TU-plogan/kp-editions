VIERLANDS, four small islands in the river Elbe, a little above the city of Hamburg, and under the joint government of that city and of LÃ¼bec. The inhabitants are a colony of Dutch who came to these spots on a religious account, and who still retain their ancient language, religion, dress, and manners. They are, in fact, the market gardeners of the city of Hamburg, and supply its inhabitants with the best of culinary vegetables and fruits. The names of the islands are, Old Gamme, New Gamme, Kirkwarden, and Kosslacke. They form four parishes, and contain a population of more than 7000 persons.
