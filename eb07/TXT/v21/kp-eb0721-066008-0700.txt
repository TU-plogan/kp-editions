VISIER, an officer or dignitary in the Ottoman empire. The Visier-azam, that is, “grand visier,” is the prime minister of state in the whole empire. He commands the army in chief, and presides in the divan or great council. Next to him are six other subordinate visiers, called visiers of the bench, who officiate as his counsellors or assessors in the divan.
