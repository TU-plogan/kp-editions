VIRTUE, a term used in various significations. In its general sense it denotes power, or the perfection of any thing, whether natural or supernatural, animate or inanimate, essential or accessory. But, in its more proper or restrained sense, virtue signifies a habit, which improves and perfects the possessor and his actions.
