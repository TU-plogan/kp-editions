VEGETIUS RENATUS, Publius, is sometimes confounded with the writer noticed in the preceding article. He is the author of a work on the veterinary art; “Artis Veterinariae, Sive Mulo-medicinae, libri IV.” Basil. 1528, 4to. This is the editio princeps; and it was followed by the edition of Sambucus, Basil. 1574, 4to. Vegetius was inserted by Gesner among the “Scriptores Rei Rusticae veteres Latini.” Lipsiae, 1735, 2 tom. 4to. There is a separate edition, of which the title bears, “curante Jo. Maithia Gesnero.” Mannhemii, 1781, 8vo. But it merely contains a reprint of Gesner’s text, without his annotations. Of this work an English version was published “by the author of the translation of Columella.” Lond. 1748, 8vo.
