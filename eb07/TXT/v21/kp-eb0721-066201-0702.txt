VIZIADROOG, a commodious sea-port of Hindustan, province of Bejapore, situated south by east from Bombay. The mouth of the river on which it is situated is half a mile broad, without a bar: it is said to be navigable twenty-five miles for vessels of 200 tons burden; and near the mouth ships of 700 tons may anchor in safety. It possesses an excellent wet-dock 355 feet in length, and the spring-tides rise nine feet. The town is situated on a tract of table land, and is defended by a fort. It was taken by the British from the Mahrattas in 1818.
