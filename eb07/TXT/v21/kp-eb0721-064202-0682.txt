VICAR, a person appointed as deputy to another, to perform his functions in his absence, and under his authority.

Vicar, in the canon-law, denotes a priest of a parish, the predial tithes of which are impropriated or appropriated; that is, belong either to a chapter, religious house, &c. or to a layman who receives them, and only allows the vicar the small tithes, or a convenient salary,.
