VESTA, in pagan worship, the same with Cybele. See Cybele. Vesta the Younger, in pagan worship, the goddess of fire, was the daughter of Saturn and Cybele, and the sister of Ceres. She was so much in love with chastity, that on Jupiterâ€™s ascending the throne, and offering to grant whatever she asked, she only desired the preservation of her virginity, which she obtained. Vesta was not represented in her temple by any image.

Vesta, one of the lately discovered planets. See Astronomy .
