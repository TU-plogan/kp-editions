BREUGHEL, John, was born about the year 1575. He first applied himself to painting flowers and fruit, in which he excelled; and he afterwards obtained much success in drawing landscapes and views of the sea. He lived long at Cologne, where he acquired considerable reputation, and then travelled into Italy, where his fame went before him, and where his landscapes, adorned with small figures, gave very great satisfaction. If a judgment may be formed from the number of pictures he left behind him, he must have been exceedingly industrious; nor was he satisfied with embellishing his own works, but rendered himself useful in this respect to his friends. Even Rubens made use of Breughelâ€™s hand in the landscape part of several of his small pictures; such as his Vertumnus and Pomona, the satyr viewing the sleeping nymph, and the terrestrial paradise, which is looked upon as the masterpiece of that great artist. Breughel died in 1642.
