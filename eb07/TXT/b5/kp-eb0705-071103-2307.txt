BURGHBOTE signifies contribution towards the building or repairing of castles or walls, for the defence of a borough or city. By a law of King Athelstan, the castles and walls of towns were to be repaired, and burghbote levied every year within a fortnight after rogation days. No person whatever was exempt from this service, and even the king himself could not exempt a man from burghbote; yet in after-times exemptions appear to have been frequently granted, insomuch that the word burghbote came to denote, not the service, but the liberty or exemption from it.
