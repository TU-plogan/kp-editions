BRUSSELS, a city, one of the capitals of the kingdom of the Netherlands, and, till the separation of Holland with Belgium, alternately with the Hague the seat of the government. It is also the capital of the province of South Brabant, and of the circle, containing ten cantons and a hundred and twenty-nine communes, takes its name. It is built partly on a plain through whic the river Senne runs, and partly on the side of a hi which rises above it. The buildings in the lower part or [7:5:613]old town are larger, and, though of antique forms, handsome; but the upper or new town is one of the most splendid collection of buildings to be found on any part of the Continent. The park, near to which are the royal palace, the houses of the legislature, and the dwellings of persons of the first rank, is a very pleasing object. The most remarkable buildings are the town-house, with a beautiful tower three hundred and sixty-five feet in height, the theatre, the arsenal, the church of St Gudule, the cathedral, and the church of the Capuchins. Brussels is a manufacturing city of great activity. It has long been celebrated for its lace and its carpets; but though the demand for these goods has rather diminished, there have been substituted others whose demands exceed theirs. .Very extensive establishments have been formed for making cotton goods of all kinds, woollens of a superior quality, hats, paper, glass, soap, starch, chemical preparations, and various minute articles for dress and furniture. There are, besides, distilleries, refineries for salt and sugar, and several large breweries. Coach-making is a very important branch of industry, and all kinds of carriages are elegantly built. This trade employsmany hundreds of workmen. There are in Brussels establishments for the promotion of learning, science, and the fine arts, with collections of paintings, and a valuable library of 120,000 volumes. With the exception of London, no city in Europe has made so great progress, either in extent, in wealth, or in embellishments, as Brussels. The population in 1814 was 72,000, but it is now 100,000.
