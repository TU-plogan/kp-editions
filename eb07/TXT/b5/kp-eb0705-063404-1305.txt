BUCKEBURG, a city, the capital of the dominions of the prince of Schauenburg-Lippe. It stands on the side of a hill, at the foot of which runs the river Aa, about seven miles from Minden. It has nothing remarkable except the castle of the prince, with a park around it, and the usual appendages of miniature royalty. The city is finely situated, and contains 2120 inhabitants, who chiefly depend on the court. Long. 8. 57. 21. E. Lat. 52. 15. 47. N.
