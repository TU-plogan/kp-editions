BRUTUS, or Bkute, according to the old exploded history of this country by Geoffroy of Monmouth, was the first king of Britain. He is said to have been the son of Sylvius, who was the son of Ascanius the son of Aeneas, and born in Italy. Killing his father by chance, he fled into Greece, where he took prisoner King Padrosus, who kept the Trojans in slavery, but released him on condition of his providing ships for the Trojans to quit the land. Being advised by the oracle to sail west beyond Gaul, he, after some adventures, landed at Totness in Devonshire. Albion was then inhabited by a remnant of giants, whom Brutus [7:5:618]destroyed. He called the island after his own name, Britain. He built a city called New Troy, since London; and having reigned there twenty-four years, at his death parcelled the island among his three sons: Locrine having the middle, called Loegria ; Camber, Wales; and Alba-nach, Scotland.

Brutus, Lucius Junius, the avenger of the rape of Lucretia, and founder of the Roman republic, flourished five hundred years before Christ. See Rome. Brutus, Marcus, the passionate lover of his country, and chief conspirator against Caesar, slew himself on losing the battle of Philippi,forty-two years before Christ. See Rome.
