BUILDING. Any work of civil architecture while in progress is familiarly termed a building. This substantive use of a participial term may be thought to arise from the old habit of contracting an expression if it be long, and using a part for the whole: “ the house or church a building, ” that is, in the course of building, or now being built, is more commonly spoken of as “a building,” or “ the building.” The term is less correctly applied to edifices generally, without reference to their state of completeness or incompleteness; but this use of it should be avoided, as the term thus becomes less definite, and therefore less valuable. ’
