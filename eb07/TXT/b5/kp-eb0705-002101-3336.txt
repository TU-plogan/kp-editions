BOSHUANAS, called by some - Bichuanas, or Bet-juanas, a numerous people, or rather race, who occupy an extensive territory in Southern Africa. Their country is bounded on the south by the Cape Colony, on the east by the Caffre territory, on the north by the Makooas, and other tribes bordering on the Portuguese settlement of Mozambique. The western limit is partly unknown, partly composed of extensive deserts.

Down to the commencement of the present century, this people were entirely unknown to Europeans. Mr Barrow, indeed, in his second journey into the country of the Caffres, obtained some notices respecting them. In 1801, while the settlement laboured under a severe scarcity of cattle, two gentlemen belonging to it, Messrs Truffer and Sommerville, set out on an expedition, with the view of procuring a supply. Having passed, first the Great Karroo or Arid Desert, then the Snowy Mountains, and the territory of the rude Bosjesmans, they arrived at an extensive pastoral plain watered by the ample stream of the Orange river, and inhabited by the Koras or Kora-nas, who appeared considerably superior to any of the other Hottentot tribes. Here they met with a Boshuana, and received from him such accounts as induced them to accompany him to his own country. They soon passed the frontier, and entered on a fertile and finely-watered territory, where, after a few days’ journey, they were surprised to find, in the heart of this rude and unknown region of Africa, what might almost be termed a city. The houses and streets of Lattakoo were built and arranged in a manner decidedly superior to any hitherto seen in the southern districts of this great continent. The king, a venerable old man, received them with kindness, and they became to all the natives objects of friendly curiosity. These people appeared to our travellers not only to have made considerable progress in the arts and in civilization, but to live together in a patriarchal simplicity and harmony, which almost realized the fabled pictures of the golden age.

Lord Caledon, then governor of the Cape, on receiving this interesting intelligence, determined to follow out the career of discovery thus opened. He dispatched Dr Cowan and Lieutenant Denovan, with a party of twenty, to endeavour to penetrate through the territory of the newly-discovered people, and if possible to reach the coast at Mozambique and Sofala, by which they would throw important light on a very considerable extent of the geography of Africa. The travellers experienced at Lattakoo the same friendly reception as their precursors; they then arrived at the residence of a chief called Makkrakka, who afforded them a still more cordial welcome. A letter was received from them, dated from the residence of this chief, in about 24. south latitude, in which they described the country as increasing in beauty and fertility, and as watered by a noble river flowing to the westward. Makkrakka sent forward his own brother to recommend them to the Wanketzens, the tribe immediately to the northward. Here they met at first with a reception altogether favourable; but this treacherous people, seeing them thrown [7:5:22]off their guard, determined upon an attack, for the purpose or seizing all their property. The expedition imprudently separated into three parties, one of which went to bathe, while another remained in charge of the waggons, and a third of the cattle. The natives having attacked successively these three bodies, succeeded too fully in their atrocious design, and entirely cut off the English.

The government at the Cape did not for some time obtain any intelligence respecting this party, and the first rumour of the disaster arrived by way of Mozambique. No official mission has since been dispatched; yet several travellers, animated by liberal curiosity, or the benevolent desire of communicating to the natives the truths of the gospel, have penetrated even deeper into the interior of this region than those now mentioned. Dr Lichtenstein, after an extensive survey of the country of the Caffres, ventured, not without some apprehension, to Lattakoo, but met with a perfectly friendly reception. Being solicited, however, to give aid with fire-arms in a war against Makkrakka, the traveller, unwilling to involve himself in these interior African contests, wisely took the first opportunity of returning, after gaining, however, a good deal of information. In 1813, the Reverend Mr Campbell, at the request of the Missionary Society, and with a view to promote its objects, ventured on an expedition into this territory. Although the dispositions of the people were not altogether such as he could have wished, he had no personal cause of complaint. Lattakoo was found (a change not uncommon in Africa, and consequent upon a schism among its inhabitants) to have been transported about sixty miles from its former situation. It appeared also diminished in size, not containing above 1500 houses and 8000 inhabitants. Although unable to effect any conversions, he obtained, with some difficulty, permission for missionaries to settle here, and a promise of good treatment. In 1820 he returned and found the establishment in a tolerably flourishing state. The missionaries had neat houses and gardens built for their use, with a chapel capable of containing 400 persons, though it was very thinly attended. Mr Campbell penetrated northwards to Mashow, Meribohway, and Kurrechanc, towns larger than Lattakoo, and governed by separate chiefs. Mr Burchell afterwards, in the course of an extensive tour through Southern Africa, penetrated beyond Lattakoo, and westward to Bakarrikarri, on the confines of the Great Desert. We have thus, from a succession of intelligent travellers, very satisfactory information respecting this country, and the tribes by which it is inhabited.

The Boshuanas are proved, both by their form and language, to belong to the same race with the Caffres; but their persons are less vigorous, and in the male sex less strikingly handsome; yet many of their females possess a great share of beauty. Although they are not on the whole so fine and manly a race, yet they have made a greater progress in the useful and even ornamental arts. Agriculture is carried on with considerable diligence; though, as is too common in barbarous tribes, its labours are devolved entirely on the female sex, who have the additional task of building the houses and fashioning the furniture and dress. The men, on the other hand, take the entire charge of the cattle, which constitutes their chief wealth. ∙ Cultivation is confined to the spaces surrounding their towns, which are built on heights for the purpose of defence; and the cattle are driven out every morning to feed, often at a considerable distance, and brought back at night within the circuit of the inclosures. The habitations are neat and commodious, being encircled with substantial walls of earth or stone; and some parts are moulded into pillars, or other ornamental shapes, and carefully painted. At Kurrechane iron and copper were smelted in large furnaces of clay; and they had well constructed vessels of earthenware for holding their grain and stores. The men are dressed chiefly in skins, often prepared with considerable ingenuity; whilst those of wild animals are thrown over their shoulders for ornament. The ladies of rank wear ample mantles, profusely embellished with beads, rings, and various species of ornaments. Makaitshoah, the beautiful wife of the king of Lattakoo, appeared to Dr Lichtenstein, having her robe trimmed with rich furs, a large bundle of cats tails hanging from the left shoulder, and one arm loaded with no less than seventy-two copper rings; the display of which appeared to be an object of peculiar pride.

In regard to their political situation, they have kings who rule with a species of patriarchal authority, and chiefly by means of influence and persuasion. When any affair of great importance is to be decided, a pectso, or general assembly of the chiefs and warriors, is summoned. These assemblages are carried on in a peculiar, and even extravagant style. The chiefs on their way indulge in strange gestures and gambols. Before entering on deliberation they commonly join in a song, whilst the principal orator often strikes up a dance. Every speech is prefaced by three tremendous howls or yells, sometimes imitating the cries of animals, while several of the attendants dance in unison. As the debate proceeds, the female citizens form an exterior circle, and by loud cheers or derisive laughter express their sense of the observations made by the speakers.

The distinctions of wealth, and even of rank, are pretty strongly marked in this society; yet they have little influence on the general train of social intercourse. Mateebe, or Mattivi, the chief whom the travellers call king, was seen seated on the ground smoking and exchanging pipes with the most ordinary citizens. He does not interfere in private quarrels, even when they proceed to bloodshed; this is considered to be an affair between individuals. He waits till his arbitration is called for, and then proceeds, often in a very summary manner, executing with his own hand the sentence pronounced.

A considerable degree of internal union and harmony prevails among these tribes. Their manners, making no pretensions to any high refinement, are neither coarse nor boisterous; their general deportment is frank and cordial, and a kind and friendly spirit towards one another seems to prevail. But the intercourse of different states with each other forms a complete scene of violence and rapine. Commandos, or forays, to carry off the cattle of their neighbours, and kill all who oppose them, form their most favourite employment. They seem to consider themselves born for this purpose; and the number of cattle which they have carried off, and of men whom they have slain, is through life their highest boast. Dr Lichtenstein even states, that on returning from a successful expedition they celebrate a horrid feast, in which each produces a portion of the flesh of his slaughtered enemy, which he roasts and devours. Towards strangers their behaviour has been generally friendly and hospitable. Mr Campbell’s party were indeed astonished, on arriving at one of the towns, to see the warriors rushing forth to meet them, brandishing their battle-axes, painted red, and dressed in the skins of wild beasts; but this soon proved to be only a form of barbarous welcome. After the first ceremony was over, however, they began actively to beg, and even to pilfer tobacco, a European luxury of which they soon became excessively fond. The missionaries have been always well treated, but have never made much progress in their main object. Engrossed by their tumultuary occupations of pasturage and war, this people seem to have a peculiar apathy towards all spiritual and abstract ideas. They [7:5:23]seem also, from Mr Burchell’s observation, to be familiar with all the forms of superstition prevalent among an ignorant people.

In advancing northwards into the interior, the country seems to improve, becoming more populous, while the people are more industrious, and better skilled in the arts. Mashow, beautifully situated on a hill, was estimated to contain 10,000 or 12,000 inhabitants; and it was surrounded by twenty-nine villages, within a circuit of twenty miles of cultivated territory. Kurreehane, still larger and more handsomely built, was supposed to contain 16,000 or 17,000 people.

This country was exposed in 1823 to a most disastrous invasion, from a predatory and ferocious race called the Mantatees, or “wanderers.” They were in fact a collected multitude of different Caffre tribes, flying before the attack of the Zoolas, who had formed a dominion on the coast of Natal. The invaders were estimated at 40,000 warriors, almost naked, armed with clubs, spears, and battle-axes, and having their legs adorned with numerous brass rings. They succeeded in sacking Kurrechane; and, after being repulsed from another town, advanced upon Lattakoo, where they spread the most deadly consternation; the inhabitants not being possessed of courage sufficient to enable them to face such a formidable attack. They received, however, the aid of a party of Griqua Hottentots, who had learned from Europeans the use of fire-arms; and after an obstinate conflict turned to flight this immense multitude, and obliged them to retreat within the Caffre territory.
