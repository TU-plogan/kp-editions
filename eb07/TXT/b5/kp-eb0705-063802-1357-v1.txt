BUDNAeANS, in Ecclesiastieal History, so called from the name of their leader, Simon Budnaeus. They not only denied all kind of religious worship to Jesus Christ, but asserted that he was not begotten by any extraordinary act of divine power, being born, like other men, in a natural way. Budnaeus was deposed from his ministerial functions in the year 1584, and publicly excommunicated, with all his disciples; but afterwards abandoning his peculiar sentiments, he was re-admitted to the communion of the Socinian sect. Crellius ascribes the origin of the above opinion to Adam Neuser.
