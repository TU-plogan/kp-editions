BRIDGEWATER, a borough and market-town of the hundred of North Petherton, in the county of Somerset, 142 miles from London. It stands on the river Parret, on which vessels from sea ascend to the iron bridge, but are aground at low water. There is much trade here, as coals for the supply of the interior are imported in large quantities, and much malt and a peculiar kind of bricks are exported. There is a good market on Thursday. Two members are returned to parliament by the inhabitant householders. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3634, in 1811 to 4179, and in 1821 to 6155.
