BRAMBANAN, a village of Java, nearly in the centre of the island, situated at the foot of a range of mountains on the north that run east and west to a great extent. It is noted for the remains of Hindu images, temples, and inscriptions, which are spread over an extent of ten miles. The most remarkable of those ruins are known under the name of the Thousand Temples, which constitute a square group of buildings, each side measuring 250 paces. One large temple stood in the centre of the square, which was surrounded at equal distances by three square rows of smaller ones, the rows being but a few feet distant from each other. At each of the four cardinal points, where there appear to have been gates, were two gigantic statues, each of them with a mace in its hand, and a snake twisted round its body. The inside walls of the large temple were adorned with figures of the conch shell, of water-vases, and of the sacred lotus, all dcnoting a Hindu origin. In these temples are figures, and other figures in relief are sculptured on the walls. They are all built of hewn granite, admirably cut and polished, and fitted into each other by means of a prominence in the upper stone, which fits into a groove on the upper surface of the stone underneath. Great skill is displayed in the architecture of the roof, which, like the rest of the building, is of hewn granite. The deepest mystery hangs over these ruins. They confirm the tradition, that at some former era a nation must have flourished in these islands, more advanced in the arts of civilization than the modern Javanese. But there is not the slightest evidence to show at what period those immense buildings were constructed. A Javanese manuscript asserts that it was in the Javanese year 1188, which corresponds to the year of the Christian era 1261.
