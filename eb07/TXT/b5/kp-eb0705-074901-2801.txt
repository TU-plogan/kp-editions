BUST, or Busro, in Sculpture, denotes the figure or portrait of a person in relievo, showing only the head, shoulders, and stomach, the arms being lopped off, and ordinarily placed on a pedestal or console.

In speaking of an antique, we say the head is marble, and the bust porphyry or bronze, that is, the stomach and shoulders. Felibien observes, that though in painting one may say r a figure appears in busto, yet it is not properly called a bust, that word being confined to things in relievo. The bust is the same with what the Latins called Herman from the Greek Hermes, Mercury, the image of that god being frequently represented in this manner amongst the Athenians.

Bust is also used, especially by the Italians, for the trunk of a human body, from the neck to the hips.
