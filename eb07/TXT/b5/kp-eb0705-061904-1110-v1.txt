BUAT-NANCAY, Louis Gabriel, Count du, was born of an old family in Normandy on the 2d of March 1732. At an early age he entered into the order of Malta; and, by a fortunate accident, he became acquainted with the Chevalier Folard, author of the Commentaries on Polybius, who received him into his house and superintended his education. Folard had a nephew, who w as minister for France at different German courts, and under whom Buat studied history and diplomacy. He was successively minister for France at Ratisbon and Dresden; but afterwards, becoming disgusted with this career, he retired from public life in the year 1776. He died at Nançay, in Berry, on the 18th of September 1787.

Buat was a man of some talents and considerable literary attainments, but possessing little knowledge of the world; which circumstance seems to have in a great measure disqualified him for public employment. He appears to have written with great facility; but his style is very unequal. His works are: 1. Tableau du Gouvernement actuel de l'Empire d Allemagne, translated from the German of Schmauss, with notes historical and critical, Paris, 1755, 12mo. 2. Les Origines, ou 'l ’ Ancien Gouvernement de la France, de l'Italie, et de l'Allemagne, published at the Hague, 1757, 4 vols. 12mo. 3. Histoire Ancienne des Peuples de l'Europe, Paris, 1772, 12 vols. 12mo. This is the [7:5:620] largest and perhaps the best work of Buat. 4. Les Elemens de la Politique, ou Recherches sur les vrais Principes de l’ Economie Sociale, 1773, 6 vols. 8vo. 5. Les Maximes du Gouvernement Monarchique, pour servir de suite aux Eléniens, 4 vols. 8vo. There is also ascribed to Buaţ a work entitled Remarques d’un Français, ou Examen impartial du livre de Μ Necher sur les Finances, Geneva, 1785, 8vo. In his youth he had composed a tragedy, entitled Charlemagne, ou le Triomphe des Lois, published at Vienna, 1764, 8vo. He likewise contributed several articles to the journals of his tim - e, on different points of history, literature, and political economy; in particular, some excellent observations on the eharaetcr of Xenophon, inserted in the fourth volume of the Variétés Littéraires.
