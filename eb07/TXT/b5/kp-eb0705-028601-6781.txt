BRIDGEND, a market-town of the county of Glamorgan, in South Wales, being partly in the parish of Newcastle and partly in that of Coity, 179 miles from London. It stands on the river Ogmore, which supplies a great abundance of salmon and other fish, and the market, held on Saturday, is well supplied with all other necessaries. There is a neat county-hall, where the sessions, and occasionally the county elections, are held.
