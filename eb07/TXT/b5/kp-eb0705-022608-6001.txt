BREHONS, the provincial judges among the ancient Irish, by whom justice was administered and controversies decided. These sages were a distinct tribe or family, to whom competent lands were allowed in inheritance. In criminal cases the brehon had the eleventh part of all the fines; which could not but be considerable at a time when murders, rapes, robberies, and the like offences, were only subject to pecuniary commutations.

ERDiiON-Laws, or Leges Brehonicae, denote the. general maxims or rules observed by the Brehons, and which had the force of laws throughout all the provinces of Ireland.
