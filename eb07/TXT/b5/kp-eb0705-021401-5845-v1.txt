BREADALBANE, or Braidalbin, a district of Scotland, in the western part of Perthshire, about thirty-three miles in length by thirty-one in breadth. It is mountainous, and for the most part unproductive. The hills, however, afford pasture for large flocks of sheep, and some of the valleys are cultivated, though not extensively, whilst others are nothing but mosses of peat and heath. Atone extremity lies Loch Lyon, from which the river Lyon issues, and, flowing in a sinuous course, discharges itself into the Tay. In the centre of the district lies Loch Tay, which is about sixteen miles in length, and is surrounded by natural scenery of great beauty and splendour. The country abounds in limestone; and several metals, such as lead and copper, are also found. There is not a town in the district, and the only villages worthy of mention are Kenmore, Killin, and Clifton. It is now traversed by several good roads. In addition to the avocations of agriculture and the breeding of cattle, a part of the inhabitants during summer occupy themselves in collecting a species of lichen from among the rocks, which is used by dyers. The Earl of Breadalbane is the chief proprietor, whose seat is Taymouth, near Kenmore.
