BUCCELLARII, an order of soldiery under the Greek emperors, appointed to guard and distribute the ammunition bread; though authors are somewhat divided as to their office and quality. Among the Visigoths buccellarius was a general name for a client or vassal who lived at the expense of his lord. Some give the denomination to parasites in the courts of princes; others make them the body-guards of emperors; and others, again, fancy they were only such as emperors employed in putting persons to death privately.
