BRUNSWICK, Duchy of. See Germany. Brunswick, a city, the capital of the duchy of the same name, in Germany. It is situated on the small navigable river Oker, which joins the Aller, and then falls into the Weser. It is an open place, the fortifications having been demolished and converted into public walks. It is a well-built city, on a fruitful plain. The palace, in the ancient German style, is large, inelegant, and incommodious. There are eleven churches, of which nine, including the cathedral, are allotted to the Lutheran worship, and one each to the Catholics and the Reformed. The number of inhabitants in 1827 was 36,200. These find employment partly in the trades and professions arising from the seat of government, partly from the trade created by the great fairs annually held, but chiefly from manufactures of almost every kind of commodity, the principal of which is perhaps that of brewing beer and vinegar, and the distillation of corn. There are several cabinets, museums, libraries, and collections of pictures belonging to or under the patronage of the duke. Long. 10. 26. 22. E. Lat. 52. 15. 35. N.

Brunswick, a post-town of Maine, in Cumberland county, United States. It is situated on the south-west side of the Androscoggin, and contains 2931 inhabitants. Long. 69. 55. W. Lat. 43. 53. N.
