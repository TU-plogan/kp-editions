BOTTOM, in a general sense, denotes the lowest part of á thing, in contradistinction to the top or uppermost part.

Bottom, in Navigation, is used to denote as well the channel of rivers and harbours, as the body or hull of a ship. Thus, in the former sense, we say, gravelly bottom, clayey bottom, sandy bottom, and so forth; in the latter, a British bottom, a Butch bottom, and the like.
