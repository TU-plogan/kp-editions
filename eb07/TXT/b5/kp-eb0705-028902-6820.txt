To BRING-to, in Navigation, to check the course of a ship when she is advancing, by arranging the sails in such a manner that they shall counteract each other, and prevent her either from retreating or moving forward. In this situation the ship is said to lie by, or to lie to; having, according to the sea phrase, some of her sails aback, to oppose the force of those which are full; or having them otherwise shortened by being furled, or hauled up in the brails.

Bringing-to is generally used to detain a ship in any particular station, in order to wait the approach of some other that may be advancing towards her; or to retard [7:5:290]her course occasionally near any port in the course of a voyage.
