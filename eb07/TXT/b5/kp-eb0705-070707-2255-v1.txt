BURCKHARDT, John Ludwig. This traveller, celebrated for his extensive journeys in the East, was descended from an ancient family in Switzerland, who had been long established at Kirchgarten, near Lausanne. His father, John Rudolph, had been tried by a French military commission on a charge of having delivered up the tête du pont at Hunningen to the Austrians, and, though acquitted, received such treatment from the French republican authorities as made a lasting impression on his mind, and induced him to remove his family from the territories, where their power predominated, and to establish them at Basle. He then entered into a Swiss corps in the service of England.

John Ludwig was the eighth son, and born about the year 1785. Having acquired the usual classical instruction at Basle, he was placed at the university of Leipsic; and, after a residence there of two years, according to a custom very usual with German students, of dividing the time of their academical course among several universities, he concluded his studies, and took his degree, at Göttingen. During his residence at the latter seat of learning, his talents, application, and good conduct had gained him the esteem and respect of the professors, but especially of the celebrated Blumenbach. When he resolved on proceeding to England, Blumenbach gave him a letter of introduction to Sir Joseph Banks, who, with the other members of the African Association, to whom he was introduced, accepted his offer of travelling to explore the interior of Africa. After the plan of his journey had been settled, he diligently prepared himself for it by application to those studies which were most appropriate. He passed his time partly in London and partly at Cambridge in acquiring a knowledge of astronomy, chemistry, mineralogy, medicine, and surgery. He suffered his beard to grow, accustomed himself to the dress and manners of the East, and diligently learned to read, write, and speak the Arabic language; in all which pursuits he was much assisted by Browne, who during his travels in Africa had acquired not merely a knowledge of, but an ardent attachment to, the languages and customs of Mahommedan nations.

After these preparations, and receiving his instructions from the society, he left England, and in April 1809 reached Malta, whence he proceeded to Aleppo in the following October. Being determined to acquire the Arabic language in perfection, he appeared there as a Mussulman under the name of Ibrahim Ibn Abdallah; and, during more than two years passed in that part of Asia, he had so perfected himself in the language as not to be distinguished from the natives, and acquired such accurate [7:5:708] knowledge of the contents of the Koran, and of the commentaries upon its religion and laws, that after a critical examination, the most learned Mussulmen entertained no doubts of his being really what he professed to be, a learned doctor of their law.

During his residence in Syria he visited Palmyra, Damascus, Lebanon, and the other parts of that interesting country, and thence repaired to Cairo in Egypt, with the intention of joining a caravan, and travelling to Fezzan, in the north of Africa. In 1812, whilst waiting for the departure of the caravan, he was induced to maκe a journey to the Nile, as far up as Mahass; and then, in the character of a poor Syrian merchant, he made a journey through the Nubian desert which Bruce had traversed, passing by Berber and Shendy to Suakim, on the Red Sea; whence he performed the pilgrimage to Mecca by way of Jidda. In this journey his privations and sufferings seem to have been of the severest kind. He returned thence to Cairo in a state of great exhaustion, but in 1815 travelled to Mount Sinai, whence he returned again to Cairo in June 1816, and there made preparations for his intended journey to Fczzan, and to explore the sources of the Niger.

Several hindrances prevented his prosecuting this intention, till at length, in April 1817, when the long-expected caravan prepared to depart, he was seized with an illness which ended his life. He had from time to time carefully transmitted his journals and remarks, and a very copious series of letters; so that nothing which appeared to him to be interesting in the various journeys he made has been lost. But it is much to be lamented that the life of a man so well qualified as Burckhardt should not have been prolonged, till he had been enabled to solve many of the doubts respecting the interior of Africa, which has excited the curiosity of mankind from the most remote ages.

The communications from Burckhardt have at several periods been furnished to the public in very ample forms, with appropriate maps; and much light has been thrown by them on the geography of the countries he visited, and on the manners, laws, religion, and commerce of their inhabitants. His Journey along the Banks of the Nile from Assouan to Mahass, on the Frontier of Dongola, was published in 1819, in 4to; and the volume contained also a description of a Journey from Upper Egypt through the Deserts of Nubia to Jidda in Arabia. To this is added an Appendix, with an Itinerary from the Frontiers of Bornou by Bahr el Ghazal and Darfour to Shendy; and also notices of the country of Soudan, west of Darfour, and vocabularies of the several languages.

In 1822 a volume was published containing a Tour from Damascus in the countries of Libanus and Anti-Libanus; a Journal of an Excursion into the Haouran in 1810; a Journey from Aleppo to Damascus in 1812; a Journey from Damascus into the Haouran in 1811; a Journey from 1 )amascus through the Mountains of Arabia Petrae'n in 1812; and a Journal of a Tour in the Peninsula of Mount Sinai in 1816.

In 1829 was published a posthumous volume of Travels in Arabia, in 4to (2 vols. 8vo). This is a very interesting work, containing the narrative of a Journey to Mecca and Medina during the time when the former city was the scene of the great Hadj or pilgrimage, as also the best account yet given of the Wahabee power.

In 1830 appeared another volume, entitled Manners and Cus toms of the Egyptians, 4to; but this, consisting chiefly of the proverbs current among the people of Cairo, is not of equal value with his former publications. (g.)
