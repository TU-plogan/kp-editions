BOTTOM, in a general sense, denotes the lowest part of รก thing, in contradistinction to the top or uppermost part.

Bottom, in Navigation, is used to denote as well the channel of rivers and harbours, as the body or hull of a ship. Thus, in the former sense, we say, gravelly bottom, clayey bottom, sandy bottom, and so forth; in the latter, a British bottom, a Butch bottom, and the like.
