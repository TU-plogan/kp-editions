BURLINGTON, or Bridlington, a sea-port town of England, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, situated on a bay called Burlington Bay, formed by Flamborough Head, which is about five miles distant, nearly north-east. It is situated about a mile from the shore; but there is another portion of it, named Burlington Quay, situated directly on the coast, formed by a pier which extends a considerable way into the bay. Considerable trade is carried on here, and the burden of the shipping belonging to the port amounts to about 6000 tons. A weekly market is held here, and two annual fairs. Burlington and Burlington Quay contain about 4000 inhabitants. Long. 0. 8. W. Lat. 54. 8. 30. N.
