BRAG, a game at cards, where as many may partake as the cards will supply; the eldest hand dealing three to each person at one time, and turning up the last card all round. This being done, each gamester puts down three stakes, one for each card; and the first stake is won by the best card turned up in the dealing round; beginning from the ace, king, queen, knave, and so downwards. When cards of the same value are turned up to two or more of the gamesters, the eldest hand gains; but it is to be observed that the ace of diamonds wins, to whatever hand it be turned up. The second stake is won by what is called the brag, which consists in one of the gamesters challenging the rest to turn up cards equal to his. But it is to be observed that a pair of aces is the best brag, a pair of kings the next, and so on; and a pair of any sort wins the stake from the most valuable single card. In this consists the great diversion of the game; for, by the artful management of the looks, gestures, and voice, it frequently happens that a pair of fives, trois, or even deuces, outbrags a much higher pair, and even some pairs royal, to the no small merriment of the company. The knave of clubs is here a principal favourite, making a pair with any other card in hand, and with any other two cards a pair royal. The third stake is won by the person who first makes up the cards in his hand one and thirty; each dignified card going for ten, and drawing from the pack, as usual in this game.
