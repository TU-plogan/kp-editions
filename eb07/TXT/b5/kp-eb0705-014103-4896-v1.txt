BOTH, John and Andrew, Flemish painters, and pupils of Bloemart, were born at Utrecht about the year 1610. The union of these brothers was remarkable; they were alike inseparable in their studies, their travels, and their painting. John painted the landscape part of their pictures in the manner of Claude Lorrain, and Andrew drew the figures and animals in the style of Bamboche. They both died in 1650; Andrew having been drowned at Venice, and his brother John, through grief, having soon afterwards followed him to the grave. In the national gallery of France there is a painting by these two masters representing a Vieιν of Italy at Sunset.
