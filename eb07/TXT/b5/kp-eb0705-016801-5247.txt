BOYNE, a river of Ireland, which rises in Queenâ€™s County in the province of Leinster, and running northeast by Trim and Cavan, falls at last into the Irish Channel a little below Drogheda. It is memorable for a battle fought on its banks between James II. and King William III. in which the former was defeated.
