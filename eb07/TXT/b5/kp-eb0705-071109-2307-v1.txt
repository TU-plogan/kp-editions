BURGOS, a province of Castile, in the north of Spain, bounded on the north by the ocean; on the east by Biscay, Alava, and Soria; on the south by Segovia; and on the west by Palencia, Valladolid, Toro, and Asturias. Its extent is 7822 square miles. It is a lofty territory, intersected by ranges of mountains, between which are extensive and fruitful valleys. The soil is for the most part sandy, intermixed with stones, but in some parts is of a good loamy description. The loftiest mountains are in the north, called the Cantabrian, which are covered with woods; whilst the Sierra Reynosa and others are bare, and almost utterly barren. The valleys in the province are watered by various small streams, and their tributary rivulets, the waters of all which are collected in part by the Ebro, which conveys them to the Mediterranean Sea, and in part by the Douro, which runs to the Atlantic Ocean. The climate is generally temperate, the summers being cool, and, except on the loftier parts, the winters not sufficiently cold. The atmosphere in the interior is commonly clear, but on the coast moist and foggy. The agriculture, though ill conducted, produces a sufficiency for the population. The breeding of cattle is the most profitable branch of rural industry; and the province supplies its neighbours with many cows, sheep, goats, horses, mules, and asses. Some silk, flax, and hemp are produced, but in very small quantities. There are scarcely any manufactures except of the domestic kind, or upon a very small scale. The inhabitants at the last correct census, that of 1803, amounted to 470,588; and it is probable they have increased since that period. The province contains five cities, 583 towns, and 1118 villages. The only places of more than 5000 inhabitants are Burgos, Logrofio, and Santander.

Burgos, a city, the capital of the province of the same name, in Spain. It is situated on a hill, around which the river Arlanzon winds. It is fortified, but its chief defence is the castle, which checked the progress of the British army. It is the see of an archbishop, whose cathedral is large and handsome, though antique. It has, besides, fourteen other churches, and twenty-four religious houses. It is the seat of the military academy and an ecclesiastical seminary, and contains about 11,000 inhabitants.
