BRENTFORD, a town, being a hamlet in part of the parish of Hamwell and hundred of Ossulton, in the county of Middlesex, seven miles from London, on the banks of the Thames. It consists of a single long street, and comprehends two parishes, with their respective churches. It is remarkable as the place where elections for the county are held, and as the greatest thoroughfare for carriages of any in England, though the street is narrow, and impediments often present themselves to obstruct the road. Near it is the magnificent palace of the Duke of Northumberland, Sion-House; and on the opposite bank of the Thames the royal palace of Kew, with its magnificent botanical garden. There is a well-supplied market on the Tuesdays.
