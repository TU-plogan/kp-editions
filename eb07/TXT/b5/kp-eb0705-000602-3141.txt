BORISTHENES, or Borysthenes, in Ancient Geography, the largest river of Sarmatia Europaea, and described by Mela, after Herodotus, as running through Ã¢ cognominal people,; as the pleasantest of all the rivers in Scythia, calmer than any of them in its course, and very agreeable to drink; as producing rich pastures, and large fish, of the best flavour, without bones; as flowing a great distance,-and rising from springs unknown; and as being navigable for a course of about forty days. It is now called the Dnieper or Nieper.
