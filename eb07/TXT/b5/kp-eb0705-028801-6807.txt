BRIGHTHELMSTONE, or Brighton, a town on the sea-coast, in the hundred of Whalesbone and rape of Lewes, in the county of Sussex. The growth of this place is one of those manifestations of the progress of wealth and the increased power of gratification in this kingdom, which on reflection cannot fail to excite astonishment. This town, a small fishing place till 1784, with neither commerce nor manufactures, and with no peculiar advantages even for sea-bathing, which formed the only pretext for visiting it, has, by the mere force of fashion acting upon rapidly-augmented wealth, grown up to be a city almost of palaces, exhibiting a display of every comfort and even luxury, and containing a population of more than 40,000 persons. It is built under the shelter of the Southdown Hills, which protect it from the northern and eastern blasts, and hence it is as much a place of resort for the idle, the invalid, and the mere fashionist, in the winter, as it was at its first establishment in the summer season. Magnificent squares and parades have been built, which have speedily found occupants; the embellishments have kept pace with their growth; churches and chapels have been erected to supply religious aid to all sects and all tastes; hotels, club-houses, and other establishments, have been formed for purposes of amusement; carriages and horses are in readiness equal to the demand for them; and every necessary, every accommodation, and almost every luxury, may be found in the markets, the shops, and the repositories. By means of steam-boats it has become one of the passages to France, and from thence the inhabitants can obtain supplies of fruit, vegetables, game, poultry, and other articles at reasonable rates. In addition to other inducements, a German institution for producing all the waters of the most celebrated medicinal springs on the Continent has, at much expense, and with very great scientific skill, been constructed. A new town has been built or is building, called Kemp Town, to contain houses of a large kind, sufficient for ten thousand more inhabitants. According to the government census, the population amounted in 1801 to 7339, in 1811 to 12,012, and in 1821 to 24,429; but the greatest proportional increase has been since the last of these years.
