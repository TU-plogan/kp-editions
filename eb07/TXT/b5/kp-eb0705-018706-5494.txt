BRAURONIA, in Grecian Antiquity, a festival in honour of Diana, surnamed Brauronia, from its having been observed at Brauron, an Athenian borough. This festival was celebrated once in five years, under the management of ten men, called in Greek kοοπο∣ο∣. The victim offered in sacrifice was a goat, and it was customary for certain men to sing portions of Homer’s Iliad. The most remarkable persons at this solemnity were young virgins, habited in yellow gowns, and consecrated to Diana. It was unlawful for any of them to be above ten or under five years of age.
