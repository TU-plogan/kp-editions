BRANDY, a spirituous and inflammable liquor, extracted from wine and other liquors by distillation. The wine-brandy of France is esteemed the best in Europe. It is distilled wherever wine is made, and for this purpose pricked rather than good wine is employed. The chief brandies for foreign trade, and those accounted best, are the brandies of Bourdeaux, Rochelle, Cognac, Charenton, the Isle of Rh√©, Orleans, the county of Blasois, Poictou, Touraine, Anjou, Nantes, Burgundy, and Champaigne.
