BRAHOOICK Mountains, a chain of mountains so called by Colonel Pöttinger, from the Brahooes, who inhabit them. They run along the eastern frontier of Persia, and extend 280 miles in length from south-east to north-east, and about 200 miles in their utmost breadth, under latitude 28. N. This range of mountains springs abruptly to a conspicuous height and grandeur, out of the sea at Cape Mowaree, in longitude 66° 58' E. latitude 25° N., whence it assumes a north-easterly direction for ninety miles. It there projects a ridge east by north, the base of which is washed by the river Indus, at the foot of Seh wan. From the separation of this chain, in latitude 25° 45', to that of30°, the primitive body runs due north, now marking the western limits of Sinde, Kutch Gundava, and a part of Sewestan, as it formerly did that of Hindustan. It thence once more regains its original inclination to the north-east, and decreases in elevation so rapidly, that in the course of forty miles it sinks down to a level, and becomes incorporated with the hills inhabited by the Käufers and by other Afghan tribes. To the westward the Brahooick Mountains are far more complicated. At their emergence from the ocean their breadth does not exceed thirty miles from the one base to the other; but from the latitude of twenty-five and a half degrees, they progressively sweep round to north, north-north-west, north-west, and west-north-west, expanding over several degrees of longitude, and sending forth many collateral chains. The main range stretches away towards the north, to the twenty-eighth degree of north latitude, where it meets the sandy desert about the sixty-fourth degree of east longitude; it afterwards sinks, like the eastern front, to-an equality with the Afghan hills, among which it is lost. This chain of mountains reaches in some parts to a great altitude, and has many peaks covered with snow. (Pottinger’s Travels in Beloochistan and Sindel) (f.)
