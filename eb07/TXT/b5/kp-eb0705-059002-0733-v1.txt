BROOKE, Mrs, daughter of a clergyman of the name of Moore, was a lady as remarkable for her virtue and suavity of manners as for her great literary accomplishments. Hcr first performance, which introduced her to the notice and consequent esteem of the public, was Julia Mandeville ; a work concerning which there were various opinions, but which every body read with eagerness. It has been often wished that she had made the catastrophe less melancholy; and wc believe that she was afterwards of the same opinion, but she thought it unworthy of her character to alter it. Soon afterwards she went to Canada with her husband, who was chaplain to the garrison at Quebec; and here shc saw and loved those romantic characters and scenes which gave birth to Emily Montague ; a work most deservedly in universal esteem, which has passed through several editions, and which is now not easily met with. On her return to England, accident introduced, and congenial sentiments attracted her, to Mrs Yates; and an intimacy was formed which terminated only with the life of that lady. Mrs Brooke, in consequence of this connection, formed an acquaintance with Mr Garrick, and wrote some pieces for the stage. She had, however, great reason to be dissatisfied with his behaviour as a manager; and she made The Excursion, a novel which she wrote at this time, the vehicle by which she exhibited to the public her complaints. Her anger, we believe, was just, but the retribution was too severe. She herself afterwards thought so, for she lamented and retracted it. Her first dramatic performance was the tragedy of Virginia, 1756. Her next effort in that line was The Siege of Synope, a tragedy, introduced by Mr Harris, and written principally with the view of placing Mrs Yates in a conspicuous character. This did not altogether fail, but it did not become popular; it wanted energy, and it had not much originality; there was little to disapprove, but there was nothing to admire. Her next and most popular production was lĩosina, which, in a most liberal manner, she presented to Mr Harris. Few modern pieces have been equally successful. Her last musical piece, entitled Maman, which was introduced by Shield, continued for some time to be occasionally exhibited. Mrs Brooke was also the translator of various books from the French. She was esteemed by Dr Johnson, valued by Miss Seward, and her company was courted by all the first characters of her time. She died in January 1789, two days after hcr husband. Her husband enjoyed the rectory of Colney in Norfolk, to which he had been preferred after his arrival from America.
