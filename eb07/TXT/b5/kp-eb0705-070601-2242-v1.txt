BUNDER, or Bender Abbas, or Gomberoon, the ancient Harmozia, a fortress of Persia, in the province of Fars, situated in a barren country, in a bay of the Gulf of Ormuz. It is subject to the imaum of Maskat, and is fortified with double walls. It was at one time the first seaport of Persia, and is still a place of considerable trade. The customs amount to 20,000 rupees, above L.2000 a year, for which, and the tribute of Minab, the imaum accounts to the king of Persia. It is eighteen miles southeast of Bushire. Long. 56. 12. E. Lat. 27. 18. N.

Bunder, or Pender Peig, or Port of Sand, a town of Persia, in the province of Fars, which stands close to the eastern shore of the Persian Gulf. It is surrounded by a miserable mud wall, flanked with round towers, on which are placed three or four useless guns. This town was the seat of a venerable freebooter, Meer Mahund, whose exploits are partly related by Niebuhr; and during his life it was a place of so much strength as to resist the repeated attacks of Kurim Khan, by whom, however, it was at last taken, after a long siege. The works were razed to the ground; and the town has so much declined since that period, that it does not contain above 300 or 400 inhabitants. It is thirty-five miles north of Bushire.
