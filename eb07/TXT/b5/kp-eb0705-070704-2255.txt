BUPALUS, a celebrated sculptor, and native of the island of Chios, was the son, grandson, and great grandson of sculptors. He had a brother, named Athenis, of the same profession, and they flourished in the sixtieth Olympiad, being contemporary with Hipponax, a poet or an ugly and despicable figure, with whom they diverted themselves by representing him under a ridiculous form. There were several statues at Rome executed by them; and they worked only on the white marble of the isle of Paros. Pausanias mentions Bupalus as a good architect as well as sculptor, but says nothing of Athenis.
