BUSKIN, a kind of shoe, somewhat in the form of a boot, and adapted to either foot, and worn by either sex. This part of dress, covering both the foot and mid-leg, was tied underneath the knee; it was very rich and fine, and principally used on the stage by actors in tragedy. It was of a quadrangular form; and the sole was so thick, that by means of it men of the ordinary stature might be raised to the pitch and elevation of the heroes they personated. The colour was generally purple on the stage; and herein it was distinguished from the sock worn in comedy, which was only a low common shoe. The buskin seems to have been worn not only by actors, but by girls, to increase their height; travellers and hunters also made use of it to defend themselves from the mire. In classic authors we frequently find the buskin used to signify tragedy itself; and it was also understood as signifying a lofty strain or elevated style.
