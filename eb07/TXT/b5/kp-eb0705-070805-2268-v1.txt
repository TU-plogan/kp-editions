BURGAGE, or Burgage-tenure, is where the king or other person is lord of a borough in which the tenements are held by a rent certain. A borough is distinguished from other towns by the right of sending members to parliament; and where the right of election is by burgagetenure, that alone is a proof of the antiquity of the borough. Tenure in burgage, therefore, or burgage-tenure, is where houses, or lands which were formerly the site of houses, in an ancient borough, are held of some lord in common soccage, by a certain established rent. These tenures seem to have withstood the shock of the Norman encroachments, principally on account of their insignificance, as a hundred of them put together would scarcely have amounted to a knight’s fee. Besides, the owners of them, being chiefly artificers, and persons engaged in trade, could not with propriety be put on a military establishment like that founded on the tenure in chivahy, and hence the free soccage in which these tenements aie held seems to be a remnant of Saxon liberty, which may account for the variety of customs affecting many oft e tenements held in ancient burgage.

Burgage-holding, in Scotland, is the tenure by which the property in real burghs is held under the king, and is originally constituted by a charter from the crown in favour of the burgh, the effect of which is, that every proprietor within the burgh holds his property directly of the king as superior, for the reddendo, now merely nominal, of watching and warding, or “service of burgh used and wont.” The title of a disponee to a burgage property proceeds on a resignation made by delivery of staff and baton in the hands of the magistrates, in virtue of a procuratory granted by the vassal last infeft, and followed by an infeftment given by the magistrate in favour of the disponee, without the intervention of any precept or charter by progress. The title of an heir in burgage subjects is sometimes completed by a precept of clare constat and infeftment, but more frequently by a single act called a cognition and seisin. The proper vassal in burgage-holding being the whole community, which, in a legal sense, never dies, the ordinary casualties are not exigible; and the nature of the tenure also properly excludes such infeudations, although a base infeftment in an annualrent out of burgage property, given by a bailie of the burgh as bailie in that part, and the town-clerk, as a common notary, has been held as effectual. No widow’s tierce is duc from burgage subjects.
