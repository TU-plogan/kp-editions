BRUGES, a city, the capital of the province of East Flanders, and of the circle, containing seven cantons and seventy-six communes, to which it gives the same name, in the Netherlands. At one period it was the greatest commercial city in Europe; and though, from political events, its importance has been reduced, the remains of its ancient wealth are visible in the houses and public buildings. It stands on the canal which passes from Ghent to the sea at Ostend, and which is navigable for large flat-bottomed barks. It is still a manufacturing city of considerable industry, producing a variety of goods in linen, woollen, and silk, and furnishing many articles, chiefly for home consumption. The land around it is brought to the highest possible state of cultivation, and furnishes ample stores of necessaries to the dense population. The churches, especially that of Notre Dame, are objects of curiosity to all visitors, as well as the Gothic town-house and the hall of justice. The inhabitants arc about 35,000. Long. 3. 7. 47. E. Lat. 51. 12. 40. N.
