BRIG, or Brigantine, a merchant-ship with two masts. This term is not universally confined to vessels of a particular construction, or which are masted and rigged in a manner different from others, but is variously applied, by the mariners of different European nations, to a peculiar sort of vessel in their own marine. Amongst British seamen this description of vessel is distinguished by having her main-sails set nearly in the plane of her keel, whereas the main-sails of larger ships are hung athwart, or at right angles with the shipâ€™s length, and fastened to a yard which hangs parallel to the deck. In a brig, the foremost edge of the mainsail is fastened in different places to hoops which encircle the main-mast, and slide up and down it as the sail is hoisted or lowered; and it is extended by a gaff above and a boom below.
