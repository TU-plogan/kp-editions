BRAMPTON, a market-town of Eskdale Ward, in the county of Cumberland, 311 miles from London. It is an old town, of some note in former ages, and is still the head of the barony of Gillsland. It stands on the river Irthing, one mile from the Pictsâ€™ wall. It has a large market on Tuesday, and a smaller one on Saturday, and several fairs to which the Scotch drovers repair with their cattle. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 16S2, in 1811 to 2043, and in 1821 to 2448.
