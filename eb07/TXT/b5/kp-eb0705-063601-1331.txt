BUDA, or Ofen, the capital of the Austrian kingdom of Hungary, jointly with the city of Pesth, with which it is in immediate communication by means of a bridge of boats leading to Margaretâ€™s Island. It is situated on the right bank of the Danube, is the residence of the palatines, and the seat of the boards of the several departments of government and of ecclesiastical affairs. The public buildings worthy of notice are the castle, in which the crown of Hungary is kept, the town-house, the orphan-house, and some of the churches. The inhabitants are about 28,500.
