BUSHIRE, Abuschehr, a town of Persia, in the province of Fars, situated in the Persian Gulf. The surrounding country is a parched and barren desert, consisting of brown sand or grey elay and roek, unenlivened by any kind of vegetation. The town, which is of a triangular form, occupies the southern extremity of a peninsula eleven miles long and four broad, and is eneirclcd on all sides except the south by water; but in high tides and storms it has sometimes been completely insulated. This, however, is not likely to happen again, as the water is fast receding from the town. It is fortified on the land side by a mud wall mounting twelve pieces of cannon. The streets are very narrow, and, like all the towns and villages in this country, it is but a mean place, being in fact little better than a collection of clay houses, surrounded by walls and towers of the same material. At a distance they can scarcely be discerned from the surface of the ground; they resemble any thing rather than the habitations of man; and they are enveloped in dirt and every species of discomfort. The heat here is intolerable, ranging in summer from 87° to 90°, and sometimes to 100°, 105°, and 106°; so that few even of the natives can endure it. To add to this evil, there is scarcely a drop of sweet water to be had within the walls. There are w ells in the sandy peninsula on whieh the town is situated, which are dug to the depth of thirty fathoms, and from which sweet water is brought from a great distance. The EastIndia Company have a factory at this place, but the apartments are small, comfortless, and ill aired. A better house was at one time built, but the jealousy of the Persian government being awakened, an order was sent to raze it to the ground. A considerable exportation takes place of Persian commodities, such as carpets, wine ∙of Shiraz, rose-water, drugs, &c.; and the imports are Indian goods of different kinds, and English manufactures. Not more than eight ships under English colours frequent the port, and about six under those of Muscat, making an average of about 4500 tons of shipping. The outer roads, where ships exceeding 300 tons burden can alone anchor, are upwards of six miles from the town. The anchorage is tolerably good; but during the fury of the north-west winds ships are frequently obliged to cut their cables and bear up for Karak. The inner roads afford better shelter, but are also at some distance from the shore. The population is said by Morier to amount to 10,000; others state it at 5000. It is ten miles west-south-west of Shiraz. Long. 50. 43. E. Lat. 28. 59. N.
