BOTTLE, a small vessel for containing liquors, and made of leather, of glass, or of stone. The word is formed from butellus or botellus, a barbarous Latin word for a small wine vessel; and a diminutive of bota, which denoted a but or cask of that liquor. The ancient Jewish bottles were made of the skins of goats or other wild beasts, with the hair on the inside, well sewed and pitched together; and an aperture in one of the paws served for the mouth of the vessel. Bottles are now chiefly made of thick coarse glass; but bottles of boiled leather are likewise made and sold by the case-makers. Fine glass-bottles, covered with straw or wicker, are called βαshs or bettees. The quality of the glass has sometimes been found to affect the liquor in the bottle.
