BURKITT, William, a celebrated commentator on the New Testament, was born at Hitcham in Northamptonshire 25th July 1650, and educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. He entered young upon the ministry, having been ordained by Bishop Reynolds; and the first employment which he had was at Milden in Suffolk, where he continued twenty-one years a constant preacher, first as curate, and afterwards as rector of that church. In the year 1692 he had a call to the vicarage of Dedham in Essex, where he continued to the time of his death, which happened in the latter end of October 1703. He was a very pious and charitable man; made great collections for the French Protestants in 1687 and the years immediately following; and by his great care, pains, and charges, procured a worthy minister to go and settle in Carolina. Among other charities, by his last will and testament he bequeathed the house in which he lived, with the lands thereunto belonging, as a habitation for the lecturer who should be chosen from time to time to read the lecture at Dedham. Besides his commentary on the New Testament, written in the same plain, practical, and affectionate manner in which he preached, he wrote a volume entitled The Poor Alans Help and the Rich Man’s Guide.
