BRIDEGROOM, a newly-married man, the spouse of the bride. In nothing have the usages of different nations varied more than in regard to marriage, and the ceremonies by which it is celebrated or solemnized. Amongst [7:5:263]the Romans the bridegroom was decked to receive his bride; his hair was combed and cut in a particular form; he had a coronet or chaplet on his head, and was dressed in a white garment.
