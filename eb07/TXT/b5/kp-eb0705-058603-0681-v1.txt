BRODERA, or Barodah, a large and wealthy town of Hindustan, in the province ofGujerat, district of Cham-paneer, the capital of a Mahratta chief known by t∏ e family name of the Guĩcowar, who is an ally of the British, and divides with them the largest and finest portion of Gujerat, his particular share being a track of abou twelve thousand square miles in extent, and lying c ∏ ιc ¶ in the northern districts. The town is intersected by t ft θ spacious streets, which divide it into four equal parts, an cross at the market-place. The ruins of some handsom Mogul buildings are still to be seen; but th°≡θ ιal ^θ by the Mahrattas are mean and contemptible, f eal city is a stone bridge over the river Viswamιtra, only one in Gujerat, where the streams are gθ ner crossed in ferry boats or on light floating platfθ 1 ∏ ιs ∙ the environs are several magnificent wells, wit 1 s [7:5:587] down to the bottom.. In 1780 the fortifications of this place consisted of slight walls, with towers at irregular distances, and several double gates. It is still wealthy and populous, and during the war with Scindia and Holkar in 1803 the native bankers advanced to the British armies a crore and a half of rupees, equal to about L.1,600,000 sterling. Provisions of all descriptions are cheap and abundant, and the population amounted in 1818 to 100,000. The founder of the present family of the Guicowar invaded the province of Gujerat in 1726, and in 1730 was confirmed in his conquest by Sahoo Rajah, the grandson of Sevajee, and the reigning sovereign of the Malιrattas. He was succeeded by his son Damajee, who in 1761 was present at the battle of Paniput, and was afterwards taken prisoner by the Peshwa Bajerow, to whom he was obliged to cede half of his territories, and to acknowledge his dependence for the other half. His successor was Futteh Singh, who, dying in 1789, was succeeded by his brother Manajee, who died in 1792, when another brother, named Govind Row, ascended the throne. He died in 1800, and was succeeded by his son Annund Row Guicowar, who in his turn was succeeded in 1814 by Futteh Singh Guicowar. The revenues of this petty sovereign were in great confusion when the British interfered and undertook the management of his affairs. Long. 73. 24. E. Lat. 22. 13. N.
