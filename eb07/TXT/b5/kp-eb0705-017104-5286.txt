BRADFORD, or Bradfortii, a market-town in the wapentake of Morley, of the west-riding of Yorkshire, 197 miles from London, and situated on a branch of the river Aire. It is built partly on the side of a steep hill, with some of the streets looking over the houses in the others. It has extensive manufactures of worsted stuffs, and, during the war, had several founderies for cannon, and other heavy iron articles. The market is held on Thursday. The parish church is a remarkably fine Gothic edifice, with a melodious peal of bells. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 6393, in 1811 to 7761, and in 1821 to 13,064. The whole parish of Bradford, comprehending twelve townships or chapelries, contained, in 1801, 28,985 inhabitants, who in 1821 had increased to 52,954.

Bradford, a market-town in the hundred of the same name, of the county of Wilts, 104 miles from London. It is situated on the banks of the river Avon, near to the Kennet and Avon Canal, having, by those two channels, communication with London and with Bristol. It is a great manufacturing place for broad cloths and cassimeres. The streets are narrow, crooked, and ill built; but the situation is sheltered, and it is very healthy. There are good markets on Monday and Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 8540, in 1811 to 9230, and in 1821 to 10,231.

Bradford, John, a divine, and martyr to the Reformation, was born in the early part of the reign of Henry V III. at Manchester, in Lancashire. Being a good pen- *man and accountant, he became secretary to Sir John Harrington, who was several times employed by King Henry, and his successor Edward VI., as paymaster to the troops abroad. Bradford at this time was a gay man, and to support his extravagance made free with the king’s money; but being at last unable to endure the reflection of his guilt, he determined to make restitution, and actually repaid the money. Quitting his employment of secretary about the year 1547, he took chambers in the Inner Temple, and for some time studied the law; but finding in himself an inclination to preach the gospel, he removed the following year to Catherine-hall, Cambridge, where he applied with uncommon assiduity to the study of divinity, and in a much shorter time than usual was admitted to the degree of master of arts, and soon after made fellow of Pembroke-hall. Bishop Ridley, who in 1550 was translated to the see of London, being charmed with Bradford’s application and zeal, now sent for him to the metropolis, ordained and appointed him his chaplain. In 1553 he was also made chaplain to Edward VI.; during which time he became one of the most popular preachers in the kingdom. Such a reformer was too dangerous to be tolerated in the succeeding reign. Accordingly, Mary had hardly got possession of the crown when Bradford’s persecutions began. He was first confined in the Tower for sedition, where he continued a year and a half. During this time he wrote several epistles, which were dispersed in various parts of the kingdom. He was afterwards removed to other prisons, and at last brought to trial before that court of inquisition in which Gardiner sat as chief inquisitor, where he defended his principles to the last, in contempt of their utmost power. They condemned him to the flames, and he was accordingly burnt alive in Smithfield, on the 1st of July 1555. His works are, 1. Seventy-two Letters, written to various people, whilst the author was in prison, and printed in Bishop Coverdale’s collection; 2. Ten Letters, printed in Fox’s Acts and Monuments; 3. Complaint of Verity, 1559, 8vo; 4. Three Examinations before the Commissioners, and his Private Talk with the Priests, with the Original of his Life, 1561, 8vo; 5. Two Notable Sermons 1574, 8vo, 1631; 6. Godly Meditations and Prayers, 1614, 24to; 7. Treatise of Repentance, 1622; with several translations and other pieces.
