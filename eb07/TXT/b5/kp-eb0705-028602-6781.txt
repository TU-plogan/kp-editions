BRIDGENORTH, a borough and market-town of the hundred of Stoddendon, in the county of Salop, 140 miles from London, on the river Severn. It is an ancient place, in the vicinity of which are many interesting remains of antiquity. There is a considerable trade carried on in iron, leather, pipes, malt, and building boats for navigating the Severn. The town returns two members to parliament, who are chosen by the corporation and the freemen, in number about seven hundred, over whom the family of Whitmore have long held a predominant influence. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 4408, in 1811 to 4179, and in 1821 to 4345.
