BREENBERG, Bartholomew, a painter, was born in 1620. He is best known by the name of Bartolomeo, an appellation bestowed upon him, for the sake of distinction, by the society of Flemish painters at Rome called Bentvogelsâˆ™ He was born at Utrecht, but in the early part of his life went to Rome. His studies in the art of painting were attended with success, and his pictures were held in much estimation. He particularly excelled in landscapes, which he enriched with historical subjects. The figures and animals which he introduced were very spirited, and drawn in a masterly manner; especially when they were not larger than the size in which he usually painted them. He died in 1660, at the age of forty. He also etched from his own designs a set of twenty-four Views and Landscapes, ornamented with Ruins.
