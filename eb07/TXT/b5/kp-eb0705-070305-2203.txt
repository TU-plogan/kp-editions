BUMM, a city of Persia, in the province of Kirman, of which it was the frontier town until the Afghans were expelled the country. It is situated in a plain in the vicinity of high mountains, usually if not always covered with snow. About twenty years prior to 1810 this city had been the scene of repeated contests; the Afghans, assisted by the neighbouring Beloches, frequently attempting the reduction of it, in retaliation for the inroads made into their country by the Persian troops. The fortifications are in consequence so greatly strengthened that they are now accounted the strongest in Persia. They have an elevated site, and consist of a very high and thick mud wall, a deep, broad, and dry ditch, with six large bastions on each face, exclusive of those at the corners, which are higher by many yards than the others. The whole is built of mud, mixed with straw and fibrous substances; and it has a gate between the two centre bastions on the southern face. On the most elevated -part of the eminence on which the town is situated stands the citadel, well fortified with a lofty wall, and towers at each corner, and containing the governorâ€™s palace, and buildings belonging to it. Bumm is a very ancient, and was formerly a magnificent city, equal indeed to any in Persia; and the widely scattered ruins around the fort attest its former splendour and its immense extent. The town was greatly embellished by the Afghans, who invaded the country and made themselves masters of it in 1719. The fountains were magnificent; and some of them threw up water to an amazing height. The gardens were also very extensive; and Lieutenant Pottinger, when he visited this place, saw the remains of a garden, equal to several acres of ground, still retaining traces of having been walled in, with elegant summer-houses. The place is famed for its pomegranates, which are superior in flavour and juiciness to those of Sheeraz or Bagdad, where the best in the world are supposed to be produced. The bazar is large, and supplies are reasonable. Since 1719 it has undergone various revolutions; and it was here that Lootf Alleekhan, the last of the Zund family who disputed the succession to the throne, was made prisoner, and put to death, about the year 1794. The spot where he was seized, when in the act of mounting his horse to escape, is still marked by a pyramid made of the skulls of his adherents, by order of his cruel competitor Agha Mahommed Khan Kajjar, the first of his family who reigned in Persia.
