BRIXHAM, a town of the hundred of Haytor, in the county of Devon, a hundred and ninety-nine miles from London, on the western side of Torbay. It is in a warm, sheltered situation, and during the war formed the place for watering the kingâ€™s ships on that station. It is celebrated as the spot where King William landed in 1688. It has now a considerable fishery, and has become a place of resort for sea-bathing. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3671, in 1811 to 4341, and in 1821 to 4503.
