BROOM denotes a well-known household besom or implement wherewith to sweep away dirt, dust, and the like. We say a birch-broom, a hair-broom, a rush-broom, a heathbroom. The primitive kind of brooms, from which the denomination is given to all the rest, was made of the genista or wild broom growing on commons.

Bnooiĩflower gives the denomination to an order of knights instituted by St Louis of France on occasion of his marriage. The motto was Exaltat humiles, and the collar of the order was made up of broom flowers and husks, enamelled and intermixed with βeurs de lis of gold, set in open lozenges, enamelled white, chained together; and at it hung a cross florencc of gold. This answers towhat the French called Ordre de la Géneste, from the name of a species of broom so called, different from the common broom, as being lower, the stalk smaller, and leaf narrow: the flower is yellow, and bears a long husk. Some also speak of another order of the Geneste or Broom established by Charles Martel, or rather Charles VI.
