BRUNN, a circle in the Austrian province of Moravia, extending over 1815 square miles, or 1,116,600 acres. It comprehends thirteen cities, with their respective suburbs, fifty-six market-towns, 649 villages, and 52,143 houses. The inhabitants amounted in the year 1823 to 354,175. The northern part of the circle is a portion of the Moravian mountain range, which yields abundant mineral riches. Between the mountains the land is highly productive in corn and cattle. It is the chief manufacturing district of the imperial dominions, and produces good woollen, linen, and cotton goods of all descriptions. The city of Brunn is the capital of the circle of that name, as well as of the province of Moravia. It stands at the junction of the river Zwittawa with the Schwartza. It is fortified, but in too weak and ancient a way to be now defensible, and the citadel, from neglect, is falling to decay. The situation is very picturesque, and the buildings are magnificent, but the streets rather narrow. It is on the whole the most pleasing city in the Austrian dominions. Its trade is very extensive. Its manufactures are chiefly fine woollen and linen goods; it is also the principal mart for the exchange of the commodities of the south and north of Europe, and is benefited by the excellent roads through it to Vienna and Italy on the one hand, and to Poland, Prussia, and Saxony on the other. The increase of inhabitants has been rapid. In the year 1814 they were 25,760, and in the year 1827 they amounted to 33,350. Long·. 16. 30 30. E. Lat. 49. 11. 32. N. °
