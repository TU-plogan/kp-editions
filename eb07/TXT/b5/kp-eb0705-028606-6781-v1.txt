BRIEF, in Law, an abridgment of the client’s case, made out for the instruction of counsel on a trial at law; wherein the case of the litigant is to be briefly but fully stated.

Brief, or Brieve, in Scots Law, a writ issued from the Chancery, directed to any judge-ordinary, commanding and authorizing that judge to call a jury to inquire into the facts mentioned in the brief, and upon their verdict to pronounce sentence.

Apostolical Briefs, letters which the pope dispatches to princes or other magistrates, relating to any public affair. These briefs are distinguished from bulls, in regard the latter are more ample, and always written on parchment, and sealed with lead or green wax; whereas briefs are very concise, written on paper, sealed with red wax, and with the seal of a fisherman, or St Peter in a boat.
