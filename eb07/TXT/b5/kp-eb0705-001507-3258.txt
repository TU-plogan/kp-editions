BORRELISTS, in Ecclesiastical History, a Christian sect in Holland, so denominated from their founder Borrel, a person of much learning in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin tongues. They rejected the use of the sacraments, public prayer, and other external acts of worship; affirming that all the Christian churches of the world have degenerated from the pure apostolical doctrines, because they have suffered the word of God, which is infallible, to be expounded, or rather corrupted, by doctors, who are not infallible.
