BREST, an arrondissement in the department of Finisterre, in France, extending over 127 square miles, comprehending twelve cantons and eighty-five communes, with 136,149 inhabitants. It takes its denomination from the city of Brest, the most perfect and strongest naval station in the kingdom. The harbour consists of the road of Brest, with two deep indentations forming bays, into one of which the river Landeneau, and into the other the river Aulne, pour their streams. There is but one narrow entrance[7:5:228], defended by strong forts on both sides, and the interior is also protected by formidable batteries. The water is sufficiently deep for the largest ships, and there is space enough for 500 sail to ride securely. The docks, store-houses, and other appendages to the arsenal, are well adapted for the purpose intended. Brest was but a fishing village till 1631, since which it has risen to be an extensive and populous city, and contains at present 2600 houses, with 25,865 inhabitants. It is furnished with a medical school for the navy, an academy for the study of navigation, an observatory, a botanical garden, and a good library. Long. 4. 13. 20. W. Lat. 48. 22. 42. N.
