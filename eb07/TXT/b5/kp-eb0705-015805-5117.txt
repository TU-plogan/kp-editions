BOXING, the exercise of fighting with the fists, either naked or with a stone or leaden ball grasped in them. In this sense boxing coincides with the pugillatus of the Romans. When the champions had o ’ pα∕gα∕, or balls, whether of lead or stone, it was properly denominated 6φαiξομaχιa. The ancient boxing differed from the pugna ccestuum, in which the combatants bad leathern thongs on their hands, and balls to offend their antagonists withal; though this distinction is frequently overlooked, and fighting with the ccestus ranked as part of the business of pugiles. Three species of boxing may be distinguished, namely, where both the head and hands were naked; where the hands were armed and the head naked; and where the head was covered with a kind of cap, called amphotides, and the hands also furnished with the ccestus.

Boxing is an ancient exercise, having been in use in the heroic ages. Those who prepared themselves for it used all the means that could be contrived to render themselves fat and fleshy, that they might be the better able to endure blows. Hence corpulent men or women were usually called pugiles, according to Terence. Siqua est habilior paulo, pugilem esse aiunt. Boxing, among sailors, is used to denote the rehearsing the several points of the compass in their proper order.

Boxing is also used for the tapping of a tree, to make it yield its juice. The boxing of maple·is,performed by making a hole with an axe or chisel in the side of the tree, about a foot from the ground, that the i liquorof which sugar is made may flow out through it.
