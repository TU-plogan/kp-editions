BRUMOY, Peter, a learned Jesuit, born at Rouen in 1668, distinguished himself in his youth by his talents for the belles lettres; and during his whole life was beloved for his probity, his virtue, and the goodness of his heart. He wrote many works, the most considerable of which is his Theatre of the Greeks. He died at Paris in 1742.
