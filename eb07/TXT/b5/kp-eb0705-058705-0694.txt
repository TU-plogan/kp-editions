BROME, Alexander, a poet, and attorney in the lord mayor’s court in the reign of Charles IL, was the author of the greater part of those songs and epigrams which were published in favour of the royalists, and against the Rump, as well in Oliver Cromwell’s time as during the rebellion. These, together with his epistles and epigrams translated from different authors, were all printed in one volume octavo after the restoration. He also published a version of Horace, by himself and others, which is very far from being a bad one. He left behind him a comedy entitled The Cunning Lovers ; and the world is indebted to him for two volumes of Richard Brome’s plays, in octavo, many of which, but for his care in preserving and publishing them, would in all probability have been entirely lost. He died in 1666.

Brome, Richard, a dramatic writer who lived in the reign of King Charles I. and was contemporary with Dekker, Ford, Shirley, and others. His extraction was mean, he having been originally no better than a menial servant to the celebrated Ben Jonson. He wrote himself, however, into high reputation, as is testified, not only by various commendatory verses written by his contemporaries and prefixed to many of his plays, but also by some lines which his quondam master addressed to him on account of his comedy called The Northern Lass. Brome, in imitation of his master, laid it down as his first great point to apply closely to the study of men and manners. His genius was entirely turned to comedy, and therefore his proper province was observation more than reading. His plots are all his own, and are far from being ill conducted; and his characters, which for the most part are strongly marked, were the offspring of his own judgment and experience, and his close attention to the foibles of the human heart. The comedies which the author left behind him are fifteen in number, ten of which are collected together in two volumes octavo.
