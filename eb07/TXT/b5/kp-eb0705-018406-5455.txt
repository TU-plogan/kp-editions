BRANDENBURG, one of the larger provinces into which the kingdom of Prussia is divided, and the division from which that powerful monarchy originally sprung. It was at first denominated a marquisate; then the electoral dignity was added to the reigning family; and afterwards, by the acquisition of Prussia, Brandenburg became a portion of the kingdom so called. It is bounded on the north by Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and West Prussia; on the east by Posen and Silesia; on the south by the kingdom of Saxony and the Saxon duchies; and on the west by Anhalt-Dessau, the province of Saxony, and Hanover. The extent is about 15,360 square miles, or near 10,000,000 English acres. It is divided into two circles, Potsdam and Frankfort, which are of nearly equal extent. The civil inhabitants, by the census of 1817, were 1,266,765; but, like those of all the other parts of Prussia, they have rapidly increased, and at the end of 1826 they were 1,479,482. The far greater part of the people are of the Lutheran church, but mixed with Catholics, Calvinists, and other sects, all of which are entitled to equal rights. The whole of the Catholics and smaller sects, including the Jews, do not exceed 30,000 persons. The entire province is nearly a sandy plain, but interspersed with a few fertile spots; and a considerable portion of it is covered with woods. It is generally well watered by streams, most of which empty themselves into the Elbe or the Oder. The chief agricultural product is rye, with some w heat, barley, oats, and buck-wheat. Fruit of all kinds is abundant, as well as culinary vegetables; and considerable quantities of hemp, flax, and hops are raised. The climate is cold and raw in w inter, and excessively hot in summer. The manufactures are chiefly confined to Berlin and the other cities; but the rural inhabitants are employed in spinning or weaving, and produce much linen cloth.

Brandenburg, a city of Prussia, chief of the circle of the West Havell, in the province of its own name. It is an old place, on the banks of the Havell, by which it is divided into the new and the old tow n. It contains an ancient cathedral, six other churches, some charitable institutions, 1320 houses, and (in 1817) 12,004 inhabitants, occupied in making various goods of cotton, woollen, linen, and leather, and in breweries and distilleries.
