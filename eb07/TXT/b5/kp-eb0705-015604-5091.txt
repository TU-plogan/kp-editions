BOWLING, the art of playing at bowls. This game is practised either in open places, as bares and bowling-greens, or in close bowling-alleys.

The skill of bowling depends much on a knowledge of the ground, and the right choice of a suitable bowl; as for close alleys the flat bowl, while for green swards, plain and level, the bowl as round as a ball is preferred.

The terms used in bowling are, to bowl wide, which is when the bias does not hold, or is not strong enough; narrow, when it is too strong or holds too much; finely bowled, is when the ground is well chosen, and the bowl passes near the block, even though it goes much beyond it; bowling through, or a yard over, is done in order to move the block; an over-bold, is that which goes beyond it; a bowl laid at hand, is that put down within the gamester’s reach to be in the way of the next bowler, and hinder his having the advantage of the best ground; bowling at length, is neither bowling through nor short; a dead length, is a just or exact one; throwing or fiinging, is discharging a bowl with a strength purposely too great for a length, in Order to carry off either the block or some near bowl; bowl-room, or missing wood, is when a bowl has free passage without striking on any other; get ofi', is when a bowl, being narrow, is wanted to be wider; bowl best at block, is that nearest the block; and drawing a cast or bowl, is to win it by bowling nearer without stirring either the bowl or block. A bowl is said to rub when it meets with some obstacle in the ground which retards its motion and weakens its force; and it is gone when far beyond the block. Block signifies a littlebowl laid for a mark, and is also called ∙<njack. Mark is a proper bowling distance, not under so many yards, and being at least a yard and a half from the edge of the green; ground, is a bag or handkerchief laid down to mark where a bowl is to go; lead is the advantage of throwing the block and bowling first; cast, is one best bowl at an end; and end, is a hit, or when all the bowls are out. The game, or up, is five casts or best bowls.

JBowlisg- Green, in Gardening, a kind of parterre in a grove, laid with fine turf, requiring to be frequently mowed, and laid out in compartments of divers figures, with dwarf-trees and other decorations. Bowling-greens are of English origin, but have been adopted by the French and Italians, who have them only for ornament, being unacquainted with or not fancying the exercise, on account of which they were first made in England.
