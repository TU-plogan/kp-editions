BURGLENGENFELD, a magistracy in the circle of Regen, in the kingdom of Bavaria, which comprehends 323 square miles, and contains 24,500 inhabitants. The city from which it takes the name stands in a most romantic situation, and in the neighbourhood of others of similar beauty, on the river Nab. It contains about 1500 inhabitants, who are chiefly occupied in the manufacture of fire-arms, and in the tanning of leather.
