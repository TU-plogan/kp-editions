BRESCIA, one of the delegations into which the Austrian kingdom of Venetian Lombardy is divided. It is bounded on the north-west by Bergamo, on the north-east by the Tyrol, on the east by the Lake of Guarda, on the south-east by Mantua, on the south by Cremona, and on the south-west by Lodi. Its extent is 1115 square miles, or 713,600 acres. It is divided into twelve districts, and these into 238 communes or parishes; and it comprehends one city, thirty-two market-towns, and 202 villages, containing 50,840 houses. The inhabitants, in 1816, amounted to 311,596, of whom 157,572 were males, and 154,024, females; but since that period they have rapidly increased; The northern part, or one third of the delegation, consists of a chain of mountains, which belong to the Rhaetian Alps; the remainder is part of the great plain of Lombardy. The latter division is highly productive in corn and in mulberry trees, as well as in flax, hemp, and oil. The wine is considered as good, but not sufficient for the domestic consumption. The mountainous parts afford iron, lead, copper, marble, granite, and charcoal. The manufactures consist principally of silk, but are considerable in woollen, linen, and cotton goods, and in iron, steel, glass, and paper wares. The capital, of the same name, is situated on the river Garza, at the foot of a hill, on the summit of which is a picturesque ancient castle. It contains, besides the cathedral, twelve parish and several conventual churches, six hospitals, six orphan-houses, and some other public buildings. The inhabitants amounted in 1817 to 34,168, but are stated to have increased to upwards of 40,000 in 1824. It is the chief seat of those fabrics the raw materials of which are so amply furnished by the province. Long. 10. 8. 4. E. Lat. 45. 32. 30. N.
