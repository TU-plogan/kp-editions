BRODY, a large city of the circle of Lemberg, in the Austrian province of Galicia. It stands on the river Sucha-Wielkabacha, close to the Russian frontier, by which position it is enabled to carry on a most extensive contraband trade with that extensive empire. It is an ill-built and filthy place, containing about 18,000 inhabitants, one third of whom are Jews. There are four churches for the Greeks, one for the Catholics, and some synagogues for the Jews.
