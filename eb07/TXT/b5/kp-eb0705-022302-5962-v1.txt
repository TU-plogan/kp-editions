BREAST, in Anatomy, denotes the fore-parts of the thorax. Smiting the breast is one of the expressions of penitence. In the Romish ehureh the priest beats his breast in rehearsing the general confession at the beginning of the mass.

Breast- Hooks, in Ship-Building, are thick pieces of timber ineurvated into the form of knees, and used to strengthen the fore-part of the ship, where they are plaeed at different heights directly aeross the stem, so as to unite it with the bows on each side. The breast-hooks are [7:5:224] strongly connected to the stem and hawse-pieces by treenails, and by bolts driven from without through the planks and hawse-pieces, and the whole thickness of the breasthooks, upon the inside of which these bolts are forelocked or clinched upon rings. They are usually about one third thicker than, and twice as long as, the knees of the decks they support.

EREAST-Plate, in Antiquity, a piece of armour worn to defend the breast, and believed to have been originally formed of hides or hemp, twisted into small cords, but latterly made of brass, iron, or other metals, which are sometimes hardened so as to be proof against the greatest force.

EREΛST-Plate, in Jewish Antiquity, one part of the vestments anciently worn by the high-priests. It was a folded piece of the same rich embroidered stuff of which the ephod was made; and it was set with twelve precious stones, on each of which was engraven the name of one of the tribes. They were set in four rows, three in every row, and were divided from one another by little golden squares or partitions, in which they were set. The names of these stones, and those of the tribes engraven on them, as also of their disposition on the breast-plate, were as follow:
[table]

This breast-plate was fastened at the four corners, those above to each shoulder by a golden hook or ring at the end of a wreathed chain; and those below to the girdle of the ephod, by two strings or ribbons, which had likewise two rings and hooks. This ornament was never to be severed from the priestly garment; and it was called the Memorial, to remind the high-priest how dear those tribes ought to be to him, whose names he wore on his breast. It is also called the Breast-plate of Judgment, because it had the divine oracle of Urim and Thummim annexed to it.
