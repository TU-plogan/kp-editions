BUCKINGHAM, the chief town of the county of that name, fifty-seven miles from London, on the river Ouse, over which there are three stone bridges. The streets are crooked and narrow, and the houses not remarkable for beauty. The assizes are held here alternately with Aylesbury, and also the quarter sessions. There is a good market on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2605, in 1811 to 3001, and in 1821 to 3465.
