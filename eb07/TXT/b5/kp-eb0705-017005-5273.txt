BRABEUTES, or Brabcuta, in Antiquity, an officer among the Greeks, who presided at the public games, and decided such disputes as occurred among the antagonists in the Ä¡ymnastical exercises. The number of brabcutae was not fixed; sometimes there was only one, but more commonly they amounted to nine or ten.
