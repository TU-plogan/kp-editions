BRETHREN and Sisters of the Free Spirit, in Ecclesiastical History, an appellation assumed by a sect which sprung up towards the close of the thirteenth century, and gained many adherents in Italy, France, and Germany. They took their denomination from the words of St Paul, in his epistle to the Romans, chap, viii. ver. 2, 14, and maintained that the true children of God were invested with the privilege of a full and perfect freedom from the jurisdiction of the law. Some of their professed principles resembled those of the Pantheists, and they held that all things flowed by emanation from God; that rational souls were portions of the Deity; that the universe was God; that, by the power of contemplation, they were united to the Deity, and thereby acquired a glorious and sublime liberty, both from the sinful lusts and the common instincts of nature; and that the person who was thus absorbed in the abyss of the Deity, became a part of the Godhead, and was the son of God in the same sense and manner as Christ was, being freed from the obligation of all laws human and divine. Many edicts were published against this sect; but, notwithstanding the severities which they suffered, they continued till about the middle of the fifteenth century. They were called by several other names, such as Schwestriones, Picards, Adamites, and Turlupins.

Brethren and Clerks of the Common Life, a denomination assumed by a religious fraternity towards the latter end of the fifteenth century. They lived under the rule of St Augustin, and were eminently useful in promoting the cause of religion and learning. Their society was formed in the preceding century, by Gerard de Groot, a native of Deventer; but it did not flourish till about the period above mentioned, when it obtained the approbation of the council of Constance, and became very respectable in Holland, Lower Germany, and the adjacent provinces. It was divided into two classes; the lettered brethren or clerks, and the illiterate. They lived in separate habitations, but maintained the closest fraternal union. The former applied to the study of polite literature, and the education of youth; whilst the latter were employed in manual labour and the mechanic arts. They were frequently called Beghards and Lollards, byway of reproach.

White Brethren, Fratres Albati, were the followers of a leader about the beginning of the fifteenth century, who arrayed himself in a white garment; and as they also clothed themselves in white linen, they were distinguished by this title. Their leader was a priest from the Alps, who carried about a cross, like a standard, and whose apparent sanctity and devotion drew together a number of followers. This deluded enthusiast practised many acts of mortification and penance; endeavouring to persuade the European nations to renew the holy war, and pretending that he was favoured with divine visions. Boniface IX. ordered him to be apprehended and committed to the flames, upon which his followers dispersed.
