+====================================================================+


BOWYER, William, the most learned printer of his age, was born at Whitefriars, in London, on the 17th December 1699. His father, whose name was also William, had been eminent in the same profession; and his maternal grandfather, Icabod Dawks, was employed in printing the celebrated Polyglot Bible of Bishop Walton. At a proper age he was placed for grammatical education under the care of Mr Ambrose Bonwicke, a nonjuring clergyman of piety and learning, who then lived at Headly, near Leatherhead, in Surrey. Here Mr Bowyer m∑ιde great progress in literature, and a firm attachment commenced betwixt him and his master. On the 30th of January 1713 the whole property of the elder Mr Bowyer was destroyed by fire, on which occasion Mr Bonwicke generously undertook the education of his pupil for a year. In 1716 young Mr Bowyer was admitted a sizar at St John’s College, Cambridge, where Dr Robert Jenkin was at that time master. He continued at the college under the tuition of the reverend Dr John Newcombe till June 1722, during which period he probably took his degree of bachelor of arts; and he appears to have been desirous of obtaining a fellowship, though it is not certain that he ever stood a candidate for that honour. Soon after this he had an opportunity of repaying the kindness which Mr Bonwicke had shown him, by officiating some time after his death in the capacity of schoolmaster for the benefit of his family.

Mr Bowyer now entered into the printing business along with his father. One of the first books which received the benefit of his correction was the complete edition of Selden, in three volumes folio, by Dr David Wilkins. This edition was begun in 1722, and finished in

1726; and Mr Bowyer’s great attention to it appeared in his drawing up an epitome of Selden de Synedriis, as he read the proof sheets. In 1727 he drew up an excellent sketch of William Baxter’s Glossary of Roman Antiquities, called “A view of a book entitled Peliquice Baxtxrianae, in a letter to a friend.” By this first public proof of Mr Bowyer’s abilities, Dr Wotton and Mr Clarke were highly pleased; but as it was never published, and a very few copies printed, it is seldom found with the glossary. In

1727 Mr Bowyer lost his mother. In October 1728 he married Miss Ann Prudom, his mother’s niece, a very accomplished lady, by whom he had two sons, William and Thomas; the former of whom died in nonage, and the latter survived his father. In 1729 Mr Bowyer published a treatise, entitled “A Pattern for young Students in the University, set forth in the Life of Ambrose Bonwicke, some time scholar of St John’s College, Cambridge;” but although this treatise was generally ascribed to Mr Bowyer, it was in reality the production of Mr Ambrose Bonwicke the elder. About this time Mr Bowyer appears to have written a pamphlet against the Separatists, though neither the title nor the occasion of itare now remembered. The same year, through the friendship of the Right Honourable Arthur Onslow, he was appointed printer of the votes of the House of Commons; which office he held under three successive· Speakers for near fifty years. In 1731 Mr Bowyer published, and, it is believed, translated, Voltaire’s Life of Charles XII. This year also his wife died. He remained a widower till 1747, when he married a very benevolent and worthy woman, Mrs Elizabeth Bill, by whom he had no children. In 1733 he published a piece in two sheets 4to, entitled “The Beau and the Academic,” being a translation from a Latin poem recited that year at the Sheldonian theatre; and in 1736 he was admitted into the Society of Antiquaries, where he became an active and useful member. In 1737 Mr Bowyer lost his father. In 1742 he published a translation of Trapps Latin Lectures on Poetry, in which he was assisted by Mr Clarke, though the latter had a contemptible opinion of the performance.

In 1749 Mr Bowyer, along with Dr Burton, was virulently attacked by Dr King, in a piece entitled Elogmnι famoe inserviens Jacci Etonensis sive Gigantis, or the praises of Jack Eaton, commonly called Jack the Giant. This abuse was probably occasioned by Mr Bowyer’s having hinted in conversation some doubts concerning the doctor’s skill in Latin. He, however, drew up some strictures in his own defence, which he intended to insert at the end of a preface to Montesquieu’s Reflections; but by [7:5:157]Mr Clarke’s advice they were omitted. In 1750 a prefatory critical dissertation and some notes were annexed by our author to Kuster’s Treatise De usu Verborum mediorum; a new edition of which, with further improvements, appeared in 1773. He likewise wrote, about the same time, a Latin preface to Leede’s Veteres Poetae citatì. Being soon after employed to print an edition of Colonel Bladen’s translation of Caesar’s Commentaries, that work received considerable improvements from Mr Bowyer’s hands, with the addition of notes signed Typogr. In the subsequent editions of this work, though printed by another person during Mr Bowyer’s lifetime, the same signature was unjustly retained. In 1751 he wrote a long preface to Montesquieu’s Reflections on the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire; translated the dialogue between Sylla and Socrates; and made several corrections on the work from the Baron’s Spirit of Laws, improving it with notes of his own. A new edition, with many new notes, was printed in 1759. In 1751 he also published a translation of Rousseau’s paradoxical oration, which gained the prize at the academy of Dijon in 1750, and first announced that singular genius to the attention and admiration of Europe. On the publication of the third edition of Lord Orrery’s Remarks on the Life and Writings of Dr Swift, in 1752, Mr Bowyer wrote and printed, but never published, “Two Letters from Dr Bentley in the Shades below, to Lord Orrery in a Land of Thick Darkness.” The notes signed B, in the ninth quarto volume of Swift’s works, are extracted from these letters. In 1753 he endeavoured to allay the ferment occasioned by the Jews’ Bill; and with this view he published, in quarto, “Remarks on the Speech made in Common Council, on the Bill for permitting persons professing the Jewish religion to be naturalized, so far as prophecies are supposed to be affected by it.” This little tract was written with spirit, and well received by those who were superior to narrow prejudices. Its design was to show, that, whatever political reasons might be alleged against the bill, Christianity was in no danger of being prejudiced by the protection promised to the Jews. The same year some of Mr Bowyer’s notes were annexed to Bishop Claton’s translation of “A Journal from Grand Cairo to Mount Sinai and back again.” In 1754 Mr Bowyer, with a view of lessening his fatigue, entered into partnership with a relation; but some disagreement arising, the connection was dissolved in three years. On the death of Mr Richardson in 1761, Mr Bowyer succeeded him as printer to the Royal Society, through the favour of the Earl of Macclesfield; and, under the friendship of five successive presidents, he enjoyed that office till his death.

In 1763 Mr Bowyer published an excellent edition of the Greek Testament, in two vols. 12mo. It appeared under the following title: Novum Testamentum Groecum; ad fidenι Graecorum solum Codicum MSS. nunc primum impressum, adstipulante Joanne Jacobo Wetstenio, juxta Sectiones Jo. Alberti Rengelii divisum; et nova interpretatione surplus illustratum: Accessere in altero volumine, Emendationes Conjecturales virorum doctorum undecunque collectoe. This sold with great rapidity. The Conjectural Emendations were well received by the learned, and are thought to be a valuable work. The president and fellows of Havard College in Cambridge expressed their approbation of this edition in very high terms, in a letter to Mr Bowyer, written in the year 1767. “This work,” say they,

“though small in bulk, we esteem as a rich treasure of sacred learning, and of more value than many large volumes of the commentators.” A second edition of the Conjectures on the New Testament, with very considerable enlargements, was separately published in one volume vo in 1772. Bishop Warburton having censured a passage in the former edition, Mr Bowyer sent him a copy of this book, with a conciliatory letter. Dr λVarburton’s Divine Legation had received very considerable advantage from Mr Bowyer’s corrections, and this even in an edition which was necessarily given to another press. In 1761 he was employed to print his lordship’s Doctrine of Grace. A second edition being soon wanted, and Mr Bowyer not having been intrusted with the care of it, he prepared a series of letters to the bishop in his own defence; and of these, together with a few he had formerly received from that great writer, he afterwards printed twelve copies, of which ten were subsequently destroyed. However, there is the best authority for asserting, that notwithstanding any little altercations which happened, Dr λVarburton always retained a sincere regard for our typographer. In 1765, at the request of Thomas Hollis, Esq. Mr Bowyer wrote a short Latin preface to Dr Wallis’s Grammaticae Lingu<B Anglicanoe. He wrote also a large English preface for the same work, which, however, was not printed. In 1766 he entered into partnership with Mr Nichols, who had been trained by him to the profession, and had for several years assisted him in the management of his business. The same year Mr Bowyer wrote a Latin preface to Joannis Harduini, Jesuitoe, ad Censuram Scriptorum veterum Prolegomena. In 1767 he was appointed to print the journals of the House of Lords and the rolls of Parliament. This year he printed Mr Clarke’s excellent and learned work on The Connection of the Roman, Saxon, and English Coins, and wrote some notes upon it, which are interspersed throughout the volume with those of the author. Part of the Dissertation on the Roman sesterce was likewise Mr Bowyer’s production; and the index, which is an uncommonly good one, was drawn up by him entirely.

In January 1771 Mr Bowyer lost his second wife. In the Philosophical Transactions of this year was printed a very ingenious Inquiry into the Value of the ancient Greek and Roman Money, by Mr Matthew Raper. But his opinions not coinciding with those of Mr Bowyer, the latter printed a small pamphlet, entitled Remarks occasioned by a late Dissertation on the Greek and Roman Money. In 1773 three little tracts were published by him, under the title of Select Discourses, treating, 1. Of the correspondence of the Hebrew months with the Julian, from the Latin of Professor Michaelis; 2. Of the Sabbatical years, from the same; 3. Of the years of Jubilee, from an anonymous writer in Masson’s Histoire Critique de la République des Lettres. In 1774 he corrected a new edition of Schrevelius’s Greek Lexico; to which he added a number of words, which he himself had collected in the course of his studies. Considerable manuscript additions were also made by him to the lexicos of Hederic and Buxtorf, the Latin ones of Faber and Littleton, and the English Dictionary of Bailey; and he left behind him many other proofs of his critical skill in the learned languages. In 1774 was published The Origin of P∣ inting, in two Essays. The original idea of this valuable tract was Mr Bowyer’s, but it was completed by Mr Nichols.

Although our author, during the last ten years of his life, had been afflicted with the palsy and stone, he not only preserved a remarkable cheerfulness of temper, but was enabled to support the labour of almost incessant reading; and he regularly corrected the learned works, especially the Greek books, which came from his press. This he continued to do till within a few weeks of his death, which happened in November 1777, when he had nearly completed his seventy-eighth year. For more than half a century Mr Bowyer was unrivalled as a learned printer, and many of the most masterly productions of this kingdom issued from his press. To his literary and professional abilities he added an excellent moral charge-ter[7:5:158]; and he was particularly distinguished by his inflexible probity, and an uncommon alacrity in relieving the necessitous.
