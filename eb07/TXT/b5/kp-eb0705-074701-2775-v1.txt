BUSBY, Dr Richard, son of a gentleman in Westminster, was born at Lutton in Lincolnshire in 1606. He passed through the classes in Westminster school as king’s scholar, and completed his studies at Christ-church, Oxford. In 1640 he was appointed master of Westminster school; and by his skill and diligence in the discharge of this important and laborious office for the space of fifty-five years, bred up the greatest number of eminent men, in church and state, that ever at one time adorned any age or nation. He was severe in his school; though he applauded wit in his scholars, even when it reflected on himself. He died in 1695, aged eighty-nine, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where there is a fine monument erected for him, with a Latin inscription. He composed several books for the use of his school.
