BULLEYN, William, a learned physician and botanist, was born in the Islc of Ely in the early part of the reign of Henry VIII., and educated at Cambridge. Botany being his favourite study, he travelled through various parts of England, Scotland, and Germany, chiefly with an intention to improve his knowledge in that science. In the reign of Edward VI. and of Queen Mary, Mr Bulleyn appears, from his remarks on the natural productions of that country, to have resided at Norwich, or in the neighbourhood, and also to have spent some time at Blox-hall in Suffolk; but he afterwards removed to the north, and settled at Durham, where he practised physic with considerable reputation and success. His great patron at this time was Sir Thomas Hilton, knight, baron of Hilton, and governor of Tinmouth Castle in the reign of Philip and Mary. In 1560 he went to London, and soon after his arrival was accused by William Hilton of Bidick of having murdered his brother Sir Thomas, our author’s friend and patron. He was arraigned before the Duke of Norfolk, and honourably acquitted. This Hilton afterwards hired some villains to assassinate the doctor; but the attempt proving ineffectual, be had him arrested on an action for debt, and sent to prison, where he remained for a long time. During this confinement Dr Bullcyn composed several of those works which established his reputation as a medical writer. He died in January 1576, and was buried in St Giles’s, Cripplegate, in the same grave with his brother the divine, who had died thirteen years before, and in which John Fox the martyrologist was interred eleven years afterwards. Dr Bullcyn appears from his writings to have been well acquainted with the works of the ancient Greek, Roman, and Arabian physicians. He wrote, 1, The Government of Health, 1559, 8vo; 2, A regimen against the Pleurisy, 8vo, London 1562; 3, Bulleyn’s Bulwark of Defence against all Sickness, Soreness, and Wounds that doe daily assault Mankinde; London, printed by John Kingston, 1562, folio, including the Government of Health; 4, A Dialogue both pleasant and pietifull, wherein is a goodlie regimen against the fever pestilence, with a consolation and comfort against death; London, 1564, 8vo, 1569, 8vo. There is a wooden print of the author prefixed to the first edition of his Government of Health; also a small one, engraved by Stukeley in 1722.
