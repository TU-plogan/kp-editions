BRADWARDIN, Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, surnamed the Profound Doctor, was born at Hartfield in Sussex about the close of the thirteenth century. He was educated at Merton College, Oxford, where he took the degree of doctor of divinity, and acquired the reputation of a profound scholar, a skilful mathematician, and an able divine. Authors are not at one as to his first preferments. Pitt says he was professor of divinity at Oxford. They agree, however, in asserting, that from being chancellor of the diocese of London, he became a courtier and confessor to Edward III. whom he constantly attended during his war with France; assisting that victorious prince with his advice, animating the troops, and fervently praying for their success. After his return from the war he was made prebendary of Lincoln, and subsequently archbishop of Canterbury. He died at Lambeth in the year 1349, forty days after his consecration, and was buried in St Anselm’s Chapel, near the south wall. His works are, 1. De causa Dei, printed at London, 1618, published by J. FI. Savil; 2. De Geometria speculativa, Paris, 1495, 1512, 1530; 3. De Arithmetica practica, Paris, 1502, 1512; 4. De Proportionibus, Paris, 1495, Venice, 1505, folio; 5. De Quadratura Circuli, Paris, 1495, folio.
