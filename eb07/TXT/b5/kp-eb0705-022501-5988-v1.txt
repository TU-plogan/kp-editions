BRECON, or Breknock, a market and borough town, the capital of the county of the same name, in South Wales, 168 miles from London, is situated at the confluence of the rivers Hondey and Uske. Its ancient castle, an object of great curiosity to the antiquarian, is said to have been built in the reign of William Rufus. There are several traces of Roman encampments in the vicinity. Its present state is not flourishing, as the manufactures of cloth and of stockings which once existed have been removed to more favourable spots. It contains three churches, and is governed by a corporation, which, with the freemen, returns one member to parliament under the influence of Sir Charles Morgan. There are markets on each Wednesday and Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2576, in 1811 to 3196, in 1821 to 4193, and in 1831 to 5026.
