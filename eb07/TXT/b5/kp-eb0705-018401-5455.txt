BRAMHALL, Dr John, archbishop of Armagh, was born of an ancient family at Pontefract in Yorkshire about the year 1593. He was invited to Ireland by the lord deputy Wentforth, and soon afterwards obtained the archdeaconry of Meath, the best in that kingdom. In 1634 he was made bishop of Londonderry, a see which he improved very much; but the greatest service he rendered to the church of Ireland consisted in getting, with the deputyâ€™s assistance, several acts passed for abolishing fee-farms and recovering impropriations, by which, as well as by other means, he regained to the church in the space of four years L.30,000 orL.40,000 a year. In the convocation he prevailed upon the church of Ireland to unite in the same faith with the church of England, by adopting the thirty-nine articles of the latter; and would willingly have introduced the English canons, but could only prevail on their accepting such as were deemed proper. Articles of treason were exhibited against him in the Irish parliament; and at the treaty of Uxbridge in 1644, the English parliament made it a preliminary article, that Bishop Bramhall, with Archbishop Laud, and others, should be excepted from the general pardon. Upon this he went abroad; but, on the restoration, he was appointed archbishop of Armagh, primate and metropolitan of all Ireland, and was chosen speaker of the House of Lords. He died in 1663. He was the author of several works, which are collected in one volume folio.
