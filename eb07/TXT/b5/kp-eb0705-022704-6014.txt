BREREWOOD, Edward, an English mathematician and antiquary, was the son of Robert Brerewood, a tradesman, who was thrice mayor of Chester, and born in that city in the year 1565. He received the rudiments of his education at the free school in Chester; and was afterwards admitted, in 1581, of Brazen-nose College in Oxford. In the year 1596 he became the first professor of astronomy in Gresham College, London; and there led the same private and retired course of life as he had before done in Oxford. He died of a fever upon the 4th of November 1613. He was a great searcher into antiquity and curious knowledge, but never published any thing during his lifetime. After his death came out the following works: â€”1. De Ponderibus et Pretiis veterum Nummorum corumque cum recentioribus Collatione, 1664, 4to; 2. Inquiries touching the Diversities of Languages and Religion through the chief parts of the world, London, 1614, 4to; 3. Elementa Logicae in gratiam studiosae juventutis in Academia Oxon. London, 1614, 8vo, and Oxford, 1628, 8vo; 4. Tractatus quidam Logici de proedicabilibus et praedicamentis, 1628, 8vo; 5. Two Treatises on the Sabbath, 1630 and 1632; 6. Tractatus duo, quorum primus est de iiletcoris, secundus de Oculo, 1631; 7. Commentarii in Ethicam Aristotelis, Oxford, 1640, 4to; and, 8. The Patriarchal Government of the Ancient Church, Oxford, 1641, 4to.
