BREVET, in the French customs, denotes the grant of some favour or donation from the king.

Brevet more particularly denotes that species of military commission by which an officer is promoted to a rank in the army above that which he holds in his regiment. Brevet rank, therefore, is a rank in the army higher than that for which pay is received, and, when corps are brigaded, it gives precedence according to the date of the brevet commission. The term brevet is also sometimes used to express general promotion, by which a given number of officers are raised from the rank of captain upwauls, without any additional pay.
