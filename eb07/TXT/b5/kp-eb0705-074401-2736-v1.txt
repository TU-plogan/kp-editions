BURNTISLAND, or Bruntisland, a royal burgh and parish of Scotland, in the county of Fife, situated upon the Frith of Forth. It is slightly peninsular, but it does not appear to have been ever surrounded by the sea. It is well sheltered towards the north by steep hills; and accordingly the harbour, which lies on its western quarter, is reckoned one of the safest in the frith. There is also a small light-house erected on the right of the entrance. The town is tolerably clean and well built, possessing one main street of considerable length, with a back one of . lesser dimensions, and various diverging thoroughfares.
[7:5:745]

There is a large distillery here, and ship-building is carried on to some extent. ∙ In ancient times it was fortified, and the remains of a wall and fort are still extant. There is a regular ferry between Burntisland and Leith, from which it is distant six miles north-north-west. The population amounted in 1821 to 2136, and in 1831 to 2366.
