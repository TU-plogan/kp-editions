BUSTARD. See Ornithology, Index. Bustard Bay, a bay on the east coast of New Holland, in which there is a channel leading to a large lagoon. There is space here for a few ships to lie in safety, but access to the lagoon is prevented by shallows. Around the sides of the bay are salt marshes and bogs, and mangroves grow in various places. The bay derived its name from one of Captain Cook’s officers having ’ shot a bustard here. Many other large birds frequent the shore, and great quantities of the hammer and pearl oysters are found under the mangroves. The country is but thinly inhabited, and the natives bear a resemblance to those in the other parts of New Holland. Long. 208. 18. W. Lat. 24. 4. S.
