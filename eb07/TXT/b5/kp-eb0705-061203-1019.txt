BRUNO, Jordano, was born at Nola, in the kingdom of Naples, and about the year 1582 began to call in question some of the tenets of the Romish church, which occasioned his retiring to Geneva; but after two years stay there he expressed his aversion to Calvinism in such a manner that he was expelled the city. After having staid some time at Lyons, Toulouse, and Paris, he came to London, and continued two years in the house of Μ. Castle-nau, the French ambassador. He was very well received by Queen Elizabeth and the politer part of the court. His principal friends were Sir Philip Sidney and Sir Fulk Greville. With these and some others of their club Bruno held assemblies; but as they treated of subjects of a very delicate nature, which could not suit the taste or capacity of every body, they kept the door always shut, and none but select persons were admitted into their company. At Sir Philip’s request he composed his Spaccio della Bestia Triumphante, which was printed in 8vo, 1584, and dedicated to that gentleman. From England he went to Wittemberg, and thence to Prague, where he printed several tracts, in which he openly avowed atheistical principles. After visiting some other towns in Germany, he made a tour to Venice, where he was apprehended by order of the inquisition, tried, condemned, and, refusing to retract, burnt at the stake on the 9th February 1600.
