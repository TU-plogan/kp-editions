BROWNIE, the name of a serviceable kind of sprite, who, according to a superstitious notion formerly prevalent in the Hebrides and Highlands of Scotland (as well as among the country people in England, where he had the name of Robin Goodfellow'), was wont to clean the houses, help to churn, thresh the corn, and belabour all who pretended to make a jest of him. He was represented as stout and blooming, had fine long flowing hair, and went about with a wand in his hand. He was the very counterpart of Mil tonâ€™s Lubber Fiend.
