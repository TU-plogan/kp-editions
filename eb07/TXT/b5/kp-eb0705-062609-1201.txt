BUCER, Martin, one of the first authors of the Reformation at Strasburg, was born in 1491, in Alsace, and took the religious habit of St Dominic at seven years of age; but meeting afterwards with the writings of Martin Luther, and comparing them with the Scriptures, he began to entertain doubts concerning several things in the Roman Catholic religion. After some conferences with Luther at Heidelberg in 1521, he adopted most of his sentiments; but in 1532 he gave the preference to those o [7:5:627] Zuinglius. He assisted in many conferences concerning religion; and in 1548, he was sent for to Augsburg to sign the agreement, called the interim, between the Papists and Protestants. His warm opposition to this project exposed him to many difficulties and hardships; the news of which reaching England, where his fame had already arrived, Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, gave him an invitation to come over, which he readily accepted. In 1549 a handsome apartment was assigned him in the University of Cambridge, and a salary to teach theology. King Edward VI. had the greatest regard for him. Being told that he was very sensible of the cold of the climate, and suffered much for want of a German stove, he sent him a hundred crowns to purchase one. Bucer died of a complication of disorders in 1551, and was buried at Cambridge with great funeral pomp. Five years afterwards, in the reign of Queen Mary, his body was dug up and publicly burnt, and his tomb demolished; but it was subsequently re-constructed by order of Queen Elizabeth.
