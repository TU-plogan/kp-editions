BRAZEN Sea, in Jewish Antiquity, one of the sacred utensils in the temple of Solomon. It was cast in the plain of Jordan, and removed from thence into the inner court of the temple, where it was placed upon twelve oxen, three of which looked towards each quarter of the world. It was ten cubits from the one brim to the other, five cubits in height, and thirty cubits in circumference, and contained three thousand baths. The brim of it was perfectly round, and so it continued in the two upper cubits; but below the brim, in the three lower cubits, it was square. It was a hand-breadth in thickness, and the brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies. About the body of this huge vessel were two borders of engravings, representing the heads of oxen in demi-relief, and out of these some suppose the water to have issued. This brazen or molten sea was designed for the priests to wash themselves in before they performed the service of the temple. Water was supplied through a pipe out of the well Ľtam.
