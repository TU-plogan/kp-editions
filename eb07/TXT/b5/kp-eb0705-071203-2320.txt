BURIDAN, John, a native of Bethune, in Artois, was one of the most celebrated philosophers of the fourteenth century. He taught in the university of Paris with great reputation, and wrote commentaries on logic, morality, and Aristotleâ€™s metaphysics. Aventinus relates that he was a disciple of Ockam; and that, being expelled Paris by the power of the realists, which was superior to that of the nominalists, he went into Germany, where he founded the university of Vienna.
