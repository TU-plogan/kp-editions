BURGLARY, or Nocturnal House-Breaking (burgi latrocinium), which by the ancient English law was called hamesuchen, a word also used in the law of Scotland, but in a somewhat different sense, has always been looked upon as a very heinous offence. The definition of a burglar, as given by Sir Edward Coke, is, “he that by night breaketh and entereth in a mansion-house with intent to commit a felony.” Burglary is a felony at common law, but within the benefit of clergy.
