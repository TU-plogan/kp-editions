BURSA, a large walled city of Asiatic Turkey, in the province of Natolia, about six miles in circuit, including the suburbs. It is situated on eminences on each side of a height, and is surmounted by a castle, which is about a mile in circumference, and which antiquaries conjecture to be the ancient Prusa. The city is said to contain 300 mosques and churches, the tombs of several sultans, together with chapels of marble and jasper. The population consists of Turks, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews. The two latter, however, do not amount to more than 600 and 800 families. The Greeks dwell in a suburb west of the castle, and divided from it by a deep channel, planted with mulberry trees, and crossed by several bridges, one of them ninety paces long and sixteen broad, and occupied on each side by shops. The Greeks have three churches in this suburb, and their metropolitan. The Armenians inhabit a suburb to the east of the former, where they have a church and an archbishop. The town is resorted to for its mineral springs, which are reckoned salutary in various disorders. At the west end of the town a spring of cold and another of hot water rise in the same apartment; and in another bath called the New Spring, which is the largest and most beautiful of the whole, two hot streams issue from a copious fountain, and run through the middle of the room. There are various manufactures in the town, and an extensive trade. Satins in great variety, and chiefly striped, are made here, for the short under garments of the Turkish habit; and there are besides manufactures of silk stuffs and gauze, while quantities of raw silk are exported by the caravans to Aleppo, Smyrna, and Constantinople. Bursa is a very ancient city, and is generally supposed to have been built by Prusius, king of Bithynia, about five or six centuries before the Christian era. After experiencing many revolutions, it was captured by an Arab prince in the year 957, but was soon retaken and held by the Greeks. In 1356 it was conquered by the Turks under Othman IÎ“., and remained the capital of the Turkish empire until the conquest of Constantinople in 1452 by Mahommed II., when the seat of government was transferred to that city. The population is computed at 60,000. It is 75 miles south-southwest of Constantinople. Long. 29. 12. E. Lat. 40. 11. N.
