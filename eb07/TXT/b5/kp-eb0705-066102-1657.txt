BUFFIER, Claude, a distinguished writer, born in 1661, became a Jesuit in 1679, and died at Paris in 1737. There are many works by this author, showing deep pénétration and accurate judgment. The principal of these is entitled Un Cours des Sciences, or a Course of Sciences, upon principles new and simple, in order to form the language, the understanding, and the heart. Paris 1732, in folio. This collection includes an excellent French grammar upon a new plan, a philosophic and practical treatise upon eloquence, an art of poetry, which, however, is not reckoned the best part of the miscellany, elements of metaphysics, an examination into vulgar prejudices, a treatise of civil society, and an exposition of the proofs of religion; all full of reflections, just as well as new. He was. the author of several other works, particularly, 1. Pratique de la Mémoire artificielle, Paris, 1715, 4 vols. I2mo; 2. Some historical works, an Introduction to the History of the Sovereign Houses of Europe, an [7:5:662]Abridgment of Spanish History, and an Account of the Origin of the Kingdom of Sicily and Naples; 3. Various treatises on religion and piety. In his Cours des Sciences Buffier has anticipated, though he failed to develope and pursue to its consequences, that peculiar system of mental philosophy which resolves all the ultimate principles of belief into the perceptions or suggestions of what is called common sense; and indeed it seems pretty certain that Dr Reid has been indebted to the learned Jesuit for valuable hints on nearly all the purely speculative points treated of in his Intellectual Philosophy.
