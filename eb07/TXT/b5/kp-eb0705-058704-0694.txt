BROMBERG, one of the governments into which the Prussian province of Posen is divided. It is bounded on the north by West Prussia, on the east by the present mg om of Poland, on the south by the government of Posen, and on the west by the province of Brandenburg. Its extent is four thousand five hundred and six square miles, or two millions eight hundred and eighty-three thousand eight hundred and forty acres. It comprehends fifty-five cities and towns, and one thousand two hundred and fifty villages, thirty-two thousand eight hundred and twenty dwelling houses, with 279,360 inhabitants, of whom about 160,000 are Catholics, and the remainder Protestants of various sects, with 16,000 Jews. It is divided into nine circles, and is a part of the former kingdom of Poland. The soil is generally a light, sand.. The face of the country is level, and a great portion of it is covered with woods. I he agricultural product is very small, scarcely sufficient for the subsistence of the inhabitants. The whole stock of cattle for this extensive district and its numerous population was in 1820 only 33,700 horses, 11,917 cows, and 45,475 sheep of all descriptions. The city of the same name, the capital of the government and of the circle of Bromberg, called by the Poles Bydgoscy, stands on an elevation near the navigable river Brahe. It is, for a Polish town, well built, and contains one Lutheran and two Catholic churches, a monastery, a nunnery, three hospitals, and five hundred and fifty-two dwellings, with 7554 inhabitants. It has some refineries for sugar, and a little trade in corn by means of its connection with the Vistula. Long. 17. 55. E. Lat. 55. 27. N.
