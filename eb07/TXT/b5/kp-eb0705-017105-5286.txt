BRADING, a town on the eastern side of the Isle of Wight, in the county of Hampshire, ninety-nine miles from London. It has a harbour capacious but shallow, and dry at low water. It has little trade, depending chiefly on the rural inhabitants in its vicinity. A new church has been recently built here. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1529, in 1811 to 1715, and in 1821 to 2023.
