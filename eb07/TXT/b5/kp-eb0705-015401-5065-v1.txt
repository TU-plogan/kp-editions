BOURGUIGNONS, or Burgundians, oneof the northern nations who overran the Roman empire, and at length settled in Gaul. They were of great stature, and warlike in their disposition; for which reason the emperor Valentinian engaged them in his service against the Germans. They lived in tents, close to each other, that they might the more readily unite in arms on any unforeseen attack; and these conjunctions they called burgs, which were to them exactly what towns are to us. Sidonius Apollinaris tells us that they wore long hair, took great pleasure in singing, and were fond of praise for their vocal talents; that they ate enormous quantities, and anointed their hair with butter, deeming that unction extremely ornamental. Their crown was at first elective, and the authority of their kings expired with the occasion that had produced it. They were not only accountable for their own misconduct, but likewise for the accidents of nature and the caprice of fortune; being deposed if they lost a battle, or if they succeeded ill in any enterprise, or if any event did not correspond with the expectations of the public. Nor were they more favourably treated in case of a bad harvest or vintage, or in the event of an epidemical distemper ravaging the state. At first the Burgundians were governed by many kings, and henden was the title of the royal dignity. But in latter times they were subject to one sovereign, and became humane and civilized, especially when Christianity was propagated in their country. Before that epoch their religion was much the same with that of the other northern nations. They had many priests, the chief of whom was distinguished by the name of sinistrus. He was perpetual, and they paid him great respect and veneration.
