BRUSH, an assemblage of hairs and hogs’ bristles, fastened in the holes of a wooden handle or board, pierced for that purpose, and serving to cleanse divers bodies by rubbing therewith. The manner of making brushes is by folding the hair or bristle in two, bringing it by means of a packthread, which is engaged in the fold, through the holes with which the wood is pierced all over, and afterwards fastening it therein with glue. When the holes are . thus filled, the ends of the hair are cut to make the surface even.

Shearmen's Brush is made of wild boars’ bristles, and serves to lay the wool or nap of cloth, after shearing it for the last time.

Brush, among painters, a larger and coarser kind of pencil, made of hogs’ bristles, wherewith to lay the colours on their large pieces. The Chinese painter’s brush consists of the stalk of a plant, whose fibres being fretted at both ends, and tied again, serve for a brush.
