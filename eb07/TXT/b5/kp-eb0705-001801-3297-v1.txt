BORROWSTOUNNESS (generally abbreviated to Bo’ness), a sea-port town of Scotland, in the county of Linlithgow, is situated on the southern shore of the Frith of Forth, where that arm of the sea is between three and four miles broad. This is one of the most ancient sea-port towns of Scotland, and many of the houses appear to be of very ancient date. The town is irregularly built; the streets are narrow and incommodious; and, from the number of public works, vŕhenċc smoke is profusely emitted, the houses are for the most part coated with soot. There is an excellent harbour here, where a patent slip is erected for the'use of shipping. The trade of this port was at one time considerable; but of late years it has much declined, in consequence of the navigable canal between the rivers Forth and Clydé having gradually transferred the trade to Grangemouth, which stands at the junction of this canal with the Forth. At present it possesses'three vessels employed in the whale-fishery. The parish contains extensive coal-works. There are also two distilleries, a pottery, à soap-work,' and a vitriol and sal-ammoniac work.’ Besides the established church, there is a dissenting meeting-house. There are two weekly markets, and an annüal fair. The population in 1831 amounted to 2809.

Borrowstounness is distant eighteen miles west of Edinburgh, and three north of Linlithgow.
