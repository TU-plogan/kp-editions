BOX, in its most common acceptation, denotes a small chest or coffer for containing articles.

Dice-Box·, a narrow deep cornet, channelled within, by which the dice are shaken and thrown. This answers to what the Romans called fritillus. Besides the fritillus, the Romans, for greater security, had another kind of dicebox called pyrgus, πvξγog, and sometimes turricula. It was placed immovably in the middle of the table, being perforated or open at both ends, and likewise channelled within; and over the top was fixed a kind of funnel, into which the dice were cast out upon the fritillus, and, descending, fell through the bottom on the table; by which all practising on them with the fingers was effectually pre- .yented.
