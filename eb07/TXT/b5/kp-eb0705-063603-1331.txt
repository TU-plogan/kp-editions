BUDDAEUS, John Francis, a celebrated Lutheran divine, and one of the most learned men Germany has produced, was born in 1667, at Anclam, a town of Pomerania, where his father was minister. He studied with great distinction at Greifswald and at Wittenberg; and having attained to eminence in languages, theology, and history, was appointed Greek and Latin professor at Col-burg; afterwards professor of morality and politics in the university of Halle; and at length, in 1705, professor of divinity at Jena, where he died in 1729, after having acquired a very great reputation. His principal works are, 1. A large historical German Dictionary, Leipsic, 1709, folio; 2. Historia Ecclesiastica Veteris Testamenti, Halle, 1709, four vols. 4to; 3. Elementa Philosophice Practicae, Instrumentalis et theoreticae, three vols. 8vo, which has passed through a great number of editions; 4. Selecta Juns Naturoe et Gentium, Halle, 1704, 8vo; 5. Miscellanea Sacra, Jena, 1727, three vols. 4to; 6. Isagoge Historico Theologica ad Theologiam Universam, singulasque ejus ' partes, two vols. 4to, a work much valued by the Lutherans; and, 7.
