BURGOMAS l’ER, Burghermaster, Burgermester, or Burgmester, the chief magistrate of the great towns in Flanders, Holland, and Germany. The power and juris- ∖ diction of the burgomaster are not the same in all places, every town having its particular customs and regulations. The word is formed from the two Flemish words borger, burgess, or citizen; and mester, master. Some express it in Latin by consul, others by senator. Purgermaster, in Holland, answers to alderman and sheriff in England.

Burgomaster. See Ornithology, Index.
