BRESLAU, one of the governments into which the kingdom of Prussia is divided. It extends over the northwest part of the province of Silesia, or what was formerly Lower Silesia. It is bounded on the north and northeast by Posen, on the east by Poland, on the south-east by Oppeln, on the south-west by Reichenbach, and on the west by Liegnitz. Its extent is 5269 square miles, or 3,373,160 acres. The population amounted in 1817 to 792,071, at the end of 1819 to 833,253, and at the end of 1826 to 914,607. It is divided into twenty-two circles, which, in 1826, contained 121,080 houses, in thirty-five cities, seven market-towns, and 1283 villages. About two thirds of the inhabitants are of the Protestant profession, about one third Catholics, and betwixt 7000 and 8000 Jews. The live stock of the whole district consisted of 72,657 horses, 293,203 cows, and 894,460 sheep of all ages and both sexes. It forms the most important part of the province of Silesia, the greatest manufacturing country of the east of Europe. The city of Breslau is the capital as well of the government of that name as of the whole province of Silesia, and is the third of the royal residences. It is situated at the confluence of the Ohlau and the Oder, about 500 feet above the level of the Baltic Sea. It is the seat of the civil and military government of Silesia. A university, re-established in 1811, has a valuable library of 100,000 volumes, and in 1826 had 850 students, consisting of both Catholics and Protestants. It is an ancient city, exhibiting many specimens of the oldest German architecture. Many manufactures, particularly of linen and cloth, have long flourished there, though said to be now somewhat on the decline. At the great fair extensive transactions are carried on in fine wool. It contained, in 1826, 78,600 inhabitants, of whom 4600 were Jews. Long. 16. 56. 47. E. Lat. 51. 6. 50. N.
