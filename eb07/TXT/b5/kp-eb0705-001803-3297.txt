BORSET, or Borsett, celebrated for its baths, a place about half a league from Aix-la-Chapelle in Germany. The abbey is a very magnificent structure. It was formerly a monastery, but now serves as a nunnery, the abbess of which is usually a princess of the empire, and lady of Borset. The waters are warm, and of the same nature as those of Aix-la-Chapelle; and they are only used for diseases in which those last mentioned are recommended, and also in dropsical and oedematous cases. The waters are distinguished into the upper and lower springs. The former were found by Dr Simmons to raise the thermometer to 186°, the latter to only 127°.
