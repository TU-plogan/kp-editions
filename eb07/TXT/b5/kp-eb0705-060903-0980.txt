BRUCKENAU, a city of 1550 inhabitants, the capital of a magistracy of the same name, in the circle of the Lower Maine, and kingdom of Bavaria. It extends over a hundred and nine square miles, and contains, besides the city, twenty-two villages, with 9350 inhabitants. It is a poor district, yielding little corn, but abundance of potatoes. The chief employment of the inhabitants consists in making wood ware, especially platters and bowls, and some spinning and weaving flax.
