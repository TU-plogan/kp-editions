DUMPALIS, a spacious bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, into which flow two considerable rivers. Good anchorage is found here, and the bay is much resorted to on account of the great quantity of fish which are found in it. At the bottom of this bay is situated the town of Dumpalis, which has a considerable trade. The inland merchants bring gold dust and a particular drug, which they dispose of to the inhabitants in the town, receiving in return tobacco, opium, white cloths, iron knives, and creeses. The natives here fight with poisoned barbed arrows, blown out of black ebony tubes; and are sure to kill at the distance of twenty yards.
