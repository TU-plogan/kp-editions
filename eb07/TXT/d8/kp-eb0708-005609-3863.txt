DITTEAH, a town and fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Bundeleund. It is populous and well built, about a mile and a half long, and nearly as much in breadth. The houses are chiefly constructed of stone covered with tiles. It is surrounded by a stone wall, and furnished with gates. Without the tow n is the rajah’s palace, standing on an eminence, and commanding a very extensive prospect, including a handsome lake. It is an ancient place, having been in the rajah’s family for several centuries. The surrounding district yields a revenue of between L.12,000 and L∙15,000 sterling per annum. On the cession of Bundeleund by the peshwa to the British in 1804, the rajah of Ditteah joined the British standard, and a treaty was concluded with him, by which he was confirmed in the possession of his ancient inheritance. Long. 78. 32. E. Lat. 25. 43. N.
