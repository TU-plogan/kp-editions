DURSLEY, a market-town of the hundred of Berkeley, in the county of Gloucester, 108 miles from London. It is a corporate town, but has long ceased to elect members of parliament. A considerable quantity of broad cloth is made, chiefly for the China trade. A market, held on Thursday, is well supplied. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2379, in 1811 to 2580, in 1821 to 3186, and in 1831 to 3226.
