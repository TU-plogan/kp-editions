DRONTHEIM, the northernmost province of the kingdom of Norway, extending from 61. 4L to 71. 11. north latitude. It extends over 64,284 square miles, but the population amounts to no more than 239,712 individuals, who inhabit six cities or towns and 115 parishes, which contain 262 churches and 110 chapels.

Drontheim, the capital of the province of the same name in Norway, and the see of a bishop, is situated at the mouth of the river Nidelf, in a deep bay or fiord, in a most pleasing situation. It is walled, and was formerly defended[7:8:201] by two forts, which are now in a dilapidated state. The streets are spacious, and the houses of respectable appearance, though all built of wood. The cathedral was once the most celebrated in the north, though now only the choir, in which the kings were formerly crowned, is entire. It has, besides, two churches, and 1400 houses, with 9000 inhabitants. The haven is secure, and causes some export trade in copper, planks, stockfish, herrings, and train oil. There are a few manufactures of linen cloth, and also refineries for sugar and saltpetre, besides tanneries and glove-making. Long. 10. 18. 47. E. Lat. 63. 25. 47. N.
