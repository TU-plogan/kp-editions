DODSLEY, Robert, an eminent bookseller and ingenious writer, born at Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire, in the year 1703. He was not much indebted to education for his literary reputation, being originally a livery servant; but his natural genius and early passion for reading soon elevated him to a superior station. He wrote an elegant little satirical farce called The Toyshop, which was acted with applause in 1735, and which recommended him to the patronage of Mr Pope. The following year he produced the King and Miller of Mansfield. The profits of these two farces enabled him to commence bookseller, and his own merit procured him eminence in that profession. He wrote some other dramatic pieces, and published a collection of his works in one volume 8vo, under the modest title of Trifles, which was followed by Public Virtue, a poem in 4to. Mr D∩dsley was the author of the Economy of Human Life, a work which acquired considerable celebrity; but for this it is supposed to have been indebted to the mistaken opinion which long prevailed of its being the production of Lord Chesterfield. The name of Dodsley is connected or associated with much of the literature of his time. Among other things he projected the Annual Register, in concert with Edmund Burke, who is known to have mainly contributed to its success. It would be tedious and uninteresting to enumerate the various literary enterprises in which he engaged. His personal character was excellent; he observed the strictest integrity in all his dealings; and he lived on easy terms with authors of high rank as well as genius. Dodsley may be considered as one of the founders of a great London bookselling establishment.
