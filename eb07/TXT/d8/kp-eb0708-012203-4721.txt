DOUAY, an arrondissement in the department of the North, in France, extending over 450 square miles, divided into thirteen cantons, and these subdivided into 146 communes, containing 183,560 inhabitants. The city which gives its name to the arrondissement is on the river Scarpe, which is divided into several channels in passing through it. The fortifications are strong, and more easily defended, from the ease with which the environs may be inundated. It is a large but not well-built city, containing 2730 houses, and 18,460 inhabitants. It was once celebrated as the place of education of Catholic priests for the British dominions. It is now the seat of large manufactories of various kinds. Long. 2. 59. 42. E. Lat. 50. 22. 12. N.
