DONGOLA, or Dankala, a town on the Nile, and capital of the district of Nubia. It stands on the declivity of a dry, arenaceous hill, and the streets are almost choked with sand brought down from the mountains behind by the floods. The houses are low and ill built. The castle is situated in the middle of the town, and is spacious, but badly fortified. The horses of Dongola are highly prized; they are remarkably beautiful, and their riders are very skilful. When the Mamelukes were expelled from Egypt, a party of those who escaped took possession of Dongola, and erected there a species of petty sovereignty. Their number, however, does not exceed 500, with from 3000 to 6000 negro slaves. Long. 32. 0. E. Lat. 19. 20. N.
