DOLE, in the Saxon and British tongue, signified a part or portion most commonly of a meadow where several persons had shares. It also still signifies a distribution or dealing of alms, or a liberal gift made by a great man to the people.

Dole, an arrondissement in the department of Jura, in France, extending over 470 square miles. It is divided into nine cantons, and these into 155 communes, containing 65,380 inhabitants. The chief place, a city of the same name, is in a fine situation on the river Doubs, which winds its way through beautiful meadows. In the neighbourhood are many Roman antiquities, especially of roads and aqueducts. The canal for uniting the Doubs with the Rhone, projected by Bonaparte, commences at this city. It contains 1350 houses, and 8235 inhabitants. It is in long. 5. 25. 1. E. and lat. 47. 2. 45. N.

Dole, in Scotch Law, from the Latin dolus, signifies a malevolent intention. It is essential in every crime, that it be committed intentionally, or by an act of the will; and hence the rule, Crimen dolo contrahitur.
