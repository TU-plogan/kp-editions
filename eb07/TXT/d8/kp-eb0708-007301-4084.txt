DIVUS, Diva, in Antiquity, appellations given to men and women who had been deified, or placed in the number of the gods.

Hence it is that upon medals struck on the consecration of an emperor or empress, they have the title of divus or dirai thus, DIVUS JULIUS, DIVO ANTONINO PIO, DI VO PIO, DIVO CLAUDIO, DIVA FAUSTINA AUG. and so on.
