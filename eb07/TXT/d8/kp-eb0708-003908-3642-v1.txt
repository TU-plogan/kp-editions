DISABILITY, in Law, is when a man is disabled, or made incapable to inherit any lands, or take that benefit which otherwise he might have done; and this may happen four ways; by the act of an ancestor, or of the party himself, by the act of God, or by that of the law. 1. Disability by the act of the ancestor is where the ancestor is attainted of high treason, which corrupts the blood of his children, so that they may not inherit his estate. 2. Disability by the act of the party is where a man binds himself by an obligation, that, upon surrender of a lease, he will grant a new estate to a lessee; and afterwards he grants over the reversion to another, which puts it out of his power to perform it. 3. Disability by the act of God is where a man is non sanae memories, by which he is incapable of making any grant, &c.; so that, if he pass an estate out of him, it may after his death be made void: but it is a maxim in law, “that a man of full age shall never be received to disable his own person.” 4. Disability by the act of the law, is where a man by the law, without any thing by him done, is rendered incapable of the benefit of the law; as an alien born, or the like.
