DIDYMUS of Alexandria, an ecclesiastical writer of the fourth century, w ho, though he is said to have lost his eyes at five years of age, when he had scarcely learned to read, yet applied so earnestly to study, that he attained all the philosophic arts in a high degree, and was thought worthy to fill the chair in the famous divinity school at Alexandria. He was the author of a great number of works; but all which we have now remaining are, a Latin translation of his book upon the Holy Spirit, in the works of St Jerome, who was the translator; short strictures on the Canonical Epistles; and a book against the Manicheans.
