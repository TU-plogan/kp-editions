DISTEMPER, among Physicians, the same with Disease. Distemper, in Painting, a term used for the working up of colours with something besides water or oil. If the colours are prepared with water, that kind of painting is called limning ; and if with oil, it is called painting in ail, and simply painting. If the colours are mixed with size, whites of eggs, or any such glutinous or unctuous matter, and not with oil, then it is said to be done in distemper.
