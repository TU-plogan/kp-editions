DYSAE, in Mythology, inferior goddesses among the Saxons, being the messengers of the great Odin, whose province it was to convey the souls of such as died in battle to his abode, called Valhalla or the hall of slaughter, where they were to drink, with him and their other gods, cerevisia, a kind of malt liquor, in the skulls of their enemies. The Dysce conveyed those who died a natural death to Hela, the goddess of hell, where they were tormented with hunger, thirst, and every kind of evil.
