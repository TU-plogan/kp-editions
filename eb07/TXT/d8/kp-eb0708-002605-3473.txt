DIFFARREATION, among the Romans, a ceremony by which the divorce of their priests was solemnized. The word comes from the preposition dis, which is used, in composition, for division or separation, and farreatio, a ceremony with wheat, from far, wheat or corn.

Diffarreation was properly the dissolving of marriages contracted by confarreation, which were those of the pontifices or priests. Festus says it was performed with a wheaten cake; but Vigen√®re maintains that confarreation and diffarreation are the same thing.
