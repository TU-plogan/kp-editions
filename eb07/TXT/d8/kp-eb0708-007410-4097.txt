DOCK, in the manège, is used for a large case of leather, as long as the dock of a horse’s tail, which serves it for a cover. The French call the dock trousse-queue. It is made fast by straps to the crupper, and has leathern thongs which pass between the thighs, and along the flanks of the animal, to the saddle straps, in order to keep the tail tight, and to prevent it from whisking about.
