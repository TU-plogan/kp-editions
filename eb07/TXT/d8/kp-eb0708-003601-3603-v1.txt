DIOPHANTINE Problems, in Mathematics, certain questions relating to square and cube numbers, and right-angled triangles, the nature of which was determined by Diophantus, a mathematician of Alexandria, who is believed to have lived about the third century. The works of Diophantus were published with notes at Paris in 1621, by Bachet de Meziriac; and another edition appeared in 1670, with observations on every question by Μ. Fermat.
