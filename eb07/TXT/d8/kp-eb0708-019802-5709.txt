DRESDEN, a city of Germany, the capital of the former electorate, now the kingdom of Saxony. It is a beautiful spot, both as regards the position and the buildings. The river Elbe divides it into two unequal parts, over which is a fine bridge of sixteen arches, 1420 feet in length and thirty-six in breadth, which, though destroyed in the French revolutionary war, has again been restored· It was fortified, but the works now serve the purposes merely of police. There are seven market-places or squares, and about sixty broad streets, with others connecting them together; and the public buildings, which are numerous and beautiful, give to the whole a most magnificent appearance, but especially in the new town, which is of more recent erection.

There are seventeen Lutheran, two Catholic, and a small Calvinist church; the most remarkable are the Frauen-kirk of the Protestants, and the elegant Catholic church connected with the royal palace. Over the altar of the latter is a painting of the ascension by Mengs, highly valued.

Dresden has obtained the name of the Athens of the north, from the various collections of the fine arts and of antiquities that are to be seen there. The palace is spacious and noble, and in the repository in the GGinen Gewölbe is arranged a collection of antiquities connected with the ancient history of the country, of very great value. The zwenger or barbican is a beautiful circular building. The garden serves the purposes of a promenade, and the apartments are used as the repository of a valuable cabinet of natural history. The picture gallery occupying the four sides of a square building is peculiarly rich in specimens of art of the best and oldest masters, and is said to be the best in Europe at the present time. The Japan palace, in a garden looking on the Elbe, contains the royal library, amounting to more than 150,000 volumes, a collection of porcelain, and many of the finest specimens both of ancient and modern statuary. The chancery house is a fine building, and, besides several paintings, contains some most valuable records of the historical kind. The other public and private houses deserving attention are numerous, and will reward the curious visitor who shall devote his time to their minute examination.

The institutions for benevolence and for instruction are numerous, appropriate, and well conducted. The surrounding country presents many objects which induce pleasing walks or rides, especially the Plaunesche-grund, where a rapid stream runs between lofty rocks, the palace of Pilnitz on the banks of the Elbe, and the gardens which surround a part of the city.

There are many manufactures carried on of gold and silver articles, silk goods, cotton and woollen cloth, gloves, hosiery, and other minute commodities. A considerable quantity of wine is made from the vineyards on the sides of the hills overlooking the Elbe. Dresden has suffered in its population by war in 1745, 1756, 1811, and especially in 1813. The inhabitants amount to 49,000, of whom 5000 are Catholics, 200 Calvinists, 860 Jews, and forty Hussites.
