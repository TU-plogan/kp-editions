DUUMVIRI, in Roman antiquity, a general appellation given to magistrates, commissioners, and officers, where two were joined together in the same functions.

Duumviri Capitales were the judges in criminal causes. From their sentence it was lawful to appeal to the people, who alone had the power of condemning a citizen to death. These judges were taken from the body of the decuriones, and had great power and authority; they were members of the public council, and had two lictors to walk before them.

Duumviri Municipales were two magistrates in some cities of the empire, answering to the consuls at Rome. They were chosen out of the body of the decuriones, and their office commonly lasted five years, upon which account they were frequently termed quinquinales magistratus. Their jurisdiction was of great extent. They had officers who walked before them, carrying a small switch in their hands; and some of them assumed the privilege of having lictors carrying axes and the fasces or bundles of rods before them.

Duumviri Navales were the commissaries of the fleet, first created at the request of M. Decius, tribune of the people, in the time of the war with the Samnites. The duties of their office consisted in giving orders for the fitting out of ships, and issuing their commissions to the marine officers, &c.

Duumviri Sacrorum were magistrates created by Tarquinius Superbus for the performance of the sacrifices, and for keeping the sibyls' books. They were chosen from among the patricians, and held their office during life; they were exempted from serving in the wars, and from the offices imposed on the other citizens; and without them the oracles of the sibyls could not be consulted.
