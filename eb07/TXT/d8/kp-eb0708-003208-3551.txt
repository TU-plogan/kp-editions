DINGWALL, a royal burgh of Scotland, and capital of the county of Ross. It lies in a low situation at the mouth of a glen opening into the north side of the Cromarty Frith, near the western extremity of that estuary. The town is rather neatly built, and consists of one main street, from which several smaller ones branch off. The townhouse is a curious old building, and stands in the centre of the place. The church is a plain edifice, on the north side of the town, with an obelisk in its neighbourhood, fifty-seven feet in height, erected to the memory of the first Earl of Cromarty, who was buried here. This place possesses a small harbour, near which formerly stood the mansion of the powerful family of Ross; but of this princely structure only a few fragments remain. Dingwall was created a royal burgh by Alexander II.; and its charter was renewed by James IV. Its civic governors are a [7:8:33]provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, treasurer, and ten counsellors. There is a weekly market held on Friday, and two yearly fairs. It is distant 178 miles north-west from Edinburgh. The population of the town and parish amounted in 1821 to 2031, and in 1831 to 2124.
