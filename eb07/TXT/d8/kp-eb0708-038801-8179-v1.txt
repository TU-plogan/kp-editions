DYNANOMETER, an instrument for ascertaining the relative strength of men and animals. * Of an instrument of this kind, invented by Regnier, and of which a description is given in the Journal de l , Ecole Polytechnique, tom. ii. the author thus speaks: “Some important knowledge might be acquired, had we the easy means of ascertaining, in a comparative manner, our relative strength at the different periods of life, and in different states of health. Buffon and Guéneau, who had some excellent ideas on this subject, requested me to endeavour to invent a portable machine, which, by an easy and simple mechanism, might conduct to a solution of this question, on which they were then engaged. These philosophers were acquainted with that invented by Graham, and improved by Dr Desaguliers, at London; but this machine, constructed of wooden work, was too bulky and heavy to be portable; and, besides, to make experiments on the different parts of the body, several machines were necessary, each suited to the part required to be tried. They were acquainted also with the dynanometer of citizen Leroy of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. It consisted of a metal tube ten or twelve inches in length, placed vertically on a foot like that of a candlestick, and containing in the inside a spiral spring, having above it a graduated shank terminating in a globe. This shank, together with the spring, sunk into the tube in proportion to the weight acting upon it, and thus pointed out, in degrees j the strength of the person who pressed on the ball with his hand.

“This instrument, though ingenious, did not appear sufficient, however, to Buffon and Guéneau; for they wished not merely to ascertain the muscular force of a finger or hand, but to estimate that of each limb separately, and of all the parts of the body. I shall not here give an account of the attempts I made to fulfil the wishes of these two philosophers, but only observe, that in the course of my experiments I had reason to be convinced that the construction of the instrument was not so easy as might have been expected. Besides the use which an enlightened naturalist may make of this machine, it maybe possible to apply it to many other purposes. For example, it may be employed with advantage to determine the strength of draught cattle; and, above all, to try that of horses, and compare it with the strength of other animals. It may serve to make known how far the assistance of well-constructed wheels may favour the movement of a carriage, and what is its vis inertiae in proportion to the load. We might appreciate by it, also, what resistance the slope of a mountain opposes to a carriage, and be able to judge whether a carriage is sufficiently loaded in proportion to the number of horses that are to be yoked to it. In the arts, it may be applied to machines of which we wish to ascertain the resistance, and when we are desirous to calculate the moving force that ought to be adapted to them. It may serve, also, as a Roman balance to weigh burdens. In short, nothing would be more easy than to convert it into an anemometer, to discover the absolute force of the wind, by fitting to it a frame of a determined size filled up with wax cloth; and it would not be impossible to ascertain by this machine the recoil of fire-arms, and consequently the strength of gunpowder.

“This dynanometer, in its form and size, has a near resemblance to a common graphometer. It consists of a spring twelve inches in length, bent into the form of an ellipsis; from the middle of which arises a semicircular piece of brass, having engraved upon it the different degrees that express a force of the power acting on the spring. The whole of this machine, which weighs only two pounds and a half, opposes, however, more resistance [7:8:389] than may be necessary to determine the action of the strongest and most robust horse.”
