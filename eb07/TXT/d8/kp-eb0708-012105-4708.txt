DORYPHORI (from ĉo¢u, spear, and∣piβω, I hear), an appellation given to the life-guardmen of the Roman emperors. They were held in such high estimation as frequently to have the command of armies conferred on them. It was usual also for commanders-in-chief to have their doryphori or life-guard to attend them.
