DICKINSON, Edmund, a celebrated English physician and chemist, was born in 1624. He studied and took his degrees at Merton College, Oxford; and in 1659 published his Delphi Phoenicizantes, in which he attempted to prove that the Greeks borrowed the story of the Pythian Apollo, and all that rendered the oracle at Delphos famous, from the Holy Scriptures, and particularly the book of Joshua; a work which procured him great reputation both at home and abroad. He practised physic first at Oxford; but removing to London in 1684, his good fortune in recovering the Earl of Arlington from a dangerous sickness procured his promotion as a physician in ordinary to Charles II. and to his household. As that prince understood and loved chemistry, Mr Dickinson grew into great favour at court, and was continued in his appointments under James II. After the abdication, he retired from practice, and died in 1707. He published many other things, Physica vetus et vera, containing a system of philosophy, chiefly framed on principles collected from the Mosaic history.
