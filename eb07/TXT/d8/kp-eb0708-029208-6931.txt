DUSSARA, a fortified town of Hindustan, province of Gujerat,- which contains about 1300 houses, which are chiefly possessed by Kurbatties; the remainder of the population being Coolees, Rajpoots, and other castes, besides a few Banyans. This place, with twelve surrounding villages, is the property of a Mahommedan zemindar, of Arabian descent, one of whose ancestors, about the year 1209, was put to death for killing a cow, and he has since been considered as a martyr, and his tomb is held in high esteem. The military force of the chief is estimated at 2000 horsemen and 100 infantry.
