DINAGEPORE, a district of Bengal, situated chiefly between the 25th and 26th degrees of N. lat. On the north it is bounded by Rungpoor and Purneah; on the south by Raujcshy; and on the east by Rungpoor, Purneah, and Rajemal. This district possesses a soil much diversified; and the face of the country has a waving appearance, being divided into small valleys, each about two or three miles broad. These valleys are watered by small rivers, which in the rainy season overflow the low lands, and swell into large lakes fifty or sixty miles in length, which, while the Ganges is in flood, have no outlet. They are thus not only prevented from running off, but are so much increased as to be navigable for vessels of considerable burden. After the inundation runs off, these low lands are covered with a luxuriant pasture, on which are fed numerous buffaloes, and large herds of other cattle, or with rich crops of rice, which is the great staple of agriculture; besides tobacco, indigo, and hemp. The land does not answer for wheat or barley. The soil of the elevated portions of the country is in general a stiff clay, in some places black and porous, in others stiff and tenacious. Many sorts of fibrous plants for cordage and sackloth are sown in April, May, and June; several sorts of pulse are also sown at the commencement of the cold season; and, where the soil is good, the sugar cane is planted in February and March. The inhabitants are in general extremely poor, and their farming utensils are therefore proportionally rude. They are in the proportion of four Hindus to one Mahommeđan. The population, according to the best statistical information that could be procured in answer to queries circulated in 1801 by the Marquis Wellesley, then governor-general, amounted to 600,000. The capital, Dinagepore, is situated on an island formed by the Pernabubah river. It is the residence of a rajah, and a place of considerable trade. It is 162 miles north-north-east of Moorshedabad. Long. 89. 40. E. Lat. 25. 37. N.
