DUFFâ€™S GROUP, a range of islands in the South Pacific Ocean, about eleven in number, extending fourteen or fifteen miles in a direction north-west to south-east. These islands were discovered by Captain Wilson in the course of his missionary voyage in the ship Duff. The largest two were covered with wood, the others appeared barren. The natives appeared shy and apprehensive of strangers.
