DUTENS, Louis, a late French writer of some celebrity, was born at Tours, of Protestant parents, on the 15th of January 1730. In his youth he addicted himself to poetry; and in 1748 he repaired to Paris and composed a tragedy, entitled The Return of Ulysses to Ithaca, which he showed to the comedian Lanoue, requesting him to bring it on the stage. The latter, how ever, returned the piece, advising the author to retouch it. Irritated at this advice, Dutens went to Orleans, where he got his play represented with great applause; but he soon became sensible of the faults of his work, and abandoned a species of composition in which he found he was not destined to excel. He soon afterwards went to England. Before leaving France, he accidentally became acquainted with Miss Pitt, sister to the Earl of Chatham, who gave him a letter to her brother; but after a short stay in London he returned to France. Not long afterwards, he was recalled to London by one of his uncles, to accompany a young English nobleman on his travels. Soon after his arrival, the young nobleman changed his intention; but, at the same time, he procured for Dutens the situation of a tutor in a private family. The father of the pupil was a man of considerable literary and scientifie attainments, who instructed Dutens in those branches of knowledge in which he was deficient. In this manner he learnt Greek and mathematics; and he at the same time applied himself to the oriental languages, and to Italian and Spanish. At the end of three years his pupil died; but one of his sisters being deaf and dumb, Dutens undertook to educate her. His young pupil, however, having become enamoured of her instructor, he deemed it a matter of delicacy and of duty to leave the house.

About this time he was appointed ebaplain and secretary to the Honourable Mr Stuart Mackenzie, the English minister at the court of Turin, and left England in the month of October 1758. In 1760, when Mr Mackenzie returned to England, the secretary remained at Turin as charge d’affaires. Dutens came to England in 1762, and attached himself to the family of Lord Bute, who, before he retired from office in 1763, procured him a pension. He again went to Turin as chargé d’affaires, and during this second mission he undertook the task of collecting and publishing a complete edition of the works of Leibnitz, and wrote his work on the Discoveries of the Ancients. He afterwards quitted Turin, returned to Britain, and attached himself to the Duke of Northumberland, who procured him a living in the north of England. He accompanied the duke’s son, Lord Algernon Percy, in his travels through France, Italy, Germany, and Holland; and while at Paris, he was chosen a member of the Aeademy of Inscriptions. In 1776 he returned to England, and soon afterwards accompanied Mr Mackenzie and his lady on a tour to Naples. On his return he was invited by Lord Mountstuart, who had been appointed envoy extraordinary, to accompany him to Turin, and Dutens found himself for the third time chargé d’affaires at that court, during a short absence of the envoy. From Turin, which he left on account of some unpleasant circumstances, he went to Florence, and thence to Rome. He was in Paris in 1783, and returned to London the following year. The revenue lie derived from his living of Elsdon, amounting to L.800 per annum, together with a considerable legacy left him by Mr Mackenzie, and estimated at L. 15,000, enabled him to pass the remainder of his life in affluence, and in the best company. He died at his house, Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, on the 23d of May 1812.

Dutens was the editor of the works of Leibnitz, published at Geneva, 1769, in 6 vols. 4to; of the Greek pastoral romance of Daphnis and Chloe, by Longus, 1776, 12mo, and of Daeier’s translation of the Manual of Epictetus, 1775, 18mo.

The two first volumes contain the life of the author, written in a romantic style; the third bears the title of Dutensiana, and is filled with remarks, anecdotes, bon mots, and so forth. Dutens is the author of the Catalogue of Medals in Swinburne’s Travels, and of the French text to the second volume of the Marlborough Gems. There is a Memoir of his in the Collection of the Academy of Inscriptions, and he also published a small tract on the Iron Mash. He was a member of the Royal Society of London, and had the title of historiographer to the king.
