DOAB. This term in Hindustan means any tract of country included between two rivers. It should properly include all the territory between the Jumna and the Ganges; but it is usually restricted to the southern portion of it, for the most part comprehended in the province of Agra. This country is of a fertile soil, and yields a large return to the cultivator. It produces mullet, sugar cane, and barley, and is peculiarly adapted for indigo, which grows here in a wild state. Tobacco has also been introduced by the Europeans, and thrives well. The climate during the rainy season is exceedingly hot, and during the winter is only cool in the morning. The country was once in a high state of cultivation; and the remains of former prosperity arc everywhere seen amidst the extensive wastes and jungles which now occupy a large portion of the surface. The tranquillity which it has enjoyed under the dominion of the British is highly favourable toits improvement. By a treaty concluded with Scindia in 1803, the forts and territories of the Doab between the Jumna and the Ganges were ceded to the British ∙, and the southern part of the Doab was ceded in 1801 by the reigning nabob.
