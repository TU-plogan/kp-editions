DIJON, an arrondissement of the department of Côte d’Or, in France, which extends over 1190 square miles. It is divided into fourteen cantons and 270 communes, and contains 124,034 inhabitants. The chief place is the city of the same name, the seat of a bishop, and of the several boards which conduct the internal, legal, political, and military affairs of the department. It is situated in a fine plain, watered by the river Ouche, and surrounded on all sides by picturesque hills, inclosing fertile meadows and corn fields. It is a well-built city, with straight and wide streets, and many magnificent buildings, but especially the palace of the ancient sovereigns of Burgundy. There is an academy and public library, and several learned establishments. The houses are 2900, and the inhabitants amounted in 1810 to 21,612; but they have since increased.
