DIAPHR AG2*I (Diaphragma), in Anatomy, a part vulgarly called the midriftļ and by anatomists septum trans- [7:8:8]versum. It is a strong muscular substance, separating the breast or thorax from the abdomen or lower venter, and serving as a partition between the abdominal and the thoracic viscera. (See Anatomy, Index.') Plato, as Galen informs us, first called it diaphragm, from the verb ð/a-pgarrε∕∣∕, to separate. Till his time it had been called pgs∣∕ες, from a notion that an inflammation of this part produced frenzy, which is not more warranted by experience than another tradition, that a transverse section of the diaphragm with a sword causes the patient to die laughing.
