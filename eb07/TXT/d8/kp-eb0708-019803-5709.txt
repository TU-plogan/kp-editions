DREVET, Peter, the younger, an eminent French engraver, was a member of the royal academy of painting and sculpture, and died at Paris in 1739, at the age of forty-two. His portraits are neat and elegant, but laboured to the last degree. He particularly excelled in representing lace, silk, fur, velvet, and other ornamental parts of dress. But the younger Drevet did not confine himself to portraits. We have several historical prints by him, which in point of neatness and exquisite workmanship are scarcely to be equalled. His most esteemed and best historical print is very valuable; but the first impressions of it are rarely to be met with. It is The Presentation of Christ in the Temple; a very large plate, lengthwise, from Luigi de Bologna. Among his portraits, the two held in the highest estimation are, that of Bossuet, bishop of Meaux, a whole length figure standing, a middling sized upright plate, from Rigaud; and that of Samuel Bernard, a whole length figure sitting in a chair, a large upright plate. The first impressions of the last are before the words Conseiller dEtat were inserted upon the plate.
