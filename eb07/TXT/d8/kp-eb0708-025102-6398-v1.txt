DUCTILITY, in Physics, a property possessed by certain solid bodies; it consists in their yielding to percussion or pressure, and receiving different forms, without breaking.

Some bodies are ductile both when they are hot and when they are cold, indeed in all circumstances. Such are metals, particularly gold and silver. Other bodies arc ductile only when heated to a sufficient degree; such as wax and other substances of that kind, and glass. Other bodies, again, particularly some kinds of iron, called by the workmen red short, brass, and some other metallic mixtures, are ductile only when cold, and brittle when hot. The degrees of heat requisite to produce ductility in bodies of the first kind, vary according to their different natures. In general the heat of the body must be such as is sufficient to reduce it to a middle state, betwixt solidity and perfect fusion. As wax, for instance, is fusible with a very small heat, it may be rendered ductile by a still smaller; and glass, which requires a most violent heat for its perfect fusion, cannot acquire its greatest ductility until it is made perfectly red hot, and almost ready to fuse. Lastly, some bodies are made ductile by the absorption of a fluid. Such are certain earths, particularly clay. When these earths have absorbed a sufficient quantity of water to bring them into a middle state betwixt solidity and fluidity, that is, to the consistence of a considerably firm paste, they have then acquired their greatest ductility. Water has precisely the same effect upon them in this respect that fire has upon the bodies above mentioned.
