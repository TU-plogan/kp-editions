DUCENARIUS, in Antiquity, an officer in the Roman army, who had the command of two thousand men. The emperors had also ducenarii among their procurators or intendants, called procuratores ducenarii. Some say that Ducenarii were those whose salary was two hundred sesterces; as in the games of the circus, horses hired for two hundred sesterces were called ducenarii. Others hold that ducenarii were those who levied the two hundredth penny, or the officers appointed to inspect the raising of that tribute. In the inscriptions at Palmyra, the word ducenarius, in Greek Ã´ouzsvag/o;, occurs very frequently.
