DUPPA, Brian, a learned English bishop, was born in 1589, at Lewisham, in Kent, of which place his father was then vicar. In 1634 he was constituted chancellor of the church at Sarum, and soon afterwards made chaplain to Charles I. He was appointed tutor to Charles prince of Wales, and his brother James duke of York; and about the same time nominated to the bishopric of Chichester. In 1641 he was translated to the see of Salisbury, but received no benefit from this preferment, owing to the suppression of episcopacy. Charles I. held him in high esteem, and is said to have derived assistance from him in composing the E∕κ,ωv Bα<r∕λ∕κη. After the restoration he was made bishop of Winchester, and lord high almoner. He died at Richmond in 1662, aged seventy-three.
