DONNE, Dr John, a poet and divine, was born in the eity of London in 1753. His parents were of the Catholic religion, and used their utmost efforts to keep him firm in the same persuasion; but an early examination of the controversy between the church of Rome and the Protestants determined him to adhere to the creed of the latter. He travelled into Italy and Spain, where he made many useful observations, and learned the languages of both countries to perfection. Soon after his return to England, Sir Thomas Egerton, keeper of the great seal, appointed him his secretary, and in this post he continued during five years. He married privately Anne, the daughter of Sir George Moore, then chancellor of the garter, and niece to the lord keeper’s lady, in consequence of which he was dismissed from his place and thrown into prison. But he was afterwards reconciled to Sir George by the good offices of Sir Francis Wooley. In 1612 he accompanied Sir Robert Drury to Paris. During this time many of the nobility solicited the king to give him some seeular employment. But his majesty, who took pleasure in his conversation, had engaged him in writing his Pseudo-Aĩariyr, printed at London in 1610; and he was so highly pleased with that work, that, in 1614, having prevailed on the author to enter into holy orders, he appointed him one of his chaplains, and procured him the degree of doctor of divinity from the university of Oxford. In 1619 Dr Donne attended the Earl of Doneaster in his embassy into Germany. In 1621 he was made dean of St Paul’s; and the viearage of St Dunstan in the West soon afterwards fell to him. Besides the above work, he wrote, 1. Devotions upon emergent Oeeasions; 2. The Ancient History of the Septuagint, translated from the Greek of Aristeas, 1633, in 12mo; 3. Three volumes of Sermons, 1640, 1649, 1660, folio; 4. A considerable number of Poems; and other works.

Donne’s writings show him to have been a man of wit and learning; but his greatest excellence consisted in satire. Lord Falkland, no mean judge, styles him one of the most witty and most eloquent of modern divines. His reputation as a poet was higher in his own time than it has been since. Dryden, with his usual judgment and discrimination, characterises him as “the greatest wit, though not the best poet, of our own nation and adds, that “he affects metaphysies, not only in his satires, but in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign, and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them with the softnesses of love.” Donne’s numbers, if they may be so ealled, are certainly the most rugged and uncouth of any of our poets; yet he was certainly not ignorant nor unskilled in the higher attributes of style, for he wrote elegantly in Latin, and displays considerable taste in some of’ his smaller pieces and epigrams.
