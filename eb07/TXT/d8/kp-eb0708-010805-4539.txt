DOMINUS, in ancient times, a title prefixed to a name, usually to denote that the person was either a knight ora clergyman. The title was sometimes also given to a gentleman not dubbed, especially if he were lord of a manor. In Holland the title dominus is still retained, to distinguish a minister of the reformed church.
