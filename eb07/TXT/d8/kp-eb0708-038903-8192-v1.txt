DYSART, a royal burgh of Scotland, in the county of Fife, is situated on the coast of the Frith of Forth, about a mile to the eastward of Kirkaldy. It consists of three narrow streets, with a species of square in the centre. In the principal street there are a number of antique houses, the fronts of which are generally decorated with inscriptions and dates. Formerly this town enjoyed a considerable trade, and on this account was ennobled with the popular name of “Little Holland.” The state of trade now, however, is far from corresponding with that ambitious title. The principal article manufactured is salt, which, together with coal, is exported in quantities. The weaving of checks, ticks, and similar fabrics, is also carried on, and affords employment to a number of the inhabitants. The harbour of the town is tolerably good. Dysart was erected into a royal burgh in the beginning of the sixteenth century, and is at present governed by two bailies, a treasurer, and twenty-two councillors. Besides the parish church, there is a congregation connected with the Relief body. The town possesses a news-room and a mechanics’ institution. The population of the burgh and parish amounted in 1821 to 6529, and in 1831 to 7104.
