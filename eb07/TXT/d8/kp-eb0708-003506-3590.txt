DIONYSIUS I. from a private secretary became general and tyrant of Syracuse and all Sicily. He was likewise a poet; and having, by bribes, gained the tragic prize at Athens, he indulged himself so immoderately 7 at table from excess of joy, that he died of the debauch, 368 B. c.; but some authors assert that he was poisoned by his physicians.

Dionysius II. his son and successor, was a greater tyrant than his father. His subjects were obliged to apply [7:8:36]to the Corinthians for succour; and Timoleon, their general, having conquered the tyrant, forced him to flee to Corinth, where, it is said, he was.obliged to keep a school for his subsistence. He died 343 b. c. Dionysius Halicarnassensis, a celebrated historian, and one of the most judicious critics of antiquity, was born at Halicarnassus. After the battle of Actium he went to Rome, where he staid twenty-two years under the reign of Augustus, and there composed in Greek his History of the Roman Antiquities, in twenty books, of which the first eleven only are now remaining. There are also still extant several of his critical works. The best edition of the works of this author is that of Dr Hudson, Oxford, 1704, in Greek and Latin, 2 vols folio. It has been reprinted more correctly, with notes by Reiske, Leipzig, 1774-1777, in six vols. 8vo.

Dionysius, a learned geographer, to whom is attributed a Periegesis, or Survey of the Earth, in Greek verse. Some suppose that he lived in the time of Augustus; but Scaliger and Salmasius place him under the reign of Severus, or of Marcus Aurelius. He wrote many other works, but his Periegesis is the only one we have remaining, the best and most useful edition of which is that improved with notes and illustrations by Hill. „

Dionysius Areopagita was born at Athens, and educated there. He went afterwards to Heliopolis, in Egypt, where, if we may credit some writers of his life, he beheld that wonderful eclipse which happened at our Saviour’s passion, and was urged by some extraordinary impulse to cry out, Aut Deus patitur, aut cum patiente dolet, either God himself suffers, or sympathises with him who does. At his return to Athens he was elected into the court of Areopagus, from which circumstance he derived his name of Areopagite. About the year 50 he embraced Christianity; and, as some say, was appointed first bishop of Athens by St Paul. Of his conversion we have an account in the 17th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. He is supposed to have suffered martyrdom, but whether under Domitian, Trajan, or Hadrian, is not certain. We have nothing remaining under his name except what there is every reason to believe spurious.

Dionysius the Lesser, a Scythian, who became abbot of a monastery at Rome. He was the first who computed time from the birth of Dionysius to Christ, and fixed that great event according to the vulgar era. He was also a learned canon law writer, and died about the year 540.
