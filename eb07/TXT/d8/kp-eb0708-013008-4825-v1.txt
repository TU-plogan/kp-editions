DOVER, a sea-port in the hundred of Bensborough, in the county of Kent, seventy-two miles from London. It is built at an opening between two cliffs, and the streets run in a circular form under the western hill. The old streets are narrow, but of late years many new parts have been added on the eastern shore, which arc handsome and airy. It is defended by forts and an ancient castle. The harbour has been formed by means of great labour and expense, and is dry at low water, but, when entered, safe. As the principal place by which communication with the Continent is kept up, it contains numerous inns and hotels, and the trade of the town arises in a great measure from casual visitors and travellers. Dover had formerly five churches, which are now reduced to three. It is governed by a corporation, with a mayor at the head of it. Two members are returned to parliament, formerly elected by the freemen, but now householders have also votes. There are markets on Wednesday and Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 14,845, including the liberty, in 1811 to 9074, in 1821 to 10,327 in the borough alone, and in 1831 to 11,924.

Dover Straits, the narrow channel between Doverand Calais, which separates our island from the opposite Continent. These celebrated straits are only twenty-one miles wide in the narrowest part. From the pier at Dover to that at Calais is twenty-four.

Dover, a post-town of New Hampshire, and capital of the county of Strafford. It is situated on the western side of the Piscataqua, and the Cochecho flows through it. This river has several large falls, which afford a considerable water power, which has much facilitated the progress of manufactures here. Dover has thus been rendered one [7:8:131] of the most flourishing towns in the state. It contains a court-house, a jail, a bank, an academy, three places of public worship, and other public buildings. The greater part of the timber exported from the state is brought to this tov¢n. Dover owns considerable shipping; it is the oldest town in the state, having been settled in the year 1623 by two Englishmen. The population amounted in 1826 to 4160. It lies sixty miles north of Boston. Long. 70.54. W. Lat. 43. 13. N.

Dover, a post-town of Delaware, in the county of Kent, and seat of the government of the state. It is situated on Jones’ Creek, seven miles above its entrance into Delaware Bay. The town is well built, chiefly of brick, and carries on a considerable trade with Philadelphia in flour. Long. 75. 30. W. Lat. 39. 10. N.
