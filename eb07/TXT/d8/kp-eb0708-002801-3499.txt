DIGIT, in Astronomy, the twelfth part of the diameter of the sun and moon, used to express the quantity of an eclipse. Thus an eclipse is said to be of six digits when six of these parts are hid.

Digits, or Monades, in Arithmetic, signify any integer under ten; as, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and by means of which all numbers are expressed.

Digit is also a measure taken from the breadth of the finger. It is properly three fourths of an inch, and contains the measure of four barleycorns laid breadthwise.
