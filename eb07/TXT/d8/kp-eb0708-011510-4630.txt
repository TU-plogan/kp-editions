DOOSHAK, a town of Persia, the capital of the province of Seistan, situated in an open country, about eight or nine miles from the river Heermund or Helmund. The modern city is small, but compact; and the ruins cover a vast extent of ground. It is populous, has a good bazar, and the inhabitants, dressed in the Persian manner, have a more civilized appearance than the other natives of Seistan, who are either Patan or Balouehe shepherds, and live a wandering life, pitching their tents amidst the ruins of ancient palaces. she neighbouring country produces wheat and barley in sufficient quantities to be exported to Herat. The pasturage is also good and abundant. This place is called also Julallabad, and is governed by an independent prince, who calls himself king of Seistan. Long. 61. 13. E. Lat. 31. 26. N.
