DULVERTON, a market-town in the hundred of Willer-ton and Freemanners, in the county of Somerset, 168 miles from London. The town is well built, and clean, having two streams of water running through it. It was formerly a manufacturing town for coarse woollen goods, but the trade has greatly declined. The market is held on Saturday[7:8:258]. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1049, in 1811 to 1035, in 1821 to 1127, and in 1831 to 1285.
