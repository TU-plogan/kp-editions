DOME, in Architecture, a spherical roof, or a roof of a spherical form, raised over the middle of a building, as a church, hall, pavilion, vestibule, staircase, or the like. See the article Arch. Dome, or Doom, signifies judgment, sentence, or decree. The homagers’ oath in the black book of Hereford ends thus: “So help me God at his holy dome, and by my trowthe.”
