DORCHESTER, a town in Oxfordshire, in the hundred of the same name, fifty-two miles from London, on the banks of the Thame. It was formerly the see of a bishop, and the cathedral, which still remains, is used as the parish church. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 777, in 1811 to 754, in 1821 to 854, and in 1831 to 866.

Dorchester, a town, the capital of the county of Dorset, 120 miles from London. It rises gradually from the banks of the Frome, and is a well-built town, formerly celebrated for its breweries of strong beer, but now with little trade, and no manufactures. It was a Roman station, and near it are an amphitheatre and two camps constructed by that nation, together with the remains of their wall. The assizes and elections are held here. The market is [7:8:116]held on Saturday. It returns two members to parliament, chosen by the householders and freeholders; but the adjoining parish of Fordington has now been added to it. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2402, in 1811 to 2546, in 1821 to 2743, and in 1831 to 3033.
