DILAPIDATION, in Law, a wasteful destroying, or letting buildings run to decay, for want of necessary reparation. If the clergy neglect to repair the houses belonging to their benefices, the bishop may sequester the profits thereof for that purpose; and in such cases a prosecution may be brought, either in the spiritual court or aâ€™t common law, against the incumbent himself, or against his executor or administrator.
