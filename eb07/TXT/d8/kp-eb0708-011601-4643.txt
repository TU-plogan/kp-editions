DORDOGNE, a department of France, formed out of the country of the ancient Perigord and a small part of Limousin. It is bounded on the north by Upper Vienne, on the east by Corr√®ze and Lot, on the south by Lot and Lot Garonne, on the west by the Gironde and Lower Charente, and on the north-west by the department of Charente. Its extent is 3740 square miles, or, according to the royal almanack, 898,274 hectares. Its surface consists of mountains, many small hills, and narrow valleys. The soil in general is stony, and by no means fruitful. The calcareous hills are mixed with sandy and clayey soils abounding in flints. It is well watered both by rivers and small streams, of which more than 1400 are enumerated in the statistical and topographical description of the department. The agriculture is in a backward state, the chief corn is maize, which forms the principal bread of the people; but of late the great extension of the potato culture has provided a useful substitute for bread. The chestnut woods, which are said to occupy one fifth of the surface, furnish also a large portion of the subsistence of the inhabitants. Sheep and goats are bred in considerable numbers, and large herds of swine are supported near the chestnut woods. Some districts yield a good white wine; but the whole quantity produced is inconsiderable. The chief exports consist of wine, chestnuts, wall and hazelnuts, nut oil, truffles, cattle, wool, and leather. The manufactures are few. Some iron wares are made, from mines in the department. The inhabitants amount to 4.24,113, of whom 8500 are Protestants. The language is a patois of Italian and French. The capital of the department is the city of Pcrigueux.
