DOMINICA, one of the Caribbee Islands, in the West Indies, about twenty-nine miles long and sixteen broad, situated between 61 and 62 degrees of west longitude, and between 15 and 16 of north latitude. It was so called by Columbus, from its being discovered on a Sunday. The value of this island must not be judged of merely by its productions; for its situation enabled the British, in time of war, to intercept the communication between France and her colonies. The soil is light, and adapted for the growth of coffee; the hills, from which several rivers descend, are covered with the finest wood in the West Indies; and several valuable sulphur mines have been discovered in it. Dominica, on account of its importance, has been raised to the rank of a distinct government. The staple commodities are maize, cotton, cocoa, and tobacco. In this island the black and coloured population is to the white nearly as twenty to one.

Dominica, one of the Marquesas Islands called Hi-waoa, Heevaroa, O-heeva-oa, or Ohiwana, by the natives. It is about eighteen miles in length and forty-five in circumference, being full of rugged hills rising in ridges directly from the sea, and separated by deep valleys, which, as well as the sides of the hills, are clothed with wood. It is separated by a channel two miles wide from Tuchu-ata or St Christina Island.
