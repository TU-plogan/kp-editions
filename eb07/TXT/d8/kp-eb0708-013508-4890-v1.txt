DRAGOONING, one of the methods used for converting refractory heretics, and bringing them within the pale of the true church. The following is the method of dragooning the French Protestants, after the revocation of the edict of Nantz, under Louis XIV. as described in a French work translated in 1686. “The troopers, soldiers, and dragoons, went into the Protestants’ houses, where they marred and defaced their household stuff, broke their looking glasses, and other utensils and ornaments, let their wine run about their cellars, and threw about their corn and spoiled it. And as to those things which they could not destroy in this manner, such as furniture of beds, linen, wearing apparel, plate, and the like, they carried them to the market-place, and sold them to the Jesuits and other Roman Catholics. By these means the Protestants in Montaubon alone were, in four or five, days, stripped of above a million of money. But this was not the worst. They turned the dining-rooms of gentlemen into stables for their horses; and treated the owners of the houses where they quartered with the highest indignity and cruelty, lashing them about from one to another, day and night, without intermission, not suffering them either to eat or drink; and when they began to sink under the fatigue and pains they had undergone, they laid them on a bed, and when they thought them somewhat recovered, made them rise, and repeated the same tortures. When they saw the blood and sweat run down their faces and other parts of their bodies, they sluiced them with water, and, putting over their heads kettle-drums turned upside down, they made a continual din upon them till these unhappy creatures lost their senses. When one party of these tormenters were weary, they were relieved by another, who practised the same cruelties with fresh vigour.” Such is persecution in its naked form.
