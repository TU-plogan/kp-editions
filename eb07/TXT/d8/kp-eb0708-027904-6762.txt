DUNDALK, a seaport town of Ireland, in the county of Louth, about forty miles from Dublin. It is a large and thriving town, with a wide street nearly a mile in length, and a very fine market-house near the entrance from Dublin. In the reign of Edward II. it was a royal city, the last we read of where a monarch of all Ireland was actually crowned and resided. It was formerly very strong, and had many towers and small castles in it. The bay has good moorings at all times, and from four to above eight fathoms water, with very good landmarks, either for bringing up to or making the harbour. In crossing the bar at high water, or ordinary neap tides, there is from fifteen to eighteen feet water. The manufacture of cambric was established in this town in 1737, for the first time in Ireland, and it has ever since flourished. Muslin is also made here, and corn is exported. It is the assize town of the county. The population amounts to 10,078.
