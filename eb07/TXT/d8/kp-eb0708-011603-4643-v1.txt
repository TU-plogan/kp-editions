DORIA, Andrew, a gallant Genoese sea officer, born in 1466. He entered into the service of Francis I. of France, but preserved that spirit of independence which is so natural to a sailor and a republican. When the French attempted to render Savona, long the object of jealousy to Genoa, its rival in trade, Doria remonstrated in a high tone against the measure; and this bold action, represented by the malice of the courtiers in the most odious light, irritated Francis to such a degree that he ordered his admiral Barbesieux to sail for Genoa, then in the hands of the French troops, to arrest Doria, and to seize his galleys. But Doria got a timely hint of this rash order; retired with all his galleys to a place of safety; and, whilst his resentment was warm, closed with the offers of the emperor Charles V. returned his commission with the collar of St Michael to Francis, and hoisted the imperial colours. To deliver his country, now weary alike of the French and the imperial yoke, from the dominion of foreigners, was Doria’s highest ambition; and the favourable moment had presented itself. Genoa was afflicted with the pestilence, and the French garrison being ill paid and greatly reduced, the inhabitants were sufficiently disposed to second his views. He sailed to the harbour with thirteen galleys, landed five hundred men, and made himself master of the gates and the palace with very little resistance. The French governor with his feeble garrison retired to the citadel, but was soon forced to capitulate; upon which the people ran together, and levelled the citadel with the ground. It was now in Doria’s power to have rendered himself the sovereign of his country; but, with a magnanimity of which there are few examples, he assembled the people in the court before the palace, disclaimed all preeminence, and recommended to them to settle what form of government they chose to establish. The people, animated by his spirit, forgot their factions, and fixed that form of government which, with little variation, subsisted until the year 1815. This event happened in 1528. Doria lived to a great age, respected and beloved as a private citizen; and he is still celebrated in Genoa by the most honourable of all appellations, the father of his country, and the restorer of its liberty.
