DOBSON, William, an English portrait and historical painter, born at London in 1610. He served an apprenticeship to one Peck, a stationer and picture dealer; and owed his improvement to the copying of some pictures of Titian and Vandyek, whose manner he always retained. He had further obligations to the latter of these artists; for it is said that a picture of his painting being exposed at a shop on Snow-hill, Vandyek, happening to pass by, was struek with it exceedingly, and having inquired after the author, found him at work in a poor garret. Vandyek had the generosity to equip him in a manner suitable to his merit. He presented him to King Charles I. who took him under his protection, kept him at Oxford all the time his majesty continued in thateity, and not only sat to him several times for his own picture, but caused the Prince of Wales, Prince Rupert, and indeed most of the lords of his court, to do so likewise. Mr Dobson, however, being somewhat loose and irregular in his way of life, was far from improving the many opportunities he had of making his fortune, and died very poor, in 1647, at his house in St Martinâ€™s Lane.
