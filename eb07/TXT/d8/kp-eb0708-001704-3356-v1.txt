DIESPITER, in Antiquity, a name given to Jupiter, and signifying diei pater, father of the day. St Augustin derives the name from dies, day, and partus, production or bringing forth, it being Jupiter who brings forth the day; and Servius and Macrobius were of the same opinion; the former adding, that in the language of the Osci they called him Lucencius, which means the same as Diespiter in Latin.
