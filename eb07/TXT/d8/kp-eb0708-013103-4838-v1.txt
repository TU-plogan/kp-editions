DOWLETABAD, a celebrated city and fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Aurungabad, deemed impregnable by the natives. The fort stands on the summit of a mountain, which is surrounded with several stone walls, the lowest of which incloses the town. The two lower fortifications are in this manner completely commanded by the upper. Like all the other hill forts of India, it is unhealthy, but is still considered as the key of the Deccan. This placđ, though it be remarkably strong, has been frequently taken. When the Mahommedan powers carried their arms into this part of the Deccan, about the year 1203, it was the residence of a powerful rajah, and was plundered of immense riches. In 1306 it was reduced by Mallek Naib, the emperor of Delhi’s general. In the early part of the fourteenth century, the Afghan emperor Mahommed III. attempted to render this place, as its present name implies, the “abode of prosperity,” and with this view he endeavoured to force the inhabitants of Delhi to quit their habitations and to emigrate to the Deccan; but he was unable to carry this violent scheme into effect. About the year 1595 Dowletabad surrendered to Ahmed Nizam, shah of Ahmed Muggur; and on the fall of his dynasty it was taken possession of by Mallek Amber, an Abyssinian slave. His successors reigned till 1634, when it was taken by the Moguls, and is now comprehended in the territories of the Nizam, but has much declined since the foundation of Aurungabad in its vicinity. Long. 76. 2. E. Lat. 19. 52. N. The district of Dowletabađ is situated chiefly between the 19th and 20th degrees of north latitude, and extends along the north side of the Godavery.
