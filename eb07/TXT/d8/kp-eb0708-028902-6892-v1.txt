D’URFEY, Thomas, more generally known by the familiar name of Tom d’Urfcy, an English satirist and songster, of whom, though his name was as well known as that of any writer extant, yet few particulars have been collected. Hc was born in Devonshire; but when, where, or of what family, is uncertain. He was bred to the law, which he forsook for the more agreeable employment of writing plays and songs; and the latter he had so happy a talent both of writing and singing, that he received many favours from persons of quality on that account. Even crowned heads did not disdain his company. A writer of the Guardian (No. 67), tells us, he remembered to have seen Charles II. leaning on Tom d’Urfey’s shoulder more than once, and humming over a song with him. This indeed was not extraordinary in so merry a monarch; but even the phlegmatic King William could relax the rigour of his Dutch muscles on hearing Tom sing a song. He was certainly by all accounts a cheerful, honest, good-natured man; but as this character does not include prudence, D’Urfey became poor as he grew old; and having prevailed on the managers of the playhouse to act his comedy of the Plotting Sisters for his benefit, Mr Addison wrote the above-mentioned paper in the Guardian, with another (No. 82) representing him in a good-humoured light, in order to procure him a full house. He died at an advanced age, in 1723.
