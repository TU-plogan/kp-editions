DIAMASTIGOSIS, a festival at Sparta in honour of Diana Orthia, which received that name ατo του μαΰπγονν, from whipping, because boys were whipped before the altar of the goddess. These boys, called Bomonicae, were originally free-born Spartans, but in the more delicate ages they were of mean birth, and generally of a servile origin. This operation was performed by an officer, in a severe and unfeeling manner; and, that no compassion should be raised, the priest stood near the altar with a small light statue of the goddess, which suddenly became heavy and insupportable if the lash of the whip was more lenient or less rigorous than necessary. The parents of the children attended the solemnity, and exhorted them not to commit any thing, either by fear or groans, that might be unworthy of Laconian education. These flagellations were so severe that the blood gushed profusely, and many expired under the lash, without uttering a groan or betraying any marks of fear. Such a death was reckoned very honourable; and the corpse was buried with much solemnity, with a garland of flowers on its head. The origin of this festival is unknown. Some suppose that Lycurgus first instituted it in order to inure the youth of Lacedaemon to bear labour and fatigue, and to render them insensible to pain and wounds. Others maintain that it is a mitigation of an oracle, which ordered that human blood should be shed on Diana’s altar; and, according to their opinion, Orestes first introduced this barbarous custom, after he had brought the statue of Diana Taurica into Greece. There is/another tradition which mentions that Pausanias, as he was offering up prayers and sacrifices to the gods before he engaged with Mardonius, was suddenly attacked by a number of Lydians, who disturbed the sacrifice, and were at last repelled with staves and stones, the only weapons with which the Lacedaemonians were provided at that moment. In commemoration of this, therefore, the whipping of boys was instituted at Sparta, and thereafter the Lydian procession.
