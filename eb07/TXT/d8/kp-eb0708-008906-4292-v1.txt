DODONA, a town of Thesprotia, in Epirus, or, according to others, in Thessaly, in the neighbourhood of which there was a celebrated oracle of Jupiter. The town and temple of the god were first built by Deucalion, after the universal deluge. It was supposed to be the most ancient oracle of all Greece; and, according to the traditions of the Egyptians mentioned by Herodotus, it was founded by a dove. Two black doves, as lie relates, took their flight from the city of Thebes in Egypt; one of which flew to the temple of Jupiter Ammon, and the other to Dodona, where, with a human voice, it acquainted the inhabitants of the country that Jupiter had consecrated the ground, and in future would give oracles. The extensive grove which surrounded Jupiter’s temple was endowed with the gift of prophecy; and oracles were frequently delivered by the sacred oaks, and the doves which inhabited the place. This fabulous tradition of the oracular power of the doves is explained by Herodotus, who observes that some Phoenicians carried away two priestesses from Egypt, one of which went to fix her residence at Dodona, where the oracle was established. It may further be observed, that the fable might have been founded upon the double meaning of the word rsλs∕α∕, which signifies doves in most parts of Greece, whilst in the dialect oí the Epirots it means old women. In ancient times the oracles were delivered by the murmuring of a neighbouring stream or fountain; but the custom was afterwards changed. Large kettles were suspended in the air near a brazen statue which held a lash in its hand. When the wind blew strong, the statue was agitated and struck against one of the kettles, which communicated the motion to all the rest, and raised that clattering and discordant din, ∖vhich continued for a while, and from which the artifice of the priests derived the predictions. Some suppose that the noise was occasioned by the shaking of the leaves and boughs of an old oak, which the superstition of the people frequently consulted, and from which they pretended to receive oracles. It may be supposed, with more probability, that the oraclcs were delivered by the priests, who by artfully concealing themselves behind the oaks, caused the superstitious multitude to believe that the trees were endowed with the power of prophecy. As [7:8:90] the ship Argo was built with oaks of the forest of Dodona, there were some beams which gave oracles to the Argonauts, and warned them against the approach of calamity. Within the forest of Dodona there was a stream and a fountain of cool water which had the power of lighting a torch as soon as the latter touched it. This fountain was totally dry at noon day, and was restored to its full course at midnight, from which time till the following noon it began to decrease, and at the usual hour was again deprived of its waters. The oracles of Dodona were generally delivered by women.
