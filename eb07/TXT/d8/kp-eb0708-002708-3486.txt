DIGGES, Leonard, an eminent mathematician in the sixteenth century, was descended from an ancient family, and born at Digges Court, in the parish of Barham in Kent, but in what year is not known. He was educated at Oxford, where he laid a good foundation of learning; and having retired from thence, he prosecuted his studies, and became an excellent mathematician, a skilful architect, and an expert surveyor of land. He composed several works, as, 1. Tectonicum, briefly showing the exact Measuring and speedy Reckoning of all manner of Lands, Squares, Timber, Stones, Steeples, &c. 1556, 4to; 2. A Geometrical Practical Treatise, named Pantometria, in three books, which he left in manuscript,but which after his death was published by his son in 1591, folio; 3. Prognostication Everlasting of right good effect, or Choice Rules to judge the weather by the Sun, Moon, and Stars, &c. in 4to, 1555, 1556, and 1564; corrected and augmented by his son, with divers general tables, and many compendious rules, in 4to, 1592. He died about the year 1574.

Digges, Thomas, only son of Leonard Digges, having received a liberal education from his tenderest years, went and studied for a time at Oxford; and by the improvement which he made there, and the subsequent instructions of his learned father, he became one of the best mathematicians of his age. When Queen Elizabeth sent some forces in order to assist the oppressed inhabitants of the Netherlands, Mr Digges was appointed their muster-master-general; by which he became well skilled in military affairs, as his writings afterwards showed. He died in 1595.

Mr Digges, besides revising, correcting, and enlarging some pieces of his father’s already mentioned, wrote and published the following learned works, viz. 1. Alee sive Scales Mathematicae, or Mathematical Wings or Ladders, 1573, 4to; 2. An Arithmetical Military Treatise, containing so much of Arithmetic as is necessary towards military discipline, 1579, 4to; 3. A Geometrical Treatise, named Stratiotico, requisite for the perfection of Soldiers, 1579, 4to, which was begun by his father, but finished by himself; 4. A perfect Description of the Celestial Orbs, according to the most ancient doctrine of the Pythagoreans, &c. placed at the end of his father’s “Prognostication Everlasting,” printed in 1592, 4to; 5. A humble motive for association to maintain the religion established, 1601, 8vo, to which is added, his Letter to the same purpose to the archbishops and bishops of England; 6. England’s Defence, or, a Treatise concerning Invasion, a tract of the same nature with that printed at the end of his Stratiotico, and called a briefe Discourse, &c. but not published till 1686; 7. A Letter printed before Dr John Dee’s Parallaticae Commentationis praxeosque nucleus quidam, 1573, 4to. Besides these and his Nova Corpora, he left several mathematical treatises ready for the press, which, by reason of law-suits and other avocations, he was prevented from publishing.
