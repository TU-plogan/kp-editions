DOXOLOGY, a hymn used in praise of the Almighty, and distinguished by the title of greater and lesser. The lesser do'xologywas anciently only a single sentence, without response, running in these words, “Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, world without end, Amen.” Part of the latter clause, “As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,” was inserted some time after the first composition. Some read this ancient hymn, “Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, with the Holy Ghost ;” and others, “Glory be to the Father in or by the Son, and by the Holy Ghost.” This difference of expression occasioned no dispute in the church till the reign of the Arian heresy; but when the followers of Arius began to make use of the latter as a distinguishing character of their party, it was entirely laid aside by the Catholics, and the use of it was enough to bring any one under suspicion of heterodoxy. The doxology was used at the close of every solemn office. The western church repeated it at the end of every psalm, and the eastern church at the end of the last psalm. Many of their prayers were also concluded with it, particularly the solemn thanksgiving or consecration prayer at the eucharist. It was also the ordinary conclusion of their sermons. The greater doxology, or angelic hymn, was likewise of much consequence in the ancient church. It began with these words, which the angels sung at our Saviour’s birth, “Glory be to God on high,” &c. It was chiefly used in the communion service, and in private devotions. Both the doxologies have a place in the church of England, the former being repeated after every psalm, and the latter used in the communion service.
