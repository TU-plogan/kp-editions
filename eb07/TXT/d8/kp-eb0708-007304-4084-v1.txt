DJEBAIL, a town of Syria, situated on an eminence near the sea, two miles north of the river Ibrahim, which is crossed by a bridge of a single arch, fifty paces wide, and of light architecture. The Arabs established themselves here under the caliphate of Omar, and it is conjectured that the bridge was built by them. The crusaders in 1100 took possession of the town, which, after some vicissitudes, remained subject to them during their sway in the East. There was formerly a harbour, now almost obliterated. This town occupies the site of the ancient Biblos. The population is 6000.
