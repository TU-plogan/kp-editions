DOROHOÄ½, a circle of Moldavia, in the northernmost part of that principality, watered by the rivers Pruth, Sireth, Schiga, and Bascheu. The capital is of the same name. It is situated on the side of a lake, is a large but not compact town, and, like the other towns in Moldavia, is filthy and badly built. It contains many churches and monasteries, has a weekly market, and is the seat of the court of law for a part of the province.
