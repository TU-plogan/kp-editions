DOUBLETS, a game on dice within tables. The men, fifteen in number, are placed thus: Upon the six, cinque, and quatre points, there stand three men a piece; and upon the trey, deuce, and ace, only two. He who throws [7:8:124]highest has the benefit of throwing first, and what he throws he lays down, and so does the other; what the one throws and has not, the other lays down for him, but on his own account; and thus they proceed until all the men arc down, and then they bear, as it is called. He who is firet down bears first, and will doubtless win the game if the other throws not doublets to overtake him; which he is sure to do, since he advances or bears as many as the doublets make, namely, eight for two fours.
