DIODATI, John, a famous minister, and professor of theology at Geneva, was born at Lueea in 1579, and died [7:8:34]at Geneva in 1652. He is distinguished by translations,

1. Of the Bible into Italian, with notes, Geneva, 1607, 4to. The best edition is that of Geneva in 1641, folio. This is said to be more a paraphrase than a translation, and the notes are rather divine meditations than critical reflections.

2. Of the Bible into French, Geneva, 1644; 3. Of Father Paulâ€™s History of the Council of Trent into French.
