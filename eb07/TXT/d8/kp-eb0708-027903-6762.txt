DUNCOMBE, William, younger, son of John Duncombe of Stocks, in Hertfordshire, was born in London in January 1690. He published in 1722 a translation of Racine’s Atltalie, which was well received by the public, and has gone through three editions. In 1724 he was editor of the works of Mr Needier; in 1735, of the poems of his deceased brother-in-law Mr Hughes, two vols. 12nio; in 1737, of the miscellanies of his younger brother Mr Jabez Hughes, for the benefit of his widow, in one volume 8vo; and in 1745, of the works of the Rev. Samuel Say, in one vol. 4to. In 1726 he married the only sister of Mr John Hughes, whom he long survived. In 1734 his tragedy of Lucius Junius Brutus was acted at Drury Lane Theatre. It was published in 1735, and again in 1747. The works of Horace, in English verse, by several hands, were published by him in two vols. 8vo, with notes, in 1757; and a second edition, in four vols. 12mo, with many imitations, appeared in 1762. In 1763 he collected and republished “Seven Sermons by Archbishop Herring, on public occasions, with a biographical preface.” He died in February 1769, at the age of eighty.
