DIGBY, Sir Kenelm, an English philosopher, was born atGothurst, in Buckinghamshire, in 1603, and became very illustrious for his virtue and learning. He was descended of an ancient family. His great-grandfather, accompanied by six of his brothers, fought valiantly at Bosworth Field on the side of Henry VII. against the usurper Richard III. His father, Sir Everard Digby, was engaged in the gunpowder plot against King James I., and for that crime was beheaded; but his son was restored to his estate. King Charles I. made him gentleman of the bed-chamber, commissioner of the navy, and governor of the Trinity House; and also granted him letters of reprisal against the Venetians, by virtue of which he took several prizes with a small fleet under his command. He fought the Venetians near the port of Scanderoon, and bravely made his way through their ships with his booty. He was a great lover of learning, and translated several authors into English; and his Treatise of the Nature of Eodies and the Immortality of the Soul discovers great penetration and extensive knowledge. He applied to chemistry, and found out several useful medicines, which he gave freely away to people of all sorts, especially to the poor. His sympathetic powder for the cure of wounds at a distance made a great noise for a time, but, like other absurd fancies, it soon fell into discredit. He had conferences with Descartes about the nature of the soul.

In the beginning of the civil wars he exerted himself vigorously in the king’s cause; but he was afterwards imprisoned by order of the parliament in Winchester House, and had leave to depart thence in 1643. He afterwards compounded for his estate, but was ordered to leave the nation; when he went to France, and was sent on two embassies to Pope Innocent X. from the queen, widow to Charles I., whose chancellor he then was. On the restoration of Charles II. he returned to London, where he died in 1663, at the age of sixty.

This eminent person, on account of his early talents and great proficiency in learning, was compared to the celebrated Pico de Mirandola, and accounted a prodigy of erudition. But his knowledge, though various and extensive, appeared to be greater than it really was, as he had all the powers of elocution and address to recommend it. He knew how to shine in a circle of ladies or philosophers; and was as much attended to when he spoke on the most trivial subjects, as when he conversed on the most important.
