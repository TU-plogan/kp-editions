DRELINCOURT, Charles, minister of the Calvinist church at Paris, was born in July 1595, at Sedan, where his father held a considerable office. He had all the qualifications which constitute a respectable clergyman; and though he defended the Protestant cause against the Roman Catholic religion, he was much esteemed even amongst the Catholics. He is best known in England by his Catechism and Consolations against the Fears of Death, works which have been translated, and frequently reprinted. His controversial works are numerous, and include the Jubilee, the Roman Combat, the Jesuit’s Owl, an Answer to Father Coussin, Disputes with the Bishop of Bellai, an Answer to Lamilletière, Dialogues against the Missionaries, the False Paster convicted, the False Face of Antiquity, the Pretended Nullities of the Deformation, an Answer to Prince Ernest of Hesse, an Answer to the Speech of the A rchbishop of Sens, and a Defence of Calvin. He married the daughter of a rich merchant at Paris, by whom he had sixteen children. His third son, professor· of physic at Leyden, was physician to the prince and princess of Orange before their accession to the crown of England. Bayle has given him a high character. Mr Drelincourt died in November 1660.
