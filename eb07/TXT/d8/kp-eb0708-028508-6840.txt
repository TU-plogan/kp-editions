DUPLICATE, among lawyers, denotes a copy of any deed, writing, or account. It is also used for the second [7:8:286]letters-patent granted by the Lord Chancellor in a case wherein he had done the same before. A second letter written and sent to the same party, and of the same tenor as a former one, from fear of the first miscarrying, is called a duplicate.
