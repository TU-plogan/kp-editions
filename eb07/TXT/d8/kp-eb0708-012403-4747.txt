DOUBS, a department of France, formed out of the ancient province of Franche-Comté, and the lordship of Mompelģard, to which in 1816 were added the cantons of Montbéliard and Audincourt, which were taken from the department of the Upper Rhine. It is bounded on the north by the departments of the Upper Rhine and Upper Saone, on the east and south by Switzerland, and on the west by the department of Jura. It extends over 2230 square miles, and the inhabitants amount to 242,597. The divisions are four arrondissements, and the subdivisions twenty-seven cantons and 633 communes. It is generally a mountainous country; the ranges traverse it in different directions, but none exceeds 2000 feet, and they are all of calcareous formation. Between the mountains are picturesque and fertile valleys, with the exception of which the whole department may be described as an ungrateful soil, and nearly one fifth of the surface is covered with scanty woods. The land on the hills scarcely ever brings even oats to perfect ripeness; but in some parts the pasture land is good, apd especially for the dairy; and many calves are bred for the neighbouring departments. The sheep are few, but the goats are numerous. There are some iron mines and iron works, and some small manufactures made from iron, besides articles made of wood, which comprise the industry of the district. The wine of late years has increased both in quality and in quantity. The capital is Besançon.
