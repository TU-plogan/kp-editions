DRAKENBORCH, Arnold, a celebrated scholar and editor, was a native of Utrecht, where he was born on the 1st of January 1684; and in that city he was afterwards professor of rhetoric and history, an office which he filled with great reputation. Graevius and Burmann taught him the belles lettres, and Cornelius Van Eck was his preceptor whilst he devoted his attention to the law. He succeeded Professor Burmann in the year 1716, and terminated his mortal career in 1748, in the sixty-fourth year of his age. He was an author of distinguished eminence, as his publications sufficiently evince. His dissertation entitled Disputatio philologico -historica de Praefecto urbis, in 4to, proves him to have been an able philologist, and gave flattering indications of future eminence. Its intrinsic merit caused it to be reprinted at Frankfort, in 1752, by Professor Uhl, accompanied with a life of its learned author. His next work, entitled Disputatio de officio praefectorum praetorio, was published in the year 1707; and ten years afterwards he gave to the world his edition of Silius Italicus, in seventeen books, 4to. In order to render this edition as perfect as possible, nothing was omitted; and many historical subjects were engraved for the purpose of elucidating the text, to which his own copious and learned annotations greatly contributed. But his splendid edition of Livy, with a life of that eminent historian, is that on which his fame as a scholar chiefly rests. It is entitled T. Livii Patavini historiarum ab zirbe condita libri, qui supersunt, omnes. Lugd. Batav. 1738 and 1746, 7 tom. The preface to this work is very long, and replete with erudition, giving a particular account of all the literary characters who have at different periods commented on the works of Livy. He took the edition of Gronovius as his model, because in his estimation it was the most correct; but he made many important alterations on the authority of manuscripts which it is probable Gronovius had either never seen, or not taken the pains to consult. Upon the whole, this edition of Livy is at once the most elaborate, interesting, and instructive, ever given to the world, since he has introduced into it the criticisms of Duchicr, Gronovius, Perizonius, and Sigonius, in addition to his own, which, though somewhat prolix, are certainly fraught with much literature and deep discernment.
