DOUBLING, in, the military art, is the putting of two ranks or files, of soldiers into one. Thus, when the word of command is double your ranks, the second, fourth, and sixth ranks march into the first, third, and fifth, so that the six ranks are reduced to three, and the intervals between the ranks become double what they were before.

Doubling, among hunters, is when a hare keeps in plain fields, and winds about in order to deceive the hounds.

Doubling, i n the. manege, is a term applied to a horse, who is said to double his reins, when he leaps several times together, in order to throw his rider. Thus it is said, “the ramingue doubles his reins, and makes pontlevis.”

Doubling, in navigation, the art of sailing round or passing beyond a cape or promontory, so that the cape or point of land separates the ship from her former situation, or lies between her and any distant observer.
