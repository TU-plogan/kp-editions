DUCAT, a foreign coin, either of gold or silver, struck in the dominions of a duke. The origin of ducats is referred to one Longinus, governor of Italy, who, revolting against the emperor Justin the Younger, made himself duke of Ravenna, and called himself Exarcha, that is, without lord or ruler ; and, in order to show his independence, struck pieces of money of very pure gold in his own name, and with his own stamp, which, as Procopius relates, were called ducati, ducats. After him, the first who struck ducats were the Venetians, who called them zecchi-ni, or sequins, from Zecca, the place where they were first struck. This was about the year 1280, and in the time of John Dandolo. But we have pretty good evidence that Roger king of Sicily had coined ducats as early as 1240; and Du Cange scruples not to affirm that the first ducats were struck in the duchy of Apulia in Calabria. See Money.
