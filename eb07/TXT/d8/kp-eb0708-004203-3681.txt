DISPENSARY, or Dispensatory, denotes a book containing the method of preparing the various kinds of medicines used in pharmacy. Such are those of Bauderon, Quercctan, Zweiter, Charas, Bate, Mcsue, Salmon, Lemery, Quincy, and others; but the latest and most esteemed, besides the London and Edinburgh pharmacopoeias, is the Edinburgh New Dispensatory, being an improvement upon that of Dr Lewis.

Dispensary, or Dispensatory, is likewise a magazine or office for selling medicines at prime cost to the poor. The College of Physicians maintain three of these in London; one at the College itself in Warwick Lane, another in St Peter’s Alley, Cornhill, and a third in St Martin’s Lane. Dispensaries have also been established in several of the principal towns in Scotland and England.
