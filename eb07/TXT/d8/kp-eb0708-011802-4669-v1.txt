DORING, or Daring, among sportsmen, a term used to express a method of taking larks, by means of a clapnet and a looking glass. For this sport there must be provided four sticks very straight and light, about the size of a pike; and two of these must be about four feet nine inches long, and all notched at the edges or the ends. At one end of each of these sticks there is fastened another of about a foot long on one side; and on the other side a small wooden peg about three inches long. Then four or more sticks are prepared, each of them one foot in length; and every one of these must have a chord of nine feet long fastened to it at the end. Each should be provided with a buckle for the commodious fastening on of the respective sticks when the net is to be spread. A cord must also be provided, having two branches. The one must be nine feet and a half, and the other ten feet long, with a buckle at the end of each; the rest of the cord must be twenty-four yards long. All these cords, as well the long ones as those about the sticks, must be well twisted, and of the thickness of one's little finger. The next thing to be provided is a staff four feet long, pointed at one end, and with a ball of wood at the other, for carrying these conveniences in a sack or wallet. There should also be carried a spade to level the ground where there may be any little irregularities, with two small rods, each eighteen inches long, and having a small rod fixed with a pack-thread at the larger end of one of them. To these are to be tied some pack-thread loops, in order to fasten the legs of some larks; and there must also be reels, that the birds may fly a little way up and down. When all this is done, the looking-glass is to be prepared in the following manner. Take a piece of wood about an inch and a half thick, and cut it in the form of a bow, so that there may be about nine inches space between the two ends; and let it have its full thickness at the bottom, that it may receive into it a false piece, in the five corners of which there are to be set in five pieces of looking-glass. These must be so fixed as to dart their light upwards; and the whole machine must be supported on a moveable pin, with the end of a long line fixed to it, and made in the manner of the children’s plaything called an apple and a plumstone; so that one end of the cord being carried through a hedge, the barely pulling it may set the whole machine of the glass a turning. This and the other contrivances are to be placed in the middle between the two nets. The larks fixed to the place, and termed calls, with the glittering of the looking-glasses as they twirl round in the sun, invite the other larks down; and the cord which communicates with the nets, and goes through the hedge, gives the person behind an opportunity of pulling up the nets, so as to meet over the whole, and take every thing that is between them. The places where this sort of sporting succeeds best are open fields remote from any trees and hedges, except one by way of shelter for the sportsman; and the wind should always be either in the front or back, for if it blows sidewise, it prevents the playing of the net.
