DROITWICH, a town of the hundred of Halfshire, in the county of Worcester, 118 miles from London. It is situated in a valley filled with salt springs, which, when reached, rise nearly to the surface; a circumstance supposed to proceed from a subterranean river passing through the masses of rock-salt which are excavated in Cheshire. The water from the springs is fully saturated, so that common salt will not dissolve in it. The salt is procured by evaporating the water, which yields about seven times as much salt as an equal quantity of sea water. The cheapness of coal causes an extensive making of salt, which supplies the neighbourhood. There is a canal joining the Severn, by which much salt is conveyed to Worcester, Gloucester, and Bristol, from which last city much-is exported to distant markets. It is an ancient borough, lately sending two members to parliament, but now only one. The market is held on Friday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1845, in 1811 to 2079, in 1821 to 2176, and in 1831 to 2487.
