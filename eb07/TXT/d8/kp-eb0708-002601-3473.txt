DIEU et mon Droit, God and my Eight, the motto of the royal arms of England, first assumed by King Richard I. to intimate that he did not hold his empire in vassalage of any mortal. It was afterwards assumed by Edward III. and was continued without interruption to the time of King William, who used the motto Je maintiendray, though the former was still retained upon the great seal. After him Queen Anne used the motto Semper eadem, which had been before used by Queen Elizabeth; but ever since the time of Queen Anne, Dieu et mon Droit continues to be the royal motto.
