DUMBLANE, a town of Scotland, in the south-western portion of Perthshire. It is delightfully situated on the eastern bank of the river Allan, at the distance of forty-one[7:8:261] miles from Edinburgh. In the middle ages this place was distinguished as being the seat of a convent of Culdees, and continued to be so till about the twelfth century. Dumblane was constituted the seat of a bishop by David I. Amongst those who, subsequently to the reformation, filled the chair, was the celebrated philanthropist Robert Leighton, who bequeathed his valuable library to the cathedral and diocese. It is still in existence, and has been augmented by several donations. Dumblane is at present only a village, consisting of a single street of an old-fashioned character, with various diverging lanes. A mineral well in the neighbourhood causes an influx of visitors during the summer months. The chief attraction of Dumblane is what was once the cathedral of the bishop, the choir of which is now the parish church. It is a large Gothic edifice, with a steeple of modern erection of 128 feet in height. Besides the parish church, there is a dissenting meeting-house. There is here a weekly market, and there are also four annual fairs. The population of the town and parish amounted in 1821 to 3135, and in 1831 to 3228.
