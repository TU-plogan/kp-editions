DUCHAL, James, D. D. a pious and learned dissenting minister, was born in Ireland, and finished his studies at the university of Glasgow, which afterwards, from a regard to his merit, conferred on him the degree of doctor of divinity. He resided ten or eleven years at Cambridge as the pastor of a small congregation, and there enjoyed his beloved retirement, with the advantage of books and of learned conversation, which he improved with the greatest diligence. On Mr Abernethy’s removal from Antrim he succeeded him there, and on that gentleman’s death he again succeeded him as a minister of a dissenting meeting-house in Wood Street, Dublin. In this situation he continued till his death, which happened on the 4th of May 1761, when he had completed his sixty-fourth year. He published a volume of excellent discourses on the presumptive arguments in favour of the Christian religion, together with many occasional tracts; and after his death a number of his sermons were published, in three volumes 8vo.
