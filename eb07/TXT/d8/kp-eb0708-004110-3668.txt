DISGUISE, a counterfeit habit. Persons doing unlawful acts in disguise are by our statutes sometimes subjected to severe penalties, and even declared felons. Thus, by an act commonly called the black act, persons appearing disguised and armed in a forest or grounds enclosed, or hunting deer, or robbing a warren or a fish-pond, are declared felons.
