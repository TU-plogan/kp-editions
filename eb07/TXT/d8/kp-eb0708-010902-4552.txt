DON, or Tanais, a river of Russia, which takes its rise from the small lake of St John, near Tula, in the government of Moscow, and passing through part of the province of Voronetz, a small portion of the Ukraina-Slobodskaia, and the whole province of Azof, divides itself near Tscherkask into three streams, and falls in these separate branches into the Sea of Azof. This river has so many windings, is in many parts so shallow, and abounds with such numerous shoals, as to be scarcely navigable, excepting in the spring, upon the melting of the snows; and its mouth is also so choked up with sand that only flat-bottomed vessels, excepting in the same season, can pass into the Sea of Azof. The banks of the Don, and of the rivulets which fall into it, are clothed with large tracts of forest, the timber of which is floated down the stream to St Demetri and Rost of, where the frigates for the Sea of Azof are chiefly constructed. The navigation of the Don, Mr Cox observes, may possibly hereafter be rendered highly valuable, by conveying to the Black Sea the iron of Siberia, the Chinese goods, and the Persian merchandise; which latter commodities, as well as the products of India, formerly found their way into Europe through this same channel.

Don is also the name of a river in Scotland, which is noticed under the article Aberdeen. Don Kossachs, land of, a province of Russia in Europe, taking its name from the river anciently called the Tanais, which passes through it, and falls into the Sea of Azof. It extends from 46. 7. to 51 .4. north latitude, and from 37. 15. to 44. 34. east longitude, and contains 79,442 square miles, or 50,842,000 English acres, being nearly equal to England and Scotland. The whole district is a plain, except on the south-east part, where a low range ofhills, a continuation of the Caucasian range, extends into the steppes. The soil is dry, consisting for the most part of a sandy clay; but near the rivers it is highly fertile. The grass on the land is not thick, and the herds of cattle require a large space to feed upon. Besides the Don, it has some streams which mostly empty themselves into that river, but in summer they are nearly dry. Agriculture is but little pursued, and the corn raised is barely sufficient for the consumption. The breeding of cattle, especially of horses, is the chief occupation. Even the common Kos-sacks have from ten to a hundred horses, and many of the richer class from five hundred to a thousand. The fishing on the rivers and lakes is the branch of industry next in importance to the breeding of cattle. By a census taken in 1796, the inhabitants were 366,247: they are known to have increased since, and were estimated in 1827 as amounting to at least 500,000. The feudal system prevails, the land is held by military tenure, and every man is a soldier. The country is divided into seven circles. The chief city is Tscherkask, situated on an arm of the Don, and said to contain about 15,000 inhabitants.
