DIFFERENTIAL, in the higher geometry, an infinitely small quantity, or a particle of quantity so small as to be less than any assignable one. It is called a differential, or differential quantity, because frequently considered as the difference of two quantities; and, as such, it is the foundation of differential calculus. Sir Isaac Newton and the English call it a moment, from its being considered as the momentary increase of quantity. See Fluxions. Differential Equation is an equation involving or containing differential quantities, as the equation 3 x i dx — 2 axdx + aydx + axdy — 0. Some mathematicians have also applied the term differential equation in another sense, to certain equations defining the nature of facts.

Differential Calculus, or Method, a method of finding quantities by means of their successive differences. See Fluxions.
