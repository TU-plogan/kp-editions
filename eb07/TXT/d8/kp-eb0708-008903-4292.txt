DODDRIDGE, Philip, D.D. an eminent Presbyterian minister, was the son of Daniel Doddridge, an oilman in London, where he was born on the 26th of June 1702. Having completed the study of the classics in several schools, he was in 1719 placed under the tuition of the Reverend John Jennings, who kept an academy at Kilworth, in Leicestershire. He was first settled as a minister at Kilworth, where he preached to a small congregation in an obscure village; but, on the death of Mr Jennings, he succeeded to the charge of his academy; and soon afterwards he was chosen minister of a large congregation of Dissenters at Northampton, to which he removed his academy, and where the number of his pupils increased.: He instructed his pupils with the freedom and tenderness of a father; and never expected nor desired that they should blindly follow his sentiments, but encouraged them to judge for themselves. He checked any appearance of bigotry and uncharitableness, and endeavoured to cure them by showing what might be said in defence of those principles which they disliked. He died at Lisbon, whither he had gone for the recovery of his health; and his remains were interred in the burying-ground belonging to the British factory there. A handsome monument was erected to his memory in the meeting-house at Northampton, at the expense of the congregation, on which there is an epitaph written by Gilbert West, Esq. He wrote, 1. Free Thoughts on the most probable means of reviving the Dissenting Interest; 2. The Life of Colonel James Gardiner ; 3. Sermons on the Education of Children ; 4. The Pise and Progress of Religion in the Soul ; 5. The Family Expositor, in 6 vols. 4to; and other works. Since the authorâ€™s death, a volume of his hymns has been published, and his Theological Lectures. Several of his works have been translated into Dutch, German, and French.
