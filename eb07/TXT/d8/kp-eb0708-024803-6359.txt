DUBOS, Jean-Baptiste, an eminent French author, was born at Beauvais in December 1670. At first he applied himself to theology, but soon renounced this pursuit for the study of public law, and of the political interests of Europe. Μ. de Torcy, when minister of foreign affairs, employed him with advantage in several secret negociations; and both the regent and Cardinal Dubos made the same use of his talents, with the same success. Having retired from the field of politics, he entered upon that of history and literature; and, in 1720, his works opened to him the doors of the French academy, of which, in 1722, he was appointed perpetual secretary, in the room of Μ. Dacier. He died at Paris on the 23d of March 1742, at the age of seventy-two, repeating as he expired the well-known remark of an ancient, “Death is a law, not a punishment.” According to Dubos, “there are three things which ought to console us for parting with life; the friends whom we have lost, the few persons worthy of being loved whom we leave behind, and lastly, the recollection of our follies, with the certainty that we shall commit no more." His first work was E Histoire des quatre Gordiens, prouvée et illustrée par des Médailles, Paris, 1695, 12mo. The common opinion, which only admits three emperors of this name, has prevailed in spite of all the efforts of his erudition and criticism. About the commencement of the war [7:8:249]of 1701, being charged with different negociations both in Holland and in England, in order if possible to engage these powers to adopt a pacific line of policy, he, in order to promote the objects of his mission, published a work entitled Tes Intérêts de l’ Angleterre mal entendus dans la Guerre présente, Amsterdam, 1703, 12mo. But as this work contained indiscreet disclosures, of which the enemy took advantage, and predictions which were not fulfilled, a wag took occasion to remark that the title ought to be read thus: Les Interets de l’ Angleterre mal entendus par ιΑbbe Dubos. His next work was L’ Histoire de la Ligue de Cambray, Paris, 1709, 1728, and 1785, 2 vols. 12mo. This history, says Voltaire, is profound, political, interesting; it makes us acquainted with the manners and usages of the time, and is a model of its kind. In 1734 he published his Histoire Critique de l’ etablissement de la Monarchie Française dans les Gaules, 3 vols. 4to; a work the object of which was to prove that the Francs had entered the Gauls, not as conquerors, but at the request of the nation, which, according to him, had called them in to govern it. But this system, though unfolded with a degree of skill and ability which at first procured it many zealous partizans, was victoriously refuted by Montesquieu at the end of the thirtieth book of the Esprit des Lois. “C’est un colosse,” said Montesquieu, “qui a de pieds d’argile, et c’est parce que les pieds sont d’argile que le colosse est immense. Si le système de Μ. l’Abbé Dubos avait eu de bons fondemens, il n’aurait pas été obligé de faire trois mortels volumes pour le prouver; il aurait tout trouvé dans son sujet; et sans aller chercher de toutes parts ce qui en était très loin, la raison elle-même se serait chargée de placer cette vérité dans la chaine des autres vérités. L’histoire et nos lois lui auraient dit: ‘ Ne prenez pas tant de peine; nous rendrons témoignage de vous.’” His Réflexions critiques sur la Poésie et sur la Peinture, published for the first time in 1719, 2 vols. 12mo, but often reprinted in three volumes, constitute one of the works in which the theory of the arts is explained with the utmost sagacity and discrimination. “All artists,” says Voltaire, “read it with advantage. It is the most useful book which has ever been written on the subjects of which it treats, in any nation of Europe. The excellence of the work consists in this, that it contains few errors, and many reflections which are just, novel, and profound. It is not a methodical book; but the author thinks, and makes others think. He was, however, ignorant of music; he had never been able to make verses, and he had not a single picture in his possession; but he had read, seen, heard, and reflected much.” Besides the works above enumerated, a manifesto of Maximilian, elector of Bavaria, against Leopold, emperor of Germany, relative to the succession in Spain, has been attributed to Dubos, chiefly, we believe, by reason of the excellence of the style, which has been greatly commended.
