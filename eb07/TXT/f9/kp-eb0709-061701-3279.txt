FLEAM, in Surgery and Farriery, an instrument for letting blood of a man or horse. A case of fleams, as it is called by farriers, comprehends six sorts of instruments; two hooked ones, called drawers, which are used for cleansing wounds; a pen-knife; a sharp-pointed lancet for making incisions; and two fleams, one sharp and the other broad pointed. These last are somewhat like the point of a lancet, fixed in a flat handle, and no longer than is just necessary to open the vein.
