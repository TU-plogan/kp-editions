FORT ST DAVID, a town of Hindustan, on the seacoast of the Carnatic, situated on the river Tripapolore. Three rivers of considerable size all fall into the sea in the space of four miles within the bounds of Fort St David. The Panaur is about 1800 yards to the north of the Tripapolore, and the two streams communicate by a canal which runs parallel to the margin of the sea, from which it is distant about 1000 yards. Fort St David stands in the angle formed by the junction of the canal with the Tripapolore, which passes close to the site of the fort, and then sends to the south an arm that joins at no great distance the river of Bandapollam, where both in one channel continue along the eastern side of Cuddalore, separated from the sea by a mound of sand. This factory was first established in the year 1691. After the capture of Madras by the French in 1746, the English were besieged here without success; and from this period it continued the head of the English settlements till 1758, when it was taken by Lally, after a short siege, and the fortifications destroyed. It is 100 miles south-south-west from Madras, and 15 southsouth-west from Pondicherry. Long. 79. 57. E. Lat. 11. 46. N.
