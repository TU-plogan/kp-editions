FACTION, a cabal or party formed in a state, city, or company.

Faction, in Antiquity, a name given to the different companies of combatants in the circus. They were four in all; the white, the red, the green, and the blue, to which Domitian added another of purple colour. They were so denominated from the colour of the liveries they wore, and were dedicated to the four seasons of the year; the green being consecrated to spring, the blue to winter, the red to summer, and the white to autumn. It appears rom ancient inscriptions, that each faction had its procurators and physician; and that party rage ran so high amongst them, that in a dissension between two factions, Î¹n the time of Justinian, nearly forty thousand men lost their lives.
