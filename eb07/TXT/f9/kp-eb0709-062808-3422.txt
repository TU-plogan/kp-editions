FLOTSON, or Flotsom. Goods which by shipwreck are lost, and floating upon the sea, are, with jetsom and ligan, generally given to the lord admiral. But this is the case only where the owners of such goods are not known. It is also to be observed Ãœiatjetsom signifies any thing which is cast out of a ship when in danger, and afterwards beat on the shore by the water, notwithstanding which the ship perishes. Ligan is where heavy goods are thrown overboard, before the wreck of the ship, and sink to the bottom of the sea.
