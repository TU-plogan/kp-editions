FORMING is used for the act of giving being or birth to any thing. The word is also simply used for giving figure to any thing. The potter forms his vessels as he pleases. Geometry teaches how to form all kinds of figures.

Forming of a Siege, is the making lines of circumvallation, to fortify the camp, and disposing things for the attack of a place in form.

Forming the Line, is drawing up infantry, cavalry, and artillery, in order of battle.

Forming is also used in grammar, in speaking of certain tenses of verbs, which are made from others by a change of certain letters. The present tense is formed from the infinitive. Compound and derivative words, also, and even all that have any etymology, are said to be formed.
