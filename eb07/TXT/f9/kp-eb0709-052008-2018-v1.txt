FERRARS, George, was descended from an ancient family in Hertfordshire, and born about the year 1510, at a village near St Alban’s. He was educated at Oxford, and thence removed to Lincoln’s Inn, where, having applied with uncommon diligence to the study of the law, he soon became distinguished for his elocution at the bar. Cromwell, earl of Essex, the great minister of Henry VIII. introduced him ⅛o the king, who employed him as his menial servant, and in 1535 gave him a grant of the manor of Flamstead, in his native county. This is supposed to have been a profitable estate; but Mr Ferrars being a gay courtier, and probably an expensive man, about seven years afterwards he was taken on execution by a sheriff’s officer, for a debt of two hundred merks, and lodged in the compter. Being at this time member for Plymouth, the House of Commons immediately interfered, and he soon obtained his liberty. He continued in favour with the king till the end of his reign; and in that of Edward VI. he attended the lord protector Somerset as a commissioner of the army, in his expedition to Scotland in 1548. In the same reign, the young king being then at Greenwich, Mr Ferrars was proclaimed Lord of Misrule, that is, prince of sports and pastimes; which office he discharged during twelve days, in Christmas holidays, to the entire satisfaction of the court. This is all that is known of Mr Ferrars, excepting that he died in 1579, at Flamstead in Hertfordshire, and was buried in the parish church. He was not less celebrated for his valour in the field than for his accomplishments as a gentleman and a scholar, and he wrote, 1. History of the Reign of Queen Mary, published in Grafton’s Chronicle, 1569, fol.; and, 2. Six tragedies, or dramatic poems, published in a book called the Mirror for Magistrates, first printed in 1559, afterwards in 1587, and again in 1610.
