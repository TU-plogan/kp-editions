FERROL, a city of Spain, in the province of Gallicia. It is one of the most important of the naval arsenals of the kingdom. Its harbour is deep, capacious, and secure; and the entrance so narrow that not more than one ship at a time can enter. From the mouth being so narrow, it is exposed to the inconvenience of not admitting the entrance or departure of vessels, but with a wind blowing from one particular point. The dock-yard is supplied with ship timber from the Asturias, and with hemp and flax from Aragon; and cordage and sail-cloth are manufactured in the royal workshops. The dry-docks for building and repairing ships in the suburb called Esteyro, are well constructed. Ã‚t Neda, near the city, a building was lately erected, upon a large scale, for rolling copper into sheets for the bottoms of ships, and for preparing the other works required for coppering ships. The harbour, as well as the city, is very strongly fortified; but some heights are said so to command them as to render the defences of little importance. The population of the city and suburbs amount to about 20,000, most of whom are subsisted by the wages of the arsenal. Long. 7. 4L 14. W. Lat. 43. 29. 30. N.
