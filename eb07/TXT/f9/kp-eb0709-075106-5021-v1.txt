FORRES, a royal burgh of Scotland, in the county of Moray. It stands on a rising ground, at the distance of three miles from the mouth of the Findhorn, and is neat and well built. The trade carried on here is not very extensive; amongst other articles, straw plait for bonnets is manufactured. In this town there is a fine stone building, called Anderson’s Institution, which was founded in 1824. Here the youth of Forres, Rafford, and Kinloss, are taught the classics, mathematics, natural philosophy, and other branches of education. Besides this academy there are several private schools in Forres; and a news-room, a subscription library, and various friendly societies. The places of worship are the parish church, a meeting-house of the United Secession church, and another of the Independents. At the western extremity of the town is an eminence on which stood the castle of Forres. This is an object of curiosity; for here Duffus, one of the early kings of Scotland, was killed by Donwald, governor of the castle. The river Findhorn runs immediately behind the eminence. At this place a very handsome bridge was swept away by the great flood of August 1829, which will be noticed in the article Morayshire. Forres is noted for the possession of one of the most remarkable ancient stone obelisks to be found in Britain. It is thus described by Mr Cordiner, in a letter to Mr Pennant: “In the first division, underneath the Gothic ornaments at the top, are nine horses with their riders marching forth in order. In the next is a line of warriors on foot, brandishing their weapons, and appear to be shouting for the battle. The import of the attitudes in the third division is very dubious, their expression indefinite. The figures which form a square in the middle of the column are pretty complex, but distinct; four seŗjeants with their halberts guard a canopy, under which are placed several human heads which have belonged to the dead bodies piled up at the left of the division; one appears in the character of executioner severing the head from another body; behind him are three trumpeters sounding their trumpets, and before him two pair of combatants fighting with sword and target. A troop of horse next appears, put to flight by infantry, whose first line have bows and arrows, the three following swords and targets. In the lowermost division now visible, the horses seem to be seized by the victorious party, their riders beheaded, and the head of their chief hung in chains or placed in a frame; the others being thrown together beside the dead bodies under an arched cover. The greatest part of the other side of the obelisk, occupied by a sumptuous cross, is covered over with an uniform figure, elaborately raised, and interwoven with great mathematical exactness. Under the cross are two august personages, with some attendants, much obliterated, but evidently in an attitude of reconciliation; and if the monument was erected in memory of the peace concluded between Malcolm and Canute, upon the final retreat of the Danes, these large figures may represent the reconciled monarchs. On the edge below the fretwork are some rows of figures joined hand in hand, which may also imply the new degree of confidence and security which took place, after the feuds were composed, which were characterized on the front of the pillar. But to whatever particular transaction it may allude, it can hardly be imagined that, in so early an age of the arts in Scotland as it must have been raised, so elaborate a performance would have been undertaken but in consequence of an event of the most general importance; it is therefore surprising that no dis-tincter[7:9:752] traditions of it arrived at the era when letters were known. The height of this monument (called King Sueno’s Stone) above the ground is twenty-three feet, besides twelve or fifteen feet under ground. Its breadth is three feet ten inches by one foot three inches in thickness.”
