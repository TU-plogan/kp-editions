FOUNTAIN, a spring or source of water rising out of the earth. Amongst the ancients, fountains were generally esteemed sacred; but some were held to be so in a more particular manner than others. The good effects resulting from cold baths gave springs and rivers this high reputation; for their salutary influence was supposed to proceed from some presiding deity. Particular reasons, however, occasioned some to be held in much greater veneration than others. It was customary to throw little pieces of money into those springs, lakes, or rivers, which were esteemed sacred, in order to render the presiding <fivinities propitious; as the touch of a naked body was supposed to pollute their hallowed waters. For the phenomena, theory, and origin of fountains or springs, see Spring. Fountain- Tree, a very extraordinary vegetable, which grows in one of the Canary Islands, and is likewise said to exist in some other places, and which distils water from its leaves in such plenty as to answer all the purposes of the inhabitants who live near it. Of this tree we have the following account in Glasse ’ s History of the Canary Islands :— “There are only three fountains of water in the whole island of Hierro, wherein the fountain-tree grows. One of these fountains is called Acof, which, in the language of the ancient inhabitants, signifies river ; a name, however, which does not seem to have been given it on account of its yielding much water, for in that respect it hardly deserves the name of a fountain. More to the northward is another, called Ħapio ; and, in the middle of the island is a spring, yielding a stream about the thickness of a man’s finger. This last was discovered in the year 1565, and is called the fountain of Antonio Hernandez. On account of the scarcity of water, the sheep, goats, and swine here do not drink in the summer, but are taught to dig up the roots of fern, and chew them to quench their thirst. The great cattle are watered at those fountains, and at a place where water distils from the leaves of a tree. Many writers have made mention of this famous tree, some in such a manner as to make it appear miraculous; others again deny the existence of any such tree, among whom is Father Feyjoo, a modem Spanish author, in his Teatro Critico. But he, and those who agree with him in this matter, are as much mistaken as those who would make it appear to be miraculous. This is the only island of all the Canaries which I have not been in; but I have sailed with natives of Hierro, who, when questioned about the existence of this tree, answered in the affirmative."
