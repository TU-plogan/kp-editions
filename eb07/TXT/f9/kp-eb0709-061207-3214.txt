FLAMEN, in Roman antiquity, the name of an order of priests, instituted either by Romulus or Numa, authors not being agreed which of the two was its founder.

They were originally only three; the Flamen Dialis, Flamen Martialis, and Flamen Quirinalis. The Flamen Dialis was sacred to Jupiter, and a person of the highest consequence and authority in the state. He discharged several religious duties which properly belonged to the kings, and was honoured with many eminent privileges, but was obliged to observe several superstitious restraints. The Flamm Martialis was sacred to Mars, and was ordained to inspect the rites of that warlike god. The Flamen Quirinalis was sacred to and superintended the rites of Romulus Quirinus. But the Flamines last mentioned, though of high authority, were much inferior to the Flamen Dialis ; and all three were chosen by the people, and consecrated by the Pontifex Maximus. In latter times several priests of the same order and name were added to their number, but inferior in power. The whole at last amounted to fifteen, the first three of whom were senators, and called Flamines Majores; whilst the other twelve, taken from among the people, were denominated Flamines Minores. According to some authors, the Romans had a Flamen for every deity they worshipped. The greater Flamines wore the robe edged with purple, like the great magistrates, and had an ivory chan, with a seat in the senate. They also had a little band of thread about their heads, and hence their name, qW' Filarnines, is said to have been derived. The wife of the Flamen Dialis was called Flaminica, and wore a ha∏' c ^ coloured habit, on which was painted a thunderbolt, u∏ι st above her head-dress she had green oak boughs, to indicate that she belonged to Jupiter the thunderer, to whom thθ oak was sacred. The Flamines wore each of them a a or cap called Flammeum or Apex. ,
