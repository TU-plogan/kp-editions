FAIRFORD, a market-town of Gloucestershire, in the hundred of Brightwalls Barrow, 80 miles from London. It is situated on the small river Coin, at its junction with the Thames, over which are two bridges. The church is a remarkably fine Gothic structure, erected about the year 1470 by an individual; and the painted window, said to have been captured by a ship belonging to the founder, a merchant of London, is highly beautiful. It is about three miles from the Thames and Severn Canal, by which some trade is carried on in coals, salt, and other heavy goods. The market is held on Thursday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1326, in 1811 to 1444, in 1821 to 1547, and in 1831 to 1574.
