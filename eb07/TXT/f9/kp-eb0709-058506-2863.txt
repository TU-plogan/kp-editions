FINE, that which is pure and without mixture. The term is particularly used in speaking of gold or silver.

Fine, in Law, has different applications. Sometimes it is used for a formal conveyance of lands or tenements, or of any thing inheritable, being in esse temporis finis, in order to cut off all controversies. Others define it a final agreement between persons, concerning any lands, rents, or other subjects, of which any suit or writ is depending between them in any court.

Fine sometimes signifies a sum of money paid for entering lands or tenements let by lease; and sometimes a pecuniary mulct for an offence committed against the king and his laws, or against the lord of the manor.

EiN Îµ-D rawing, or Rentering, a dexterous sewing up or rejoining the parts of any cloth, stuff, or the like, torn or rent in the dressing, wearing, or otherwise.

Fine- Stiller, in the distillery. That branch of the art which is employed in distilling spirit from treacle or other preparations or recrements of sugar, is called fine-stilling, by way of distinction from malt-stilling; and the person who exercises this part of the trade is called a fine-stiller.
