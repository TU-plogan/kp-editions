FOKIEN, a large province of China. On the north it is bounded by the province of Tche-kiang, on the east by the Chinese Sea, on the south by Quang-tong, and on the west by Kiang-si. It comprehends under its jurisdiction the Pang-hon or Piscadore Islands, and also the island of Formosa. It has a fertile soil, and an agreeable, warm, and salubrious air; the mountains produce abundance of trees fit for ship-building; and agriculture is prosecuted with great skill on the plains, which yield rice in abundance. The high grounds are disposed in terraces, rising above one another, and water is conducted to them in pipes made of bamboo, which grows here in great plenty. The mountainous parts produce quicksilver, copper, lead, and iron; and it is even conjectured that there are gold mines, though these are not allowed to be worked. Manufactures are carried on in this province to a considerable extent. Steel implements are made, and also cloth from hemp and cotton, besides paper and pencils. The silks and cloth are of extraordinary fineness and beauty. The port of Enfouy in this province was formerly open to European vessels. The chief towns are Fou-tchoo, the capital, celebrated both for commerce and literature; Tsuen-tchosu, Yeu-ping, and Tchang-tcheou. The population is computed, though on very uncertain data, at 15,000,000.
