FOR.BES, Duncan, an eminent Scottish lawyer, and Lord P resident of the Court of Session, was born at Culloden, Itvverness-shire, in the year 1685. His natural disposition inclined him to the army; but, as he early discovered a superior genius, he was induced by the advice of friends to apply himself to learning. Having completed his studies at the university of Edinburgh, he removed thence to Utrecht, and afterwards to Paris, where he directed his attention particularly to the civil law, in which he made great progress. He returned to Scotland in 1710, and was the same year called to the bar, where his abilities soon attracted notice, and procured him extensive practice. In 1717 he was appointed solicitor-general of Scotland; in 1722 he was returned member of parliament for the county of Inverness; in 1725 he was made King’s Advocate; and in 1742 he attained the highest judicial dignity in Scotland, that of Lord President of the Court of Session. During the rebellion in 1745 and 1746, he was mainly instrumental in preventing a general rising of the Highlanders in favour of the pretender to the crown, and he even mortgaged his estate in support of the government. But the glory he acquired in checking the spread of the insurrection, by preventing some of the most powerful chiefs from joining the standard of Prince Charles Edward, and in afterwards contributing to re-establish peace and order, was the only reward of his services. Although he had impaired, nay almost ruined, his private fortune in the cause of the public, government declined to make him the smallest recompense. The minister of the day, with the meanness for which it is difficult to account, desired Jo have a state of his disbursements; an incivility which so much shocked the proud spirit of the patriotic president that he withdrew without deigning to make any reply. He had saved the country, yet they wished to huckster with him about pence. His services had been too great to be requited by any ordinary recompense, and hence they repaid him with ingratitude. It seems, also, that he had displeased the government of the day by the freedom and boldness with which he censured the barbarous system pursued, after the battle of Culloden, in a spirit of vindictive ferocity to which there has been no parallel in modern times, excepting, perhaps, in the wars of La Vendée. The ungrateful treatment which he experienced at the hands of the government he had saved is understood to have preyed on the spirits of President Forbes, and to have produced the fever of which he died in 1747, in the sixty-second year of his age. Throughout the whole course of his life he entertained a lively sense of religion, without the least taint of superstition; and his charity was indiscriminately extended to every sect and denomination of religionists. He was well versed in the Hebrew language; and wrote in a flowing style concerning theology and philosophy, particularly respecting the sources of incredulity. His writings, which had no reference to his profession, were, 1. Thoughts on Religion; 2. A Letter to a Bishop; and, 3. Reflections on Incredulity, 1750, in 2 vols. 12mo.

Forbes, William, bishop of Edinburgh, was born at Aberdeen in the year 1585, being the son of Thomas Forbes, a respectable citizen descended from Forbes of Corsinday, whose ancestor was the second son of the same Lord Forbes from whom Forbes of Corse derived his lineage. His mother was Janet the sister of Dr Cargill, an eminent physician. From the grammar school, where he had made uncommon progress, he was at the early age of twelve removed to Marischal College, and after the usual period of four years he took the degree of A. Μ. The principal, Gilbert Gray, was so much pleased with his scholarship and modesty, that he procured his appointment to the professorship of logic. It was his duty to teach the logic of Aristotle, whom he very strenuously defended against the attacks of Ramus. This office he resigned at the expiration of four years, and afterwards prosecuted his theological studies on the continent. Having landed at Dantzig, he travelled through a great part of Prussia and Poland. He studied in several of the universities, particularly those of Helmstadt and Heidelberg. Diligently rescrting to the public libraries, he rendered himself familiar with the writings of the fathers and schoolmen; and in the Hebrew language[7:9:738] he became a great proficient, or, according to the ' expression of his biographer, equalled the skill of any Jew.

After spending four years in Germany, he went to Holland, and visited the university of Leyden, where his relation Dr Jack was then a professor of philosophy. He was anxious to extend his travels to France and Italy, but being deterred by the delicate state of his health, he sailed for England. From London he proceeded to Oxford, where his learning was held in so much estimation that he was offered the professorship of Hebrew in that university: but his countryman Dr Craig, physician to the king, advised him to consult his health by returning to his native air; and he accordingly arrived at Aberdeen, after an absence of five years, when, according to an obvious calculation, he must have attained the age of twenty-five. The corporation immediately conferred upon him the freedom of the city. When his health was in some measure restored, he was appointed minister of Alford, and was afterwards removed to Monyrriusk. He speedily acquired the reputation of a most eloquent preacher, and after a short interval he became one of the ministers of Aberdeen. During the king’s visit to St Andrews in the year 1617, Forbes was created D. D. As the state of his health was still very infirm, he. was willing to exchange his cure for an academical office. He was nominated principal of Marischal College, and discharged his duty with learning and zeal: he not only read lectures in divinity, but likewise taught the Hebrew language. After retaining the office for two years, he was induced to accept of a pastoral charge in Edinburgh, where however he soon discovered that his character and doctrines were held in much less estimation than in his native city. Aberdeen was the strong-hold of episcopacy, and its clergy were among the most learned and respectable of the episcopalians; but in Edinburgh the presbyterians were the predominant party, and Dr Forbes therefore found himself placed in a situation far from agreeable. When he already thought of resigning his living, his old friends at Aberdeen invited him to resume his spiritual labours among them, and there he continued to reside till near the close of his life. When King Charles visited Edinburgh in the year 1633, Forbes was one of those who preached before him; and the king was so much struck with his eloquence, that when he erected the new see, he spontaneously nominated him as the first bishop. His patent bears the date of January 26, 1634. He was consecrated in the month of February, and soon afterwards removed his wife and children to Edinburgh,^[1. Spalding’s History of the Troubles in Scotland, vol. i. p. 24. Edinb. 1828-9, 2 vols. 4to—“Mr Andrew Forbes, one of the youngest sons to the bishop of Edinburgh, was professor of humanity in the town of St Jean d'Angel, near the town of La Rochelle." (Catalogues of Scotish writers, p. 124. Edinb. 1833, 8vo.)] but he was not long permitted to enjoy his new dignity: he died on the 11th of April, before he had completed the third month of his episcopate, and when he had only attained the fortyninth year of his age. His remains were interred in the cathedral church of St Giles.

Bishop Forbes was a man of very extensive reading, but he did not himself publish any work. He wrote copious animadversions on the works of Cardinal Bellarmin, and, after his death, these papers came into the possession of Dr Baron, who intended to prepare them for the press; but the national commotions speedily ensued, and this design was never executed, nor has their subsequent fate been ascertained. These animadversions, which his biographer describes as elaborate and nervous, filled the margin of the cardinal’s works, printed at Paris in three vo lumes. T wenty-four years after the author’s death, Thomas Sydserf, bishop of Galloway,^[2. Baillie's Letters and Journals, vol. ii. p. 426.] published “Considerationes ' modestae et pacific® Controversiarum de Justificatione, Purgatorio, Invocatione Sanctorum et Christo Mediatore, Eucharistia, per Gulielmum Forbesium, S. T. D. et Episcopum Edinburgensem primum. Opus posthumum, diu desideratum.” Lond. 1658, 8vo. The preface, subscribed T. G., that is, Thomas Gallovidiensis, is followed by an account of the author’s life. This volume, which was reprinted at Helmstadt in the year 1704, attracted a very considerable degree of attention, and is mentioned by many of the continental writers.^[3. Bibliothèque Choisie, tom. v. p. 396. Bayle, Dictionaire Historique et Critique, tom. ii. p. 1194.] Any honest plan for promoting peace may seem to merit praise; but it is a very indifferent method of securing the peace of the church, by offering to meet the papists half-way. This is reforming backwards. The character of the learned author lias thus been drawn by Bishop Burnet: “He was a grave and eminent divine: my father, that knew him long, and being of council for him in his law-matters, had occasion to know him well, has often told me, that he never saw him but he thought his heart was in heaven, and he was never alone with him but he felt within himself a commentary on these words of the apostles, ‘ Did not our hearts bum within us, while he yet talked with us, and opened to us the Scriptures?’ He preached with a zeal and vehemence, that made him forget all the measures of time, two or three hours was no extraordinary thing for him; those sermons wasted his strength so fast, and his ascetical course of life was such, that he supplyed it so scantly that he dyed within a year after his promotion; so that he only appeared there long enough to be known, but not long enough to do what might have been otherwise expected from so great a prelate. That little remnant of his that is in print shews how learned he was. I do not deny but his earnest desire of a general peace and union among all Christians has made him too favourable to many of the corruptions in the church of Rome: but tho’ a charity that is not well ballanced may carry one to very indiscreet things, yet the principle from whence they flowed in him was so truly good, that the errors to which it carried him ought to be either excused, or at least to be very gently censured.”^[4. ‘ Burnet’s Life of william Bedell, D.D. Bishop of Kilmore, pref. Lond. 1685, 8vo—A portrait of Bishop Forbes may be found in Pinkerton’s Iconographie Scotica, or Portraits of illustrious Persons of Scotland. Lond. 1797, 4to.] (x.)

Forbes, John, one of the most learned divines whom Scotland has produced, was born on the second of May 1593. He was the descendant of an ancient and opulent family: his father was Patrick Forbes, bishop of Aberdeen, his mother was Lucretia the daughter of David Spence of Wormiston. His paternal ancestor was a younger son of Lord Forbes, and he was thus connected with some of the principal families in his native district.

Patrick Forbes was the eldest son of William Forbes of Corse and Oneill in the county of Aberdeen. William, the second son, bequeathed to his posterity the estates of Craigievar and Fintray. John, the third son, became minister of Alford, and, adhering with great zeal to the presbyterian discipline, was at length driven into exile on account of his having acted as moderator of the Aberdeen assembly. He settled in Holland, and successively officiated as a clergyman at Middelburg and Delft. His son Patrick Forbes quitted the presbyterians, and became bishop of Caithness in the year 1662. William’s fourth son was Sir Arthur Forbes of Castle Forbes in the kingdom of Ireland, whose son was created earl of Granard: the father [7:9:739] followed the profession of arms, and after quitting the Swedish service, had obeyed the call of fortune in Ireland, where he acquired an ample estate. The bishop of Aberdeen had other three brothers, of whom no particular notices have been preserved. He was himself educated at Stirling school, under Thomas Buchanan, an eminent classical master, and afterwards became a student in the university of Glasgow, where he was committed to the care of his distinguished kinsman Andrew Melville. When this learned man removed to St Andrews, in the year 1580, he was accompanied by Forbes, who applied himself to the study of the Hebrew language and of divinity with so much assiduity and success, and was so conspicuous for the propriety and gravity of his deportment, that a design was entertained of appointing him to a professorship in St Mary’s College; but his father, who was already advanced in years, was anxious to see the heir of his estates otherwise settled, and, in compliance with this wish, the son relinquished his academic life. After his marriage, he fixed his residence near Montrose, and gained the respect of all his neighbours. Nor were his religious exercises confined to his own family: several of the churches in that vicinity were deprived of their pastors, and in one of these he regularly officiated for some time, till he was strongly urged by the bishop of the diocese, as well as by many other clergymen, to enter into holy orders. He was however unwilling to comply with this requisition, and the archbishop of St Andrews, who did not approve of lay-preaching, enjoined him to desist from the discharge of clerical functions. After a certain interval, which is not clearly defined, he consented to take orders, and was appointed parson of Keith, in the diocese of Moray. In the year 1618, he was elected bishop of Aberdeen, and he appears to have been one of the most exemplary prelates of that age. He was, says Bishop Burnet, “a gentleman of quality and estate, but much more eminent by his learning and piety, than his birth or fortune could make him. He had a most terrible calamit^on him in his family, which needs not be named: I do not know whether that or a more early principle determined him to enter into orders: he undertook the labour of a private cure in the country, upon the most earnest invitations of his bishop, when he was forty-eight years old, and discharged his duty there so worthily, that within a few years he was promoted to be bishop of Aberdeen; in which see he sat about seventeen years. It was not easie for King James to per-swade him to accept of that dignity, and many months passed before he could be induced to it, for he had intended to have lived and dyed in a more obscure comer. It soon appeared how well he deserved his promotion, and that his unwillingness to it was not feigned, but the real effect of his humility. He was in all things an apostolical man; he used to go round his diocess without noise, and but with one servant, that so he might be rightly informed of all matters. When he heard reports of the weakness of any of his clergy, his custome was to go and lodge unknown near their church on the Saturday night, and next day, when the minister was got into the pulpit, he would come to church, that so he might observe what his ordinary sermons were, and accordingly he admonished or encouraged them. He took such care of the two colledges in his diocese, that they became quickly distinguished from all the rest of Scotland: so that when the troubles in that church broke out, the doctors there were the only persons that could maintain the cause of the church; as appears by the papers that past between them and the covenanters. And though they begun first to manage that argument in print, there has nothing appeared since more perfect than what they writ. They were an honour to the church both by their lives and by their learning, and with that excellent temper they seasoned that whole diocess, both clergy and laity, that it continues to this day very much distinguished from all the rest of Scotland, both for learning, loyalty and peaceableness.” Bishop Forbes is the author of several works, which deserve to be mentioned. The most considerable of them appear in a volume bearing the subsequent title: “An learned Commentarie vpon the Revelation of Saint lohn, wherein both the covrse of the whole booke, as also the more abstruse and hard places thereof, are more cleerly and eui-dently explaned then heretofore they haue bene. Newly corrected, and the desectes and errors of the first edition supplied and amended. By Patrick Forbes of Cotharis. Wherevnto is added an profitable Treatise of the author, in defence of the lawfiιll Calling of the Ministers of Reformed Churches, against the Cauillations of Romanistes: and an Epistle to a Recusant, cleering and maintayning some pointes of the said Treatise, chalenged by a Roman Elymas Bar-Iesus-it.” Middelburg, 1614, 4to. Of these different works a Latin translation was long afterwards published by his son Dr Forbes: “Commentarius in Apocalypsin, cum Appendice,” &c. Anιstelodami, 1646, 4to. Another work of the bishop is entitled “Eubulus, or a Dialogve, wherein a rugged Romish Ryme (inscrybed, Catholicke Questions to the Protestunt) is confuted, and the Questions there-of answered. By P. A.” Aberdene, 1627, 4to.

Of this worthy father, John Forbes was the second son. After having studied at Aberdeen, he was sent to the university of Heidelberg, where he was placed under the care of David Pareus, an eminent professor of divinity. He likewise prosecuted his studies at Sedan, and in some other universities which are not specified. Having devoted much time and labour to the acquisition of the Greek and Hebrew languages, and of all the variegated knowledge requisite for a theologian, he returned to his native country in 1619, being then in the twenty-sixth year of his age, and on the 27th of April he was admitted professor of divinity in King’s College, Aberdeen. In this important vocation he laboured with great diligence, and speedily acquired the character of a most able and useful teacher. He was profoundly skilled in ecclesiastical antiquity; and, not contented with delivering what is called a system of divinity, he exhibited a very elaborate deduction of the progress of Christian doctrine in various ages of the church. Of the value of his instructions in this department, a very adequate opinion may be formed from the inspection of a work which he published in the maturity of his learning and judgment. Nor did he neglect to instruct his students in practical religion: one division of his lectures related to moral theology, another to the pastoral care and to residence.

While he was engaged in these useful and honourable labours, the kingdom was agitated by religious dissensions. Episcopacy, commonly described by the more odious name of prelacy, was no favourite with the great body of the people; and the five articles of Perth, passed in 1618, and relating to kneeling at the communion, the observance of festivals, confirmation, private baptism, and private communion, had excited a violence of opposition with which it was found very difficult to contend. Dr Forbes, who was as much distinguished by his piety as by his learning, endeavoured to promote peaceable measures; and with this view, he published his earliest work, bearing the title of “Irenicum Amatoribus Veritatis et Pacis in Ecclesia Scoticana.” Aberdoniae, 1629, 4to. Of this work he sent a copy to Archbishop Usher, who received it with much cordiality.^[5. See the Letters (p. 456·) subjoined to Dr Parr’s Life of Usher. Lond. 1686, fol.] The bishop of Aberdeen did not live to witness the [7:9:740] subversion of episcopacy: he died on the 28th of March 1635, in the seventy-first year of his age. As his eldest son had died ten years before, the professor of divinity succeeded to the family-estates. This prelate being regarded as the restorer of the university, and as a great pillar of the church, his death was sincerely lamented by the adherents of his own party. Soon after his decease, a volume, consisting of 429 pages, and including a portrait, was published under the following title: “Funerals of a Right Reverend Father in God, Patrick Forbes of Corse, Bishop of Aberdeen. Toĭ «» aγio ∣ i Reverendissimi in Christo Patris, Patricii Forbesii a Corse, Episcopi Abredoniensis, Tumulus, a multis omnium ordinum collachrymantibus variegato opere exornatus.” Aberdene, 1635, 4to. Among other contributions, this volume includes English sermons by Dr Baron, Dr Scrogie, Dr Guild, Dr Sibbald, and Dr Ross, and a funeral oration in Latin by David Leitch, sub-principal of King’s College. Besides Latin verses, Dr Forbes contributed a Latin sermon, and a “Dissertatio de Visione Beatifica.” Among the contributors of Latin verses we find Robert Gordon of Straloch, Arthur Johnston, David Wedderbum, Patrick Panter, George Wishart, and Andrew Ramsay. The Latin and English or Scotish verses are numerous; and there is a Greek tetrastich by Robert Downie, the librarian of King’s College.

Dr Forbes, who was naturally disposed to think that nothing is better than peace,^[6. 0i3i> lrr r i∕unn ιi(tinif. (S. Ignatii Epistolae genuinae, p. 17- edit. Smith.)] next published “A peaceable Warning to the Subjects in Scotland; given in the yeare of God 1638.” Aberdene, 4to. It was speedily answered in a tract ascribed to Calderwood, the most strenuous defender of the presbyterian cause. The introduction of the covenant involved the most conscientious of the episcopalians in inextricable difficulties. The professors and ministers of Aberdeen, who had recourse to argument and remonstrance, printed a paper containing “Generali Demands concerning the late Covenant.” To this paper, which was subscribed by six doctors of divinity, Forbes, Scrogie, Lesley, Baron, Sibbald, and Ross, an answer was returned under the names of Alexander Henderson, David Dickson, and Andrew Cant, three individuals of no small influence among the covenanters. The doctors of Aberdeen subjoined replies to the answers; which produced further answers from Henderson and Dickson. The doctors published a rejoinder, and had the advantage of the last word;^[7. The generali Demands of the reverend Doctors of Divinitie, and Ministers of the Gospell in Aberdene, concerning the late Covenant in Scotland; together with the Answeres, Replyes, and Duplyes that followed thereupon, in the year 1638. Reprinted in one book, by order of Parliament. Aberdene, 1663, 4to.] but this was the chief advantage which they obtained, for all of them were deprived of their offices in the church and university, for their refusal to subscribe the covenant. William Lesley was principal of King’s College, and appears to have been a man of erudition.^[8. See Garden, vita J. Forbesii, p. 25—In a letter dated in 1702, Bishop Sage conveys the following information: « The demands, replys, and duplys of the Doctors of Aberdeen, as I was informed when there, though subscribed by six, wer all formed and digested by Dr Lesley.” (Catalogues of Scotish writers, p. 131.) Middleton has however stated that Dr Baron “bare the greatest share in that famous debate.”] Robert Baron, a younger son of Baron of Kinnaird in the county of Fife,^[9. 8ibbald*s History of Fife and Kinross, append. Edinb. 1710, fol.] was professor of divinity in Marischal College, and one of the city clergy. Being a great master of scholastic philosophy and theology, he published various works which procured him a high reputation, and he is described as “a person of incomparable worth and learning.”·^[10. Middleton’s Appendix to Spotswood’s History, p. 29—Baillie, vol. i. p∙ 185, characterizes him as good Dr Baron. He subjoins, “I had great hopes, if he had lived a little, he should have quit them, and been glad to embrace the covenant of his mother church, as his learned, brother now has done.” Middleton speaks of John Baron as “a person of great worth and learning, and of great candour. He died in the time of our late combustions.”] ' He was elected bishop of Orkney, but he died at Berwick in 1639, before he could be consecrated. Like Dr Lesley, he had been deprived of his office, and had been obliged to fly from Aberdeen. His brother Dr John Baron, professor of divinity at St Andrews, was finally induced to subscribe the covenant. Dr Forbes was treated with some degree of tenderness; and the covenanters being solicitous to gain such a convert, the proceedings against him in the ecclesiastical courts were protracted for several years. After some preliminary steps, he was in 1640 cited to appear at Aberdeen before a delegation of the general assembly. He was declared to be free from the taint of popery and Arminianism; but as he still adhered to episcopacy, and declined to subscribe the covenant, his case, through the influence of Baillie, was remitted to the presbytery of Edinburgh. He was allowed a month to yield satisfaction to this judicatory, and as he failed to do so, sentence of deprivation was pronounced against him. In 1643 he moved the synod of Aberdeen to make application to the general assembly, that he might be permitted to retain his professorship without subscription; but it was there determined that his deprivation was valid from the beginning.^[11. Baillie’s Letters and Journals, vol. i. p. 383.] He had purchased two houses adjoining to the college, and had assigned one of them to the professor of divinity, and the other to the cantor, a person on the foundation. ^ In the deed of conveyance, he neglected to reserve to himself a life-rent in the professor’s house; nor can it be mentioned without regret and indignation that he was obliged to vacate it for his successor in office.^[12. Spalding’s Hist, of the Troubles in Scotland, vol. ii. p. 161. 190. Orem’s Description of King’s College, p. 84. 142.]

He was anxious to continue his residence in the university, for the benefit of prosecuting his researches in the public libraries; but he found that he must either subscribe the solemn league and covenant, or abandon his native country. Preferring the latter alternative, he embarked for Holland on the 5th of April 1644, and, after a voyage of five days, landed at Campvere. He travelled through the different provinces, and frequently preached in the Scotish and English churches. He had formerly married a lady of Middelburg, named Soete Roos-boom, who died on the 19th of January 1640. She was the mother of nine children; but only one of them, a son named George, was alive at the time of the father’s exile. Dr Forbes chiefly resided at Amsterdam, and occupied himself in preparing for the press a work of great research and value. It appeared under the title of “Instructiones Historico-Theologicae de Doctrina Christiana, et vario Rerum Statu, ortisque Erroribus et Controversiis, jam inde a temporibus Apostolicis ad tempora usque seculi decimi-septimi priora.” Amst. 1645, fol. A second edition followed after a considerable interval. Genevae,] 680, fol. And an abridgement of the work was published by Arnoldus Montanus, under the title of Foτbesius contractus. Amst. 1663, 8vo. Forbes was enabled to prefix to his ample volume the favourable judgment of the theological faculties of Leyden, Utrecht, and Franeker, as well as that of Rivet, Maresius, and Vossius. This book established [7:9:741] the reputation of the author as a theologian of a very high rank. Bishop Burnet speaks of it as “a work which, if he had finished it, and had been suffered to enjoy the privacies of his retirement and study, to give us the second volume, had been the greatest treasure of theological learning that perhaps the world has yet seen.”^[13. Burnet's Life of Bedell, pref.] Dr Cave has likewise mentioned it as a work of great value,^[14. Cave, Historia Literaria, p. xxx.] and it has received similar commendation from writers of many different nations.

After having resided upwards of two years in Holland, Forbes embarked at Campvere on the 8th, and arrived at Aberdeen on the 14th of July 1646. He immediately retired to his country-seat at Corse, and was permitted to spend the remainder of his days in learned and devout seclusion. He died on the 29th of April 1648, having completed the fifty-fifth year of his age. A short time before his death, he made application to the presbytery for permission to have his bones deposited in Bishop Dunbar’s aisle in the cathedral church, beside those of his father and wife; but even this last favour was denied to a learned and excellent man, whose fault was a difference of opinion on the subject, not of Christian doctrine, but of ecclesiastical polity. He then directed his body to be interred in the churchyard of Leochel, where no monument was erected to his memory.^[15. Orem's Description of King’s College, Aberdeen, p. 85.] He left an only son, who is described by Dr Garden as the heir of his father’s estates, but not of his virtues.

Dr Forbes was small in stature, and of a somewhat swarthy complexion. A person who had acquired such ample stores of erudition must have been an ardent and indefatigable student; and, with respect to his habits of study, we are informed that he always read and wrote in a standing posture. One of the few relaxations in which he indulged was the Scotish game of golf. With his extensive learning he united fervid and habitual piety. His conduct was upright and consistent in times of no small difficulty and distress.

An honourable monument was at length erected to his memory, in a collective edition of his Latin works. “Reverendi viri Johannis Forbesii a Corse, Presbyteri et SS. Theologiae Doctoris, ejusdemque Professoris in Academia Aberdonensi, Opera omnia, inter quae plurima posthuma, reliqua ab ipso auctore interpolata, emendata atque aucta.” Amstelaedami, 1703, 2 tom. fol. The second volume bears the date of 1702. The edition is introduced by two dedications, written by George Garden, D.D., an advertisement by Wetstein the printer, and a preface by Dr Gürtler, professor of divinity at Deventer. A copious life of the author, by Dr Garden, is next subjoined. The biographer, who appears to have been a very amiable man, was a regent in King’s College, and afterwards minister of St Machar’s, but was ejected from his living on the restoration of the presbyterian discipline. Under the title of “J. Forbesii Vita interior,” he has added an abstract of Forbes’s diary, which was written in English. One of the posthumous works is an ample treatise, entitled “Theologiae Moralis libri decem; in quibus Praecepta Decalogi exponuntur, et variae circa Dei Legem, et specialia ejusdem Praecepta, Controversi® dissolvuntur, et Casus Conscienti® explicantur.” (x.)
