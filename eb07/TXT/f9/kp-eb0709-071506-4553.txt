FOLKSTONE, a market-town of the county of Kent, on the sea-shore, in the hundred of its own name, of the lathe of Shepway, seventy-two miles from London. It is a member of the Cinque Ports under Dover, but returns no members to parliament. It is built on the ascent of a steep hill, the foot of which forms the sea beach. The chief employments are fishing, and the contraband trade in articles charged with heavy duties. The market is held on Thursday, and well supplied. The population amounted in 1801 to 3257, in 1811 to 3697, in 1821 to 4541, and in 1831 to 4296.
