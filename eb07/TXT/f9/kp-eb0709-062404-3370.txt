FLORENCE, a city, the capital of the grand duchy of Tuscany, and of the division of it of the same name. The department of Florence comprehends the extensive valley of the Arno, and a great portion of the Appennine Mountains, and extends over 3652 square miles, divided into thirty-three vicariates, and containing 643,385 inhabitants. The city of Florence is at the foot of the Appennines, in a beautiful and fertile valley, and is watered by the Arno, which divides it into two unequal parts. It is surrounded with fortifications, but of no great military strength. It has seven gates, of which that of St Gallo is distinguished by a noble marble triumphal entrance. It is divided into four wards, and contains seventeen piazzas, 172 churches, twelve ⅛nn∙ ’ 1 m 1 any n ° ble private P alaces , 9000 dwellings, and 75,200 inhabitants. The streets are not altogether regular or wide, but they are kept clean, are well paved, and lighted by night. The Via Larga is distinguished by many large and magnificent palaces; but the Corso, in which races are ļeld, is the favourite promenade of the fashionable people. niĨĴ fine f st c view ™ the city 1 ιs, however > to be seen from the piazza of Santa Mana to the palace Pitti, the grand ducal residence. The cathedral, the galleries, the churches, the obelisks, and the fountains, are the most magnificent of any in Italy, and deserve a description more detailed than the compass of this notice will allow. The institutions for charity, and the establishments for instruction, especially in the fine arts, are upon an extensive and liberal plan. ' There are three public libraries; the Laurenziana with 120,000 volumes, the Machlibecchiana with 90,000, and the Marcelliana with 40,000. Florence was formerly one of the most distinguished manufacturing places of Italy, and the various kinds of silk goods and of fine black cloth there produced still maintain a high reputation. Besides these, it produces table and other linen, woollen cloths, carpets, caps, soap, perfumery, and essences, lacquered and silvered ware, and many works in alabaster and marble. Florence has produced many individuals eminent in arts, science, and literature; among others, Machiavelli the political writer; Dante Allighieri, Luigi Rucellai, Menzini, and Filicaja, poets; Guicciardini the historian, Michel Angelo Buonarotti the artist, Galileo the astronomer, Amerigo Vespuccio the navigator, Lully the musician, and the artists of the school of this city.
