FE, Fo, or Fohi, the name of the chief god of the Chinese, whom they adore as the sovereign of heaven. They represent him as shining all in light, with his hands hid under his robes, to show that his power does all things invisibly. He has at his right hand the famous Confucius, and at his left Lanza or Lanca, chief of the second sect of their religion.
