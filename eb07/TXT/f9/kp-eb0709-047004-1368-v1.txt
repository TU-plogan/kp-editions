FABIAN, or Fabyan, Robert, an aiderman of the city of London, and sheriff in the year 1493, was a person of some learning, a tolerable poet, and author of a Chronicle of England and France, entitled The Concordance of Histories, in two volumes folio, and containing several curious particulars, not elsewhere to be found, relative to the city of London. Stowe calls it “a painful labour, to the great honour of the city and of the whole realm.” We are told that Cardinal Wolsey caused as many copies of this book as he could procure to be burned, because the author had made too clear a discovery of the larð-e revenues of the clergy. Fabyan died in 1512. There have been five editions of his works, the first of which was printed by Pynson, in 1516; the second by Rastell, in 1533; the third by Reynes, in 1542; and the fourth by

Kingston, in 1559, all in folio; whilst the fifth forms part of the series of Chronicles edited by Ellis, and is reprinted from Pynson’s edition, with various collations and improvements.
