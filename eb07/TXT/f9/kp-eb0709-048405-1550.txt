FALSTER, an island in the Baltic, forming a part of the kingdom of Denmark. It is separated from Zealand by the Gaade Sound, from Langeland by Guldborg Sound, and from Moen by Green Sound. In extent it is 184 square miles, and contains 16,500 inhabitants, in two cities and thirty parishes. Its produce of corn exceeds its consumption; and it assists other parts of the kingdom with some supplies of butter, meal, live cattle, and fruit. The chief town is Mykopping, on Guldborg Sound.
