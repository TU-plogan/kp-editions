FORFEITURE originally signifies a transgression or offence against some penal law. The word is formed from the base Latin forisfactura, whence forfaitura and forfaic-tuτa, and the French forfait. Foτisfactura comes from fo-τisfacere, which, according to Isidore, signifies to hurt or offend, facere contra rationem ; and is not improbably derived from forts, out, and facere, to do, an action out of rule, or contrary to the rules. Borel thinks forfait is derived from the using of force or violence; and Lobineau, in his glossary, supposes forisfacta properly to signify a mulct or amend, not a forfeit, which latter he derives from the Bas-Breton, forfeit, a penalty. But with us it is now more ⅛equently used for the effect of such transgression, as the losing some right, privilege, estate, honour, office, or effects, in consequence thereof, than for the transgression itself. Forfeiture differs from confiscation in this, that the former is more general; whilst confiscation is particularly applied to such things as become forfeited to the king’s exchequer; and goods confiscated are said to be such as nobody claims. See Treason.
