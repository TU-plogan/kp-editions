FORUM, in Roman antiquity, a public place within the city of Rome, where causes were judicially tried, and orations delivered to the people.

Fobum was also used for a place of traffic, and answered to our market-place. These places were generally called for a venalia, in contradistinction to the former, which were called for a civilia.

The for a civilia were public courts of justice, commonly magnificent in themselves, and surrounded with porticos and stately edifices. Of these, six were very remarkable: 1. Forum Romanum ∣ 2. Julianum ; 3. Augustum ; 4. Palladium ; 5. Forum Trajani ∣ and, 6. Forum Sallustii. The Forum Romanum was the most noted, and is often styled simply Forum, by way of eminence. Here were the bar called Rostra, the Comitium, the sanctuary of Saturn, the temple of Castor, and other remarkable edifices. Of the for a venalia, or market-places, which were numerous, the chief were, the forum boarium, for oxen or beef; suarium, for swine; pistorium, for bread; cupedinarium, for dainties; and olitorium, for garden stuffs.

The Grecian aγo1a, ∣ corresponded exactly with the Roman for a, being places where courts and markets were indiscriminately held. At Athens they had many for a, but the chief of these were the old and the new. Forum Indicere was the act of the praetor appointing the place in Rome where causes were to be tried. Agere forum denoted the bringing on causes out of Rome, in a Roman province, and was the same with agere conventum.
