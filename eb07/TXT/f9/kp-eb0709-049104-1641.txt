FARTHING, a small English copper coin, amounting to one-fourth of a penny. It was anciently called fourthing, as being the fourth of the integer or penny.

EARTHING of Gold, a coin used in ancient times, containing in value the fourth part of a noble, or 20d. in silver. It is mentioned in the statute 9 Henry V. cap. 7, where it is enacted that there shall be good and just weight of the noble, half noble, and farthing of gold.

Farthing of Land seems to differ from farding-deal For in a survey-book of the name of West Hapton, in Devonshire, there is an entry thus: A. B. holds six farthings of land at L.126 per annum. 8o that the farthing [7:9:492]of land must have been a considerable quantity, indeed far more than a rood.
