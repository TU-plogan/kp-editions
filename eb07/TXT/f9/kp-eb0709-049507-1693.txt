FAUNA, a deity amongst the Romans, who was daughter of Picus, and originally called Marica. Her marriage with Faunus procured her the name of Fauna, and her knowledge of futurity that of Fatua and Fatidica. It is said that she never saw a man after her marriage with Faunus, and that her uncommon chastity occasioned her being ranked among the gods after death. According to some, she is the same as Bona Mater.
