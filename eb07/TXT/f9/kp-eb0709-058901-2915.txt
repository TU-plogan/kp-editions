FISCAL, in the Civil Law, something relating to the pecuniary interest of the prince or people. The officers appointed for the management of the fisc were called procuratores fisci, and advocati fisci ; and among the cases enumerated in the constitutions of the empire, where it was their business to plead, one is against those who have been condemned to pay a fine to the fisc on account of their litigiousness, or frivolous appeals to the courts of law.
