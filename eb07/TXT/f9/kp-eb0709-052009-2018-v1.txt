FERREANAH, a town of Tunis, in Africa. It bears evident traces of great antiquity, and of having been formerly the largest city of this portion of the Tunisian territory. This, it is usually affirmed, is somewhat unaccountable, because, though the town enjoys a good climate, and is well supplied with water, yet the surrounding country is arid and barren in the highest degree. But the difficulty vanishes when we consider that it lies in the vicinity of a great desert of sand, which is perpetually shifting, and gradually overwhelming whole tracts of country, which were formerly covered with l&xuriant vegetation. Such may have been the case with regard to the country surrounding Ferreanan. Dr Shaw conjectures that it is the site of the ancient Thala, which is so particularly described by Sallust in his narrative of the Jugurthan war. Ferreanah is about 130 miles sout - west of Tunis.
