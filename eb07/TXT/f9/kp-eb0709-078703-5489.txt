FORTITUDE, a virtue or quality of the mind, which is generally considered to be the same as courage, though in a more accurate sense the oue may be distinguished from the other. Courage may be a virtue or a vice, according to circumstances; fortitude is always a virtue. We speak of desperate courage, but not of desperate fortitude. A contempt or neglect of danger, without regard to consequences, may be called courage ; and this some brutes possess as well as man. In them it is chiefly the effect of natural instinct; in man it depends partly on habit and partly on strength of nerve. But fortitude being the virtue of a rational and considerate mind, is founded on a sense of honour and a regard to duty.

This virtue takes different names, according as it acts in opposition to different sorts of evil; but some of these are applied with considerable latitude. With respect to danger in general, fortitude may be termed intrepidity ; with respect to the dangers of war, valour ; with respect to pain of body or distress of mind, patience ; with respect to labour, activity ; with respect to injury, forbearance ; with respect to our condition in general, magnanimity.

The motives to fortitude are many and powerful. This virtue tends greatly to the happiness of the individual, by giving composure and presence of mind, and keeping the other passions in due subordination. To public good it is essential; for without it the independence and liberty of nations would be impossible. It gives to a character that elevation which poets, orators, and historians, have in all ages rejoiced to celebrate. Nothing so effectually inspires it as rational piety; the fear of God is the best security against every other fear. A true estimate of human life, particularly its shortness and uncertainty, together with the numberless evils and temptations to which, by a long continuance in this world, we must unavoidably be exposed, ought by no means to discourage or to throw any gloom on our future prospects, but should teach us that many things are more formidable than death, and that nothing is lost, but much gained, when, by the appointment of Providence, a well spent life is brought to a conclusion.
