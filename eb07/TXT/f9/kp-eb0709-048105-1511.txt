FALASHA, a people of Abyssinia, described by Bruce, and supposed to be of Hebrew origin. According to the received accounts, the Falasha are the descendants of those Jews who went from Palestine into Ethiopia, as attendants of Menilek, the son of the queen of Sheba or Saba by Solomon. But the language of this people is very different from the Hebrew, Samaritan, or any other which the Jews ever spoke in their own country. On being interrogated concerning it by Bruce, they said that it was probably one of the dialects spoken by the nations on the Red Sea, among whom they had settled at the period of their first emigration.
