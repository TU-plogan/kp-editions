FICUS, the Fig Tree. The ficus religiosa, or banian tree, is a native of several parts of the East Indies. It has a woody stem, branching to a great height and vast extent, with heart-shaped entire leaves terminating in acute points. Some of these trees are of amazing size and ex- . tent, as they are continually increasing, and, contrary to most other things in animal and vegetable life, seem to be , exempted from decay. Every branch from the main body throws out its own roots, at first in small tender fibres, several yards from the ground; but these continually grow thicker until they reach the surface, and then striking in, increase to large trunks, and become parent trees, shooting out new branches from the top, which again in time suspend their roots, and these, swelling into trunks, produce other branches; thus continuing in a state of progression as long as the earth, the parent of them all, contributes her sustenance. The Hindus are particularly fond of the banian tree, which, from its long duration, its outstretching arms, and overshadowing beneficence, they look upon as an emblem of the Deity. Near these trees the most esteemed pagodas are generally erected; under their shade the Brahmins spend their lives in religious solitude; and the natives of all castes and tribes are fond of recreating in the cool recesses, beautiful walks, and lovely vistas of this umbrageous canopy, impervious even to the direct rays of a tropical sun.
