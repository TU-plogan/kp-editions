FORTUNATAE Insulae, the name by which the Canary Islands were known to the ancients. The Carthaginians were no doubt acquainted with these islands at an early period, but it was the selfish nature of their policy to confine such knowledge to themselves, for the sake of the commercial advantages to be derived from it. It was not, therefore, till the fall of Carthage that the Greeks and Romans acquired any accurate information respecting the islands on the west coast of Libya. Statius Sebosus, the friend of Lutetius Catulus, consul 242 b c., and who flourished in the time of the Cimbrian war, could not have been the first who made the discovery, though he was probably the first who gave a description of them to the public. Of this account we possess only a few notices by Pliny, who seems to have derived no information from any other quarter. Yet there must have been considerable intercourse with these islands, as we find that Sertorius, when flying before the superior force of the party of Sylla, was so charmed with the account of them he received from some sailors, that he was strongly tempted to take refuge there. The name seems at first to have been restricted to two, Convallis, the island of Teneriffe, and Planaria, now Canaria, from which the Canary Islands derive their name. Ptolemy extends the name to six islands. (Strab. i. 3; Plin. vi. 32; Plut. Sert. 9; See Minano, Diccionario Geografie, &c. Madrid, 1826.)
