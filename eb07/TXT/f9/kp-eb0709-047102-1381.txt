FABRIANO, Gentile da, an historical painter, was born at Verona in 1332, and became a disciple of Giovanni da Fiesole. In that early age of painting he rendered himself famous, and was employed to adorn a great number of churches and palaces at Florence, Urbino, Siena, Perugia, and Rome, but particularly in the Vatican; and one picture of his, representing the Virgin and Child, attended by Joseph, which is preserved in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, was highly commended by Michel Angelo. By order of the doge and senate of Venice, he painted a picture in the great council chamber, which was considered as so extraordinary a performance, that his employers granted him a pension for life, and conferred upon him the highest honour of their state, namely, the privilege of wearing the habit of a noble Venetian. He died in 1412.
