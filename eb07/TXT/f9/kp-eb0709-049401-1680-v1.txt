FATA Morgana, a very singular phenomenon, mentioned by different philosophical writers and travellers, who inform us that it is seen in the Straits of Messina, and sometimes denominated the Castles of the Fairy Morgana. The accounts of this phenomenon differ considerably from one another, and travellers are not agreed as to the causes of its production.Minasi, in his dissertation on the Fata Morgana, gives a description of this remarkable phenomenon. When the rising sun shines from that point whence its incident ray forms an angle of 45° on the Sea of Reggio, and the bright surface of the water in the bay is not disturbed either by the wind or the current, whilst the spectator is placed on an eminence, with his back to the sun and his face to the sea, there appear on a sudden in the water, as in a catoptric theatre, multiplied objects, numberless series of pilasters, arches, castles well delineated, regular columns, lofty towers, superb palaces, with balconies and windows, extended alleys of trees, delightful plains with herds and flocks, armies of men on foot and horseback, and many other strange images, in their natural colours and proper actions, passing rapidly in succession along the surface of the sea during the whole of the short period of time that the above-mentioned circumstances remain as described. But if, in addition to these circumstances, the atmosphere be highly impregnated with vapour and dense exhalations, not previously dispersed by the action of the wind or waves, or rarefied by the sun, it then happens that in this vapour, as in a curtain extended along the channel to the height of from fifteen to twenty feet, and nearly down to the sea, the same objects are beheld not only reflected from the surface of the sea, but likewise in the air, though not so distinct or well defined as the former objects from the sea.If the air be slightly hazy and opake, and at the same time dewy and adapted to form the iris, then the above-mentioned objects will appear only at the surface of the sea, as in the first case, but all vividly coloured, or fringed with red, green, blue, and other prismatic colours.From this account, then, it appears, that there are three different species of Fata Morgana ; the first, that which appears at the surface of the sea, being denominated the Marine Morgana ; the second, that which is seen in the air, called the Aerial Morgana ; and the third, that which is observed only at the surface of the sea, being the Morgana fringed with prismatic colours. Minasi has attempted to trace (he etymology of the word Morgana, which, he thinks, is derived from μwος, tristis, and yακ>⅛ι, laetitia afficio. This splendid sight affects all descriptions of men with such joy, that they run towards the sea, exclaiming Morgana, Morgana. The etymology of Minasi, therefore, though it may at first view seem to be a contradiction in terms, will appear not unnatural, when, besides the joy which the Morgana inspires, we take into account the corresponding sorrow or dejection which must be felt when it vanishes away. The same author informs us, that he beheld this magnificent appearance three times, and would rather behold it again than the most superb theatrical exhibition in the world.In his physical and astronomical remarks on this phenomenon, Minasi observes that the sea in the Straits of Messina exhibits the appearance of a large inclined speculum ∙ that, in the alternate current or tide which flows and returns in the straits six hours each way, and is constantly attended by an opposite current along shore to the medium distance of about half a league, there are many eddies and irregularities at the time of the change of its direction· and that the Morgana usually appears at this period. He ascribes the effects produced by it to the supposed inclination of the surface of the sea, and its subdivision into different planes by the contrary eddies; and the effects produced in the air he considers as the result of saline and other effluvia suspended in the air. These appearances are produced by a calm sea, and one or more strata of superincumbent air differing in refractive, and consequently in reflective power, rather than from any considerable change in the surface of the water, with the laws of which we are much better acquainted than with those of the atmosphere.

To this account may be added that given by Houel, whose judgment and accuracy render his authority highly respectable. In fine summer days, says he, when the weather is calm, there arises above the great current a vapour, which acquires a certain density, so as to form in the atmosphere horizontal prisms, the sides of which are disposed in such a manner, that when they come to their proper degree of perfection, they reflect and represent successively, for some time, like a moveable mirror, the objects on the coast or in the adjacent country. They exhibit by turns the city and suburbs of Messina, trees, animals, men, and mountains; and are certainly beautiful aerial moving pictures. There are sometimes two or three prisms, equally perfect; and they continue in this state from eight to ten minutes. After this, some shining inequalities are observed upon the surface of the prism, which render confused to the eye the objects which had before been so accurately delineated, and the picture vanishes. The vapour forms other combinations, and is dispersed in air. Different accounts have been given of this singular appearance, which may perhaps be attributed to a bitumen which issues from certain rocks at the bottom of the sea, and is often seen to cover part of its surface in the Straits of Messina. The subtile parts of the bitumen being attenuated, combined, and exhaled with the aqueous globules which are raised by the air, and formed into bodies of vapour, give to this condensed vapour more consistence, and contribute, by their smooth and polished particles, to the formation of a kind of aerial crystal, which receives the light, reflects it to the eye, and transmits to it all the luminous points which colour the objects exhibited in this phenomenon, and render them visible.
