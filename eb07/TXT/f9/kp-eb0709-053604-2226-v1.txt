FIDDES, Richard, a laborious English writer, was born at Hunmanby, near Scarborough, in the year 1671. Having received his grammatical education at a private school in the neighbourhood, he was admitted first of Corpus Christi, and then of University College, Oxford; but, after taking the degree of bachelor of arts, in 1693, he returned to his relations, and married the same year a lady of good family and fortune. In 1694 he was ordained priest, and not long afterwards presented to the rectory of Halsham; but this place, situated in a marsh, having proved insalubrious both to himself and his family, his residence on his benefice was dispensed with by his diocesan, upon which he removed to Wickham, where he continued for some time. Being thus unable to display his talents as a preacher, and having a numerous family to support, he resolved to devote himself to literature, and with this view proceeded to London in 1712, where, by the favour of Swift, he was introduced to the Earl of Oxford, who made him one of his chaplains, and procured for him a similar appointment from the queen. But the change of ministry in 1714 overturned all Fiddes’ hopes of preferment, and forced him to apply to writing with greater assiduity than ever. Yet he continued to enjoy the esteem of contemporary writers, particularly those of his own party, and was honoured with the friendship of some of the most eminent men of the time. By the interposition of Dr Radcliffe, the degree of bachelor of divinity was conferred upon him by diploma, in the beginning of 1713; and, in 1718, he was honoured with that of doctor by the university of Oxford. In 1725 he died in the house of a friend at Putney, leaving a wife and six children, one of whom, his eldest daughter, married Mr Barcroft, curate of St George’s, Hanover Square, who abridged Taylor’s Ductσr Dubitantium. Dr Fiddes was the author of, 1. A Prefatory Epistle concerning some Remarks to be published on Homer’s Iliad, occasioned by the proposals of Mr Pope towards a new English version of that poem, 1714, in 12mo; 2. Theologica Speculativa, or the first part of a body of Divinity under that title, wherein are explained the principles of Natural and Revealed Religion, 171 , folio; 3. Fifty-two Practical Discourses on several subjects, 4. The Life of Cardinal Wolsey, 1724, folio; 5. Answer to Britannicus, compiler of the London Journal, 1725, being a defence of the Life of Wolsey; 6. A general Treatise o Morality, formed upon the principles of Natural Reason only, 1724, in 8vo; 7. A Preparative to the Lord s Supper; and, 8. A Letter in answer to one from a Freethm er, occasioned by the Duke of Buckingham’s Epitaph· Fiddes was an ingenious but not very learned man, possessed a retentive memory, and was capable of the rn0 [7:9:537] intense application; but his style as a writer is tedious and prolix, and, though commonly judicious, he almost never rises above mediocrity. His misfortunes, towards the close of his life, were chiefly owing to his connection with that party i∏ thθ state t0 which, through Swift, he had been led to attach himself upon his arrival in London.
