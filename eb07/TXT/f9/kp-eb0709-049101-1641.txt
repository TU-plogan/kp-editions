FARRINGDON, a market-town of the county of Berks, in the hundred of the same name, sixty-eight miles from London. It is finely situated on the declivity of the termination of a range of hills, at the foot of which the Thames runs, and where the ruins of an ancient castle are to be seen. It is a town of but little trade, except what arises from a good market held on Tuesday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1691, in 1811 to 1843, in 1821 to 2784, and in 1831 to 2729.
