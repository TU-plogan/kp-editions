FIESOLE, a city of the grand duchy of Tuscany, in Italy, in the province of Florence. It occupies an elevated situation, is the see of a bishop, and has a cathedral, several churches, and but few inhabitants. It is a place of great antiquity, having been in remote ages one of the twelve eminent cities of Etruria. It has now several country-seats of the Florentine nobles.
