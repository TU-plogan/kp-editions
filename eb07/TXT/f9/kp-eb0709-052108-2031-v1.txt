FESTI Dies, in Roman antiquity, certain days in the year devoted to the honour of the gods. Numa, when he distributed the year into twelve months, divided the same into the dies festi, the dies profesti, and the dies intercisi. The dies festi were again divided into days of sacrifices, banquets, games, and feriae. The dies profesti were those days allowed to men for the administration of their affairs, whether of a public or private nature; and they were divided into fasti, comitiales, &c. The dies intercisi were days common both to gods and men, some parts of wlîicli were allotted to the service of the one, and some to that of the other.
