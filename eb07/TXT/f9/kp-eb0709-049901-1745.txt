FEEJEE Islands, a group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean, the exact number of which has not been ascertained. They are situated from about 15. 33. to 19. 15. of south latitude, and extend to about 175. east longitude. They are equally fertile with the generality of the islands in the South Pacific Ocean, and abound in the same sort of produce. Sandal wood is plentiful, and a considerable trade is carried on with the Europeans in this article. The inhabitants are a ferocious race, being all cannibals. These islands were originally discovered by Tasman in the year 1643. They were seen by Captain Bligh in the years 1789 and 1792; and many European vessels have since visited them.

FEET-Bearer, the name of an officer in the courts of the ancient Anglo-Saxon and Welsh princes. He was a young gentleman, whose duty it was to sit on the floor, with his back towards the fire, and hold the kingâ€™s feet in his bosom all the time he sat at table, in order to keep them warm and comfortable; a piece of state and luxury unknown, and, we may add, unnecessary, in modern times.
