FERNANDO PO, an African island, situated near the coast of Benin. It was discovered in 1471 by a Portuguese navigator, whose name it bears. It is about sixty miles in circumference, and is both fertile and beautiful, yielding abundance of rice, fruit, sugar canes, and tobacco. It is however little frequented by strangers; and the inhabitants, who are about 1200 in number, are said to be rude and uncivilized. Long. 8. 40. E. Lat. 3. 28. N.
