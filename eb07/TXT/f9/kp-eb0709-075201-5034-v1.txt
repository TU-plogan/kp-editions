+=====================================================================+


FORSTER, John Reinhold, a celebrated naturalist and geographer, and an accomplished scholar and linguist, was born on the 22d October 1729, at Dirschau, in Polish Prussia, where his father was burgomaster or mayor. His family was of English descent, and had quitted Great Britain in the time of Charles I.

At the age of fourteen he was placed for a year at the public school of Marienwerder, and was afterwards admitted into the gymnasium of Joachimsthal at Berlin. Among his schoolfellows was Pallas, who became so well known for his various researches in natural history, with several others who distinguished themselves in literature and science. He applied himself with diligence to the study of the ancient and modern languages, and in particular of the oriental languages, as connected with divinity. He continued the same pursuits at the university of Halle, which he entered in 1748. After three years, having completed his theological studies, he resided for two years more at Dantzick, preaching as a candidate. In 1753 he obtained a small benefice at the neighbouring town of Nassenhuben, and the next year he married his cousin Elizabeth Nikolai; but he still found leisure to improve himself in natural philosophy, geography, and the mathematics. His increasing family having become too expensive for his income, he accepted the proposals of the Russian consul at Dantzick, and agreed to superintend the establishment of the new colonies at Saratof on the Volga. The consul received the thanks of the reigning favourite, Count Orlof, for his judicious selection of a person so well qualified; but our adventurer was not satisfied with his success in the undertaking,, and, in 1766, he resolved, somewhat suddenly, to try his fortune in England, whither he proceeded well recommended, but with exhausted finances. Soon afterwards, however, he received a gratuity of 100 guineas from the Russian government, and he obtained some remuneration from the booksellers for his translations from the German and the Swedish. He declined a proposal of Lord Baltimore, who offered him the management of his large estates in America, preferring the appointment of a teacher of modern languages and natural history in the dissenting academy of Warrington, where he found a more interesting society than would have been attainable in any part of the New World. He was not, however, very popular as an instructor; and he was soon after this engaged to accompany Mr Dalrymple, who was going out as governor of Balambanjan, near Borneo; but the plan was never executed. In 1772 he was appointed naturalist to the expedition under the command of Captain Cook in his second voyage of circumnavigation; and he took witlι him his son George, then seventeen years old. For this undertaking Forster was abundantly qualified as a man of science and an accurate observer, though his temper and conduct were not always such as to make him agreeable to his shipmates, nor was he uniformly considerate and humane in his intercourse with the uncivilized inhabitants of the countries which he explored. After the return of the expedition, there were repeated discussions and disputes respecting Forster’s share in the intended publication of the narrative of the voyage. Two thousand pounds, which had been granted by government for the plates of the work, were to have been equally divided between Cook and Forster for this purpose; but Forster’s performance of his part of the undertaking was disapproved, and he was deprived of the advantage which he expected to have derived from the plates. It is possible that he may have expressed himself incautiously respecting the conduct of the expedition; perhaps also he may have been thought deficient in accuracy of idiom; for he was more fluent than correct or elegant in the various languages which he was in the habit of speaking and writing. He was, however, supposed to be concerned in the account of the voyage which was published by his son; and this participation was considered by his opponents, and even by many of his friends, as an infringement of the conditions of his engagement; besides that many offensive remarks and a few inaccuracies were introduced into the work, some of which were afterwards candidly admitted and corrected by his son. All these circumstances made Forster’s residence in England by no means agreeable, and his pecuniary embarrassments became so pressing that he was at one time in confinement for debt. He was, however, set at liberty in 1780, by the munificence of the king of Prussia, who furnished him with the means of satisfying his creditors, and established him at Halle, as professor of natural history, and inspector of the botanical garden. The year after he took the degree of doctor of physic in the university. He was not always on the most cordial terms with his academical colleagues, and he was too fond of accusing them in his reports to his superiors. His circumstances were also much embarrassed by his unfortunate propensity to play, which absorbed the whole earnings of his labour. He, however, considered the eighteen years that he spent at Halle as the happiest of his life. He was much afflicted in his old age by the premature death of his two sons; indeed his health seemed to be impaired by his grief, and he died on the 9th December 1798. Professor Kurt Sprengel has written an account of his life, containing a just encomium on his various talents and acquirements, though somewhat too flattering with regard to his moral character. He appears to have been master of seventeen different languages; and he was as extensively acquainted with things as with words, being as much indebted for his various knowledge to his industrious and accurate observation of nature, as to his great reading and his profound learning. He was long intimate with Buffon, and greatly admired his writings; and he was in constant correspondence with Linnaeus and his son, the latter of whom gave the name of Forstera to a new genus of plants, in compliment to the two botanists who had discovered it in New Zealand. In conversation he was witty, but frequently too satirical; and his unguarded sallies created him many enemies. He became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries soon after his arrival in England; in February 1772 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; and in 1775, upon his return from the South Seas, the university of Oxford conferred on him the honorary diploma of a doctor of laws. His principal publications are these:

1. Specimen Historice Naturalis Volgensis, Phil. Trans. 1767, p. 312, containing a geographical description of the country about Saratof, and an ample enumeration of its various productions. 2. An Introduction to Mineralogy, or an accurate Classificationof Fossils and Minerals, 8vo, London, 1768; with a Translation of Lehman's Halotechnia, intended principally as a text-book for a course of lectures delivered at Warrington. 3.

Novoe Species Insectorum, Centuria 1, 8vo, London, 1771; consisting chiefly of English insects, together with a few foreign [7:9:753] ones, arranged according to the Linnaean system, with the adoption of two genera from Geoffroy. 8. An Account of the management of Carp in Polish Prussia, Ph. Tr. J 771, p. 310, in a letter to the Honourable Daines Barrington. It appears that the carp is a kind of staple commodity of that country. 9.

The object of this essay is to prove that the byssus of the ancients was cotton, and not fine linen, in which the author succeeds without difficulty; and he states, that all the cloths enveloping the mummies that he has been able to examine are uniformly cotton. In his Egyptian etymologies he is learned and ingenious, but, like almost all other Egyptian etymologists, extremely precipitate. 21.

(Sprengeľs Memoir ; Eyries in Biographie Universelle, vol. xv. 8vo, Paris, 1816; Aikin’s General Biography, vol. iv. 4to, London, 1803; Chalmers’s Biographical Dictionary, vol. xiii. 8vo, London, 1814.) (l. l.) Forster, John George Adam, commonly called George, a distinguished naturalist and circumnavigator, the son of John Reinhold Forster, was born at Dantzick in 1754, and enjoyed, in his earliest youth, the advantage of his father’s assiduous and affectionate instructions, by which he profited so rapidly, that he was capable, at the age of ten years, when he went with his father into Russia, of ascertaining the species of a plant by comparing it with the Linnaean description. He was for a short time at a school in Petersburg. Upon his arrival in London, he was at first placed in a merchant’s counting-house, but soon found his health unequal to the employment, and followed his father to Warrington, where he continued his studies at the academy with so much application, that he became a perfect master of the English language, and otherwise distinguished himself by the strength of his memory and the vigour of his imagination, at the same time that he assisted his father in giving lessons in French, and in completing a variety of translations of voyages and travels. He also accompanied his father, together with Sparrman, in the arduous engagement of making all kinds of physical observations in the circumnavigation of the globe; and he was particularly employed in delineating the various objects of natural history which were discovered. After his return he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; but he soon quitted England to settle at Paris. In 1779, however, he was appointed professor of natural history at Cassel; and, in 1784, he was nominated to a similar situation in the University of Wilna, where he took a degree of doctor of physic; but he found little satisfaction in residing amongst a people so imperfectly civilized. The empress of Russia had engaged him to take an important part in a new voyage of discovery which she meditated; but the design was abandoned upon the commencement of the war with the Turks. He was next invited by the elector of Mentz to accept the appointment of president of the university newly established in that city, and he was residing there at the time when the French army entered it. Being a declared republican in his political principles, he was dispatched as [7:9:754] an envoy to Paris to solicit the incorporation of Mentz with the French republic; but during his absence the Prussian troops retook the city, and he lost the whole of his property, including his numerous manuscripts. He had married a Miss Theresa Hayne, and had one daughter as early as 1788; but, at a subsequent period, his wife⅛ conduct gave him great reason for uneasiness; and though he affected to despise what he called the prejudices of social life, and to excuse her infidelity, and even attempted to facilitate her union with a more favoured admirer, still the affair in reality affected him deeply, and he resolved once more to leave Europe, as if in search of the waters of oblivion; and he was actually preparing for a voyage to Thibet, when his health was subdued by the ravages of a scorbutic disorder, and he died on the 13th February 1792. Besides the assistance which he rendered his father in many of his literary undertakings, he was also the author of a variety of separate publications under his own name.

1. A Voyage Round .the World in his Britannic Majesty's Ship Resolution, commanded by Captain James Cook, during the years 1772, 1773, 1774, and 1775, 2 vols. 4to, London, 1777; in German, 2 vols. 4to, Berlin, 1779, 1780, and 3 vols. 8vo, 1784. The style of this work is rather more animated and poetical than that of the official account of the voyage; the second volume is considered as the best written, and the freest from affectation and false sentiment. 2. Mr Wales, the astronomer of the expedition, published some remarks on the work, which occasioned a Reply to Mr Wales’s Remarks, 8vo, London, 1778, in which the author declares that his father had no concern whatever in the book, but he admits that he had committed some inaccuracies. 3. A Letter to the Earl of Sandwich, 4to, London, 1779. 4. His Answer to the Authors of the Literary Journal of Göttingen exhibits considerable warmth of language, but candidly admits some errors; it excited some further animadversions from Professor Meiners, who declared himself the author of the criticisms. 5. In 1787 he published at Berlin, in 4to, A Translation of Captain Cook’s Third Voyage, performed in 1776-1780, with an introduction and other additions. 6. A Description of the Gentiana saxosa, Swedish Trails. 1777, p. 183. 7. Life of Dr Dodd, 8vo, Berlin, 1779. 8. Preface to Sparrman’s Travels, 8vo, Berlin, 1784. 9. He undertook, together with Professor Lichtenberg, the publication of the Göttingen Magazine, which was continued from 1780 to 1785, and published in it, amongst other essays, A Description of the Red Creeper, or Ceτthia coccinea of Owhyhee, i. vi. p. 346. 10. Experiments with Vital Air, vol. iii. ii. p. 281; examining its effects on glow-worms. 11. A Decad of New Plants, N. Act. Upsal, vol. iii. 1780, p. 171. 12. On Pygmies, Hessiche Bey träge, vol. i. p. 1, 1785. 13. History and Description of the Bread-Fruit Tree, p. 208, 384; also separately, 4to, Cassel, 1784. 14. Florul<ε Insularum Australium Prodromus, 8vo, Göttingen, 1786. 15. Fasciculus Plantarum Magellanicarum, Commentât. Soc. Gott, vol. ix. p. 13. 16. Plant<e Atlanticoe, p. 46. 17. Miscellanies, or Essays on Moral and Physical Geography, Natural History, and Moral Philosophy, 6 vols. 8vo, Leipsic and Berlin, 1789-1797; the last two volumes are posthumous, and chiefly of a political nature. 18. Pictuιe of the Lower Rhine, Brabant, Flanders, Holland, England, and France, taken in the year 1790, 3 vols. 8vo, Berlin, 1791-1794; Dutch, Haarlem, 1792, 1793; French, called Voyage Philosophique, 2 vols. 8vo, Paris, 1795, 1796. This work contains many interesting remarks on manners and on the arts, showing that the author possessed very extensive information, as well as originality of talent; but there is too much affectation of sentiment, and an injudicious display of hostility to Great Britain. 19. Historical Remembrances of the Year 1790, 8vo, Berlin, 1793. There are also several political pamphlets of a temporary nature, which could add little or nothing to their author’s fame; and a few scattered memoirs in different periodical publications. He was also concerned in the Collection of Voyages published by Professor Sprengel; and, together with Pallas and others, in an edition of Martini’s Dictionary of Natural History. Indeed, his life, though short, was one continued scene of literary activity; but his application to the labour of compilation was too unremitting to allow him to concentrate the whole force of his mind on the performance of any one great original work of genius. The Sketches of the Mythology and Customs of the Hindoos were written by another author of the same name.
