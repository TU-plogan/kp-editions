FLORES, or Ende, an island in the Eastern Seas, extending about 200 miles in length by forty or fifty in breadth, at the extremity of which is a strait called Flores Strait. Near the coast is a fine open country, but the interior parts are mountainous and woody; and there is said to be a volcano in the centre. Sandal wood was formerly obtained here in great abundance, but it is now grown scarce. At a village in the straits which separate Flores from Sabraon and Solor, European vessels procure refreshments in exchange for ammunition, coarse cutlery, and other articles. The island belongs to the sultan of Beema, in the island of Sambawa, who derives a considerable revenue from the edible bird-nests found in it. The Portuguese formerly resided in it; and their descendants, or those calling themselves such, and professing the Roman catholic religion, are still dispersed over the island. The island is situated between the 120th and 123d degrees of east longitude, and the 8th and 9th degrees of south latitude.
