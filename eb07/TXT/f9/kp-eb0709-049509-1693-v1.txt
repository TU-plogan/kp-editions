FAUNS (Fauni), among the ancients, were a species of demi-gods inhabiting the forests, called also Sylvans (Syl-vani), and differing little from the Satyrs. They delighted more particularly in vineyards, and generally appear as attendants of Bacchus, in the representation of Bacchanalian feasts and processions. The Fauns were represented as half men, half goats, having the horns, ears, feet, and tail of a goat, a very flat nose, and the rest of the figure human. Though the Fauns were considered as demi-gods, yet they were supposed to die after a long life. Arnobius shows that their father or chief, Faunus himself, lived only a hundred and twenty years.
