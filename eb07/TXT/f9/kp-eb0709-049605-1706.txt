FEALTY, in Law, an oath taken on the admittance of any tenant, to be true to the lord of whom he holds his land. By this oath the tenant holds in the freest manner, on account that all who have fee hold per fidem et fiduciam, that is, by fealty at the least.

This fealty, at the first creation of it, bound the tenant to fidelity, the breach of which was the loss of his fee. It has been divided into general and special; general, that which is to be performed by every subject to his prince; and special, required only of such as, in respect of their fee, are bound by oath to their lords. To all manner of tenures, except tenancy v at will, and frank-almoign, fealty is incident, though it chiefly belongs to copyhold estates held in fee and for life.
