FALMOUTH, a sea-port of the county of Cornwall, in the hundred of Kerriar, 273 miles from London, at the spot where the river Fale falls into the sea. It has risen to importance from the excellence of its harbour, which is capable of containing large fleets of heavy ships in perfect security; though difficult to get out of when the wind is easterly, and consequently fair for the passage across the Atlantic. The Lisbon packets sail regularly from this port, and at one period a beneficial trade was extensively carried on by them. Falmouth has now a considerable trade in the pilchard fishery. Near to it is Pendennis Castle, one of the defences of the harbour, built in the reign of Henry VIII., improved by Elizabeth, and greatly strengthened by Cromwell. It was occupied as a prison for Americans captured at the early stages of the war with the colonies in 1776. There are markets on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 4849, in 1811 to 5307, in 1821 to 6374, and in 1831 to 7284.
