FLANK, or Flanc, in the manege, is applied to the sides of a horseâ€™s buttock. In a strict sense, the flanks of a horse are the extremes of the belly, where the ribs are wanting, and are immediately below the loins.

Flank, in War , is used by way of analogy for the side of a battalion, brigade, division, or army, in contradistinction to the front and rear. Flank, in Fortification, is a line drawn from the extremity of the face towards the inside of the work. Or, flank ls that part of a bastion which reaches from the curtain to the face, and defends the opposite face, the flank, and the curtain.

Fichant Flank is that whence a cannon playing fires directly on the face of the opposite bastion.

Rasant or Pazant Flank is the point whence the line of defence begins, from the conjunction of which with the curtain the shot only rases the face of the next bastion; and this happens when the face cannot be discovered but from the flank alone.
