FOU-TCHANG, a city of China, in the province of Pe-tchc-li, situated on the banks of the grand canal. It is an ancient city, but the gates at the extremities are in a state of decay. It has a bridge of great antiquity, consisting of four large arches and three smaller ones, secured by parapets; the whole of which is crumbling down.
