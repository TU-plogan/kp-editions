FABRICIUS, George, a Latin poet and historian, was born at Kemnitz, in Germany, on the 24th April 1516. He began his studies in his native place, and completed them at Freyberg and at Leipsic, where he was preceptor to Wolfgang, and also to Philip and Antony Werter. He travelled into Italy with the elder of his pupils, and on his return to Germany in 1553, was appointed director of the college of Meissen, where he died on the 13th July 1571. In his poetical compositions, which obtained for their author considerable distinction, he aftected not to employ any word which had the slightest flavour of paganism; and he blamed those poets who had in their works introduced the pagan divinities. All that he wrote on the history of his country is, in the judgment of Niceron, estimable for research and accuracy; and Lenglet Dufresnoy pronounces a similar opinion. The following list includes the principal works which he published, either as author or as editor: 1. Terentii Afri Comoediae sex cum castigatione duplici Joannis Rivii et G. Fabricii, Strasburg, 1548, in 8vo; 2. Borna, sive Liber utilissimus de veteris Bomoe situ, regionibus, viis, templis, aliisque aedificiis, Bâle, 1550, in 8vo*; 3. Virgilii Opera cum commentariis Servii et T· C. Donati, Bâle, 1551, in fol.; 4. Virgilii Opera a Fabricio castigata, Leipsic, 1551, 1591, in 8vo; 5. Poematum Sacrorum libri quindecim, Bâle, 1560, in 16to; 6. Poematum veterum ecclesiasticoum opera Christiana et operum reliquiae ac fragmenta, 1562, in 4to; 7. De Be Poetica libri septem, 1566, in 8vo; 8. Bcrum Misnicarum libri septem, 1569, in 4to; 9. Originum illustrissimae stirpis Saxonic(x [7:9:472]libri septem, 1597, in fol.; 10. Perum Germanice magnfe et Saxonice universes memorabilium volumina duo, Leipsic, 1609, in fol. Fabricius, or Fabrizio, Jerome, surnamed Acquapendente, from his having been a native of the episcopal city of that name, in Italy, where he was born in 1537. His parents, though poor, were desirous to give their son an excellent education, and with this view sent him to Padua, where the young Fabricius soon found powerful protectors to assist in the cultivation of his talents. After completing his course of philosophy, he applied himself to medicine, which he studied under the celebrated Fallopius, and soon became the most distinguished pupil of that learned professor, whom he afterwards succeeded. Fallopius having died in 1562, Fabricius, then only twenty-five years of age, was at first employed merely to give anatomical demonstrations; but he discharged this duty with so much zeal and ability that, in 1565, he was formally promoted to the chair of surgery, whilst that of anatomy, which had hitherto been considered as merely a dependence or accessory of the other, was declared primary in favour of Fabricius, to whom were also assigned very considerable appointments. And to these preferments the senators of Venice added the highest distinctions which it was in their power to bestow. They granted him privileges not less extraordinary than flattering, gave him precedence of the professors of philosophy, named him citizen of Padua, honoured him with a statue and a gold chain, decorated him with the order of knight of St Mark, constructed a superb anatomical theatre for his accommodation, and assigned him a liberal retired allowance, with the right of naming his successor. Fabricius practised his profession with much dignity and with rare disinterestedness. Persons of high rank, who were indebted to him for the re-establishment of their health, made up by rich presents for the fees which the generous physician refused; and these Fabricius collected in a cabinet, on the door of which he caused to be inscribed the words Lucri neglecti lucrum. He possessed a beautiful country-house, situated on the delightful banks of the Brenta, and still known by the name of Montognuola d' Acquapendente, where, sound in body and mind, loaded with riches, generally esteemed, and enjoying a brilliant reputation, he calculated on spending a happy old age. But his expectations were cruelly disappointed, and his repose was disturbed by envy and ingratitude. It is even said that he was sometimes obliged to employ the knife for other purposes than surgical operations and dissections. Relations on whom he had never ceased to lavish favours, unworthily betrayed his confidence, and are suspected, not without reason, of having abridged his days by means of poison. Having attained the age of cighty-two, he died suddenly in an agony of vomiting, on the 21st May 1619, leaving to his niece a fortune of two hundred thousand ducats, and to the republic of letters the following works, which are much esteemed: 1. De Visione, Voce, Auditu, Venice, 1600, in fol.; 2. De formato Fectu liber, Venice, 1600, in fol.; 3. De Venarum ostiolis, Padua, 1603, in fol.; 4. De Locutione et ejus instrumentis, Venice, 1603, in 4to; 5. De Brutorum loquela, Padua, 1603, in fol.; 6. De Musculi artificio ac Ossium dearticulationibus, Vicenza, 1614, in 4to ;7. De Motu locali Animalium secundum totum, Padua, 1618,’ in 4to; 8. De Exspiratione et ejus Instrumentis libri duo, Padua, 1615, in 4to; 9. De Gula, Ventriculo, Intestinis, Padua, 1618, in 4to; and also, De totius Animalis integumentis, Padua, 1618, in 4to. These different fragments were collected and printed by Bohn, with a preface, under the title of Opera omnia Anatomica et Physiologica, hactenus variis locis ac formis edita, nunc vero certo ordine digesta, et.in unum volumen redacta, Leipsic, 1687, in fol.

But the Leyden edition, published in 1738, by Bernard-Lifroy Albinus, is preferred to that of Bohn, as containing a life of the author, and the prefaces of the different treatises, which Bohn had unaccountably suppressed. All the writings of Fabricius are truly classical, and fully jug. tify the high reputation of their author. His style is pure, and even elegant; the language of Hippocrates was as familiar to him as that of Celsus; and lucid order pervades all his writings. In regularity of plan and clear luminous method he is unsurpassed, “On a reproché à ce grand chirurgien trop de timidité dans l’exercice de son art, et pourtant nous le voyons,” says his French biographer, “pratiquer et perfectionner le trépan, employer avec autant de hardiesse que de talent le bistouri, l’aiguille, le trois-quarts, la rugine et même le for rouge, quoiqu en dise Severino. Haller, qui, certes, ne le juge pas avec bienveillance, est forcé de lui rendre justice sur ces divers points.” In a word, Fabricius was one of the greatest ornaments of the university of Padua, and one of the most celebrated anatomists and surgeons of the sixteenth century. (a.) Fabricius, John Albert, one of the most learned, laborious, and useful of bibliographers, was born at Leipsic on the 11th of November 1668. He lost his mother in 1674, and five years afterwards his father, Werner Fabricius, director of music in the church of St Paul at Leipsic, and author of several works, particularly Deliciae Harmoniere, published in 1657. The subject of this notice commenced his studies under his father, who, on his deathbed, recommended him to the care of Valentine Alberti. He studied during five years under Wencelaz Buhl, then for some time under Ĵ. S. Herrichen; and, in 1684, he was sent to Quedlinburg, there to continue his studies under Samuel Schmidt. From this period the Adversaria of Barthius formed his delight; and when, in 1687, he saw the first volume of Morhof’s Polyhistor, the desire which he had already felt of devoting himself to letters greatly increased. Having returned to Leipsic in 1686, he was the same year admitted bachelor in philosophy, and, in the beginning of 1688, he took the degree of master in the same faculty; soon after which he published his first work, consisting of only one sheet in quarto. He then applied himself to the study of medicine, which, however, he relinquished for that of theology; and having gone to Hamburg in 1693, he proposed to travel into several countries, when the unexpected and not very agreeable information which now reached him, that the expense of his education had absorbed his whole patrimony, and even left him in debt to his trustee, forced him to abandon his project. He therefore remained at Hamburg, where J. F. Mayer employed him in the capacity of librarian. In 1696 he accompanied his patron to Sweden, and, on his return to Hamburg, not long afterwards, he competed for the chair oflogic and philosophy. The suffrages being equally divided between Fabricius and Sebastian Edzardi, one of his opponents, recourse was had to chance, which decided in favour ofEdzardi; butin 1699 Fabricius succeeded Vincent Flaccius in the chair of eloquence and practical philosophy, after which he took the degree of doctor in theology at Kiel. From 1692 to 1697 he had preached regularly every Friday; but after he received his appointment of professor, he devoted the greater part of his time to the duties of that office. In 1701, J. F. Mayer having established himself at Greifswald, caused the chair of theology in that city to be offered to Fabricius, who, however refused it on account of his health. But in 1708 he ha accepted the situation of professor of theology, logic, an metaphysics, and was preparing to enter on his new oitice, when the senate of Hamburg induced him to remain, by adding to his charge as professor that of rector of t e [7:9:473]school of St John, then held by his father-in-law, Schultz, whom Fabricius was very willing to assist in the discharge of his duties. Schultz died in 1709, but Fabricius retained the rectorship two years longer. In 1719 the landgrave of Hesse Cassel made him so advantageous an offer, that Fabricius was on the point of accepting it; but this time also the magistrates, by a seasonable increase of salary, prevailed on him to remain amongst them. An attempt was subsequently made to draw him to Wittenberg. But Fabricius refused to listen to the proposals which were made to him, and died at Hamburg on the 30th of April 1736. Besides the time which he had devoted to the duties of his office, Fabricius spent a considerable portion in maintaining an extensive correspondence, and in receiving the visits of foreigners; but he was so laborious that he was nevertheless the author of a great number of works, the list of which, according to Niceron and Reimar, includes as many as a hundred and twenty-eight. It will be sufficient here, however, to indicate the most remarkable of these, which are, 1. Scriptorum recentium Decas, Hamburg, 1688, in4to; 2. Decas Dccadunι,sive Plagiaτοrium et Pseudonymorum Centuria, 1689, in 4to; 3. Bibliotheca Latina, sive notitia Azictorum veterum Latinorum quorumcunque scripta ad nos pervenerunt, Hamburg, 1697, in 8vo, a work which was republished in an improved and amended form by J. A. Ernesti, Leipsic, 1773, in 3 vols. 8vo; 4. Bibliotheca Graeca, sive notitia Scriptorum veterum Graecorum quorumcunque monumenta integra aut fragmenta edita extant, tum plerorumque e manuscript. ac deperditis, Hamburg, 1705-1728, in 14 vols. 4to, a work which has justly been denominated maximus antiquae eruditionis thesaurus ; 5. Centuria Fabricio-rum scriptis clarorum qui jam dicm suum obierunt, 1705, in 8vo, and a second Century in 1727; 6.

Hydrotheology, in German, 1734, in 4to; 12. Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infimae Latinitatis, ] 734-1756, in 5 vols. 8vo. The principal works edited by Fabricius were, 1. Vincentii Placcii theatrum anonymorum dpseudonymorum, Hamburg, in two vols. fol.; 2. Joannis Mabillonii iter Germanicum, et Joannis Launoii de Scholis celebribus a CaroloMagno et post Carolum Magnum in occi-cente instauratis liber, 1717, in 8vo; 3.

Fabricius, Vincent, born at Hamburg on the 13th of eptember 1612, studied at Leyden, and there took his e S>ees in medicine in 1634. He had already made himself known by his talent for Latin poetry; and two years befoιe this, had published a collection of verses, at the solicitation of his friend and patron Daniel Heinsius. He t ιen applied himself to the study of law, in which his progress was not less rapid than it had been in the other sciences, and in due time he became a learned civilian. 1he bishop of Lubec conferred on him the title of counsellor, with suitable appointments; but he did not hold this situation for any length of time; and having established himself with his family at Dantzic, he was soon afterwards named syndic, and then burgomaster, of that city. The knowledge which he had acquired of the interests of the republic, and the talent for public speaking which he displayed upon occasions of importance, caused him to be thirteen times returned by the senate as their deputy to the Polish diet. He died at Warsaw, during one of the sessions of that body, on the 11th September 1667. The first edition of the poems of Fabricius appeared at Leyden in 1632; and the second, corrected and augmented by the author, in 1638. But his son, Frederic Fabricius, published a third at Leipsic, 1685, in 8vo, containing several pieces which had been omitted in the preceding editions, besides the Harangues pronounced by him in the Polish diet, a discourse De Obsidione et Liberatione urbis Leidensis, delivered at Leyden in 1632, and the medical theses maintained by him in the same city.

Fabricius, John-Christian, the most celebrated entomologist of the eighteenth century, was born at Tundern, in the duchy of Sleswick, in 1742. After having completed his studies, at the age of twenty, he repaired to the university of Upsal, to attend the prelections of Linnaeus. How long he remained there is uncertain. But no pupil was ever more indebted to the lessons of his master than Fabricius. All his works on entomology, which have secured to him a well-merited reputation, indicate the precepts, the method, and even the forms of Linnaeus, applied to the development of a single new idea, not more fortunate in conception than fruitful in its consequences. Far from disguising the obligations which he owed to his master, Fabricius delighted to expatiate on the happy moments which he had passed in the society of Linnaeus; and the grateful scholar has transmitted to us those biographical details, which are not only the most interesting in themselves, but at the same time best fitted to give us an insight into the character of the great naturalist. It was in studying under the latter that Fabricius conceived the idea of his system, and formed the project of his labours on insects. The first insect s mouth which he dissected was that of a cockchafer (scarabaeus stridulus) ; he showed it to Linnaeus, with the description he had made of it, and proposed to him to employ the organs of the mouth, in order to establish the characters of insects, in the new edition of the Systema Naturae which Linnaeus was then preparing. The latter encouraged his pupil to pursue this course, but refused to enter on it himself, because, as he said, he was too old to change his method. Forced to choose a profession, Fabricius studied medicine, and at the age of twenty-five took the degree of doctor in physic; but being soon afterwards appointed professor of natural history in the university of Kiel, he devoted himsclŕ entirely to his favourite pursuits, and, in 1775, published his system of entomology. This work gave anew aspect to the science. Swammerdam and Ray had classed insects according to their metamorphoses; Lister, Linnaeus, and Geoffroy, according to the organs of motion; and some entomologists, as Reaumur, Scopoli, and even Linnaeus himself, had employed the nutritive organs in order to characterize distinctively certain genera. But before the time of Fabricius no one had thought of makiner these [7:9:474]the basis of a general classification. This idea was at once new and bold, and the author evolved it with singular ability. In a second work, which he published two years afterwards, he developed the characters of the classes and genera, showing in the preface the advantages of his method, and, at the same time, excusing its inconveniences. Lastly, in 1778, he published Entomological Philosophy, in imitation of the Botanical Philosophy of Linnaeus; and from this period till his death, that is, during the space of more than thirty years, he was incessantly occupied in extending his system, which he reproduced under different forms in the various works which, from tinfe to time, he gave to the world. But in proportion as the number of species increased, the characters of the genera, and even of the classes, became more and more uncertain and arbitrary; and, with reference to this fundamental point, his later wa itings are perhaps inferior to those which preceded them. The basis which he had assumed was excellent; but it could only conduct him to a natural method, not, as he supposed, to a system ; and this misconception led him to neglect other considerations which would have furnished more exact means of classification. Fabricius had a very extensive knowledge of botany, and of the other branches of natural history. He had been appointed counsellor of state to the king of Denmark, and professor of rural and political economy, in which capacity he published, in German and in Danish, several useful works, though much less celebrated than those which appeared from his pen on the subject of entomology. Fabricius died in 1807, at the age of sixty-five, of a melancholic affection, produced, as is alleged, by the bombardment of Copenhagen. The following is a list of his works: 1.
