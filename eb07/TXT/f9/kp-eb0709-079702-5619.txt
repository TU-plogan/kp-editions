FOURNESS, in Loynsdale, Lancashire, is a tract between the Kent, the Leven, and the Dudden sands, which runs north parallel with the west sides of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and on the south runs out into the sea as a promontory. Here, as Mr Camden expresses it, “the sea, as if enraged at it, lashes it more furiously, and in high tides has even devoured the shore, and made three large bays; viz. Kentsand, into which the river Ken empties itself; Levensand and Duddensand, between which the land projects in such a manner that it has its name hence; Foreness and Foreland, signifying the same with us as promontorium anterius in Latin.” Bishop Gibson, however, derives the name of Foumess, or Furness, from the numerous furnaces that were there anciently, the rents and services of which, called Bloomsmithy rents, are still paid. This whole tract, except on the coast, rises in high hills and vast piles of rocks called Foumess-Fells, amongst which the Britons found a secure retreat, trusting to these natural fortresses, though nothing was inaccessible to the victorious Saxons; for we find the Britons settled here 228 years after the arrival of the Saxons; because at that time Egfrid king of Northumberland gave St Cuthbert the land called Carth-mell, and all the Britons in it, as is related in his life. In these mountainous parts are found quarries of a fine durable blue slate, which is made use of to cover buildings in this and many other parts of the kingdom.
