FALU, one of the provinces of northern Sweden. It â…› bounded on the north by Hernosand, on the east by Gefleborg, on the south-east by Wastera, on the south by Orebro, on the south-west by Carlstadt, and on the west by Norway. It extends over 12,980 square miles, comprehends three cities, one market-town, and 1747 insulated establishments, and contains 124,816 inhabitants. The province is generally mountainous, the highest points rising to about 4000 feet above the level of the sea. Some agriculture is practised in the southern part, and rye, barley, and oats are grown; but in the north nothing is to be seen except barren wastes. There are annually upwards of 2000 head of cattle brought from other parts to supply the few inhabitants who can afford to indulge in their flesh. The chief products are wood, potash, pitch, and tar from the soil, and iron, copper, and porphyry from the mines.

Falu, a town of Sweden, the capital of the province of that name. It is situated between the lakes Warpen and Runn, on a river which flows from one to the other. It is an ancient town, containing chiefly wooden houses to the number of 1135, and 4709 inhabitants, who chiefly find employment in the mines around them, but in some degree from various manufactures.
