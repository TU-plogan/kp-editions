FAST, in general, denotes abstinence from food; but is more particularly used for such abstinence on a religious account.

Religious fasting has been practised by most nations from the remotest antiquity. Some divines even pretend that it had its origin in the earthly paradise, where our first parents were forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge. But though this seems carrying the matter too far, it ⅛ certain that the Jewish church has observed fasts ever since its first institution. Nor were the neighbouring nations, the Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Assyrians, without their fasts. The Egyptians, according to Herodotus, sacrificed a cow to Isis, after having prepared themselves by fasting and prayer; a custom which he likewise ascribes to the women of Cyrene. Porphyry affirms, that the Egyptians, before their stated sacrifices, always rested a number of days, sometimes even of weeks; and that during this time the priests and devotees not only abstained from flesh, fish, wine, and oil, but even from bread, and some kinds of pulse. These austerities were communicated by them to the Greeks, who observed their fasts much in the same manner. The Athenians had the Eleusinian and Thesmophorian fasts, the observance of which was very rigorous, especially amongst the women, who spent one whole day sitting on the ground in a mournful dress, without taking any nourishment. In the island of Crete, the priests of Jupiter were obliged to abstain during their whole lives from fish, flesh, and baked meats. Apuleius informs us, that whoever had a mind to be initiated in the mysteries of Cybele was obliged to prepare himself by fasting ten days; and, indeed, all the pagan deities, whether male or female, required this duty of those who desired to be initiated into their mysteries, of the priests and priestesses who gave out the oracles, and of those who came to consult them.

Amongst the heathens fasting was also practised before some of their military enterprises. Aristotle informs us, that the Lacedaemonians having resolved to succour a city of the allies, ordained a fast throughout the whole extent of their dominions, without excepting even the domestic animals; and this they did for two ends, first, to spare provisions in favour of the besieged, and, secondly, to draw down the blessing of heaven upon their enterprise. The inhabitants of Tarentum, when besieged by the Romans, demanded succours from their neighbours of Rhegium, who immediately commanded a fast throughout their whole territories. Their enterprise having proved successful by throwing a supply of provisions into the town, the Romans were obliged to raise the siege; and the Tarentines, in memory of this deliverance, instituted a fast to be annually observed ever afterwards.

Fasting has always been reckoned a particular duty amongst philosophers and religious people, some of whom have carried their abstinence to an incredible length. At Rome it was practised both by kings and emperors. Numa Pompilius, Julius Caesar, Augustus, Vespasian, and others, we are told, observed stated fasts; and Julian surnamed the Apostate was so exact in this observance as to outdo the priests themselves, and even the most rigid philosophers. The Pythagoreans kept a continual lent; but with this difference, that they believed the use of fish to be equally unlawful with that of flesh. Besides their constant temperance, they also frequently fasted rigidly for a considerable time. In this respect, however, they were all outdone by their master Pythagoras, who continue his fasts for no less than fifty days together. Even Apollonius Tyaneus, one of his most celebrated disciples, cou never equal him in the length of his fasts, though these greatly exceeded those of the ordinary Pythagoreans. The Gymnosophists, or Brahmins of the East, are a s° very remarkable for their severe fastings; and thθ 0 J nese, according to Father Lecomte, have likewise t eir stated fasts, with forms of prayer, for preserving them r ° m barrenness, inundations, earthquakes, and other calamitae®· The Mahommedans too, who possess so large a part or ≡ 1 ' > [7:9:493]are very remarkable for the strict observance of fasts; and the exactness of their dervises in this respect is extraordinary.

Fasting was often used by the heathens for superstitious purposes; sometimes to procure the interpretation of dreams; at others, to serve as an antidote against the pernicious consequences of nocturnal visions. The Jews, though expressly forbidden to fast upon Sabbath days, think themselves at liberty to dispense with this duty when they happen the night preceding to have had frightful and unlucky dreams, which they consider as presaging great misfortunes. On these occasions they observe a formal fast during the whole day; and at night the patient, having invited three of his friends, addresses himself to them seven times in a very solemn manner, saying, “May the dream I have had prove a lucky one and his friends answer as many times, “Amen, may it be lucky, and God make it so after which, in order to encourage him, they conclude the ceremony with the words of Ecclesiastes, “Go eat thy bread with joy,” and then set themselves down to table. They have also added several fasts not commanded in the law of Moses, particularly three, in memory of sore distresses which their nation has at different times suffered. The abstinence of the ancient Jews commonly lasted twenty-seven or twenty-eight hours at a time, beginning before sunset, and not ending till some hours after sunset the next day. On these days they were obliged to wear white robes in token of grief and repentance, to cover themselves with sackloth, or their worst clothes, to lie on ashes, to sprinkle these on their heads, and to perform other like ceremonies. Some spent the whole night and day following in the temple or synagogue, in prayers and other devotions, barefooted, with a scourge in their hands, of which they sometimes made a good use, in order to excite their zeal. Lastly, to complete their abstinence, they were accustomed at night to eat nothing but a little bread dipped in water, with some salt for seasoning; except indeed they chose to add to their repast some bitter herbs and pulse.

The ancients, both Jews and Pagans, had also their fasts or purifying the body, particularly the priests and such as were any way employed at the altars; for when nocturnal disorders happened to them, it was unlawful to approach the altars all the next day, which they were bound to employ in purifying themselves. On this account, at great festivals, where their ministry could not be dispensed with, it was usual for them, on the eve of these solemn occasions, not only to fast, but also, for the greater certainty, to abstain from sleep. For this purpose the high priest had. under officers to awake him, if overtaken with sleep, against which other preventives were also employed.
