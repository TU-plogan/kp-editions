FORT AUGUSTUS, the central fort ο/three such establishments erected for the purpose of overawing the Highlands since the Revolution. It is situated in the centre of a beautiful plain or opening in the hills, in the heart of Inverness-shire, at the western extremity of Lochness, and on the south bank of the Caledonian Canal. Fort Augustus is the weakest of the three forts mentioned, and was easily taken and destroyed by the Highland insurgents during the revolt of 1745. It resembles a gentleman’s house more than a place of military strength; and, though capable of containing 400 soldiers, is now sufficiently garrisoned by a few veteran artillerymen.
