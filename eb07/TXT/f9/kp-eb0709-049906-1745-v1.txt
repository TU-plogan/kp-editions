FELIBIEN, Andre', was born at Chartres in 1619, and went as secretary under the Marquis de Fontenay-Mareuil, who was French ambassador at the court of Rome in 1647. On his return Μ. Colbert procured him the place of historiographer to the king, and also that of superintendent of buildings, and of the arts and manufactures, in France. He became afterwards deputy comptroller-general of the bridges and dykes in that kingdom; and died in 1695. Felibien wrote several pieces relating to the fine arts, the principal of which is his Dialogues on the Lives and Works of the most eminent Painters.
