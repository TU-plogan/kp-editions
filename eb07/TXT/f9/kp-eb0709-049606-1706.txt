FEAR is defined an apprehension of impending evil, attended with a desire of avoiding it. Fear in the extreme is called terror. Fear, in Scripture, is used in various senses. The fear of God is either filial or servile. Filial fear is a holy affection or gracious habit in the soul, by which it is inclined to obey all Godâ€™s commandments, and to hate and avoid evil. Slavish or servile fear is the consequence of guilt; a judicial impression produced by sad thoughts of the provoked majesty of heaven; an alarm within that disturbs the rest of a sinner. Though this fear be in wicked men, yet it is often preparative to faith and repentance. Fear is likewise used for the object of fear. God says that he will send his fear before his people; that is, a dread wrought by him, in order to terrify and destroy the inhabitants of Canaan.

Fear was deified by the Pagans. Tullius Hostilius brought the worship of this deity to Rome. The Ephori of Sparta erected a temple to Fear, near their tribunal, in order to strike awe into those who approached it. Fear was likewise worshipped at Corinth.
