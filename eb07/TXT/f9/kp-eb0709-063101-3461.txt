FLUXIONS.

INTRODUCTION.

The calculus of fluxions, the most important addition that ever was made to the fabric of abstract science, was invented in the latter part of the seventeenth century. Considered as a purely intellectual speculation, it far transcends any theory that had been previously known in pure mathematics; and it is not less estimable by reason of its applicability to physical knowledge. By its powers as an instrument of analysis, the science of geometry has been exceedingly enlarged; and the elegant speculations of the ancient geometers now go but a little way into the vast field of knowledge which has been laid open by the fluxional calculus, the sublime discoveries of Apollonius and Archimedes being merely easy deductions from more extended theories. It has, further, rendered most efficient aid in the investigation of the laws of nature, more especially in establishing the true theory of the motions of the heavenly bodies, which, without its assistance, could not have attained its present high position in the scale of human knowledge.

It may easily be supposed that the invention of the calculus was not at once fully revealed to the world. Its principles being inherent in the nature of geometrical magnitude, they would of course be gradually disclosed with the advance of mathematical science.

As long as the geometers of antiquity confined their speculations to the comparison of figures bounded by straight lines, there was no difficulty. The axioms and the mental process of conceiving the magnitudes compared to be placed one upon another, was sufficient to establish the equality of triangles in the cases when these could be brought entirely to coincide. The principle of superposition might have been carried further in the elements, so as to prove the equality of parallelograms, which are the complements of those about the diameter of a parallelogram; also of parallelograms having equal bases and altitudes; and the equality of the square on the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle to the squares on its sides. In fact, the doctrines of plane geometry were sufficient to prove that any two equal rectilineal figures admit always of being decomposed into spaces, such that, corresponding to every space in one of the figures, there may be found a space exactly equal and similar to it in the other figure; so that in this way any two equal rectilineal figures, however dissimilar, may yet, by division, be brought to coincide.

The principle of superposition, which was sufficient for the comparison of rectilineal plane figures, one with another, could not, however, be extended to the comparison of rectilineal with curvilineal, or of curvilineal with curvilineal figures. In treating of these, the ancients bund it necessary to introduce new notions and modes ofdemonstration into geometry; and the difficulty which occurred in reasoning about curvilineal figures gave rise to the method of exhaustions, the most refined and important of their geometrical theories.

. The fundamental principle of the method of exhaustions ιs this very simple proposition, that the difference of any '" 0 unequal quantities, by which the greater exceeds the oss, may be added to itself so often, as to exceed any finite quantity of the same kind. On this the geometers 0 antiquity founded their propositions concerning curvi-meal figures. By its aid they found that polygons may inscribed in circles, which shall differ from them by less than any assignable space; and hence they might infer that the circles have to each other the same ratio as si nlar polygons inscribed in them, namely, the squares of their diameters. Although in this way they could assure themselves of the truth of the propositions, yet as this kind of proof was of a looser nature than that by which they established their more elementary doctrines, they fortified it against all cavil by their usual mode of synthetic demonstration, proving that the square of the diameter of one circle was to that of another as the first circle to a space that was neither less nor greater than the second, and therefore exactly equal to it. By a like process they proved that a cone is one third of a cylinder of the same base and altitude; and from the demonstrations which they gave of these propositions, it might be concluded in general, that when two variable quantities which have a constant ratio approach to two determined quantities, so as to differ at last from them by less than any assignable space, the same constant ratio is also the ratio of the determined quantities, which are the limits of the variable quantities.

The cautious way in which the ancients proceeded in finally establishing the truth of their propositions concerning the proportions of solids, could be∙of very little use in their original discovery. Indeed we may reasonably suppose, that in the first instance they arrived at a knowledge of their truth by a much shorter road, probably in a way not very different from that followed by the earlier geometers in modern times, who have extended their theories. But whatever path they followed, it led them to some truths of the highest importance at the time they were first known. After ages of fruitless labour in attempting to square the circle, the fine discoveries of Archimedes, that the parabola was two thirds of its circumscribing parallelogram, and the sphere two thirds of its circumscribing cylinder, and its surface four times that of one of its great circles, must have been received by his contemporaries with high satisfaction.

In the beginning of the seventeenth century, the writings of Archimedes greatly engaged the attention of the principal cultivators of mathematical science, who soon seized the spirit of his method, which was altogether distinct from the unwieldy machinery of the ancient mode of synthetic demonstration. He had only considered such solids as could be generated by the revolution of conic sections about an axis, and he had not even exhausted all the cases of these. The celebrated Kepler greatly extended this theory, in a treatise which he composed on the mensuration of round solids. These he conceived to be formed by the revolution of the conic sections about any ordinate, or a tangent to the curve at the vertex, or, in short, about any line whatever within or without the curve. In this way he described about ninety new solids, and proposed them as problems for the consideration of his contemporaries; but of these he resolved only a few of the most simple. In this work he first introduced the name and notion of infinity into the language of geometry. He considered the circle as composed of an infinite number of triangles, having their vertex at the centre, and forming the circumference by their bases. The cone he regarded as composed of an infinite number of pyramids, resting on the infinitely small triangles which formed its circular base, and having their vertices at its vertex; and he supposed a cylinder of the same base and altitude as the cone to be made up of prisms having the [7:9:632]same bases and altitudes as those which composed the cone. ,

The bold extension which Kepler thus gave to the cautious language of geometry drew the attention of his contemporaries, some of whom eagerly followed in his steps. Cavalieri, a friend and disciple of Galileo, embodied the new views in his geometry of indivisibles, the theory of which he possessed in 1629, although it was not published until 1635. In this work, lines were considered as made up of points, surfaces as composed of lines, and solids as formed of surfaces. Cavalieri was exceedingly careful to verify his method, comparing his results with those which had been established by the ancient geometrical mode of demonstration; and, assured by their agreement, he ventured boldly in his new career. His principles were attacked, but he defended them by showing that they might be translated into those of Archimedes, from which they only differed in brevity of expression; his surfaces and lines being in fact merely the thin solids and small inscribed and circumscribed triangles of the ancient geometer, and their number being supposed so great that the difference between them and the figure about which they were described was less than any assignable quantity.

Ťhe new views proposed by Kepler were taken up in France by Roberval, who had carefully studied the writings of Archimedes, and formed a theory by which he could resolve problems concerning curvilineal figures. Instead of supposing lines to be made up of points,, and surfaces of lines, as had been assumed by Cavalieri, he regarded a line as composed of an infinite number of infinitely short lines, a surface as composed of an infinite number of infinitely narrow surfaces, and so on; an assumption which at bottom was the same as that of the Italian geometer, but capable of being wrought up into a theory differing less from the spirit of the ancient geometry. Roberval concealed his views, employing them secretly as the means of invention in geometry, and expecting in this way to get the start of his contemporaries in reputation as a geometer. In the meanwhile the work of Cavalieri appeared and frustrated his selfish expectations.

The facility which the introduction of the notion of infinitely small quantities gave in the extension of geometry, induced all the mathematicians of that day to employ it in their researches. In the doctrine of curve lines it was applied to the theory of tangents by Roberval, Descartes, and Fermat, with great success. So very near had this last-mentioned geometer approached to the fluxional or differential calculus, that Laplace says he ought to be reputed its true inventor. Laplace was no doubt a great authority; but the facts on which he formed his opinion have always been generally known, and no one before him has attempted to reverse the decision of the age in which the calculus was invented. The justice of the decision has been subjected to a scrutiny by men of the highest powers of mind, who, differing in many of their opinions, have yet agreed in ascribing the invention to others.

The problem of drawing tangents to curves is indeed closely connected with the calculus, and at the period when this was about to be revealed that problem was much agitated, and successfully resolved by Slusius, Wallis, Barrow, and others. The writings and discoveries of .Descartes exerted a most beneficial influence on the new geometry, particularly by his happy application of algebra to geometry. Before his time geometrical problems had been resolved by algebra, and a rich mine of discovery thereby opened. But he was the first who thought of applying algebraic formulae to express the nature of curve lines; an invention of vast importance to both branches or mathematical science.

Another most important benefit that resulted from the new views which Descartes brought forward, was the notion of variable quantity. The early analysts distinguished quantities chiefly from the circumstance of their being known or unknown; and the main object of inquiry with them was to discover the chain of reasoning by which they might pass from the given quantities to the determination of those required. The view which Descartes took of geometrical magnitude brought the relations of quantities forward as a principal subject of contemplation. A new subject of discussion was brought into mathematical science, namely, the changes which take place in quantities connected by an invariable relation, when one of them is supposed to change its value, and pass from one state of magnitude to another. The science of geometry owes its elegance and the variety of its doctrines to the combined effect of magnitude and position, as they influence the subjects under consideration; and, in addition to these, the doctrine of curve lines has introduced a new element, namely, the property of varying in magnitude, as an attribute of quantity. This property of indefinitude, in respect of greatness, although it may appear a trivial affection of quantity, has, however, led to the most important consequences; for from this, combined with other principles, have sprung the fluxional calculus and other mathematical theories, which, originating in the ordinary conceptions of the human mind, have engaged the attention of men endowed with the highest powers of intellect for more than a century past.

In the progress of time the notions of infinite quantity introduced by Kepler, Cavalieri, and others, into mathematics, became familiar to geometers, who perceived the immense value of the improvement, and saw that, by due care in its application, there was no risk of its leading into error. Dr Wallis, in the year 1655, gave an admirable specimen of this new analysis in his Arithmetic of Infinites ; a work which contained the first traces of the algebraic analysis applied to the quadrature of curvilineal spaces. Pursuing the views of Cavalieri, he reduced the problem of finding the areas of curves to the summation of the powers of an arithmetical series, consisting of an infinite number of terms, or rather the ratio of the mean of all the terms to the last term. He also showed by the same principles, that certain curve lines might be rectified, or that straight lines might be found to which they were exactly equal; a remark that was shortly afterwards verified by William Neil, a young mathematician of that period, who, at the age of nineteen, showed that the length of the semicubical parabola might be found in finite terms. This was the first curve that was rectified, and the second was the cycloid, a discovery due to Sir Christopher Wren.

Thus the principles of the fluxional calculus were at this period coming gradually into view. Their importance was seen and understood, and in substance, although without an appropriate notation, they were employed in extending the dominion of geometry; it might therefore be supposed that in the course of time they would have been gradually formed into a system, just in the way the science of algebra advanced from the rude form it had when first introduced into Italy, to that degree of compactness and perfection which it acquired by the successive improvements of Vieta, Harriot, and Descartes. But, m the case of the fluxional calculus, a happy combination of circumstances anticipated the slow operation of time. Newton and Leibnitz, two men endowed with the highest powers of mind, appeared nearly at the same time in the field, of discovery. The genius of each shone with resplendent lustre, even amidst the blaze of intellect which enlightened the latter period of the seventeenth century, and which has rendered it for ever memorable in the annals of human[7:9:633] knowledge. They both turned their attention to this branch of mathematical science, and, as is now generally admitted, each, independently of the other, collected the undigested principles into a system, and, by a powerful effort, performed at once what the united labour of ordinary minds would have hardly accomplished in a century.

In ascribing to each of these great men the full honour due to the merit of the invention of the calculus, it is proper to add, that this is a question which at one time divided the opinions of the learned world, and gave rise to a controversy which was agitated with great keenness for almost a whole century. There never could be any doubt as to Newton being the inventor of the calculus of fluxions. He has been acknowledged by all to have been the inventor, and the first inventor; but the question strongly contested has been, whether Leibnitz, without knowing what had been done by Newton, invented his differential calculus by the force of his own mind, or borrowed it from the fluxional calculus, with which at bottom it is identical.

In the course of this controversy it was clearly established by the British mathematicians, who almost to a man ranged themselves on the side of their illustrious countryman, that, as far back as the year 1669, Newton, then in his twenty-sixth year, and a fellow of Trinity College, communicated to Dr Barrow a tract, entitled De Analysi per Aequationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas. In this manuscript the method of fluxions was first indicated; and rules deduced from it given for the quadrature of curves, and various other matters to which the calculus is applicable, were distinctly specified. From this tract, which was sent by Dr Barrow to Collins, the secretary of the Royal Society, it is established beyond all doubt that Newton was then in full possession of his method; and indeed it is certain from other evidence that he must have had it as far back as 1666. The important discoveries made by Newton were communicated without reserve by the secretaries of the Royal Society to mathematicians on the Continent, as well as to those in Britain. In this way it might be generally known that Newton possessed a most valuable instrument of research, by which he had been led to these results, although its nature was too obscurely indicated to give any assistance in divining its precise form.

Leibnitz appears to have been later than Newton in beginning his career of discovery in the mathematics. In the year 1672, being then in London, he communicated to some members of the Royal Society what he supposed to be discoveries relating to the differences of numbers. It was, however, shown to him that the same subject had been discussed long before, by Mouton, a French geometer. He then appears for the first time to have turned his attention to infinite series. Afterwards, on his return to Germany in 1674, he announced to Mr Oldenburgh, then secretary of the Royal Society of London, that he possessed very general analytical methods, by which he had found theorems of great importance relating to the quadrature of the circle, by means of series. In answer, the secretary informed him that Newton and James Gregory had also discovered methods which gave the quadrature of curves, and which extended to the circle.

In the year 1676 Newton addressed a letter to the secretary of the Royal Society, which was made known to Leibnitz. This was the first direct communication between these two great men. It contained the binomial theorem, which Newton had known in the year 1669, and a variety of other matters relating to infinite series and quadratures; but nothing directly relating to the method of fluxions. At this time Newton entertained no jealousy of Leibnitz, for he sneaks of him in the letter with great respect. In a second letter Newton explained at his request the way in which he had found the binomial theorem, and he adverted also to his own calculus, explaining the purposes to which it could be applied, but concealing its nature under the form of an anagram of transposed letters, which was expressed thus, 6αced r αe13e^713Z9n4o 49rτ∙4s9i12ya‰ It is not easy to see what certain information Leibnitz could draw from this assemblage of characters; yet such was the effect of national prejudice in biassing the minds of the British mathematicians, that Raphson, in his History of Fluxions, a work dedicated to the Royal Society of London, expressly asserts that Leibnitz deciphered the anagram, and found it to be this sentence, Data equatione fluentes quotcunque quantitates involvente in. venire fluxiones, et vice versa, “Having any given equation involving never so many flowing quantities, to find the fluxions, and vice versa” We believe there was not the least ground for this assertion; and from such a specimen of want of candour, it is easy to infer that there was very little chance of Leibnitz getting justice done him by the English mathematicians.

In the month of June 1677 Leibnitz sent to Mr Oldenburgh, to be communicated to Newton, a letter containing the first essays of a method which extended to all that could be done by that of Newton. The death of Oldenburgh, which happened soon afterwards, put an end to the correspondence, and it was not until the year 1684 that Leibnitz made his discovery public, it being then inserted in the Leipsic Acts; so that whilst Newton’s claim to the priority of the discovery must be admitted by all, it is not less certain that Leibnitz was the first to give the full benefit of the calculus to the world; for Newton’s Method of Fluxions only became generally known in the year 1687, by the publication of his Philosophice Naturalis Principia.

It is certain that Leibnitz enjoyed unchallenged for fifteen years the honour of being the inventor of his calculus; even Newton himself rendered him that justice in the first edition of his immortal work. Subsequently, however, a foreign mathematician, Fatio de Duillier, piqued, it is said, by having been omitted in an enumeration of eminent geometers by Leibnitz, declared, in a treatise on the line of shortest descent, printed at London in 1699, that he was obliged by the undeniable evidence of things to acknowledge Newton not only as the first, but as by many years the first inventor of this calculus; from whom, whether Leibnitz, the second inventor, borrowed any thing or not, he would rather they who had seen Newton’s letters and other manuscripts should judge than himself.

The insinuation contained in this passage of Fatio’s book could not but be very offensive to Leibnitz, who inserted an animated reply in the Leipsic Acts of 1700, and complained to the Royal Society of London of the injustice done him; and here the affair rested for a time: but it was revived some years afterwards. When Newton’s treatise on the quadrature of curves, and his enumeration of lines of the third order, was published, the Leipsic journalists gave an unfavourable review of the work. Amongst other things, after a brief exposition of the nature of fluxions, they added, that Newton uses and has always used fluxions for the differences of Leibnitz, just as Fabri had substituted in his synopsis of geometry motion instead of the indivisibles of Cavalieri. This most unjust accusation excited great indignation in the minds of the British mathematicians, one of whom, Keill, Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford, in a paper inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of the year 1708, affirmed that Newton was the first inventor of the calculus, and that Leibnitz, in publishing it in the Leipsic Acts, had merely changed the name and the notation. Leibnitz, thus directly charg-ed[7:9:634] with having taken his calculus from that of Newton, addressed a letter to Mr, afterwards Sir Hans Sloane, the secretary of the Royal Society, in which he required that Keill should retract his accusation. Keill however refused to do this, and in answer addressed a letter to the secretary, in which he professed to show, not only that Newton had preceded Leibnitz in the invention, but that he had given so many indications of his calculus that its nature might easily be understood by any man of ordinary understanding. This letter was sent to Leibnitz, who addressed a second letter to the Royal Society, requiring that they should stop these reproaches of Keill, saying that he was too young a man to know what had passed between him and Newton.

The society, thus appealed to as a judge, appointed a committee to examine the old letters, papers, and. documents which had passed between the mathematicians on the subject. The report of this committee does not appear altogether satisfactory. “We take the proper question to be,” say the reporters, “not who invented this or that method, but who was the first inventor of the method; and we believe those who have reputed Leibnitz the first inventor, knew little or nothing of the correspondence between Mr Collins and Mr Oldenburg long before, nor of Mr Newton having that method about fifteen years before Mr Leibnitz began to publish his in the Acta Eruditorum of Leipsic; for which reason we reckon Mr Newton the first inventor, and are of opinion that Mr Keill, in asserting the same, has been nowise injurious to Mr Leibnitz.” This declares nothing on the only point about which there could be any doubt, namely, whether Leibnitz had formed his calculus entirely by the power of his own genius, or had availed himself of a knowledge of Newton’s invention. The judgment satisfied neither party. Keill wished to establish against Leibnitz the charge of plagiarism, but was disappointed; and Leibnitz found in the decision grounds of complaint against the Royal Society. In a communication to the Abbé Conti, a Venetian nobleman and a common friend of his and Newton, then in England, he accused the English nation of desiring to be considered as almost the only inventors. He said it did not appear, as had been well observed by Bernoulli, that Newton possessed before him the infinitesimal characteristic and algorithm, although it would have been easy to have found it if he had been so disposed, just as it would have been easy for Apollonius to have discovered the theory of curve lines of Descartes. He complained that his opponents had attacked his candour by forced and unfounded interpretations of his words. The question was the calculus of differences, and his opponents made it turn entirely upon series, where Newton had no difficulty in going before him. He maintained that he had found for himself a general method for series, and that he had no need of Newton’s method of extractions. There were other grounds of complaint, such as, that only extracts from letters had been given in the Ċommerciwn Εpistoli-cum f whereas the entire letters should have been published· Throughout the whole, which is a postscript to a letter, he manifests much chagrin; and he concludes with proposing this problem, intended, he says, to feel the pulse of the English analysts: To find a line which shall cut perpendicularly all curves of a determinate series, and of the same kind; for example, all hyperbolas, which shall have the same vertex and centre. This he desires the abbe to propose as from himself, or a friend thl. n ι the . ab f i ι s 1 re ∙ pl ∕ t0 . t . his letter he marmed Leibnitz that he had delayed writing until he could at the same time send the answer which Newton had given to his postscript. He tells him that he had read the Commercium Ep ls tohcum, and the originals of the letters which it contained, and, on the whole, he inferred that, setting aside matters foreign to the dispute, the only question at issue was, whether Newton had found the Calculus of Infinitesimals, or Fluxions, before, or after him? The abbé says, you published it first, it is true; but you admit that Newton allowed much to transpire in the’letters which he wrote to Oldenburgh and others. This has been proved at length in the Commercium and its extract; what is your answer? This is what the public requires, to form a correct opinion on the matter. The abbé further informs Leibnitz that his friends believe he x>ught to give an answer, if not to Keill, at least to Newton himself, who, in the letter which the abbé had received from him to be communicated to Leibnitz, had challenged him in express terms. In a spirit of friendship and good sense, he further adds, that he wishes to see á good understanding between them, that the public will profit but little by their disputes, and that the additions to knowledge which they prevent are a pure loss to posterity. He moreover tells him that the king, George L, had desired to be informed of all that had passed between Newton and him. From this we may judge what an interest was excited in the public mind by a dispute which, even at this day, fetv could perfectly understand. The answer which Leibnitz gave to the abbé’s friendly advice was, that he had put his letters, and Newton’s, with his own answers to them, into the hands of Mr Remond at Paris, with a view to have a neutral and impartial opinion as to the matters in dispute. The whole were then to be submitted to the Abbé Varignon and other members of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and afterwards sent to England. In his answers he disavowed the sense which the English mathematicians had extracted from the assertion of the Leipsic journalists, namely, that Newton employed and always had employed fluxions for the differentials of Leibnitz,, which they understood to mean that Newton had availed himself of Leibnitz’s method, only substituting fluxions for differentials. It was from this passage that the English had declared Leibnitz to be the aggressor, in having abetted an attack of Newton; but Leibnitz declared the English interpretation to be full of malignity towards him, and that the sentence in the Leipsic Acts (Pro differentiis Leibnitianis D. Newtonus adhibet semperque adhibuit fluxiones')., meant that Newton had employed fluxions after having seen his differences, and also before he had seen them.

We believe enough has been detailed to show that, besides a desire to arrive at truth, there was infused into this controversy the jealousy of two rivals for the glory of a great discovery; and, in addition, the spirit of partizanship of their respective admirers, and that natural feeling which induces men of different countries to exalt their own nation, although sometimes at the expense of their neighbours. It is not wonderful, then, that at the time this controversy was at its height, men were greatly divided in their opinions.

It is now impossible to obtain absolute certainty as to the question, whether Leibnitz derived any aid from the discoveries previously made by Newton, which, to a certain extent, were made known to the scientific world. It may therefore be some satisfaction, in the want of perfect evidence, to have the judgment of Montucla, the historian of the mathematics, on this subject. “In regard to the principle of fluxions,” says he, “there are only three places of the Commercium Epistolicum which treat o it with sufficient clearness to prove that Newton hat found it before Leibnitz, but I believe too obscurely to take from him the merit of the discovery, one o these is a letter from Newton to Oldenburgh, who had re marked to him that Slusius and Gregory had found a very [7:9:635]simple method of tangents. Newton answered that he conjectured what it was, and he gave an example, which is in effect the same thing as these two geometers had found. He added that it was but a particular case, or rather a corollary to a method much more general, by which tangents.to all sorts of curves, whether geometrical or mechanical, might be found without laborious calculation. He repeated the same thing, without explaining himself further, in his second letter, which has been already mentioned, and he concealed the principle under transposed letters. The only writing in which Newton had allowed any thing of his method to transpire is his Analysis per Equationes numero Terminorum infinitas. He there briefly and obscurely reveals-his principle of fluxions. It cannot be denied that the principle and method were there indicated; but it is not certain that Leibnitz had ever seen the passage. His adversaries have never said that it had been communicated to him by letter; they have merely thrown out a suspicion that Collins might have communicated it to him in his second journey to London. Indeed the suspicion is not altogether void of probability, inasmuch as Leibnitz admitted that in his interview with the secretary he had seen a part of his epistolary correspondence. I believe, however, that it would be rash to pronounce upon this. There might have been grounds for suspicion if Leibnitz had merely given a few essays of his new calculus; but when we consider the improvements he made, as appears by the number of pieces he contributed to the Leipsic Acts, it seems probable that he owed his calculus to his own genius, and his efforts to divine the nature of a method by which Newton had made so many fine discoveries. This is the more probable, as from the method of tangents of Barrow to the differential calculus, the step is not too great to have been made by a power of mind of which Leibnitz had given so many proofs.”

If it had been true, as the British mathematicians alleged, that Leibnitz had taken his calculus from that of Newton, it would have been a very remarkable circumstance that such a long period should have elapsed between his first putting forth his pretensions to the honour of the invention, and the denial of Newton and his friends. This is a thing uncommon in the history of contested claims to discovery, when both the claimants are alive and all the facts known. It is also remarkable that Newton, while in the prime of life, did not of his own accord bring forward a charge of plagiarism against his contemporary. On the contrary, in the first edition of his Principia, which appeared in 1687, he expressly admitted Leibnitz’s claim; and this admission is found even in the edition of the Principia published in 1713. It is now well known, that before the period of the controversy between Newton and Leibnitz, the mind of the former had at one time been in a state which rendered him unfit to draw correct conclusions from the ordinary incidents of life; witness his letters to Mr Pepys and Mr Locke in September 1693 (Brewster’s Life of Newton). At this time he seems to have laboured under great bodily indisposition, from which he afterwards in appearance recovered; indeed it may be doubted whether his temper was so equal and mild in the latter period of his life as has been represented by his biographers. A collection of letters which passed between Flamsteed the astronomer and Abraham Sharp the celebrated calculator, which have lately come into the possession of the Astronomical Society of London, prove that Newton, in conjunction with Halley, opposed Flamsteed in the publication of his Historia Caelestis, a work of the highest merit, and the result °f the labour of his life, with a pertinacity of purpose w hich is by no means an amiable trait in his character. It is certain that Newton entertained towards Leibnitz a very different feeling at one period of his life, from that which he in the end evinced. In the edition of the Principia 1713, and those which preceded it, he says, <¢ Ten years ago, in a correspondence with Mr Leibnitz, I informed him that I had a method of determining maxima and minima, of drawing tangents, and resolving similar problems, which applied alike to rational and irrational terms, but concealed it under transposed letters. He answered that he had found a like method, which he communicated, and which differed from mine only in the terms and the signs, and in the way of conceiving quantities to be generated.” This concession was liberal, and worthy of Newton. However, in the edition of 1726, he retracted this act of justice, having struck out the passage, as Montucla assures us, with his own hand. The historian of the mathematics, however, finds an excuse for this harshness in the treatment which Newton had received from Leibnitz’s friends.

The circumstance of the calculus having had two distinct origins, had the inconvenient effect of giving it two different forms and names. Newton at different times used different notations before he finally adopted that which has been followed by the English mathematicians. Leibnitz and his followers employed one somewhat different; and each sect pertinaciously adhered to the example set by its leader. There was a still greater difference in the view which each party took of quantity, and the way in which it may be generated. Newton conceived geometrical magnitudes to be generated by continued motion, a line by a point in motion, a surface by a moving line, a solid by a moving surface, an angle by a line turning about a point, and so on. It is evident, that by assuming geometrical quantities as the representatives of time, force, and whatever can be expressed by number, these can be conceived to increase or decrease according to the same laws as their geometrical representatives. His calculus therefore consisted of two parts:

Is/, Supposing two quantities to have a given relation to each other (for example, the one to be always equal to the square of the other), and the rate of increase of one of them at any instant of time to be known; to find the rate of increase of the other at the same instant. These rates of increase were called the fluxions of the quantities; and the rules for their determination constituted the direct method of fluxions. 2d , The second part was the reverse problem, in which the relation between the rates of increase of two quantities which depended the one on the other, being given, it was required to discover the relation of the quantities. This was the inverse method. ∙

Leibnitz at first supposed quantity to increase by the addition of some indefinite portion of a quantity of the same kind, and his differentials were quantities proportional to the instantaneous changes in the greatness of the quantities thus generated. He afterwards found it shorter to introduce directly these instantaneous changes into his calculus under the name of infinitely little differences (infiniment petites). These however he did not regard as absolute zeros, but only as not comparable to finite magnitudes. His calculus had, like Newton’s, two parts, the differential calculus, which gave rules for deducting the relation of the differentials of quantities from that of the quantities themselves, and the integral oalculιιs, which resolved the reverse problem, or discovered the relation of the quantities when the relation of their differentials was known. This corresponded to the inverse method of fluxions, as the differential calculus corresponded to the direct method.

There is this distinction, then, between the two methods:
[7:9:636]

Newton’s fluxions are any finite quantities which have to teach other the ratio of the velocities, or degree of quickness with which the quantities are generated.· 1he differentials of Leibnitz are infinitely small quantities, a creation of the mind more removed from ordinary apprehen-; sion than the finite representatives of fluxions. This distinction has often been urged in favour of the superiority I of Newton’s calculus. On the other hand, Newton has ι introduced time into his calculus. Now this is an element foreign to geometry, and belonging to mechanics, a quite distinct branch of science. The metaphysical distinctions between the two forms of the calculus have had but little influence on its progress. Whichever of the two forms is chosen, the rules are the same; and so also are the difficulties to be overcome Some time elapsed before the newly invented calculus was actively employed. At length Leibnitz, to rouse the attention of geometers, proposed in 1687 this problem: To determine the curve along which a heavy body must descend, so as to approach by equal distances in equal times to a horizontal plane. Huygens was the first to resolve the problem. He showed what was the nature of the curve; but he did not give his demonstration. James Bernoulli also resolved the problem by the differential calculus, and published his analysis in the Leipsic Acts. His younger brother John united himself in a close friendship with Leibnitz, and continued throughout life his coadjutor and staunch defender. He made the calculus known in France, where he resided for a time, and gave lessons to the Marquis de l’Hôpital. Part of these form the Analyse des infiniment Petits, a work which bears the name of the marquis, with but a slight acknowledgment in the preface of the share which his preceptor had in its composition. Indeed it was almost entirely his; and of this injury Bernoulli complained justly, but privately, in his correspondence with Leibnitz. The remaining lessons, which teach the integral calculus, are given in the collection of Bernoulli’s works, published in 1742. The whole form an excellent exposition of the principles of the calculus, and contain some of its finest applications.The continental mathematicians who were remarkable for their skill in the differential calculus were at first few in number. They might be nearly all included in the names of Leibnitz himself, James and John Bernoulli, De l’Hôpital, and Varignon. They were, however, remarkably active, particularly the Bernoullis, whose writings have contributed powerfully to its advancement The inventor of the fluxional calculus seems to have taken but little interest in its extension. His treatise on quadratures did not appear till 1706; and his work on fluxions was not published in his life time, but appeared in 1736, nine years after his death. He had however fully availed himself of its power in the composition of his Principia, without revealing to the full extent the nature of the instrument with which he wrought, but establishing the truth of his propositions by synthetic demonstration,after the manner of the ancient geometers. Probably this was done in deference to the taste of that time; for a contemporary writer, Hermann, in following his example in the composition of his Phoronomia, assigned to Leibnitz as a reason, that the geometrical method was likely to be better understood than the analytical in Italy. 1his way of proceeding is now, however, disused by the best writers/and replaced by the more legitimate and undisguised use of the calculus.

The extensive views which the new calculus opened up, afforded the means of resolving problems which had baffled the skill of the earlier mathematicians, and suggested many new ones which without its aid would hav⅞ been quite intractable. The cycloid and the catenary, curves which had eluded the penetrating mind of Galileo, were more fully comprehended; many new ones were suggested and the cultivators of the calculus challenged each other to an investigation of their properties. There is an elegant class of problems which relate to the greatest and least values of quantities. Some of these, called problems of maxima and minima, can be resolved by the ordinary geometry and algebra; but there is a class which lies beyond the dominion of these, and to it belongs the solid of least resistance, the curve of swiftest descent, and, in general, the problems called isoperimetrical, one of the simplest of which is to find the nature of the line which, bein<, given in length, shall comprehend the greatest possible space. These formed the subject of a warm but honourable contest between the two Bernoullis, brothers; and their investigation laid the foundations of that branch of the calculus, the highest, which has been formed into a theory by the labours of Euler and Lagrange, under the name of the Calculus of Variations.

Among the early cultivators of the calculus in Britain we may reckon Cotes, the friend of Newton, who died at the early age of thirty-four (his Harmonia Mensurarum, and other writings, indicate a genius of the highest order), De Moivre, Taylor, Craig, David Gregory, and Stirling. It must, however, be confessed, that the continental school in the course of time advanced before that of Britain, as well in the number of its disciples, as in their high mathematical genius and the importance of their discoveries. John Bernoulli had two sons, Nicoas and Daniel, who rivalled their father’s skill in the applications of the calculus; and these had as condisciples Hermann and Euler. This last mathematician has carried the subject to a point of perfection far beyond what it had attained in the hands of those that had gone before him.

Amongst the means by which the improvement of the calculus has been promoted, we may reckon the problems which passed between the British and continental mathematicians as challenges to each other, in answering which Newton himself condescended sometimes to enter the lists. The doctrine of infinite series, a branch of the mathematics of English origin, gives powerful aid to the calculus in its greatest difficulties; but, legitimately, its assistance ought not to be called in if the problem admit of being resolved in finite terms. The English sometimes failed in the observance of this most proper condition of a good solution, and thus gave rise to reproaches from their opponents, which in at least one instance were not unjustly incurred by Newton himself. In the course of this warfare, Keill, the champion of the English, proposed as a challenge to John Bernoulli, to determine the nature of the curve which a projectile describes in a medium resisting as the square of the velocity. Bernoulli soon resolved the problem, not only in the case proposed, but also when the resistance was as any power whatever of the velocity. He then proposed to put his solution into the hands of some confidential person in London, provided that Keill would deliver his solution to the same person. Keill, however, had upon trial not been able to resolve the problem, and therefore preserved a profound silence, and made himself, by his boasting and failure, quite ridiculous. The triumph of Bernoulli was complete, and he did not miss the opportunity of bestowing severe castigation on his humbled adversary, recollecting, we may suppose, the treatment which his deceased and lamented friend Leibnitz had received from him and his friends.

As another proof of the spirit and rivalry of the supporters of the two analytical theories, we may mention that Brooke Taylor proposed a problem in the intégra calculus to all geometers not English, and sent it to 1 r Montmort to be communicated to the foreign geometers.
[7:9:637]

Notwithstanding the general terms of the challenge, it was well understood to be particularly aimed at John Bernoulli, who in return offered to wager fifty Louis that he would resolve the problem, and to stake fifty more that he would propose a problem which he himself could resolve, but which Taylor could not. The English mathematician did not think it prudent to accept the offered condition. Indeed it was a complaint against the English geometers, that although they made no scruple of trying to puzzle foreigners with difficulties, they rarely responded to the counter challenges proposed to themselves.

Perhaps there never was a considerable invention or discovery which had not to encounter opposition; sometimes from the slowness with which the human mind yields to the force of truth when opposed to long-received opinions, and sometimes from less excusable causes, such as mistaken or interested views, or mere jealousy excited by the fame of the inventor. The new calculus had in the very outset its opponents, such as the Abbé de Catelan, a zealous Cartesian, who declared that it would be better to extend the principles of the Cartesian geometry than to seek for new methods; and this was said in the preface of a book composed on the principles, somewhat disguised, of the very calculus of which he was an opponent. It had another adversary in Nieuwentiit, a man who had written some tolerable works on morality and religion, but who had but small pretensions to be regarded as a geometer. Catelan was satisfactorily answered by De ľHôpital, as was Nieuwentiit by Leibnitz, and afterwards by Bernoulli and Hermann, who proved that this adversary of the calculus really did not know what he opposed.

The calculus had a more formidable enemy in Μ. Rolle, a skilful algebraist and indefatigable calculator, but aman full of confidence in his own notions, rash in forming his opinions, and jealous of the inventions of others. He attacked the certainty of its principles, and he attempted to show that its conclusions were at variance with those obtained by methods previously known, which were acknowledged to be correct. His attack was repelled by Varignon, who completely obviated the objections to the truth of the principles, and further showed that the supposed discrepancy between its conclusions and those obtained by other methods, were mistakes he had committed from haste and inadvertence. These disputes occupied the French Academy a considerable part of the year 1701. The members were chiefly geometers considerably advanced in years, who had been long accustomed to other methods, and were therefore not much disposed to receive new doctrines. Some took no part in the dispute, yet were not sorry to see a storm raised against a theory for which they had no great liking, and took no means to allay it; others, more under the influence of heir passions and prejudices, yielded to these, and declared open war against it. In this state of things the best course was supposed to be that of hearing all which could be said for and against the calculus. The academy ’as long involved in the dispute. Rolle brought forward objection upon objection; and although Varignon continually obviated them, yet the former always claimed the ιctory. In the end the dispute degenerated into a real uarrel, and commissioners were appointed to decide on it. 1hese were Père Gouye, MM. Cassini and de la Hire, . 0 >. however, pronounced no judgment; but the public P'∏ion, or at least the opinion of geometers, was in favour

*arignon∙ The first controversy thus ended, or at least h as suspended, for want of a decision from the commission; ut Rolle, the champion of the opponent of the calculus, h°°w renew θd hostilities. Its defence was next taken up 3 y Μ. Saurin. The ground of attack was the indefinite 0rtn which the calculus gives for the subtangent of a curve at the point where two branches intersect each other, and which in this case is expressed by the fraction -∙ Saurin’s answer was satisfactory; but Rolle, intrenched in masses of calculation, obstinately maintained the combat. 1he academy was again appealed to. The Abbé Bignon, who conducted its affairs, undertóok to decide the controversy, with the assistance of MM. Gallois and De la Hire, two judges by no means favourable to Saurin. They gave no absolute judgment; but recommended to Rolle to conform more strictly to the rules of the academy, and to Saurin to forgive the proceedings of his adversary. Rolle suffered in the estimation of competent judges; he, however, afterwards did justice to the calculus, by acknowledging that he had done wrong in opposing it, and admitting that he had been urged forward by the instigation of malevolent persons, one of whom was the Abbé Gallois; and his demise in 1707 accordingly put an end to the controversy.

In England the Newtonian calculus had to sustain an attack on its principles from a writer of first-rate talents, Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne. The circumstances which led to it are curious. Mr Addison had given the bishop an account of the behaviour of their common friend, Dr Garth, in his last illness, which was highly unpleasing to these two advocates of revealed religion; for when Addison began to discourse with Garth on a future state, “Surely,” said the latter, “I. have no reason to believe these trifles, when my friend Dr Halley, who has dealt so much in demonstration, has assured me that the doctrines of Christianity are incomprehensible, and religion itself an imposture.” The bishop therefore took up arms against Halley, and in the year 1734 addressed to him, as an infidel, a discourse called The Analyst, the object of which was to prove that mathematicians acted inconsistently in objecting to mysteries in faith, seeing that they did not hesitate to admit much greater mysteries, and even falsehoods, in their own science; and he chose the principles of the doctrine of Fluxions, as laid down by Newton and adopted by his followers, to prove the truth of his proposition. It may be supposed that so able a writer would not fail to make an impression on the public mind. But the mathematicians were not slow in coming forward in defence of the doctrines of their chief. In the same year came out a tract with this title: “Geometry No Friend to Infidelity, or a Defence of Sir I. Newton and the British Mathematicians, by Philalethes Cantabrigiensis,” supposed to be Dr Jurin. As usual the attack was renewed, and again repelled by the same hand. Other defences of Newton appeared, one of the best of which was from the pen of Benjamin Robins; it was entitled A Discourse concerning the Nature and Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton’s Method of Fluxions, and of Prime and Ultimate Ratios. But the most important result of this controversy was A Treatise on Fluxions from the pen of Colin Maclaurin, professor of mathematics in the university of Edinburgh, printed in 1742. This defence of the principles of Newton’s views, expressly intended to obviate all objections, is quite satisfactory. The treatise is indeed considerably prolix; but this was a consequence of the circumstances in which it was composed. It however contains a great deal more than a mere theory of fluxions. We have in it some of the finest applications of analysis to the principal problems which had been agitated amongst geometers from the invention of the calculus to the time in which the work appeared.

By the middle of the century the calculus proceeded with a rapid march of improvement. Euler in 1744 greatly enriched it by his solution of the Isoperimetric Problem ( Solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti), a theory which he afterwards wrought up into the Calculus [7:9:638]gt;for 1772, proposed to make the calculus altogether inde-: pendent of the consideration of infinity, and to rest on principles purely analytical, thus connecting it with the doctrines of the ordinary algebra. He has since realised and extended his views in his Theorie des Fonctions A nα . lytiques, also in his Leçons sur les Calcul des Fonetims∙ works which, from their excellence and the celebrity of their author, have formed a new era in the history of the calculus.The twofold origin of the calculus, besides placing its principles on different foundations, gave it also two different forms of notation; and in this state it continued during the whole of the eighteenth century, to the great inconvenience of mathematical students, and, we may add, to the hindrance of the progress of science. A change, however, has taken place within the last twenty years; during that period some British geometers, imbued with the mathematics of the continent, adopted also its notation in preference to that of the followers of Newton, and employed it publicly in their researches. This spirit of innovation in time took possession of the minds of the junior members of the university of Cambridge, and now we may say that it has completely supplanted the native notation. We have retained the name of Fluxions, because, from the changes which have taken place in the way of treating the subject since the days of Leibnitz and Newton, it seems to be as proper as the term differential. It is otherwise with the notation. This is consecrated by its having been employed in the writings of Euler, D’Alembert, Lagrange, and other great masters in mathematical science; and besides, it has advantages over the other in point of symmetry and compactness, and the established reputation of a whole century of useful service. It is true, the late illustrious Lagrange laid it aside in his attempt above mentioned to new-model the calculus; but subsequent writers, in extracting what was excellent from his works, have ic general invested his views with the ordinary notation of the continent. In the following treatise we shall conform to this beneficial alteration.gt;Kepler, Nova Stereometria Doliorum Vinariorum 1615Cavalieri, Geometria Indivisibilium 1635 Exercitationes Geometricae Sex 1647Roberval, Traité des Indivisibles.

Brooke Taylor, by his Methodus Incrementorum, had extended the foundations, and even proceeded a great way in the structure, of a kindred calculus, that of finite differences. Stirling had followed in the same path in his Methodus Bifferentialis ; and Euler had opened a new. field for discovery in the calculus of partial differences, in which D’Alembert followed his steps, and carried the subject further. The same period abounded in good writers. In this country Demoivre, Simpson, Landen, and Waring, stand among the foremost in the list for the originality of their views; on the continent Ricatti, Clairaut, Fontaine, and others, followed in the train of Euler and the Bemoullis.

It is a curious fact in the history of mathematics, that there are instances of ladies who have applied their talents to its study and improvement with much success. Hypatia. the daughter of the ancient geometer Theon, is one notable instance. Unfortunately we have no vestiges of her writings by which we might form an estimate of her proficiency in a science which at firstsight seems not to have many attractions for the female mind. We have another instance in an Italian lady, Maria Gaetana Agnesi, who was actually professor of mathematics in the University of Bologna in the year 1748; and how well she was qualified for the office appears from her Analytical Institutions, a work of great excellence on algebra, the theory of curve lines, and the differential calculus, composed for the instruction of the youth of Italy. This work is so excellent, that Bossut, a French mathematician of great eminence, translated the parton the differential calculus into French, and incorporated it with his Course of Mathematics, as the best treatise he could find on the subject. There is also an English translation by the Rev. John Colson, Lucasian professor of mathematics in the university of Cambridge. Her countryman Frisi, a most competent judge, mentions her in enumerating the mathematicians of Italy, and bestows great praise on her work, calling it opus nitidissimum, ingeniosissimum, et maximum certe opus quod hactenus ex feminae alicujus calamo prodierit. At the present time we have another admirable instance of a lady who has surmounted the difficulties of the calculus. Mrs Somerville, in her work entitled Mechanism of the Heavens, London, .1831, has enriched English literature with a treatise on physical astronomy, in which the different branches of the calculus are combined with the most refined theories of mechanics. Her book does her infinite credit, and indeed is highly honourable to the whole female sex.

Geometers have differed in opinion as to the best way of working up the principles of the calculus into a system. Newton, as has already been stated, employed the theory of motion as the means of connecting its doctrines with the principles of the ordinary algebraic analysis. Leibnitz, again, with the same view, conceived quantity as passing from one degree of magnitude to another by the continual accretion of infinitely small parts. The mind finds no great difficulty in distinctly apprehending tie subject in its simplest state either way. Objections have, however, been taken to both, and attempts made to substitute a better. Euler considered the infinitely small quantities of Leibnitz as absolute zeros, that have to each other ratios derived from those of the vanishing ST l’ h ∙ ch Î7 re P1 ac θ* D’Alembert proposed to make the basis of the calculus the consideration of the mΓ√n∙° f t τ e 1 , mits the <l uantitιes ∙ An English mathe-

The preceding catalogue contains the names of the principal improvers and cultivators of the calculus, from its first invention to the end of the last century. However, it does not contain all their writings; to have enumerated these would have extended the catalogue to too great a length. Almost all the improvements of the calculus Were first given in the form of academical memoirs, from which they have been drawn, and incorporated into the systems that have from time to time been published. The great repertories in which it is contained are the writings of Newton, Cotes, Demoivre, theBernoullis, Maclaurin, Simpson, Euler, D’Alembert, Lagrange, Legendre, La Place, Monge, Poisson, Gauss, Ampère, Ivory, &c. From these have been constructed the treatises of De 1 Hôpital, Bougainville, Le Seurand Jacquier, Cousin, and others, which were the most complete at the different periods when they appeared. At this time the most extensive treatise is the second edition of Lacroix, which came out between 1810 and 1819. In the present century there have been published in France treatises by Garnier, Du Bourguet, [7:9:640]Boucharlat, Cauchy, and others which we have not seen. In Britain we have had treatises by Woodhouse, Dealtry, Lardner, Jephson, Young, Thomson, and others. The university of Cambridge, long infertile, now teems with treatises on the subject, such as those of Brown, Coddington, Earnshaw, Hymer, Jarret, Millar, Myers, and Peacock. There are, besides, treatises on the calculus in courses of mathematics, such as the Elementi d’Algebra of Paoli, the Cours des Mathématiques of Bezout, a like work by Francoeur, &c. There have also been works constructed for the benefit of students, which may be used with any treatise on the subject, such as the excellent collection of examples by Peacock, Herschel, and Babbage, which was intended as an accompaniment to an English translation of an abridgment of Lacroix’s treatise; and the integral tables of Hirsch, which have been translated from the original German into English.

There is a branch of the calculus of great interest, which of late has engaged, and will probably long engage, the attention of mathematicians; we mean the subject of Elliptic Transcendents. This theory originated in the discovery of a very remarkable property of the ellipse and hyperbola by Fagnano, an Italian mathematician, who first showed that arcs of these curves can be assigned, of which the difference is expressible in finite algebraic terms. This most interesting subject has been discussed by the following writers:

PART I.

DIRECT METHOD OF FLUXIONS, OR DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS.

1. In the application of algebra to the theory of curve lines, some of the quantities under consideration are conceived as having always the same magnitude as the parameter of a parabola, and the axes of an ellipse or hyperbola; others again are indefinite in respect of magnitude, and may have any number of particular values; such are the co-ordinates at any point in a curve. This difference in the nature of the quantities has equally place in various theories of the pure and mixed mathematics, and it naturally suggests the division of all quantities into two kinds; namely, such as are constant, and such as are variable.

A constant quantity is that which is supposed to have always the same value. A variable quantity, again, is that which may change its value by increasing or decreasing, so that in passing from one degree of magnitude to another it will have had in succession every possible intermediate magnitude.

Thus, in a circle, the radius is a constant quantity, and any arc of the circle, also its cosine, sine, tangent, secant, &c. are variable, quantities. In the ellipse, the axes or semiaxes are considered as constant; and the co-ordinates to any point in the curve, and in general any lines or spaces or angles which in the same ellipse admit of different values, are variable. So again in the parabola, the parameter is constant, and the co-ordinates to any point in the curve, also any arc of the curve, and the space contained by that arc and the co-ordinates, are to be regarded as variable.

In what follows, we shall in general call constant quantities simply constants, and variable quantities variables.

It is usual to denote constants by the letters a, b, c, &c-towards the beginning of the alphabet, and variables by the letters x, y, z, &c. towards the end.

2. One quantity is said to be a function of another when they are so related that the latter being supposed to change its value, the former also changes its value. Thus, in geometry, the radius of a circle being constant, the cosine, the sine, the tangent, the secant, &c. are functions of the arc. On the other hand, the arc may be considered as a function of any one of these quantities. In mechanics, the force by which a body is urged forward, the space it has passed over, and its velocity at every instant, may all be regarded as functions of the time.

In this algebraic expression, a + X

* = ⅛'

in which a is a constant and x a variable, the quantity y is regarded as a function of a, which is called the independent variable. Here y is expressed by x; but by resolving the equation, x may be expressed by y thus:

x = a (y-.I) y + 1 the quantity x is now a function of y. In either case, the constants a and 1 are not considered. In these examples, u = a-j-bx-1-cx 1 , u = √ (a* + bx + a?), _ a 4- √ bx U ~ c + x i , u is a function of x. A quantity may be a function of several independent variable quantities. Thus, in the expression u = ax 1 + bxy -ļ-cy i , a is a function of the independent variables x and y.

The variety of forms of functions of a variable is endless. They may, however, be resolved into a few elementary functions such as these, x n , a x , log x, sin x, cos x.

The first of these, x n , in which n is constant, and all that can be formed from it by a finite viunber of the elementary[7:9:641] operations of algebra, are called algebraic functions; for example, this, , bx i — c ’ x u = ax i 4- -, T √α i + a*

which is formed by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of the square root. These two, α r , log X, which cannot be expressed by a finite number of terms composed of powers of x, are called transcendental functions, and the remaining two, sin x, cos x, and such as may be formed from them, viz. tan x, sec x, &c. are called trigonometrical, also angular and circular functions.

In the last example, the value of the function u may be immediately found, if the value of x be known. Such functions are called explicit. There are functions, however, which require to be separated from the variable by the resolution of equations, or other means, before their value can be found; as in this example, u 4- X ux = — - — , u — X in which u is supposed to be a function of x. In this case, before the value of u, corresponding to a given value of X, can be found, a quadratic equation must be resolved. Such a function is called an implicit function of x. On the other hand, x is an implicit function of w. By the resolution of an equation we find

.=+ + l + <≡÷T} i u is now an explicit function of x.

The early algebraists indicated the square root of a quantity by placing the letter r before it; thus τx meant the square root of x. The letter was afterwards changed into the sign ⅜∕, and the square root of x was conveniently expressed thus, Vx. In like manner, it is convenient to have a symbol which shall express generally a function of a variable, and accordingly it is now usual to express any function of a variable x by the symbol fx or f (χ) ; also by Er, or px. Here the letters f or F, or φ, are considered merely as the abbreviation of the word function, and not as a co-efficient to the letter x. In this way we include all these expressions, u = x n , u = d c , u = log X, u = cos X, u = sin x, in one general expression, viz. u=fx, or a =flx).

When a function depends on two variable quantities x, y, which are independent of each other, such as this expression, « = ax l -ļ- bxy -f- cy i , we shall express it thus, m =/(«> y)∙

Here we take no notice of the constant quantity a, b, c. A like notation may be applied when three independent variables enter a function.

3. The manner in which we propose to treat this subject requires that the reader should distinctly understand what is meant by a limit to the value of a variable function, or a variable ratio. In the elements of geometry it is shown that the area of a circle is less than that of any regular polygon described about it; and that the greater the number of sides of the polygon, the more nearly is its area equal to that of the circle; so that any space being given, however small, a polygon may be described about the circle, which shall differ from it by less than that space. Suppose now a series of polygons to be described about a circle, each having the number of its sides greater than that which preceded it, the double for example. These will approach continually to an equality with the circle as a limit, which the series, however far continued, can never absolutely reach in respect of magnitude, but from which some term, and all that follow it, may differ by less than any space assignable.

In like manner, the circle is the limit of the area of all regular polygons inscribed in it; and the circumference of the circle is the limit of the perimeters of regular polygons described in it or about it.

In our article Algebra (sect. 266) it has been shown, that, putting a for an arc of a circle, the fraction . a is sm a always greater than an unit, but that ML; g always less; farther, that the arc being supposed to decrease continually, these fractions approach to each other, and may differ by less than any assignable quantity; therefore unity, which is always between them, is their common limit. Hence it appears, that of these three quantities, an arc, its sine, and its tangent, the ratio of any two is that of equality. In the same article it has been shown that the arc a is the limit of the fractions n tan. - and n sin -, η n supposing the number n to be increased continually.

The geometrical series l+β + x* + x 3 ....+ ι^- ’ is equivalent to the function -j—L (Algebra, sect. 56); when X is less than 1, and n is infinitely great, then x" = 0, and the function =; therefore, in this case, the 1—x sum of any finite number of terms of the series will always be less than j——, but will approach to it as the number of terms increases, and may differ from it by less than any assignable quantity; hence it follows that the function ţ is the limit of the sum of the series.

This is true, whatever be the numerical value of n; but suppose n to be a large number, then the factors 12

1— -, 1—-, &c. will differ but little from unity; and they will differ the less as n is greater. Suppose now n to be indefinitely great, then these factory may be accounted each equal to an unit; and, therefore,

(, + ff = 1+ i+ι⅞+f⅛ + ' fc

It has been shown in algebra (sect. 177) that the second member of this equation is the development of the function a x , where ♯ denotes the number 2-7182818, viz. the base of Napier’s logarithms; therefore, if n be supposed to increase continually, the expression Çl +-)" will approach to e x as its limit; and making x = 1, the limit of (1 + -) = β = 2∙7182818, a constant quantity.

4. Since the value of a function depends essentially on that of the variable, which is its basis, any change in the value of the latter will produce a corresponding change in the value of the former.
[7:9:642]

First, let the function be u = χ-, and let us suppose that the variable changes its value, being increased by a quantity A, and thereby becoming x + h ; let u' denote the corresponding value of w, so that we have «* = (x + hp = x 2 + 2xh + A 2 = u + 2xh + A*; hence u' — u = 2xh + h l .

It thus appears that, A denoting the increment of the variable X, the corresponding increment of the function, viz. u' — w, is 2xh + h t .

The algebraic expression for a ratio is a fraction whose numerator is the antecedent, and denominator the consequent. In the present case, the ratio of the increment of the function to that of its variable is ⅛- m = 2 " + a ∙

As another example, let the function be « = x , ; then, supposing, as before, that the variable x is increased by the quantity A, ⅛nd, putting u' for the new value of the function, we have d’ _ (x + ms I = * 3 + 3.t’Ä + 3xh t + A 3 Ç + 3 χ*h + 3xh ι + A’;

*-⅛ i = 3r s + 3xA + A®.

A

In this case we see that when x has increased to x + A, the function “has become u + 3x i h + SxA® + A 3 , having received the increment 3x i h + 3hx l + A 3 , a quantity composed of the integer powers of A. Farther, it appears that the expression for the ratio of the increments is

3a:® + 3arA + A®, of which the first term 3a√ is entirely independent of the value of A, the increment of x.

When the function is u = x t , we have, putting, as in the former examples, A for the increment of the variable, and u' for the new value of the function, u ’ = u + 4,x 3 h + 6χW + 4∙rA 3 + A 4 ,

= 4x 3 + 6x'h + 4χh* + A 3 .

From these examples it appears, that when x changes its value and becomes x + A, then the new value of the function u=x* becomes u' = u + 2a∙A + A®, « = x 3 becomes u' = u + Sx 2 A + 3»A® + A 3 , u = x* becomes u' = u + 4ar s A + Qx t h l + ⅛rA 3 + A 4 ; and in general that u = x n , any integer power of x, becomes υ! = u + ph + qh t + rh z + sA 4 -f-, &c.

the new value of the function being composed of a series of terms, the first of which is its original value, and the following terms, integer powers of the increment A, multiplied by p, q, r, &c. certain other functions of x, the forms of which depend on the original function, whence they have been derived.

Farther, it appears that when u = x l , then = 2» + A; whenu = a j , '~½ _ 3r . + 3χh ÷ a ,.

when u = X t , u ~^ _ 4a J + 6a .s Ä + ± χh t + Ä ,. and, in general, that when x = u n , n being any whole number, then √ — u

— a — =, p + qh ÷ fA 2 + «A 3 +, &c.

Thus it appears that the expression for - the ratio of the increment of the function ι^ to that of its variable x, maybe resolved into two parts, one, p, which is independent of the increment, and another, yA+rA 2 +sA 3 +, &c.; or

A (g + rA + sA° +, &c.), which, having A the increment as a factor, must decrease with it, and, by giving a sufficiently small value to A, may become less than any assignable quantity, so that the first term p is the limit of the ratio.

Let us consider the complex function u = α + bx + cx i .

When X becomes x + A, u becomes u' = a + b (x + A) + c (x + A)*

= a + bx + ex' + (b+2cx) h + eld, hence vf — u = (b-∖- 2cx) A +ch t , ~∙ i U - = b + 2cx + ch.

A

In this case the limit of the ratio is b + 2cx. By a like examination of particular functions it will be found that they have all a common property, that is, If u be any function of a variable x, and if in that function X be supposed to change its value and become X + h; the corresponding new value of the function will be u' = u + ph + qh® + rh 3 +, &c.

and the ratio of the increments of the function and its variable,

- u ~ = P + qh + rh ’ +, &c.; an expression which, when h is supposed to decrease continually, has for its limit the first term p; and this limit will be different for different functions, there being such a connection between the function and its limit, that the one may be found from the other.

This property of the increments of a function and its variable suggests an important and extensive analytical theory, which will consist of two parts.

I. Any function of a variable quantity being proposed, to determine the limit of the ratio of the corresponding increments of the function and its variable.

II. On the other hand, having given the ratio of the increments, to find the function from which it has been derived.

These two inquiries constitute at bottom the Direct and Inverse Method of fluxions of Newton, the Differential and Integral Calculus of Leibnitz, and the Theory of Functions of Lagrange. Our present subject is the direct method of fluxions, or its equivalent, the differential calculus.

5. We have seen (4), that by the transition of a function, for example, u = x 2 , from one state of magnitude to another, by a change in the magnitude of its variable», it acquires the new value u' = u + 2xA + A®. The whole difference u' — u between its new and first values is 2xh + A 2 . It is the first term of this difference, viz. 2xh, that constitutes what is called the differential of the function from which it has been derived; and the determination of this first term for any function is the object of this first part of our calculus.

In like manner, in the function u = x 3 , which, when x becomes x + A, changes to u' = u + 3x ’ A + 3xA a +A 3 , the whole difference between the two states of magnitude of the function is 3x s A + 3xh i + A 3 , and its differential is 3x 2 A∙ And the whole difference between the first and succeeding value of the function u = x ’ is 4∙r 3 A + Qx t h l + 4∙rΛ 3 + A 4 , and its differential, is 4x 2 A∙ And, in general, whatever be the nature of the function u, if x + A be substituted in it instead of x, and the expression thus formed be expanded into a series, u+ph + qh ι + rh 3 +jA 4 , <⅛c∙ [7:9:643]the complete difference between the two states of the function is ph + qh t + rtf + sh* +, &c.

and its differential is the first term ph. '

In conformity with this definition, the differential of the 1 variable x itself will be its increment h, which, because of ' its use in generating the differential of the function, has ’ been designated by a peculiar symbol, viz. dx : here the 1 letter d is to be understood as a characteristic, not as a co-efficient. The letter d is also prefixed to the symbol for a function to denote its differential. Thus, supposing « = ?, we have du = 2xdx, an expression which means that the differential of the function w is equal to the differential of the variable multiplied by 2z as a co-efficient; so also, if u = a÷, the equation du = 3x t dx means that the differential of u is equal to the differential of x multiplied by 3a*.

6. Since, when u = a i , then du = 2xd⅛, this last expression may otherwise stand thus, = 2®; under this form 2x is the co-efficient in the expression for the differential of «, and it is on that account called the differential coefficient of the function u or 3?. In like manner, when u = 3?, then du — 3sPdx and Ļ- = 3x s ; in this case Sa: 8 dx is the differential co-efficient of the function u = x 3 . Tl>e general symbol for the differential co-efficient of any function w is ⅛, and the new value of u being w + ph +qh 2 dx

4-, &c. we have ⅛ = p, where p is some function of x, which depends on the form of the function w, and is deducible from it when its form is known.

To denote the differential of an expression formed in any way, we prefix the symbol d to the expression. Thus d{(α + x)(b i — ¢ 8 )} denotes the differential of a function produced by multiplying the factors a-ļ-x and b t — x 2 , and ^^ a ~l^ x ∖^∙ —— serves to denote its differen ce tial co-efficient.

The definition which has been given of a differential suggests immediately this rule for finding the differential of a function of a single variable.

Substitute X 4- h in the function instead of x; expand the expression thus formed into a series of terms composed of integer powers of h, and take the term which contains the first power of h for the differential, exchanging the letter h for the symbol dx.

Thus, let the function be w = ax + bs?, in which a and b are constants, then, putting x + h for x, and u , for the new value of w, we have

( = α(ie + A) + ⅛(x+A)≡

u' √ = ax + bx i + (a + 2bx) h + bh 2 ( = u+ (a + 2bx) h + bfŕ.

Here du, the differential of the function, is (α4^2Zκr)A, or (a + 2bx) dx, and = a + 2bx the differential co-efficient.

7. The rule given in last article, for determining the differential of a function, supposes that we have methods by which any function may be expanded into a seriesof terms, into each of which some integer power of the increment h enters only as a factor. It is sufficient for our purpose, however, if we can find that term of the series which contains the simple power of h; and this can in general be found easier than the general development, which indeed may be the very thing to be investigated by the calculus. Now we have seen (4) that the co-efficient of this term is the expression for the limit of the ratio of the corresponding increments of a function and its variable, and the same quantity is the differential co-efficient of the function (6), therefore the determination of the differential of a function is the same thing as the determination of the limit of the ratio of the increments.

Let the function be u = —; then u ’ = — t— τ, and X X τ A

ι a 2 a t — a t h u u ~ X + h X ~ X (x + A) ’ and the limit of the ratio of the increments is u , — u _ — a 8 h - X (x + h)'

Now, without expanding the expression for the limit, it is obvious that as h decreases, that expression approaches to — ‰ which is therefore ⅛ the differential co-efficient of x i dx the function; hence du = — ~ ~p~∙ ln 1 ** ce manner > “ being the general expression for any function, and d = u + ph + qk 2 +, &c. its expanded value when x + A is put instead of x, we have * z y - = p + ¢A +, &c.

and limit of — P = ^11 ∣ an ^ = P^ x ∙

According to this view of the subject, the differential calculus is the finding of the ratios of the simultaneous increments of a function and of the variable on which ií depends.

The process of calculation by which the differential of any function u is found, may be regarded as a particular operation performed on quantity, analogous to the elementary operations of algebra; and it may, like these, be distinguished by a particular name accordingly. The result of the process being the differential, the process itself is called differentiation, and to perform the process on a function is to differentiate the function.

8. It is material to observe, that the limit of the ratio of the increments of a function and its variable are the very same, whichever of the two be considered as a function of the other. Thus, u being a function of x, when x becomes X + A, u becomes u + ph + qhĩ + rA 3 +, &c. p, q, r, &c. being functions of x, deducible from the function u Let us put

A = ph + qh t 4- rh 3 +, See. so that the contemporaneous increments of x and u are h and A. Now, from the value of A, by the reversion of series (Algebra, art. 163), we find h =- k — ⅛A 8 4-,<fcc. P P 3

So that, regarding x as a function of u, when w becomer u + A, X becomes

-A—⅛A 8 4-,&c. P P ’ and the general expression for the ratio of the incre ments is |=1--2ä+,&c.

A P P ’ which has for its limit -, and the limit of the ratio τ is, aι p A

before, = p. ,

9. It is easy to see that two equal functions must hav⅛ equal differentials; for whatever be the value of the va [7:9:644]riable on which they depend, it must necessarily happen , that the respective changes they receive in consequence of the change which is attributed to the variable must also be equal. Thus, if u and v be two functions, such, that w = », whatever may be the value of x; and if, when x becomes x + h, then u becomes and v becomes v ’ , we shall have √ = v r , and u’ — u = υ' — v, and u' U l∕ V ~h ĥ—

If then p and q denote the limits of these ratios, p ~ q and pdx = qdx, that is, du = do.

From this it follows, that under whatever form a function appears, its differential is the very same quantity. For example, the differential of x 3 + a 3 will be identical with the differential of (x + a) (x t — ax + α s ), its equal.

The converse of this proposition is not generally true, and we should be wrong in affirming that two equal differentials belong to equal functions. For, let u = a + l>x be a function of x, then, substituting x + h for x, and putting w' for the new value of w, we have u' = a + bx

4- bh = u + bh, and - ~ “ = b. n

We see here that the constant a does not enter into the limit of the ratio of the increments, which would therefore be the very same for the function u = bx} hence it follows that the differential bdx belongs alike to a + bx, and to bx. Thus it appears, that in differentiating any function whatever, all the constant quantities combined with it, either by addition or subtraction, disappear. With respect to those which are connected by multiplication and division, they enter the result as co-efficients.

10. The differential of any function of a variable x maybe found by the general methods indicated in article 6; but it is convenient to have rules adapted to particular cases.

Let τ and s be two functions of a variable x. It is proposed to investigate a rule for finding the differential of u = rs, their product.

Suppose that by the substitution of x + ĥ for x in the functions τ and s, and their expansion, they become T T + ph + qh * +, &c · * ’ = * + F ’ A + ρ ⅛ 2 +, &c.

In these expressions, p, q,& c . represent functions of a⅛ derived from τ ; and p ʹ, tf, &c. other functions of x derived from λ Corresponding to these let u' denote r's>, the new value of the product rs = w. By actual multiplication we find √= rV=rs + (rp1 + sp )h + (rq + pg + sq)h*+,&c. Hence, putting u for rs, also transposing and dividing by h, there is got ~7 t “ = ηp , + φ + (rq , + pg +sç) Ä +, &C.

The terms τpf and sp in the second member of this equation are functions of x, which are independent of the function h; the following terms are all multiplied by h, therefore they decrease and vanish with it. So that limit of ratio --~ u . = rg + sp. Nowp = limit of⅛i, and q = limit of ≤+A « A

Instead of the limits of the ratios, let us put the differential co-efficients of the functions u, r, s (art. 6), and we find v '

du _ d⅛ rfr dx T dx s dx ’ and du = rds Ą-sdr.

Hence we have this rule, fraction ; from the differential of the numerator multiplied by the denominator subtract the differential of the denominator multiplied by the numerator, and divide by the square of the denominator.

The rule for the differential of u = - may be also symmetrically expressed thus:

du _ dr ds u ~ r l’ ’ and in general, if u = then įļļ _ i i dt dv dy u ~ r s ^ t ^ ~t ~ĩ ~ff'

For, by what has been shown, it appears that when u = — , then du _ d(rst) d(vy) u ~ τst vy '

Now⅛≤>=⅛ + ⅛ + ⅛

rst r s t' and ⅛)=⅛ + ⅛.

vy ® y To find the differential of the product of two functions, multiply the differential of each by the differential of the other function, and add the products.

11. Since, when u = rs, we have du = sdr + rds, it follows that du _ dr . ds u ~ ^r^ ^ t ~T’ If we suppose u = rtv, the product of three factors, by putting s = to, we have u = rs, and du dr ds u ~ r s’ but since s = tv, we have for the same reason <⅛ dt ; dv s t V ’ . e du dr dt , dv therefore — = 1 -∣ .

u r t V

By writing the product rs* instead of u, there is got, after proper reduction, du = tvdr + rvdt + rtdv.

In general, If a function be the product of any number of functions of a variable, its differential is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the differential of each by the product of all the other functions.

The same rule may also be briefly expressed in symbols, thus: whatever be the number of functions r, s, t, v, *('») = » {⅛ + ⅛ + ≤ + ⅛j.

12. To find the differential of a fraction whose numerator and denominator are functions of a variable x s let u =

-, then r — us, and dr — uds + sdu, and, putting for u its value —, , rds , dr = — -f- sdu ; therefore, du = ^r-~rds s l

Hence we have this rule: To find the differential of a [7:9:645] , „ du dr , ds , dt dυ dy therefore, — = 1 + — ∙

w r s t V y

It also follows, from what has been shown, that if the numerator of a fraction consist of any number of factors r, s, t, and the denominator of any number v, y, then s rstì _ rşţ s <fr . ds . dţ dv dy 1

l tÿĵ - vy ∖ r s t υ y ĵ *

13. We shall next investigate a rule for the differential of any power of a function y, which may be either itself an independent variable, or else some function of another variable.

First, let u = y n , n beiŋg any whole number. The function may be put under this form, u-y y∙y y∙∙. to “terms, and then (11) we have d A = d A + ⅛ +⅛- + ⅛... to n terms; u y y y y thatis,⅛=⅛

u y , , ndy , , and du = -įŗ u = ny n ~ 1 dy.

Next, let us suppose that the function has a fractional m exponent, and that w = y n , then u n = y m , and nw"— 1 du = my m — 1 dy, by art. 9, and du = 1 - dy ; — m — — but u = y n and w”— 1 = y n ;

√-1 1 therefore —— i =v" , u n ~ 1 *

- ι and du = — y n

Lastly, let us suppose n to be a negative whole number or fraction, so that u = — . In this case we may apply the rule for a fraction (12); and observing that the numerator here is a constant, of which the differential must be accounted = 0, we have

* = - a +⅛ = -"J ‘ŵ.·

thus it appears, that whether n be whole or fractional, positive or negative, d(y n ) = ny n ~ l dy.

Hence this rule: To differentiate any power of a function, multiply it by the exponent, diminish the exponent by an unit, and multiply by the differential of the variable. If the function have a co-efficient, the differential must be multiplied by that co-efficient. Thus d(ax n ) = nax n — 1 dx.

The determination of the differential of a power of a variable might have been shortened by assuming the truth of the binomial theorem, as found in our article Algebra, art. 160, 161. That theorem however may be derived from the differential calculus, and we shall give its investigation as one of its applications.

It frequently happens that the differential of √y = y ∖ , the square root of a function, is to be found; therefore a rule for that case will be convenient. By the general rule for a power,

<*(y 4 ) = ģy 4— λ dy = ⅛y - ½> that is, d(√y) =

Hence it appears that the differential of the square root of a function is the diff'erentiaΓof the function divided by twice its square root.

14. Let y be a function of a variable x, and let u be a function of y; it is proposed to investigate a rule for finding the differential of u relatively to x.

Suppose x to change its value and become x + h, then y becomes ↑f — y j r ph + qh ’ + rh 3 +, &c.; or, putting ph 4- qh 2 + rh 3 +, &c. = k, y becomes y + k. But u being a function of y, when y becomes y + k, then u becomes u' = u + ph + <fh l + r ’ k s +, &c.; here i∕, q ’ , ι ’ , &c. denote certain functions of y, which are independent of k and also of h. Hence, by substituting for k in this last series, its value ph + qh i + ,&c., it appears that when x becomes x + h, u becomes u' — u + ptph + (pfq + q ’ p i ) h i +, &c.

and hence —y- =I , P ÷ (1 9 '<Z + +> &c ·

Suppose now ä to decrease continually, we have ,. . ~vι — u . limit of —— ≡ pp∙

Now, y being a function of x, p = and u being considered as a function of y, ÿ = ; but if we consider u as a function of x, then du ,. . ω'— u

- = l un ’ t- = pp.

Hence it follows that du _ du dy dx~ dy dx' m idu=(1×∙1 ∖ d.. ∖ dy dx)

Hence this rule: To find, relatively to x, the differential of u, a function of y, the quantity y being a function of X, Find the differential co-efficient of u considered as a function of y only, and the differential co-efficient of y considered as a function of x; multiply the product of these co-efficients by the differential of x, and the result is the differential of u.

It has been found that du dy_du. dy dx dx ’

Now if we suppose that u = x, then this expression becomes dx ⅞∕ _ dx _ dy dx~ dx ’ and hence it appears that dx 1_

dy ~ dy dx

This shows that the differential co-efficient of x considered as a function of y, is the reciprocal of the differential co-efficient of y considered as a function of x, a conclusion which may also be deduced from art. 8.

15. Let V, y, z be functions of a variable x, and let it be proposed to find the differential of u = a ∙j~ by -ļ-cy — ez, where a, b, c, e, denote constants.

Let us suppose that when x becomes x + h, then V becomes v + ph + qK i +, &c. y becomes y + p!h + qh i +, &c. z becomes z + ffh + <fh i +, &c.
[7:9:646]

Let √ be the corresponding value of u, so that sa + bυ + cy—ez

“=

V∙ + , &C.

Hence, putting for the first term of the second member of the equation its value u, and transposing and dividing by Ä, we get

~~y^ = bp + cp∕ — ejf + lbq + ccf — eq p )h, &c.

And passing-to the limits, observing that the limit of” “is the differential co-efiicient of u, also that p, p', and ff are the differential, co∙efiicients of v, y, and z respectively, we get du _ bdv . cdy edz dx ~ dx dx dx ’ and du = bdy + cdy — edz.

From this it appears that the differential of a function made up of others simply by addition and subtraction is composed in like manner of the differentials of the several terms, each with the sign of the function from which it was derived; the differential of a constant being reckoned = 0.

16. These rules are sufficient for the differentiation of any explicit algebraic function, and we shall now give examples.

1. Let u = ax∙ ; this is a particular case of the general function w = ax n ; therefore, by the rule (13) du = 3ax κ dx.

2. Let u=^ = ax~ 6 ∙, then du = — 5ax^ t dx=~^ dx .

3. L,etu=Vx 3 =xs∙, in this case du= ⅛x⅛dx = ⅛dxVx.

4. Let u = ax 3 + bx i + ex + e ; then du = 3ax s dx + 2bxdx + cdx, or du ≡ (3ax t + 2bx + c)dx.

Here the constant e, which is a term of the function, has disappeared by the differentiation.

5. Let u = (α + bx n )P ; we may put y = a + bx 1i , and then u = if f ; and du = py p ~ λ dy.

Now √ ’ ~ 1 = (a + bx n ) p ~ 1 , and dy = bnx n ~ i dx∙, therefore du = bnp (a + bx π ) p ~ 1 x n ~ 1 dx.

We might have dispensed with using the symbol y, and regarded a + ôar" as a single function, and u as a power of that function, and found the differential by the rule of art. 13.

As an example of the rule of art. 10, for the product of two functions,

6. Let u — 3? (α + x) t ; put p = x 3 , and q — (α + x) i ; then u z=pq, and du = qdp -ļ- pdq.

Now dp = 3x t dx, and dq = 2 (α + x) dx ; therefore du = 3x i la + xfdx + 2x 3 (a + x) dx = x i (a + x) (3a + 5x) dx.

In practice, the introduction of the symbols p and q may be omitted.

7. Let « = X (1 + χ) (1 + sty. In this case, a is the product of three functions; therefore, by the rule of art. 11, du = ( 1 + x) ( 1 + aŕ) dx+X ( 1 + a:») dx + 2a? ( 1 + x) dx. This, when abbreviated by multiplication, becomes du = (1 + 2 X + 3a? + 4a?) dx.

We might have proceeded otherwise by the rule </(,«)=„+ + .⅛ + ⅛j; accordingly, we would have had

= *< 1 + ’><> + {⅛ + ĪŦĨ + ī¾}’ an expression reducible to the former.

8. As an example of a fractional function, let « = î we have, following the rule of art. 12, , (I + x s ) dx — 2 x i dx (1— x i )dx du = ΓΓ+7+ = 7Γ + py-∙

9. Again, let a = ÿįĴĮ. 1 = ’ this W

exemplify the rule

Accordingly, making x — r, a? + 1 = sr, ar 4 — a? ⅛ 1 — t, we have

, a? + X fdx, 2xdx (4a? — 2ar) dx I

* = r=7TΤ 1 ī ÷Γ÷J- >-z'÷τ ι

This by reduction becomes

. —{.τ fi + 4ar 4 — 4a?—1 }√ar dil ~ (ar 4 -x≈+ I)« '!

10. As an example of the rule in art. 14, let a = 3y', and y = x 3 + ax ; then d A = <>y, ⅛ = 3ar* + α,∙ dy 3 ’ dx g ∙⅛ = 6y (3ar≡ + a) = 18 i ⅛, + 6ay, and du = . . dx = 18a⅞∕dar + Gaydx.

We may in such an example proceed otherwise, thus; because a = 3y t , du = 6ydy ; and since y — x ’ + ax, dy = 3a^ + adx, substitute this value of dy in the expression for du, and it becomes du = 18Ŵ/ + 6aydx, the same as before.

17. The subjects which are to follow require the application of the binomial theorem, we shall therefore give its investigation, as the first application of the calculus.

Supposing n to be any number whatever, whole or fractional, positive or negative, it is easy to infer, from the consideration of particular cases, that

(1 + rr)" = 1 + A∙r + Bx 2 + Cx s + Dar 4 +, &c., the co-efficients A, B, C, &c., in the series being numbers altogether independent of x, and deducible from the index n alone. The expression (1 + x) n and its development being equal for all values of x, they form an identical equation, and must have equal differentials, hence (art,∙9) we have, taking the differential of each term, nl 1 + a:)" -1 dx= Adx + 2Baŵ+3Cx*d⅛ + 4Dx 3 dr+, &c. Leaving now dx out of each term, and multiplying both sides by 1 + x, the result is n(l+x)"=A÷ (A + 2B>+(2B + 3C>e s + (3C÷4D)α d

+ ,&c.

But from the assumed series we have n(l + x)" = n + nAx + mBx 2 + nCx 1 +, &c.

Now the terms of these two expansions of «(1 + a:)* 1 must be identical; therefore

A = n, A = n;

A + 2Β = nA, B = ⅛~>A∙,

2B + 3.C = »B, ∙ and hence < C = B;

3C + 4D = nD,

By substituting for A its value in B, and for B the resulting value in C, and so on, there is found (l + ⅛∙ s l⅛ + ^ + !⅞⅛5r + fe . and again, by putting instead of x, and multiplying both sides of the equation by a", we get (a + x)" = a n 4- ţ a n ~' x + x l

18. In the investigation of the binomial theorem we have employed a principle of analysis of continual use in the calculus, namely, that in such an equation as this (called an Identical Equation), a+bx+cx i +ex s +bc., =A + Bz÷Cz 2 + Ex 3 + &c.(l.) in which a, b, c, &c., A, B, C, &c. are constants, and x is variable; in order that the equation may hold universally true, it is necessary that a = A, b = B, c ≡ C, e = E, &c. For since x is indeterminate, we may suppose it to decrease untd it vanish; then all the terms into which it enters also vanish, and we have a = A; therefore, leaving these equal terms out of both sides of (1), and dividing all the remaining terms by x, we get b + ex + ex t +, &c., = B + ex + Eï ! +, &c. (2.) By proceeding with this equation as with the former, we obtain b ~ B, c = C, e = E, &c., and so on.

19. We come now to the investigation of the differentials of transcendental functions of a variable, and begin with the exponential function u = α x , the exponent x being variable, and the quantity a constant. Assuming that when x becomes x + A, w becomes w, we have w = α x , tf = d* + *=α* A therefore, u' — u = a x a h — a x = a x la h — 1);

. u' — w χd l — 1 and — ī — = a — τ — . h n

The determination of the limit of the ratio of the increments requires that we determine the limit to which the value of the fraction a tends when A is supposed to decrease continually. Let us put a = 1 + c ; by the binomial theorem (art. 17), .*=(i+√=> ÷⅛t⅜t ¾y∙ ι +

&c.

therefore, ~=c+ ~1Γ~ c °^ + c 3 + &c.

Now A being supposed to decrease continually, the second side of this formula manifestly approaches to c →' + ⅛=P + =Γ7-f-√+ &c · that is, to ♯ — ļc* ÷ ⅜c 3 — ⅛c 4 ψ, &c.

Therefore, limit of — ~-- = Nap. log a, and hence, = limit “- = ar (Nap. log a), and du = (Nap. log α) a x dx.

We have now this rule for differentiating a function which is a variable power of a constant quantity.

Multiply the function by the differential of the variable index, and by Napier’s log. of the constant quantity. Note. — The logarithm of a number a, in any system whatever, will in what follows be expressed by the abbreviation log a ; but when the system is that of Napier, we shall denote it thus, 1. a.

That is, The differential of the logarithm of a number is found by multiplying the differential of the number by the modulus of the system and dividing by the number. Note In Napier’s system M = 1.

21. The differentials of the trigonometrical functions sin X and cos x are next to be investigated.

Letu=sinx,andu ’ =sin lx + A); then (Algebra, 240), u' — u = sin lx + A) — sinaι = 2 cos (a: + ⅛A) sin ⅜A, , u'— u . , 1 1 . sin. A A

and —— = cos (x + ⅛ A) ∣- 1-.

Next let u — cos x, and u’ = cos lx + A) we have now u' — u = cos lx + A)—cos X = —2 sin lx + ⅜ A) sin įh ; d — u . , 1 . ,. sin ⅜ A

Passing now to the limits by supposing A to decrease continually, du ,. . u'— u

and du = — dx sin x.

Hence it appears that The differential of the sine of an arc is the product of the differential of the arc and its cosine : [7:9:648]and that the differential of the cosine is the product of the differential of the arc and its sine with the sign — prefixed. Note. — The negative sign indicates, that while the arc increases the cosine decreases when it is positive.

The differential of the cosine might have been found otherwise, by regarding it as a function of the sine. Thus, putting V for the sine, and y for the cosine; because ∕∕- ≡ 1 — c 2 , by differentiating, ydy = — vdv ; now x being the arc, dυ = ydx ; therefore ydy = — vydx, and dy = — υdx.

22. The functions a = tan x, u = cot x, &c. may be considered as formed from the elementary functions sin x and cos x.

(1.) Let a = tan x = ~~, then (art ∙ 12 and 20), du _d (sin x~) cos X — d (cos x) sin x cos 2 x _ (cos 2 X + sin a a )d⅛ ^ dx

Hence, again, du = dx sec 2 # = dx(l + tan 2 #).

there are the reverse functions, u = arc (sin = #),»= arc (cos #), &c.

The first, viz. the arc whose sine is #, is sometimes by British writers expressed thus; w = sin -1 # ,∙ and the second, the arc whose cosine is #, thus; u = cos x~ 1 .

24. Having now found rules for the differentiation of the elementary transcendentals and trigonometrical functions, we proceed to exemplify their application to the differentiation of complex functions.

(1.) Let the function be u — x y , that is a variable x raised to a power y, a function of the variable.

By the theory of logarithms 1. u = y 1. #.

Put V = 1. u and z — 1. #; then v = yl ; and do = ydz + zdy (art. 10).

Now do = d(l u) = andtfe = d(l.#) = —(20); therefore, ~ = + 1. #. dy, = u ^dx + l x.dy I

(2.) If u = x x , then, by last example, du = x x 11 +1. #| dx.

(3.) Let u=a ; put b x = y, then u = α y , and du = 1. a a y dy, also dy = 1. b. b x dx (19); therefore du ≡ 1. a . 1. b. a dx.

In the following examples we shall suppose the logarithms to be those of Napier’s system.

26. As examples of complex angular functions s

(1.) Let« = tan 1 x; that is, let w be the arc whose tangent is x, and let z — cos nu cos” u. dz

It is proposed to find the differential co-efficient

In the first place, du ~ —^ĩ— — dx cos 2 u, sec 2 u { = — ndu (sin nu cos” w + cos nu sin u cos" w) = — ndu cos" 1 u (sin nu cos u + cos nu sin u) = — ndu cos" -1 u sin (n + 1) u, and = — n sin (n + 1) u cos" +1 u.

(2.) Next, “being the same function of x as before, let z = sin nu cos” w, to find the differential co-efficient

In this case, Í = ndu (cos nu cos” u — sin nu sin u cos" -1 w) = ndu cos" -1 u (cos nu cos u — sin nu sin u) = ndu cos" 1 w cos (n + 1) u, and A = n cos (n + I) u cos" + 1 w∙

Successive Differentiations.

27. A function of a variable, when differentiated, produces a new function, viz. its differential co-efficient. This in its turn may be differentiated, and there will be produced another differential co-efficient, which will stand in the same relation to the former as that did to the original function. By another differentiation, a third differential co-efficient may be formed; and so on continually, unless some differential co-efficient come out = 0.

For example, from the function u = x n , we deduce ⅛ = n ®" 1 : putting nowp = nx l 1 , we hence derive the differential co-efficient ⅛ = n (n — Dx n ~ 2 ∙, and putting q=n(n-D χ n - 8 , we find ⅛= n(n — 1 ) (n— 2)x n ~ 3 . We may proceed in this way, until the result of a differentiation be a constant, and then the process will stop; but in some cases it may be continued indefinitely.

There is an appropriate notation to express the relation in which the successive differentials, p, q, &c. stand to the original function w, from which they have been derived: since d (- ∖ du , dp ., . ∖ dx) p = -, and q = -ý-, therefore q = l·—- ; r dx ,1 t jχ 1 dx

The symbol d will be more simply expressed by d 2 w. dx ; and thus we have _du _dp_ (Pu _ V ~ dx q~ dx~ dx 2 ’ so that by the expression q = it is to be understood that q is the result of two differentiations performed on the function w, the differential of the variable, viz. dx, being considered as constant.

From the function q we may now deduce _ dq d 3 u r - dx~ dx i ' and so on continually; but the different import of the characters d 3 u and d⅛ 3 must be carefully attended to; the former implies that the operation of differentiation has been performed three times on the function w, and the latter denotes the third power of dx. The combination of the two, , expresses the function that results from the three differentiations, in each of which the factor dx has been left out, and the final result divided by ita third power, or, if retained, that it has been regarded as constant.

(1.) As a particular case of the function w = a®", let u=asfi ; then 5a®*, = 4∙5αx 3 ,

5=≈3∙4∙5∞ 2 , ⅛=2∙3∙4∙5<∞, dx 3 dx A

^=2∙3∙4∙5α.

a ’ x

In this example we have come to a differential co-efficient which is a constant, and the series stops; but if the index of the power ®" be a fraction or negative, the series may be continued indefinitely.

The expression is called the first differential co-efficient of the function u, or the differential co-efficient of the first order ; those which follow are called the second, third, &c. or the differential co-efficients of the second, third, &c. orders.

In the case of the function « = ar s , writers on the calculus of fluxions call du-=z 5x i dx the first fluxion of the function; d°-u = 20z 3 d⅛ s its second fluxion; (Pu = 60jA⅛* its third fluxion; and so on, the terms of the series constituting the different orders of fluxions.

28. We have assumed for the foundation of the differential calculus an important analytical principle, first particularly recognised by Euler, viz. Let ∕z) denote any function of a variable quantity a:,· if instead of x there be substituted x + h, h being any indeterminate quantity, so that the function becomes Jlx + A), this new value may always be expanded into a series of this form, ytø+rÄ + çÄ’ + rÄ’+.&c., in which the quantities p, q, &c. are new functions of x derived from the primitive function, and independent of the indeterminate quantity A.

29. The truth of this principle has been exemplified by induction from particular cases. Lagrange has, however, given a demonstration of it in his Théorie des Fonctions, which is to the following effect:

In the first place, the development of the function (x + A) cannot contain any fractional power of A, so long as x is entirely indeterminate. For the radicals of h can only come from radicals in the primitive function; and it is manifest that the substitution of x + h instead of a: can neither increase nor diminish their number, nor change their nature, while x and h are indeterminate. On the other hand, by the theory of equations, every radical expression has as many different values as there are units in its exponent; from which it follows, that every irrational function has as many distinct values as there are combinations of the different values of the radicals which it contains. Therefore, if the development of the function ∕(x + A) could contain a term of the form uh n , the functional· must necessarily be irrational, and contain a certain number of different values, which must be the same for its development; but this development being represented by the series flx) + ph + qh i 4-, &c. + uh n 4-, Ac. every value of the function/(z) (the first term). might be combined with each of the n values of the radical n √x m , so that the function ∕ lx + h) ex panded would have more values than the same function unexpanded, which is impossible.

This demonstration is general and rigorous so long as x and A continue indeterminate; but it fails if determinate values be given to x, for it may happen that these values may destroy some radicals in the function flx), which may yet exist in the function flx 4- A).

30. It being proved that the development of the function cannot have any fractional powers of A, it is easy to be assured that it cannot contain negative powers. For if among the terms one had the form m being a positive integer number, then, in making A = 0, that term would become infinite, and the function lx + A), and of course ∕lx), would in this case be infinite, which cannot be, unless a particular value be given to x. Thus it is clearly established that the development of the function can contain neither fractional nor negative exponents.

31. The general form of the development of the function, viz.

f(x + A) =f(x) + ph + qh i + rA 3 +, &c.

being thus ascertained, the next question is, what is the law of relation between the original function flx) and the functions p, q l r, &c. which are derived from it? We owe the discovery of this relation to a celebrated English mathematician, Brooke Taylor, who gave it in his Methodus Incrementorum, published in the year 1715 in the form of an analytical theorem, which is now called by his name: we shall now give its investigation. The following is that of Lagrange.

Let∕(x) = n: be any function of x ; then, supposing a: to become x + A, u becomes flx + h) — u + ph + qh 1 + rA 1 + sir 4-, &c.

Suppose now that x changes again its value, and becomes x + A, and here A, like A, is independent of x. Then flx + A) becomes flx 4^ A 4- A).

There are two ways of finding what the series fl χ ÷ h')-uA ph + qh 1 + rA 3 + sA 4 · +, &c. becomes, when x + A becomes a: + A + A. ls⅛ We may have the value of the series by substituting A -fA in every term instead of A. 2<ZZy, We may also have its value by substituting x + A in the functions p,q, r, s, &c. for x ; that is, instead of p, and q, and r, &c. we must put the values they have when x + k is supposed to be substituted in them instead of x.

By the first-mentioned process wefind∕(ar + A + A) = w+ ph + qh ι + rk 3 + sh* +, &c.

+ pk + 2qhk + 3rA s A + 4sA 3 A +, &c.

+ gA s + 3rAA 8 + 6sA⅝ s +, &c.

+ rK> + 4sAA 3 +, &c.

+ sA 4 , +, &c.

And, in employing the second, it must be considered that, when x becomes x + A, then

“becomes u + pk + qt? -J- rk 3 + sk i +, &c. because A here takes the place of A in the function flx + A), and its development « + ph + qh- + rh 3 +, &c.

The supposition that x changes its value to x + A, leads to corresponding changes in the functions^, q, r, &c. ; so that p becomes p + p∕k + pTk l 4- pfh? 4-, &c.

s . . . i 4- i ¾ + s -A≡ 4- s"Α 3 +, &c.

&c.
[7:9:651]

Here p ’, p", &c. denote functions of x derived from p, just as p, q, r, &c. are derived from the function u; and a like remark applies to į, <f', &C-also to τ , , r n , &c. and so on. Substituting now these new values of u, p, q, r, &c. in the series u + ph + qh i + τh i + sh* +, &c. we have∕(x + h + k) = u + pk + qk i + r⅛ 3 + sk i +, &c.

By comparing the co-efficients of like powers, or products of powers, of h and k in the two expressions for f(x + Ä + ⅛), it appears that, to make them identical, we must have 2q = g, ’ ir-q ’ , 4s = r ’ , and so on.

Therefore q = y, τ = -y, s= -τ, &c.

Now, by the definition of a differential, pdx is the differential of u, where p is the co-efficient of A in the series « + ph + qh t +, &c. Therefore p = Similarly, q , dx is the differential of q, where tį is the co-efficient of k in the development q — fk∙ i τ q"k 2 +, &c.

These values of p, q, r, s, &c. being substituted in the series u + ph + qh 2 + r∕ι 3 + sh i +, &c. we obtain ∕(∙+A) =

32. We shall now give another investigation of this important formula, which is remarkable for its brevity and simplicity. It rests on the following analytic principle.

If u be any function whatever of v 4^ z, which relation may be expressed thus, u = s(v + z);íAE differential co-effi- cient of u, found on the supposition that v is variable and z constant, will be the very same as if it were found on the supposition that ι is vanable and. v constant. To exemplify this in particular cases, suppose w= (v +z) n , then, making υ variable and z constant, A = n(v-J- z) n ~~ 1 ; and making z variable and v constant, ^-= «(«+»)* 1 , the same as before. Again, let u = a v *^ z = α 0 a z , then ^and~ are expressed by the same quantity Lα.α c a x = J.a a v+ *.

The truth of the principle is almost self-evident; for if we make v + z — x, so that∕(v + z) =flx) ; then, who ther we suppose v to vary and to become υ + A, while z remains the same, or z to vary and become z + h, while V remains constant, the result is the very same, viz.

f(v + z + h)-f(x + A); therefore, in the development of f (v + z + A) = f ix + h), viz.

/(«) + PA + ≠ 2 + rÄ’ +, &c. in which p, q, &c. are functions of x; that is, of v + z, these functions will be the very same, whichever of the two, V and z, has been considered as the variable, the other remaining constant. Now, by the nature of a differential (art. 7), we have n - <H∕(⅜<*{∕(→*)} . p dx d{v + z) ’ and upon the supposition that v is variable and z constant, then d{∕(→z)} . p dυ ’ but supposing z variable and v constant, f ,= <⅜∕<→*>} .

theref <, re ⅛⅛i A< dv ∙lz the first side of this equation being the result of the differentiation, supposing v variable, and the second the result, on the hypothesis that z is variable. Since the two . d{f(υ + z)} , d{(v + z)} ., . .

expressions --, — and ’ -t ω ∙ c identical r dv dz and the same function of v + z, we may represent that function by the symbol F (t> + z); then, by reasoning as before, we shall have tZ{F(o÷z)} _ d{F(t> + *)} dυ l dz i

Thus it appears that the second differential co efficient of the function f(v + z) is the same expression, whether v or z be regarded as the variable; and the reasoning may be extended to the co-efficient of any order.

33. Supposing now f(x) = u to beany function of x, and f (x -{- h) = u! to be its value when x becomes x + h, it has been proved (art. 29, 30), tłiat the expansion of u is u’ = u + ph + qh i + rh 3 + sh i -, and herep, q, r, &c. are functions of x, into which x does not at all enter; while, on the other hand, h is entirely independent of x. From the identity of the function w and its expansion, their differentials, taken on the same hypothesis, must be equal, whichever of the quantities x and h be regarded as the variable. Supposing, first, x variable and h constant, we have ^ = įl + ţ. h + ^,P + d '^ + d -Lh 3 +,&c. dx dx dx dx dx dx and next, supposing h to be variable and x constant, ţļ =ph + ïqh + 3rl? + 4sŵ> +, Ac.

This is the well-known binomial theorem (Algebra, art. 160).

35. Next, let ∕ (x) be u = a x , a variable power of the constant quantity a. Then, putting

A =(α-1)-⅛ (a-1) 2 + ⅜(aD 5 -⅛(a-1)< ÷, &c. B, article 19, g=Aa', g = A∙ a’, g = A><,*, g = A. a ∙,Ac

and if we make x = —, we have

Hence it appears that a^ is a constant number, which is the sum of this series. By taking the sum of a sufficient number of its terms, we find a A = 2∙718281828459.

Let this number, which will frequently recur, be denoted ’ by the letter e, and we have a A = e, and a = e* and z∙ ax _ z, x _ i -i- a - _l A⅛ s A⅛ 3 1 A 4 X t , „ + + 1.2 + 1.2.3 + 1.2.3.4 +, * c,i l and making y = Ax, so that y may be any number, / = 1 + y + X + _£_ + __g_ + ,&c.

Make x = 1, and observe that log 1 = 0, and change h into X, and we have log (1 +®) = -i|a:—⅛a* + ja 5 — įx*+, &c.ļ

This is the logarithm of 1 -f- x in the system whose base is a.

In the preceding article we found that a = e*, hence, from the theory of logarithms (Algebra, sect, xix,), A is the logarithm of a to the base e. Now

A = d-l-⅜(α-D 2 + ⅜(α- ]∕-RaD 4 , + ,⅛c∙ Therefore, in the system whose base is e 9 l°g α = β-1 —⅛(α-D 8 + ⅛(α-1∕-⅛(α-1)«; and hence, putting l-∣-αι for a, and x for a— 1, in that system, log(l+<r) = a ,- &c .

Now we found that in the system whose base is a, log(l+^) = 1{ 1 -i^+jr j -^ + , & c .}

By comparing these two expressions for log (l+ar), it appears that in the system whose base is e, the constant quantity A, which is e - 1 -⅜(e - ι∕+⅜(e - ıy_ +e_ 1 )4 +1 &c .

is equal to unity. Logarithms computed according to this system are the same as those first given to the world by Napier, the celebrated inventor of logarithms, who was, however, led to them by a very different path from that here followed. It so happens that the same logarithms express hyperbolic areas, and hence they were called hyperbolic logarithms, a distinction quite improper, because hyperbolic areas may be expressed by logarithms of any system. Accordingly, it is now common to denominate them, in lwnour of the inventor, Napierian logarithms. In speaking of these, then, it must be understood that their base is e=2∙718281828459, &c.; and remembering that the letter 1 prefixed to any expression of a function means Napier’s logarithm of that function (art.

Then sin (ar-J-A) = P sin ar + Q cos a⅛ cos (ar-į-A) = P cos ar — Q sin ar.

Hence, by eliminating Q and P in succession, sin (x+fι ∖ sin ar+cos (ar-J-7ι) cos x = P, sin (ar-į-Ä) cos x — coS (ar+A) sin ar = Q.

Therefore (Algebra, 239), cos A=P, sin A = Q; and exchanging A for ar, e 08 X = 1 “T* ŽĀł—≡Zδ + ' &C> a? , x 5 x> , s” x - x 2.3 + 2.3.4.5 2.3.4.5.6.7 +, &C ’

38. Let the function be the arc whose tangent is ar, that is, « = tan -1 x; dsc then du ≡ yψ^y = dx cos 2 u (art. 23), , du and = cos w cos u.

a formula due to James Gregory. We have found this series in a very different way (Algebra, art. 270), and have there applied it to the determination of the ratio of the diameter to the circumference. It will be therefore sufficient to state the result here. Let <r denote half the circumference of a circle, of which the rad. = 1, then <= 3∙ 141592653590—.

Macíaurin’s Theorem.

39. There is a general formula nearly related to that of Taylor, and indeed an easy deduction from it, commonly called Maclaurins Theorem. It is given at page 610 of the second volume of his fluxions (printed in 1742); but it is proper to say, that the same formula, in substance, was given in 1717 by Stirling, in his Lineoe Tertii Ordines Neutonianoe, p. 32.

We have found that/(a:) = u being any function of a variable x, „ ,, ∖ , du, . (Pu h t 1 d 3 u A 3 d i u A 4 ,

From this it appears, that provided u be such a function of x as admits of being expanded into a series of the form u = A + Bz + Car + ^Dx t +, &c.

where A, B, C, D, &c. are constant quantities, then, U being the value of u when x = 0, and U ’ 1 U", U ’ ", &c. being[7:9:654] the values of the differential co-efficients⅛ζ *⅛ ¾ , dx dχdx i &c. found on that hypothesis, we have

This is Maclaurin’s theorem, of which we shall now give some applications.

The formula w = log x does not admit of being expanded into a series of the prescribed form, for in this case Ŝ = Ăi ; thβ su PP osition that x = 0 makes wand ⅛ as well as all the following differential co-efficients, infinite.

For example, let u = b + lx — α)⅛; in this case, du 1 <Pu _ 1_

and by the theorem, flx + K) = b + lx — α + A)⅛ ≡≡ i+(ar — a)^ + 1 ä s h* +, &c.

Now if we give to x any particular value greater than a, the development is perfectly significant, and expresses truly the value of b + lx—a + h)⅛. If however we give to x the particular value a, then x — α = 0, and the development becomes b -f- 0 + — +, &c.

2(0)’ 8(0)’

from which no conclusion whatever can be drawn, because all the terms having zero in the denominator are infinite, if in the expression b + lx — a ⅛ A)^ we make x = α, it becomes b + A^ r . This expression has two values, viz. 5 + √A, b — Vh. The development given by the theorem contains, however, only positive integer powers of k ; therefore it can have only a single value; and hence it is impossible that it should express the function in the . particular case ofat= a. In such cases the theorem has been said to fail ; this however happens not from any imperfection in the theorem, but merely because it is unsuitable to the purpose to which it has been applied; and this want of applicability is indicated by the co-efficients of the powers of h failing to express any thing definite.

46. Again, let the function be « = ∙,—; then

If we make x = a in 7— ţ — A ·,· , x , , the function to be (x + a + A) t b —— 2

expanded, it becomes = bh , an expression in which the exponent of h is negative; therefore this case cannot be included in a formula which contains only positive integers of Ä, and hence the apparent failure of the theorem.

47. That a general formula should not express all particular cases, was at one time regarded as a kind of paradox in analysis. Lagrange first cleared up this point, and showed, that when by giving particular values to x, the new state of the function contains terms of the form m PA , or QΛ n , that is, negative or fractional powers of A, then, from the very nature of the calculus, all the co-efficients in the general development after a certain term will become infinite. On the other hand, when a particular value of x renders the co-efficients infinite, we may conclude that the development in that case ought to contain fractional or negative powers of A. In such particular cases as appear not to admit of expansion by Taylor’s theorem, other methods deducible from the calculus are applicable; in general, the ordinary algebraic methods are sufficient.

Differentiation of Equations of two Variables.

48. We have as yet differentiated only equations in which the variables were separated, such as this, y = a + b x + ca 2 , where y is an implicit function of x. But the equations which chiefly occur in analytical inquiries contain for the most part the two variables combined or mixed together; as in this equation, y 8 — 2 mxy + ar≈ — a i = 0.

If we suppose the equation resolved, so that y is expressed in terms of x only, which gives y = mx →= √α* + (m*_ Dar, the differentials may be found by the rules already explained. In general, however, the variables cannot be so separated, and therefore it is necessary that we be able to determine the differential co-efficients of a function by other means.

49. An equation formed in any way from two independent variable quantities may be represented by the general symbol

∕(ar > y) = 0 ∙

The variable y must be expressible in some way by x; therefore we may represent its value, however found, by the equation y = X, where X denotes an expression made up of terms containing only x and constant quantities. When this value of y is substituted in the equation, it becomes f(x, X) = 0.

This is an identical equation, involving x only, which must hold true whatever value be given to x. Let the expression f (x, X)=f (x, y) be denoted briefly by «. Suppose now x to change its value and become x + A; by Taylor’s theorem, its new values will be , 1 du, , d i u ,. 1 d?u ...

’ ľ= “+ to A + ^ A + rf? A +,&C ·

The equation f lx, y) = w = 0 must hold true whatever value be given to x ; therefore we must have w = 0, and this requires that the co-efficients of the different powers of the indeterminate quantity A be separately = 0 (art. 18), so that from the equation u =,flx, y) = 0 there may be derived a series of equations, du n d- ∣ ι n d 3 u „ „ - r = 0 > τ-,≡ 0> Ĵ-S = 0 > &C. dx , dx t ’ dx 3 ’ which must all hold true at the same time as the original equation.

50. Let us take for example the equation y 2 + x 2 = a 2 , or y 2 + x 2 — a t = 0 ,.(l.)

in which a is a constant quantity; in this case, u — f i + 3? — α ’; hence we have by differentiation g⅛*4+*-*

-⅛=-≡ «·

To determine the differential co-efficient of the second order, put ĝ = p, and we have d A=2yp+2x i as p is a function of x and y, and y is a function of x, therefore p is a function of a.·. Taking now the differentials, and dividing by dx, the result is

observing that p and q are functions of x and y, and consequently of x, we may find by differentiation an expression which will involve, besides x and y, these quantities, dyip_ļy n _^y n _py, dx 1 dx dx 2 ' dx i ' $ dx ’ and from this equation ⅛ ≡ may be determined, ob- diy , du , , , , . serving that and jġ are expressed by x and y in equations (4) and (2).

51. The preceding analysis gives the following rule for [7:9:656]determining the differential co-efficients of y, a function of x, when the relation between x and y is expressed by an equation.

Take the differentials of the terms of the equation, considering y as a function of x, and dividing by dx, the result will be an equation which gives the value of ĝ. Again, take the differentials of the terms of this equation, ^considering y and ĝ as functions of x, and the result will be an equation involving and ĝ, which, combined with the former, serves to determine ⅛( A third equa- dx 3 tion may be found from this, by taking the differentials, and considering y, and ĝ, as functions of x; and this, combined with the other two, gives -ĝ, and so on to any number of equations.

Let y be such a function of x that y i — 2 mxy + x i — a t = 0 (1.)

It is proposed to determine its differential co-efficients.

By a first differentiation (y — mx) dy — (my — x) dx = 0, and ⅛=^. (2 ,)

dx y — mx x

Again, by differentiating, ⅛- ( 1 — wt *)* dy _ (1— m 2 )y dy 2 (y — mx ) t ' dx (y — m®) 2 "’“*”'· ''

and, substituting for its value,

⅛ = - (1 -

ι Here P, Q, R, denote expressions composed of y and x. By substituting for and their values as given by equations (4) and (2), there will be obtained the value of d’y ∙ c j

- τ ⅞, in terms of x and y. dx ’

52. The equations which may be deduced by differentiation from a proposed equation are called fluxional or differential equations, and the equation from which they have been deduced is called the primitive equation. The equation which gives the value of is said to be of the first order, and that which involves ¾ is of the second (UC e order, and so on for the higher orders.

Thus, the primitive equation being y* — 2mxy + x i — a t = 0, we have found, for the differential equation of the first order, dy my—x _ Q dx y — mx ’ and that of the second order,

<*⅞∕ (1 — m 2 ) dy (1—Q ÿ _ θ dχ∙ y — mx dx (y-mx) 3 ’ equivalent to + (1 —* m 3 ) y t ⅛nxy+ ff∙ _ θ n dχ- ' ' (y — mx) i

53. Differential equations of all orders hold true simultaneously with the primitive from which they have been derived, therefore any combination of them will also hold true; and whatever number of values the function y has (in the preceding example it has two), the differential coefficients into which y enters will have the same number.

It has appeared (art 15) that in functions of a certain form the constants they contain vanish from their differentials. A like remark applies to differential equations. Thus, if y 2 = ax + b be a primitive equation, in which a and b are constants, the differential equation is 2ydy = adx ; and this belongs to every particular equation which can be formed from the primitive, by giving all possible values to b. The constant a may also be made to disappear by putting the equation under this form, ^- = a + b - i x x for this by differentiation gives 2xydy — y°dx — bdx 3? ~ and 2xydy — (y i — b)dx = 0; or ~ = ⅞τy~

This equation expresses a relation which subsists between the quantities x,y, '⅛l, independently of any particular value of the constant a.

The very same equation will be obtained by eliminating, by the ordinary process (Algebra, sect. 7), a from the two equations y 2 = ax + b, 2ydy = adx.

If the constant quantity which is eliminated is not of She first degree in the proposed equation, the result will contain powers of the co-efficient higher than the first.

For example, let the equation be y 2 -2βy + x 2 = a*,∙

then, by differentiating,

2yrfy — ady + xdx = 0, , ydυ + xdx hence a = ; i, , . dy

This value of a being substituted in the proposed equation, we obtain, after due reduction,

(**-2y 2 )g-4xy⅛-x 2 =0; d ∖ ι an equation that expresses a relation between x, y, -ģ, which is independent of any particular value of a.

By resolving the equation in respect of a, we find a = —y ≡±≡ √2y 2 + x i ; and hence, the constant a forming a term by itself, it disappears by differentiation, and we have

⅛,±⅛+⅛= t0 ,

√2y 2 + x l an equation which, being from the radical sign, will be identical with the former.

54. Any number of constants whatever may be made to disappear by repeating the process of differentiation as often as there are quantities to be eliminated; for example, let the equation be y’ = m(a 3 — ae 3 ); by a first differentiation y = — mx ; taking the differentials a se∙
[7:9:657]

cond time, we get y + ™ = — m. This value of — m being substituted in the former equation, it becomes dy dυ t d i υ a result which is independent of both a and m. Of Vanishing Fractions.

55. When the numerator and denominator of a fraction are such functions that, by giving a particular value to their variable, they both become = 0 at the same time, the fraction is then called a vanishing fraction. The fracas β 2

tion a is of this kind; for when x = a, the numera tor and denominator both vanish, and the fraction takes the form -, from which we can draw no conclusion as to its true value, although it be evident that the fraction has then a determinate value; for x i — a 2 _ (x + a) (x — a) _ l X — a ~ X — a — « τ ∏; and when x = a, its true value is as a + a = 2«.

It appears that the above fraction has taken the peculiar form - when x = a, from the circumstance of its having the factor x — a in the numerator and denominator. The same is true of this other fraction, a 3 — a⅞t — xa 3 + a 3 ax — a 2 ’ which takes form θ when x ≡ a. The numerator and denominator have a common divisor, x — a; when freed from ļŞ a 2 this, it becomes —; when x = a, this fraction be-

a comes θ, which is truly = 0. Again, this fraction įġ· aa ⅛ tιτ ~I- ^ a i > which has the same property when x=a, by reason of the common factor x — a, when freed from the factor is —-— Thus when x = a becomes -, that X — a 0

is, the value is infinite. In these cases the common factor is obvious; but it is not so always. Take this as an example, ⅛^ 8 ^ a " 1 ∙ c08 f ; when a: is a quadrant, or sin X -f-cos X — 1 1

= ⅜w, this fraction becomes ð. For its true value in this case, see ex. 4 of art. 57.

56. When the terms of the fraction are algebraic functions, their greatest common measure may be found by an elementary operation in Algebra (art. 20), and the fraction disengaged from it by division. A more simple and general solution may, however, be obtained from the differential calculus.

Q + ^ Ä + ā?Ū2 + -ā?TT2ľ3 +’ &C '

By hypothesis, when x = a, then P and Q both vanish; therefore, leaving them out of the expression, and putting P , , P", P", &c. to denote the differential co-efficients of P in the numerator, and Q ’, Q", Q m , &c. those of Q in the denominator, and dividing the terms by A, the fraction will be expressed by P + ' 3 P'h + ⅛P"'A g +, &c.

O' + ⅛QA + ⅜Q w A* +, &c.’

P ’

When A = 0, this expression becomes; and when a is put in this fraction instead of x, the result will be the true p value of ∙^∙; for it is manifestly the same thing to suppose, first, that X becomes x + A, and then that x = a and A = 0, as to suppose at once that x = a.

If it happen that one of the two quantities, P, Q', becomes = 0 when a is substituted instead of x, then the p fraction q- will be ≡ 0, or infinite, according as the vanishing quantity is the numerator or denominator; if both become = 0 at once, then, leaving them out, the expression becomes, by reduction, P' + ⅜P" A +, &c.

Q" + ⅛Q"A +, &c. 5

P ff and making A = 0, it become —, which, putting a instead p of X, will be the value of the fraction and so on.

P

57. Hence we have this rule: To find the fraction in the particular case of x = a, supposing that P and Q are both reduced to 0 by this supposition. Divide the differential co-efficient of the numerator by that of the deno-

P'

minator; let the result be ^∙, in which make ≈=α,∙ then, if this expression does not become ð, it is the value sought;

0 P'

but if it takes the form -, treat the fraction -p in all respects like the original fraction, and deduce from it a new frac tion and proceed in this way until an expression be found which does not become ð when a is put for x ; and the first expression that is found having this property is the value sought.

Ex. 1. The sum of the geometrical series

1 + X + a? + rr 3 ...+ x b ~ 1 to n terms is — - 1 -. Find its value when x ≡ 1.

X — 1

In this case, P = ae" — 1, Q = x — 1; hence we deduce ^=»w»-« = P; g= l = Q,^ = n^ ι dx dx Q'

P

when X = 1, the fraction = n, the value of the sum of the series, as is manifest.

Ex. 2. Let the fraction be Τ^∖ ĵľ*· ~~, = X, bx i — ibex + bc 2 Q

which becomes ð when x = c, to find its value. In this dP dQ. case j- = 2ax— 2ac = P'; -y- = 2bx — 2bc = Q' ; dx dx ’ [7:9:658] P _ 2ax — 2ac _ αχ — ac

Q' - 2bx — 2bc ~ bx — bc

Making x — c, this fraction becomes ð, therefore, proceeding as before, g = 2a = P,^ = 2 6=Q',g=J 5 d⅛ 2 dx ’ Q b hence it appears that when x = c, the value of the srac-

. ∙ a tion is y

Ex. 3. The fraction — — becomes χ when x = 0.

Find its value then. In this case, g=].(α) β *-l.(⅛)δ*=Pf =1 = Q'∙

When x = 0, becomes 1. (a) — 1. (δ) ≡ 1. ?, the value required.

P' _ — cos x — sin x Q' cos x — sin ae

When x = ⅜r, & quadrant, then cos x = 0, and sin x ≡= 1; the value of the proposed fraction is therefore =-; = 1.

Ex. 5. Let the fraction be a -—-- *; to find its value when x = a. In this case P = a a ~ n — x*~", Q = a — x. p =≡=-*'-∙{>-+ i =+ β ∙=g=- 1 ,

£= √-∙∣L. + Lz2!} i making x = a, we have a n ∣ 1. a + a ~” ļ for the value required.

58. The rule of last article will not apply when Taylor’s theorem fails to give the developments of the functions P, Q, in the case when x = a. When this happens, we may substitute a + A instead of x in the fraction ?, and expand the numerator and denominator into ascending series, which proceed by the powers of h ; we shall then have AA* + B⅞ s +, ⅛c, A!h ,f + B≠ +, &c.

instead of the proposed fraction. If in this result we suppose A = 0, we shall have the value of the fraction when x = a. Now there are here three cases; viz. α > a', a, = a r , and a < a!. In the first case, we may write the expression thus:

AA*~'*' + B⅜ 3 ^* +,⅛e,

A'+ B7? —+,&c.

Under this form, it is manifest that as long as a is greater than α', the supposition of h = 0 will make the fraction equal to nothing, and that it will become when a ≡ a! j but when α ∙≤ a', we write the expression thus:

A + BA g ~* ÷,&c.

A⅛' r '- β + B'A 0 '-∙ +,&c.’

and by the supposition of h = 0, this result becomes infinite. In all cases the true value depends on the first term alone of each series.

59. The following rule extends to all fractions which

, . . . ,0

can occur under the indeterminate form θ.

Take the first term of each of the series which express the development of the numerator and denominator when x = a + h; reduce the resulting fraction to its most simple form, and then make h = 0.

s

The fraction — —whose value cannot be found ( x _ a p by differentiation, when x ≡ a becomes by this method

Ä*

when x is changed into x + h; making now A = 0, we have its true value (2a)^.

This last rule will sometimes be preferable to the former, by differentiation, even when that process is applicable. For example, four successive differentiations must be performed on the numerator and denominator of this fraction,

+ 4αr ’ + 7α* x— 2β ’ —2a f √ 2t⅛ + βF

x l — 2ax — α≈ + 2α √ 2ax — x ’ in order to find its true value when x ≡ a; by writing a + A instead of x, it becomes 2a 3 — 2a 8 A — aΛ 8 4~ A 1 — 2a t ⅜∕ a i 4- 207 -2a t + h 3 + 2a and reducing the radical quantities into series, we have √V+2≡ = a + A - * + *, _ g, + , &c .

By substituting these series in the fraction, and putting A = 0, we obtain — 5α for the value sought.

Of the greatest and least Values of a Function.

60. In supposing that a function changes its value, we may assume that the variable increases continually from 0 to infinity, either positively or negatively. To get distinct notions, it may be convenient to suppose that the variable increases or decreases by successive equal differences. The function however may not increase or decrease continually along with its variable. It may first increase to a certain magnitude, and afterwards decrease; or it may decrease and afterwards increase; or it may alternately increase and decrease several times. We may represent the variable x by the abscissa of a curve, and the function y by the corresponding ordinate. The curve, from [7:9:659]its nature, may recede continually from its axis, like the paι rabola and hyperbola: or it may first recede from and afi ' terwards approach to the axis, like the circle and ellipse; or it may be sinuous, alternately approaching and receding. 1 When a variable function, by a continual change in its magnitude, first increases and afterwards decreases, there will be one value of the function which will be greater than those which immediately preceded it, and also greater than those which immediately follow it. In this state the value of the function is the greatest possible, at least within certain limits on each side of that extreme value; and then it is said to be a maximum. On the other hand, if a function, by a continual change in its value, first decreases, until it be reduced to a certain magnitude, and afterwards increases, it is said to be a minimum, when it is just changing from the state of a decreasing to that of an increasing quantity.

A variable function may have several values, each of which will be a maximum or minimum, according to the definition. The essential character of a maximum consists in its being greater than the values which preceded and which follow it ; and that of a minimum in being less than the pre- 'ceding and following values. So that as many changes as there may be from increase to decrease, or the contrary, so many maxima and minima there will be.

61. Before proceeding farther, it will be convenient to establish this principle. In a series of the form ph + qh 3 + rh 3 + sir +, &c.

in which A is indeterminate, and independent of p, q, r, &c. such a value may be given to h, that any term shall exceed the amount of all that follow it. For, putting the series under this form,

A {p + qh ÷ rh 3 + sh 3 +, &c.); by supposing A to decrease, qh + rh t + sh 3 + , &c. may become less than any assignable quantity, and therefore less than p ; consequently, çä 2 + rh 3 + »A 4 + , &c. may be less than ph, in any ratio of inequality. In the same way it will appear that rh + sA 2 +, &c. may be less than q, and rh ’ + sh* +, &c. less than qh 1 , and so on. Hence it follows, that in the series ph + <∕A 2 + rh 3 + sh i + , Ac. A may have such a value that the amount of all the terms beginning with any assigned term shall have the sign of that term, + if it be +, and — if it be —

62. Let y denote any function which may become a maximum or minimum when its variable has attained some particular value; then, if x — A and x + Abe substituted successively in the function instead of x, the two results must be both less than the maximum value, and both greater than the minimum value. Denoting now the value of the function which corresponds to x — A by 1 y, and the value which corresponds to x + A by y 1 , we have, by Taylor’s theorem, d yκx. dt y^L d,χ hi + &c ıy = y ~ài A+ dx i 1.2 dx 3 1.2.3 + ’ & '⅛∕ diy h 3 d’y h 3 yt=y + ^ Ä + L2 ⅛l∑3 +λc ∙

Now, it is impossible that l y and y 1 can at the same time be both less or both greater than y, if the co-efficient -- be not = 0; for if it have some value different dx from zero, then such a value may be given to A that ĝ A shall exceed in any given ratio of inequality all the terms which follow it, and one of the two series beginning with =t÷'-^h will be a positive quantity and the other negative; and if this were true, y would be of an intermediate magnitude between 1 y and y 1 , which cannot be, when it is a maximum or minimum. Therefore, in order that y may be a maximum or minimum, we must have = 0, and then, in the expressions _ cPy h 3 d’'y A a , .

ry ~ y + d^ 1.2 - dx s 1.2.3 +,&C *

1 d i y h t , <Py h 3 yι ~ y + dx l L2 + dx 3 1.2.3 +, C "

such a value may be given to A as shall make 1 y and y 1 both less than y in the case of a maximum, or both greater in that of a minimum.

It may, however, happen that the value of x which makes -- = 0 shall also make ⅛ = 0, so that we have dx ι dx i v - v ^ y E- + d ⅛.J*. ,&c.

dx 3 1.2.3 dxf∙ 1.2.3.4 ’

, dPυ h 3 . d*y A 4 y ι- y+ ⅛ i 1.2Λ + dx^ 1.2.8.4 +,&C *

Then the function cannot be a maximum or minimum, unless the same value of x make ~ = 0, and give a finite value for ĝ

63. On the whole, we have this rule, to determine the maximum or minimum value ofy, a function of x. Make the differential coefficient^ ≡ 0: Find the value of x, and substitute it in A, ; and if the result be negative, thefunction is a maximum; but if it be positive, the function is a minimum. And if it be = 0, then put Al 3 = 0, andjinà s, and substitute it in^ ζ , and draw the same conclusions from the signs as before, and so on.

The rule for determining a maximum or minimum of a function was first given correctly by Maclaurin, in hit Fluxions, chap. ix. , , . ,

64. We shall now apply the theory to the resolution ol problems, of which there may be an endless variety, and many highly interesting.

Ex. 1. To determine whether the function « = 2αa — x ’ has a maximum or minimum value.

In this case the differential co-efficient = 2 (α — x) which being put = 0, we have x = a. The second differ ential co-efficient ¾ = 2, a negative quantity, there aar fore the function has a maximum value (art. 63), viz when x = a ; and that value is u = a 2 , as is indeed evi dent from the nature of the function.

Ex. 2. Letw≡a* + 3⅛+ 2i thenĝ = 2x + 3. Thi put = 0, gives x ≡ — I· Again, = 2, a positiv∣ quantity, therefore the function is a minimum when x = —.⅞. In that case u = —ļ.

Ex. 3. Let u = x 3 — 15 x 2 + 56a: — 60. Here g≡3^-30x + 56, g = 6x-30.
[7:9:660]

The equation = 3a?—30.z ’ + 56 = 0 being resolved, . . . 15 =ź= √57 .... 15 ± √57 .

we find X = Making x = θ , we find d 2 u j- ι = 6a:— 30 = =1= 2 √57. Hence it appears that the function has a minimum, and also a maximum value; the „ ,. 15 + √57 ∙. , former corresponding to x = g , and the latter

15 —√57 t öx= .

If X = —’ ^^ 3 ^ 57 > « = — 30 — ~ √57, a minimum. Ifx = ——ğ—-, u = — 30 + ^-√57, a maximum. Ex. 4. Lett* = a? — 5a? + 5a? + 1; then ⅛ = 5x t - 20a? + 15a: 1 = 5x t (x l — 4λ + 3); į = 20a? — 60a? + 30a: = 10 x (2x t — 6a: + 3).

The equation = 5a? (a? — ix + 3) = 0, gives four values of x, viz. x = 3,x= 1, the other two are = 0.

These being substituted in ¾, show that the function ajr has a nwκrιmum and minimum : when X = 3, w = — 26, a minimum ; x = 1, u = 2, a maximum ; when X ≡ 0, then vanishes, therefore there is neither maximum or minimum in this case.

Ex. 5. To determine the maxima and minima values of the function y-=X c ; we have found (art. 24, ex. 2), that

∣=Aι+i∙*) 1 '

and hence ^^=X t ∣ ^ + (l+l. x) t ļ;

The function x x cannot be = 0; we must therefore put 1 + 1. a: = 0; hence 1. x = — 1, and x = e~* = —. e

This value of x, substituted in the second differential coefficient, makes <Pu sì\e -⅛3 = ( -1 . e, a positive quantity;

ı_ therefore, when x = -, x 1 — (-) , a minimum. Ex. 6. To find the greatest space that can be enclosed by four given straight lines:

Let the given lines be AB = a, BC = b, CD ≡ e, DA =f.∙ Let x= angle B, v = angle D, y=, the area ABCD: Draw the diagonal AC.

By trigonometry, α 2 +⅛ 2 — 2ab cos x — AC 2 , e 5 +∕ 8 -2βfeosv= AC‘; Hence, 2ab cos x — 2er cos υ = a 1 -1-b l — e t — f i (1)

And because trian. ABC = ∣ai sin x ; trian. ADC = ier sin V, therefore, y — ţab sin «+ W , sin υ (2)

This last equation by differentiation gives, by the nature of a maximum,

ĝ = ļab cos x+įęf cos υ = 0 (3)

By differentiating equation (1), we find abdx sin x — efdv sin v = 0; , , j ,dυ , sin x and hence er - τ - = — ab- : y dx sin υ

Therefore, from eq. (3), ab ∣ cos *+ ^"^ð 8 ” ļ = ®: and hence sin v cos a:+cos υ sin x = O; that is (Algebra, art. 239), sin (x+t>)=0, and x+r=<r.

Thus it appears that the opposite angles B, D must together make two right angles; therefore the figure will be a maximum when it is inscribed in a circle; and since in this case cos X ≡≡ — cos V, sin x = sin v ; from equations (1) and (2), 2(ab+er) cos x = α 2 +5 s —e 2 - -f*, 2lab+er) sin x = 4y.

By squaring both sides of these equations, and adding, and observing that cos i x+sin 2 a: = 1, we have 4(α i+ esf - (α ≡+i’ — e ≈-∕ s )* + 16y% and 16y≈ = 4(α⅛+ι∕) 5 — (α 2 +⅛ 2 — e s — f i p.

The right-hand side of this formula admits of being resolved into these two factors, viz.

2ab +2√+ α 2 +δ 2 - <?- f = (a+b)* -, (e — ∕Y, 2ab+2er-a*-V+r+f* = (e÷∕) 2 - (α — 5) 2 ; and these again admit of this further resolution, (β+5+e— f) (α+5 — e+∕), (e +/+“ — *) (e+∕-e+5);

If we now put í = ⅛(α+⅛+e+∕), we have a+b+e — f= 2(s — ∕), a+b-e+f=2( s -e), e +∕+ a — b = 2(s — b), e +∕-a + b= 2(s — a).

Hence 16y t = 16(s — o ) (√- b) (a — e) (s — s) ; and y = √(s-α) C — b) { t - e ) ∖ t -f).

We have now found by the calculus an elegant geometrical theorem.

Ex. 7. To determine the dimensions of a cyiindric measure, open at top, which shall contain a given quantity of grain, liquor, &c. under the least internal superficies.
[7:9:661]

Let X = AB be tĥe diameter of the base, υ = AC its depth, <r the number 3-1416 (viz. half the circumference of a circle whose rad. = 1), and c the content of the cylinder. By Geombtry, the area of the base = -j-, and its circumference = m , and the internal surface of the cylinder = t*r. Now 1 the content of the cylinder c = —τ^; an( l therefore therefore the internal surface = —; and putting y for the whole inside surface of the measure, l 4c y=-4-+v*

therefore, ~- = —— = 0; μx 2 x t d’y _ c 8c dx i ~ 2 + ar> ’

The first of these equations gives <λ 3 =8c = 2τz⅛, and x = 2υ ; hence the diameter of the base must be twice the depth: The second differential co-efficient being a positive quantity, shows the surface to be a minimum.

Ex. 8. A candle stands on a horizontal table, directly over a point at a given distance from a small object on the table; what ought to be the height of the flame when the object is illuminated the most possible.

Let A be the object on∙the table, B the point under the candle, and C the flame, considered as condensed at a point. The intensity of the illumination on the object A depends on its distance from C, and on the angle which the rays make with the surface (supposed to be horizontaD. By the principles of optics, the intensity at different distances, the angle of obliquity being the same, will be inversely as the square of the distance; and with different degrees of obliquity, the distance being the same, as the sine of the angle which the rays make with the surface. Therefore the intensity, as depending on both obliquity and distance, will be expressed by 1 . r , n BC

Āē’ 8 * n CAB = Āē’·

Put a — AB, x = sin CAB, and let y denote the illuminating power on the surface at A; then

and „ = ì~ r ∑τ~ = ⅜> and cos 2 x = ⅜. cos- X 1 + cos 2 X 3 3

By the trigonometrical tables, 2 x = 70° 32 , , and x = 35° 16'; this gives BC = AB × . 71 nearly: so that the height of the flame must be about ⅛ of the distance AB.

Ex. 9. To find the position of the planet Venus in respect of the earth and sun when her light is the greatest.

The planet does not appear brightest when her disc is perfectly round; she is then too remote to produce that effect; and besides, she is seen in the direction of the sun. In her inferior conjunctions her crescent is too narrow, almost the whole illuminated part being turned towards the sun. It is therefore in some intermediate position, which is to be determined, that she is brightest.

Let S be the sun, E the earth, and ACBD Venus, ADB its illuminated hemisphere which is turned towards the sun, and CBD its hemisphere towards the earth: produce S V to F.

The portion of the illuminated surface turned towards the earth is contained between two planes DV, BV, perpendicular to the plane EVS; and this surface will manifestly be projected into a crescent, the breadth of which is the versed sine of the angle BVD, which is equal to EVF, because if BVE be added to both, each is a right angle. Now the area of the crescent is always as its breadth; therefore, the whole disk being taken as an unit, the illuminated part of it will be expressed by the versed sine of the angle EVF, or by 1 + cos EVS.

Again, the brightness of the planet at different distances is inversely as the square of the distance; therefore the brightness depending on its position in respect of the sun and its distance from the earth jointly, will be pro-

. 1 1 + cos EVS

portional to

Let a = ES the distance of the earth from the sun, b = VS the distance of Venus from the sun, x = VE the distance of Venus from the earth;

Then, co, EVS — + ∕1~ °*, and 1 + cos EVS S∙+^ + *∙-o∙

The negative value of x is not applicable, and we have X = √3 α* + b i — 2 b.

In numbers, a = 10000, b = 7233, therefore x = 4304, the angles E = 39° 43 , 30", V = 117° 55 ’ 20", S = 22° 21' 10".

Ex. 10. Let ABDB'A' be a kirb roof supported by [7:9:662]four rafters AB, BD, DB', B'A', two and two of which are equal, viz. AB = A'B', and BD — B'D, and all perfectly free to turn about the points A, B, D, B', A', as joints. Suppose also that AA' the span, and DC the height of the roof, are given, and that AB has to BD a given ratio. Determine the position of the rafters when by their weight they form an equilibrium.

Suppose the roof to be inverted so as to form a polygon hanging suspended from the points A, A'; by a known principle in statics, when it forms an equilibrium, the centre of gravity of the mass of matter in the polygon will be the lowest possible. If now the polygon were reversed and placed in its position as a roof, without changing the angles at the joints, the equilibrium would not be disturbed, and in this position the centre of gravity would be the highest possible.

Draw a line from B to B', which will be parallel to AA'; and draw the perpendiculars BE, B'E'. Put the angle BAC = B'A'C = x, DBF = DB'F = υ ; let the given ratio of AB to BD be that of a given number m to a given number n ; these numbers may represent the length, also the weight, of the rafters, which may be supposed placed in their centres of gravity, or middle of the beams.

By trigonometry, BE = m sin x, DF = n sin v, therefore DC = m sin x + n sin v ; and, by statics, the height of the centre of gravity of AB, also of A'B', above A A will be ⅜ BE = -į m sin x, and the height of the centre of gravity of BD, also of B'D, will be ⅜ (BE + DC) = m sin X + I n sin υ ; and since the distance of the common centre ofgravity of all the beams from A A' will be found by multiplying the distance of each centre by the mass, supposed placed at that centre, and adding the results into one sum, and dividing by the sum of all the masses; the height of the centre of gravity of the whole system of beams above AA' will be m 2 sin X + n (2 m sin x + n sin t>)

2 (m + n)

Let this height be denoted byy,∙ then, rejecting the constant denominator 2 (m + n), y = (m 2 + 2 mn) sin x + n ι sin v, a maximum; and since AC, half the span of the roof, is a given quantity, we have m cos x + n cos υ — AC, a constant.

From the first equation, ⅛ = (m s + 2 mn) cos x + n s cos v = 0; and from the second, , dυ „ , dυ m sin x m sin X + n sin υ — — 0; hence - r =: .

dx ax n sin υ

This value of being substituted in the value of ĝ, we obtain z . „ x mn cos V sin x (m 1 + 2 mn) cos x : = 0; v sm V and from this again,

^ = -^ + 2 (1.)

tan » » k ’

This formula expresses a property of all roofs made of four beams, which are equal two and two, when by their position they form an equilibrium.

Join AD, and put y = angle DAC which is known, DC

because tan y ≡ Theangle BAD =x— γ, and BDA

— y — υ. Now, in the triangle ABD, sin A: sin D = DB: BA, that is, sin (x — γ) : sin (γ — v) = n : m ; therefore, sin -<5--y> = 2L (2.)

sm (γ — υ) m v z

These equations (1), (2), determine the angles x, t>, when the ratio of AB to BD is given; from their form, the angles may be easily found by trials in the trigonometrical tables. The elimination of one of the angles would produce an equation of the fourth degree; for this reason, the method of trials is the best way of proceeding. When the angles x and v are known, every thing else may be readily found.

If we suppose the beams AB, BD, to be of equal length, then m = n, and our two equations become

= 3, sin (x — y) = sin (y— t).

In this case, x + υ = 2y; then, from the equation tan X sin x cos v _ ≡ tan υ ~ cos X sin v ~ ’

• sin X cos υ — cos x sin υ _ sin (x — v ) _ ,. we g βt sin x cos t> + cos x sin t> - sin (x + υ) ~ 2 ’ and hence sin (x — t>) = ⅜ sin (x + t>) = ļ sin 2y; and putting for υ its value 2y — x, sin 2 (x — y) = ⅜ sin 2y.

This determines the angle x, and v = 2y — x.

The theory of equilibriums opens a wide field for the application of the calculus, as must be evident from the preceding solution; but our limits will not permit us to enter on it farther.

Determination of r Angents to Curves.

65. Let HPK be any curve referred to an axis AC; and let AB = X and PB = y be the co-ordinates of any point P in the curve; the point A being the origin of the abscisses. Let PT, a tangent to the curve at P, meet the axis in T; and let SPQ,any straight line drawn through P, meet the curve in Q and the axis in S. Draw QC perpendicular to the axis, and PR perpendicular to QC; and let PR = BC = h, and QC = y ’, the ordinate corresponding to the absciss x + h.

By similar triangles, QR: RP = PB: BS, that is, y ʹ-y: h = y : BS.

Now, by Taylor’s theorem (art. 31), y “y = Ž Ä + Ä Ä ' + &c · hence, dividing the first antecedent and consequent by ¼ [7:9:663]I+S λ + s '∙ u =^ bs ∙

This proposition holds true whatever be the magnitude of Ã, the increment of x. But now let us suppose h to decrease continually; the point Q will approach to P, and the line QPS approaching to coincidence with PT, the point S will approach to T; and when Ä vanishes, Q will be at P, and S at T, and BS will have become BT; our proportion will now be

|:l=y:BT.

The line BT, between the ordinate PB and tangent PT, is called the subtangent ; from this proportion it appears, that X and ä being co-ordinates at any point in the curve,

d’y dx , lλ

BT, the subtangent, = y ÷⅛ c = ĩľįļp that is, the subtangent is equal to the ordinate divided by its differential co-efficient; or it is a third proportional to the differential of the ordinate, the differential of the abscissa and the ordinate. The subtangent being known, the position of the tangent is determined.

Let PD, a perpendicular to the tangent at P, and consequently to the curve, meet the axis in D; the line PD is called a normal to the curve; and BD, the segment of the axis between the ordinate and normal, is called the subnormal.

The triangles TBP, PBD are similar, therefore TB: BP = BP: BD, or dx : dy = y : BD , hence the subnormal BD ~y^^,......... (2).

Because the tangent of the angle PTB = ψj∣, and the

PB tangent of the angle PDB ≡ gŋ; therefore, tan angle T = and tan D = (3).

In the right-angled triangles TBP, PBD, we have PT γ — PB 2 + BT s , and PD s = PB 2 + BD s ; therefore, tangent PT = y J' l +^ W

normal PD = y 1 + (5)

66. We shall now apply these general formulae to some particular curves.

Ex. 1. Let the curve be the parabola, and supposing AC to be the axis, and A its vertex: by the nature of the curve, putting a for the parameter, y 2 ≡ ax, „ , _> d⅛ 2y hence 2ydy = adx i djc 2u i 2ax subtan. BT = ~y = -f- = — = 2x; dy a a that is, the subtangent is double the absciss AB.

Again, for the subnormal, we have , __ dy adx a subnor BD = ^y=^- = ^∙

Thus it appears that the subnormal is constant, and equal to half the parameter.

Ex. 2. Let the curve be an ellipse, of which OA half the greater axis = α, OB half the lesser axis = b ; and supposing the origin of the co-ordinates to be at O the centre, let OQ = x, PQ ≡ y. By the nature of the curve, a i : & = (a +x) (a — x) : y s (Conics);

δ 2 z o .∖ , , b'xdx hence y l = (α s -x 2 ), and ydy = ^- s dx a-y" a t — tŕ (d^ ∖ and subtan. QT = ^y=- —- — (- —*)∙

Fi<r. 7.

The general formula for the subtangent was found on the hypothesis that it was on the same side of the ordinate as the absciss; in this case they are supposed to be on opposite sides, and hence its value has the negative sign; leaving the direction of the subtangent in respect of the absciss out of consideration, we have

QT = - — X, and OT = ⅛

X ∙B hence it appears that OQ: OA = OA: OT.

When the axes are equal, the ellipse becomes a circle, but the subtangent is independent of the ratio of the axes.

Ex. 3. Let the curve be the hyperbola, of which a = OA the semitransverse axis, and b = the semicojugate; then, putting OQ ≡ x, and PQ = y, we have (by Conics), b t b ’ y* = - t (x 2 -a t ), ydy= ^xdx l dx cry* rr s -α 2 a t subtan. QT = -⅛ y= -f χ = —ļ— = x ~~ = hence OT = OQ — QT = —.

This shows that the tangent always passes between the centre and the vertex when x has a finite value; but when Xbecomes infinite, then OT = 0, and the tangent becomes an asymptote to the hyperbola.

Ex. 4. We shall next draw a tangent to the cycloid; ' but first the nature of the curve must be expressed analytically. Conceive a circle to roll along a straight line, moving always in the same plane, just as the wheel of a carriage rolls along a straight road. By this motion any given point in the circumference of the circle will describe [7:9:664]a continuous curve in that plane, which will meet the line along which it rolls at intervals equal to its circumference.

Let ⅛B be the line along which a circle CD A rolls, beginning its motion from a point of contact b, and completing a revolution when it has come to B. The point of the circumference which was in contact with the line at b will then have generated the curve line ÓAB. This is the cycloid, and the line 6B its base.

Let ADC be a fixed circle in the position of the generating circle when it has completed half a revolution, 0 its centre, and AC its diameter, called the axis of the cycloid. Let AD be any arc of this circle. Draw the radius OD. When the generating circle, by rolling along CB from the position C, has passed over a distance equal to the arc AD, the centre 0 will have generated a straight line OE parallel to CB, and equal to the same arc AD; moreover, the moveable radius, which was coincident with OA, will, by the rotation of the circle, have come into a position EP, parallel to OD, because the angular motion of the radius about the moving point E will always be proportional to the arc of the circle that has been applied to the base, that is, by hypothesis, to the arc AD; and since the lines OD, EP are equal and parallel, a straight line drawn from P through D, meeting AC in Q, will be parallel to EO, and therefore perpendicular to AC; and since PD = OE = arc AD, it follows that PQ, any ordinate to the axis AC, is equal to the sum of the arc AD and its sine DQ. This is the distinguishing property of a cycloid. To express it by equations, let the radius of the generating circle be a, and the angle AOD = v, then PD = arc AD = av, and DQ = a sin v, so that, putting AQ = x, and PQ ≡ y, we have for the equations of the curve X — a (1 — cos ø), y = a (» + sin v) ; and from these every property of the curve may be investigated.

To determine the tangent: by differentiation,; " t ; “z, ι λ dx sin V dx= a sin », dy = adv (1 + cos »), - 5 - = , ’ dy 14-COS»

, dx (v + sin ») sin » PQ . QD

subtan QT = y — = i—— c —'- = -- √ l ; dy 1 + cos » CQ hence CQ:DQ=PQ:QT.

But by the nature of the circle CQ: DQ = DQ: QA; therefore PQ: QT = DQ: QA; hence the triangles PQT, DQA are similar, and the tangent PT is parallel to the chord DA.

Ex. 5. In the logarithmic curve of which the equation is y = α x , we have dy = a x . 1. a.dx = y 1. a.dx; therefore d įy = Γα = subtan g ent ∙

Hence it appears that the subtangent is a line of a constant given length.

67. To find a formula for the subtangent and normal of curves whose nature is expressed by a polar equation. Let HPK be such a curve, generated by the revolution of a variable radius AP about a given point A in AC, aline given in position. Through A draw AT' perpendicular to AP; let a tangent to the curve at P meet this line in T' and the axis in T; draw PQ perpendicular to the axis AC, and draw the normal PD, meeting TA in D. Then AT is the subtangent and AD the subnormal. Let AQ = X, PQ = y, the revolving radius AP = r, the variable angle PAC = », and the angle PTA = t. The lines X, y, r are now to be considered as functions of the angle ».

The angle TPA being the supplement of the sum of PTA and PAT; that is, of » + t, we have (Algebra, art. 236 and 242), tan angle T'PA ≡ — tan (» + <) = tan ¢ ^h tan * v , tan “tan t— 1

Now tan e = ^, and tan t’ = ?^= —⅛ ʹ; X TQ dx therefore tan T'PA = ——^τ-— = T7~r~7^∙

Again,⅛=⅛ d(⅛=d (tan ») = -⅞-, β x i ∖ x∕ v cos* »

therefore xdy — ydx = dr — = r"dυ ; ; 3 cos 2 »

and xdx + ydy = įd (z 2 + y*) = ļd (r*) = rdτ ; therefore tan TPA = =; rdr dr and since by trigonometry TA = AP tan TPA, therefore subtangent TA = r*; also, since TA: AP = AP: AD; therefore subnormal AD = į-. dυ

Ex. Let the curve PH be the spiral of Archimedes, the nature of which is defined by the equation 2π = αr. where « = 2 right angles, and “is a given line, viz. the value of r when » = 2r. In this case , t dv . 2<r* subtangent — . τ a =

68. In some curves the segment of the axis between the origin of the co-ordinates and the tangent increases with the variable x, and may exceed any given line. In others the tangent cuts the axis always at a finite distance from the origin; it is then an asymptote to the curve. If from the subtangent QT = ⅛ y (fig. 8) the absciss AQ = x be subtracted, the remainder y — a: is the general expression for AT. Now if when x is infinite this expression is finite, we may conclude that the curve has asymptotes; but if it be infinite, the curve has no asymptotes.

In the conic hyperbola we found (ex. 3, art. 66) dx a l n dx a* — y=x r; therefore - r y — x = — —r; when x is dy v x i dy j x*

infinite, the expression — — = 0, hence it follows that the hyperbola has an asymptote which passes through the centre.

In the parabola, ex. 1, we found y = therefore [7:9:665]y — x = — x =,2x — x= x. When x is infinite

αy a this quantity is also infinite, therefore the parabola has no asymptote.

The method of drawing tangents to curves is an important branch of the theory of curve lines. It serves also to determine their greatest and least ordinates (which may also be found by the theory of maxima and minima), and many other circumstances relating to their figure.

Differential of the Area of a Curvilineal Space, and of the Arc of a Curve.

69. In curve lines it is convenient to consider x, one of the co-ordinates, as an independent variable quantity; and any area having an arc of the curve for a boundary, also the arc, and in general every other variable quantity connected with the curve, as functions of that variable. If the curve be expressed by a polar equation, the angle which the revolving radius makes with the variable may be taken as the independent variable, and the co-ordinates and other variable quantities related to the curve as functions of that angle.

We begin by investigating a formula for the area.

Let AB be the axis of any curve CP, A and C given points in the axis and curve, PQ, HK any two variable ordinates, and CD an ordinate given in position at the given point C; draw PE and HF perpendiculars to HK, PQ.

Put AQ ≡ x, PQ = y, curvilineal space PQDC =

AK = t’, HK=y, HKDC = ∕,∙

thenQK=ar'— x, and PHKQ=s ’ — ».

The space PHKQ is greater than the rectangle PEKQ, but less than the rectangle FHKQ (supposing y to increase from the position PQ to HK), therefore, s' — i>(a∕- x)y, y —s<(a∕-αr)y; and S≡>^ ⅛< y ∙

Hence, since when HK approaches to coincidence with PQ, y ’ approaches to equality with y, we have ds .. s' — » d⅛= 1,m ∙^=*

and ds — ydx (1).

Thus it appears that The differential of a curvilineal area is the product of the ordinate and the differential of the absciss.

In the formula just found, the ordinates have been supposed perpendicular to the axis. If they be oblique, let a be the angle of inclination; then d — s will be greater than (x ’ — x)y . sin α, but less than (a/ — x) g . sin α; and hence, reasoning as before, we find ds = sin a . ydx........................... (2).

70. To find a formula applicable when the nature of the curve is expressed by a polar equation, let B be the pole, and PB the variable radius.

Put PB = r, the angle PBQ — v, and the curvilineal space PCDB = s ; also let BQ = x, PQ = y, then ds = d (space CDQP) + d (triangle PQB).

Now d (space CDQP) = — ydx, which is negative, because x decreases when the space increases; and d (triangle PQB) = rf(⅜ xy) = iydx + ∣ xdy ; therefore, ds = — ydx + ⅛ydx + ∣ xdy — ⅜ (xdy — ⅜ ydx)

= A∕g)(art,12).

But in the right-angled triangle PBQ,

BQ = X = r cos V, ∣=tanr, dg) = -≤L(a rt, 22); hence ds= ⅛r 1 dυ . (3).

In this case The differential of the area is half the product of the square of the revolving radius, and the differential of the angle which it makes with the axis. l ∖ . y Ne have already found (art. 23) various expressions for the differential of the arc of one particular curve, viz. the circle. We shall now investigate general expressions for the differential of the arc of any curve. For this purpose it will be convenient to establish the following geometrical proposition.

Let CPMD be a curve, that between the points P and M continually approaches to or continually recedes from an axis AB. Let PQ, MN be ordinates to the axis at the extremities of the arc PM, and PK, MH tangents to the curve at the points P, M, meeting the ordinates in K and H: The length of the arc is always of an intermediate magnitude between the lengths of the tangents PK, MH.

Draw the chord PM, and let I be the intersection of the tangents. It is easy to see that PK, one of the tangents, meets the parallel ordinates in an angle K more acute than M, the angle made by the chord PM and ordinate MN; and the other in an angle H less acute; therefore the chord will be less than the former and greater than the latter. Now the arc is greater than the chord; therefore MH, the least of the tangents, is less than the arc PM.

Again, in the two triangles PIH, MIK, it is evident that the two parts PI, IK, of the longest tangent, are respectively greater than HI, IM, those of the shorter; therefore PK is longer than the sum of PI and IM; but the arc PM is by an axiom of geometry less than the sum of PI and IN, therefore the tangent PK is greater than the arc PM.

72. Let A be a given point in the axis, and C in the curve; draw PE, HF parallel to AB; put AQ = x, AN = x , , PQ = y, CP = z, CM = d; then PE = d—x, and arc PM = z , — z. Because PM = d — z is less than PK, but greater than MH, therefore [7:9:666]zf—z pκ g*—g HM af—x' ζ 'PE ,a *=^x' HF’

Now and are the secants of the angles KPE and MHF; therefore the ratio —- is expressed by a quantity less than the secant of one of these angles, and greater than the secant of the other angle. Suppose now z ’ — z and xf — x, the terms of the ratio, to be continually diminished; the angles at H and P will approach to equality, and at last become equal, therefore the limit of the ratio, viz. ⅛, is equal to the secant of the angle KPE; but it was shown (art. 65) that the tangent of the angle which a line touching a curve makes with the axis, or any line parallel to the axis, is equal to and consequently its secant to J 1 ÷; therefore

Ŝ = + Ž and dz ~ + d v , ∙ ( 1 )

Hence it appears that The square of the differential of the arc of a curve is equal to the sum of the squares of the differentials of its rectangular co-ordinates.

73. In the case of curves expressed by a polar equation, let A be the given point about which the variable radius

AP turns; put v for the variable angle which the line AP ≈ r makes with AB, a line given in position; let the rectangular co-ordinates be AQ = x, PQ z= y then X ς= r cos V, y = r sin υ ; dx ≈ — r sin v dυ + cos v dr ≡≡ — ydy -ţ--dr; dy — r cos vdy + sin v dr = xdυ + — dr ; r dx t = ÿW + ^dr i - 2 ^l dvdr; dy> = z~d↑t + dr"- + ≡I dvdr ; therefore, d⅛ 2 + dy i = (z ’ ÷ y») (dv l + ~j.

But ¢Lr 2 + dy- = <fe*, and x i + f = r 1 ,∙ therefore, dz ι = i λ dv 3 + dr ∖ and dz = √ τ i dυ i + dr l (2)

This formula gives the differential of an arc of a curve ip terms of the differential of the variable radius vector, and the angle which it makes with the axis.

74. We shall now give a method of defining a curve by a polar equation, which leads to a simple and elegant expression for the differential of an arc of the curve.

Let CPD be any curve, and A a given point in AB, a line given by position; draw a tangent PF at any point P in the curve, and a perpendicular AF from the given point A on the tangent; if now we know the relation between the perpendicular AF, and the angle FAB, which it makes with the line AB, the length of the perpendicular corresponding to any given value of the angle can be found; thus the position of the tangent will be known; the calculus gives a general formula for PF, the segment of the tangent between the point of contact and its intersection with the perpendicular; thus the point of contact P is known, and in this way may any number of points in the curve be determined.

75. Let D be another point in the curve, DH a tangent, and AH a perpendicular on the tangent, and let us put angle FAB = u, perp. A F = p, tan PF = t, arc CP = z,∙

HAB = u', AH=, o', DH=i ’, CD=t’

From the position of the lines in the figure,

HD — FP = HE + ED — (FK + KE — EP)

= PE + ED — FK — (KE —HE).

By trigonometry, FK = AF. tan FAK = p tan (u' — w); and because in the equiangular triangles AFK, EHK, the angles at A and E are equal, therefore HE = KE . cos (u — u'); hence the above equation may be expressed thus, t — f= PE + ED — p . tan (u' — u) —{1 — cos (uf — u) }KE; and dividing by u' — u, It — t _ PE + ED tan (u' — u) 1 — cos(u , -¾) ve u’— u υ! — u u' — u u' — u

Suppose now the point D to approach to coincidence with P, we have these limits to the ratios:

.. tf — t dt PE + ED dz 1,m ∙ 7∑Γ" m = T > lιm ∙ — _ M = Tu : lim. ⅛'-") = 1 . lιm , 1 -cos(√-u) u' — u u! — u = lim. 2sin8 İ(« , -“) =0> u' — u hence, on the whole,

É = ⅛ — P> andtfe = dt + P du > oτ d (z — t’) = pdu.

In the figure from which the formula has been investigated, the arc and tangent lie in the same direction from the point of contact. If they had proceeded in contrary directions, the formula would have been d(z +t) =pdu, so that, in general, d(z= f =t)=pdu (3)

The differential of the arc may be expressed independently of t; for

AH — AF = KH + AK — AF;

Now KH = HE . tan HEK = HE tan (u' — u), and AF = AK cos (u' — u) ; therefore, dividing by u' — u l we have [7:9:667] ý — P _ uv tan (m , — «) , 1 — cos (√ — «) . „ √-W -H √-u + √- « AK · and, passing to the limits, observing that lira. HE = t, .. tan (tľ — w) , 1 — cos (κ ’ — «) .

du

The sign + is to be taken when the arc and tangent lie in the same direction, but the sign — when they have contrary directions; and because dt = z±∑ ⅛, therefore du in every curve

ŵ = pdu + g du = (p + g)ŵ. (4)

This is the formula which was to be found.

Generation of Curves by Evolution: Radius of Curvature: Evolutes.

76. The method of generating curves by evolution is a geometrical theory invented by Huygens, and given in his Horologium Oscillatorium. He explained it upon geometrical principles, for his work appeared many years before the calculus was invented.

Let BHE be a model of a plane curve made of a solid material, having some thickness, and let one end of a thread HEC be fastened at a point B on the edge of the model, and applied along its convexity, so as to coincide with it entirely between B and E, the remaining portion EC of the thread forming a straight line touching the curve at E. Suppose now the thread to be gradually unlapped from the curve BE, keeping it always tight; the end C will now describe another curve CPD.

All curves, in which the curvature is neither infinitely great nor infinitely small, may be generated in this way by the evolution of a thread from another curve.

77. The curvfe EHÐ, by means of which the curve CPD is generated, is called its Evolute; and the curve CPD thus generated by evolution, is called the Involute of the other curve.

From the way in which the involute is generated from its evolute, we may infer,

(1.) That PH, the part of the thread disengaged from the arc EH, is a tangent to the evolute at H.

(2.) That the line PH is perpendicular to a tangent to the curve CPD at P, and that at the same time it describes an element of the curve, and an element of a circle whose momentary centre is H and radius HP.

(3.) That to a certain extent the part of the involute adjoining to P, and towards C, is more incurvated than a circle whose radius is PH; because, supposing P to proceed towards C, the variable radius PH is gradually becoming shorter. On the other hand, a portion of the curve from P towards D is less incurvated than a circle whose radius is CP, because the generating radius is continually becoming longer.

(4.) That since the curvature of the involute on one side of P, and adjoining to it, is less than that of a circle whose radius is PH, and the curvature on the other side of P is greater, it follows that at the point P the curvature of the involute is exactly the same as that of a circle described with the radius HP. The point H is therefore called the centre of curvature of the curve CPD in the point P; and PH, its radius of curvature at that point; and a circle described with the line PH is the circle of equal curvature with the curve at the point P. From the close union of the circle and curve they have been said to osculate. It must, however, be kept in mind that the two curves have no common segment; they meet in a geometrical point at P, and separate on both sides of it. We may also infer that the circle of curvature has a more intimate contact with the curve than any other circle that passes through that point.

(5.) That the evolute of a curve is the locus of the centre of curvature of every point in the curve.

78. We shall now investigate general formulas for the radius of curvature, and for the evolute of any curve, by which these may be found when the nature of the curve is known.

Let AB be the common axis of the involute CPD, and its evolute EHB, and A the origin of co-ordinates; letH be the centre, and PH the radius of curvature at P; and H' the centre, and P'H' the radius of curvature of another point P', near the former. Let the radii produced, if necessary, meet the axis in N and N'; and let 0 be the poiht in which they intersect each other.

Put AQ =z X, PQ = y, arc CP = z, arc CI* = z', angle PNA = v, angle P'N'A = v , , rad. of curv. PH = r.

By trigonometry, PG = OG. sin POG; PG = OG. sin

POG; therefore, OG = —

sin POG + sm P'OG

Suppose now the points P ’, P to approach continually towards coincidence, the line GO will manifestly have for its limit PH, the radius of curvature at P. The limit of the sum of the tangents PG, P'G will be the arc PF'= s' — z. The limit of the sines of the angles POG, P'OG will be the arcs which measure the angles, and that of the sum of the sines will be the measure of the angle POP = NON = v ’ — V. Hence it appears that r = limit of ^r~ a ∏d therefore, that dz ∕., T = Tv < 1 >

This is our first general expression for the radius of curvature. Put ⅛ = p, ¾ = ⅛ = o.

dx r do? dx 1

Because (art. 72) dz — Vda* + ⅛∕ 2 ~ dx*∕l + ⅛ dx ’ therefore dz — dx √1 + ∕A

When treating of tangents to curves, we found (art. 65) that tan v = ⅛ therefore, tan v = -, sec v = ? , ⅜ P P [7:9:668]and d(tan υ) = desec , o = —

hence, — dυ = — and dυ = — τ7r⅛∙ l’ l’ . 1 +lr

If now the values of dz and dυ be substituted in our first formula for the radius of curvature, there is obtained . = -ί (ι+A » = -<^Ζ m

This is a second genera] formula for the radius of curvature.

Let s denote the normal PN. In the right-angled triangle PQN, by trigonometry, sin N = ĩĝ, that is, sin V — - ; but since

«

tan V — — = -, therefore - = sin υ = — — ł , r ⅞∕ p í √l÷, p*

and √l÷p* = A and (1 + p»)5 =

Referring now to our second formula, we have d dl. ∕ 3 ) w i ~ y 3 ⅛r w

This is a third formula for the radius of curvature.

If we suppose the nature of the curve (see fig. 14, art. 74) expressed by an equation between AF = p, a perpendicular from a given point in the axis on a tangent PF, and FAP = v, the angle which that perpendicular makes with the axis, and therefore also equal to the angle which the normal PN makes with the axis; then, since dz = Çp + ; from formula (1) we get also r =P + ⅛ ( 4 >

This is a fourth formula for the radius of curvature.

79. To determine the nature of the evolute EHB, from any point H in the curve draw HK perpendicular to AB, and HI perpendicular to PQ; and assuming A, the origin of the co-ordinates of the involute also as the origin of those of the evolute, let AK = a, HK = β ; in the triangle PHI, HI = PH . cos H ≡ r cos v, and PI — r sin υ, therefore

α = x + r cos v, β — y — r sin v.

We have found that tan v = į and therefore P p 1

cos V = — - r — sm V = — == ;

√1 + p 2 ’ √1 + p» hence, combining these with the expressions for r, we have a = χ -g ( 1 +**)> β=y + i -C+p t )i or, substituting for p and q the quantities they denote, a _ x _ rf y . rfjι +<fy 8 β _ . <⅛ 8 + dg i dx ’ dy ’” d 2 y

In these formulae, and in the second and third for the radius of curvature, x is regarded as the independent variable, and y as a function of x.

80. From the way in which a curve may be generated by an evolute, we have a method of finding any number of curves which may be rectified, that is, whose length may be assigned in algebraic terms; for PH, the radius of the curvature, is the sum of the straight line CE, and the arc EH of the evolute. Now we can form innumerable curves whose radius of curvature will be known, therefore, corresponding to every curve whose radius of curvature can be found and expressed in algebraic terms, there is a curve which can be exactly rectified.

81. We shall now give examples of the application of the formulae.

Ex. 1. Let the curve be a parabola, of which AC is the axis: let c denote the parameter, and let AQ = x, and PQ = y, be the co-ordinates of P, any point in the curve. Let CH be the evolute, and let AK = α, HK ≡ β, be the co-ordinates of H, the centre of curvature at P, the radius of curvature being PH = r.

By the nature of the curve, y 3 = ex, therefore, + _ rt -A. i i π * c *+⅜* c ÷ 4e dx “ 2y , P 4∙y 1 4x ’ (Py _ dp _ _ cdy 1 _ c s d⅛ s dx~ q ~ 2 dx ‘ y i ~ ìļp ’ r - _ ( 1 ÷P 8 ) * _ (≤±⅛⅛ (c*+to≠ ~ q - 2c t ~ 2c»

= ⅜√≡Σ∙

This is the expression for the radius of curvature by formula (2). If we put the normal PN = s, we have, by formula (3) (art. 78), s 3 _ 4⅜ 3 _ s 3 _ (normaD* r ~~W i ~ d’ - - (⅛c) s - (semipar.)»·

Next, to find the evolute, we have a = x~ ^(l+p 1 ) = ≈+ = 3x+įc s o 1 14-n s c s +4y ’ — 4y 3

Hence a = ⅜(α-⅛c), y--(~^ i and since, by the nature of the parabola, ex = y 2 ; therefore the equation of the evolute is

Take AC = ⅞c, then C is a given point; and CK = α— ⅛c∙ PutCK = x' ; HK = p = — g, and the equation of the involute becomes V ~ 27c

Hence it appears that the evolute is the semicubical parabola. This is the first curve that was rectified by the infinitesimal calculus.

Ex. 2. Let the curve be an ellipse, of which OA = α is the semitr ansvers e axis, and OB = b the semicojugate. Let e = √α s — b ’ be the eccentricity, and, assuming the centre as the origin of co-ordinates, let OQ = x, PQ = y, HP, the radius of curvature at P, = r. x s υ t

The equation of the curve is —ŗ + y- = 1; or ά» χ» + α 2 y 3 = a s b , : Hence [7:9:669]^- = P=--∙, dx ? α 2 y

To find the equation of the evolute, let Hbe any point in the curve; OK = α, and HK = /3, the co-ordinates. The values of p, 1 +p 3 , and q, being substituted in the formula (art. 79), we have _ v ι x a y ⅞* α 4 -∙<⅛ ~<⅛ 1 .

a x a*y i 4 a* a s y 2 a 4 ay y- f y - ≤^ p - y ÿ - · a y “δ 4 '

Let us exchange a and β for x , and y ’, and we have ⅛=(¾* ⅛=(⅛)∖

Observing now that in the ellipse L∙ ÷ = 1, we have for the equation of the evolute

(ÿ) f + (ÿ) ï = 1: or (tte, ) f + =(<* , -i ’) l .

"The form of this equation is remarkable from its analogy to that of the ellipse itself. The curve has the form shown in figure 17.

Ex. 3. Let the curve be the cycloid; of which let AA ’ be the base, BC the axis, BDC a circle whose diameter is BC. From P any point in the curve, draw PDE perpendicular to the axis, meeting the circle in D; draw PQ perpendicular to the base, and let PH be the radius of curvature.

Since all cycloids are similar figures, we may make the radius of the generating circle = 1; let CQ = PE = x, PQ = CE = y, the arc BD = v.

By the nature of the cycloid (art. 66, ex. 4), x ≡ V -ļ-sin V, y ≡ 1 — cos v, therefore dx = dv (1 -∣- cos υ), dy = dv sin υ, dy^_ _ sin v . 1 . _ 2 > _ dv . dx ] -∣- cos V , ‘ " 1 -∣- cos υ ’ * , 1 -Įcos v ’ ∙Py- d P x - a ~ 1 dx t dx ? (1 ψ cosr)* ’

Hence r, the rad. of cur. = — = √8 (1 -(- cose).

Draw the chord CD, and because

1 -ļ-cos V = 2 cos s ⅜t> (Algebra, 249) = 2 sin’ į arc CD = ⅛ chord* CD.

Therefore, PH = r = 2 chord CD.

It was shown (art. 66) that a tangent at P is parallel to BD, the chord of the supplement of CD; therefore PH, which is perpendicular to the tangent, is parallel to the chord CD; it is therefore determined in position and magnitude for any given point in the curve.

The evolute AHF may be found by the general formula (art. 79), or otherwise from the expression for PH, the radius of curvature, thus:

Draw AL perpendicular to AC, and equal to BC,.but on the opposite side of AC; describe the semicircle AML, and draw HMR perpendicular to AL, cutting the semicircle in M; let PH meet AC in N.

Because CA = semicircle CDB, and CN = DP = arc BD, therefore AN = arc CD. But because PH = 2CD = 2PN; and therefore PN = NH; the parallels PE, HR are equally distant from CA; and hence CE = RA, and arc CD = arc AM and chord CD = chord AM, also angle DCA = angle CAM. Now CD = PN = NH: therefore AM = NH; but AM is parallel to NH; therefore MH = AN = arc CD = arc AM; and HR = arc AM -∣- sin MR; thus it appears that H is a point in a semicycloid having the same base as the cycloid AβA ’. Indeed LAFis just the semicycloidal space CBA ’ transferred to the position AHF, the point B being placed at A, and A ’ at F. If the other semicycloidal space AB be transferred to the position FA'Ľ, the arc APB in the position FA'will form another branch of the evolute, exactly similar to FA, but turned the contrary way.

From what has been found it appears, that if the semicycloids FLA, FĽA'were placed in a vertical plane, with the point F uppermost, and the semi-bases FL, FĽ in a horizontal line; and if a weight were suspended from F by a thread equal in length to FB, and made to vibrate in that plane, like a pendulum; the weight would manifestly vibrate in an arc of a cycloid. This elegant property of the curve was discovered by Huygens, who also found that the vibrations would be isochronal, that is, performed [7:9:670]in equal times. This is an important proposition in dynamics.

Contact of Curves.

82. The ancient geometers paid particular attention to the contact of straight lines, with the few curve lines which they considered. Apollonius even touched on the contact of circles and the conic sections; for he treated of the shortest line that can be drawn from a given point in the axis to the curve. It is only, however, since the invention of the differential calculus that this branch of geometry has been carried to any considerable extent.

83. The curvature of a circle being the same throughout, it serves as the means of comparing the curvature in different points of a curve. It is, however, easy to understand, that in like manner we might consider the nature of the contact of a parabola, or a curve of any kind whatever, with a proposed curve.

Let y —f (x) and v = F (x) be the equations of two curves CPD, C'P ’ D', which have a common axis AB, and the same point A for the origin of co-ordinates. Let x be a common absciss, and y the corresponding ordinate of any point in the curve CD; also v, the like ordinate in the curve C'D ’. Suppose now that when x becomes x + 4 y becomes g, and v becomes ν'; by Taylor’s theorem,

∙→+Ζ*+gA+∙*

. _ , dυ , d i υ h i 1 c ^~ v+ dχ h + ^Γ2 + &C -

Suppose now the curves to have a common point H, at which y = v ; then, If the curves be such that ⅛ = — , their contact at P will be of such a nature, that no third curve can pass between them at that point, unless it has a like property.

LetHK=y = v, KQ = Ä, PQ =, ∕, P'Q = v'. Also, let u = HK be the ordinate of a third curve that passes through H, and u' its value, corresponding to AQ = x -ļ- h, then . . du , 1 d ’ u h∙ , „

* = + 2 + * c ∙

We are to prove it to be impossible for the third curve, in leaving the point H, to pass between the arcs HP and HP, unless — = ⅛ = ĝ. For suppose it possible, then, because in general pp =^-+(Ζ-Ζ)^+(S -g)f+ *- and, because at the point H, y≡r; and, in this particular case, = we have dx dx d- i i- (ĩv - ∖ -M ( ,p y tpv ∖ h3 t ~\dx? d⅛√2 + Uc 3 d⅛ 3 √6 + * c, This is the general expression for PP, the difference between the ordinates of the curves CD, C'D ’, whatever be the magnitude of KQ = h.

In like manner, the difference between g, the ordinate of the first curve, and u', that of the third, will be generally expressed by . , f t ty du ∖ i L d*«ĄÄ* , .

which, on the hypothesis that y = u, becomes (dy du ∖ , ftPy d*u ∖ h t . . "-''=⅛-z) * + t¢-aela + te

Now, if it were possible that the third curve, in leaving the common point H, could pass between the other two, we should, to a certain extent from the point H, have ÿ — d greater than g — u’, that is, after dividing the expressions for y — d and g — tt’ by h, (<Py ∕Pυ ∖ h (<Py d 3 v ∖ h t ∖ dx ’ d⅛ 8 ∕ 2 + ∖ dx* d⅛≡) 6 + &C ‘

dy du (d 1 y d t u ∖

And this equation ought to hold true, however small the line KQ = h be taken. But h may be taken so small, that all the terms in the expression for y ’ — d shall be less than any assignable quantity, while those of ↑f — d continually approach to ĝ — as a limit, which by hypothesis is not equal to zero. Now these two conclusions are incompatible with each other; therefore it is impossible that the third curve can pass through the point P between the other two, when ĝ is not equal to

If, however, ĝ = then the third curve may pass between the other two; for it will only be necessary that d s y <Pυ <l’y d ’ u . d 2 u . d⅛

dx 1 dx l > dx t dx i ' t at ls, d’ā? > dx t ' which is evidently possible.

84. Again, if there be two curves whose equations are y = f( χ ), V = F (x), and which have a common ordinate y = v, and if they be such, that dy dv d~y d i v dx~ dx dx i ~ dx i ' then no third curve of which the equation is w = φ (x), and which has a common ordinate with the other two, can pass between them, unless at the same time dy_ _ du tPy _ d λ u dx ~ <lx dx l ~ dx x

This proposition is proved exactly in the same way as that in last article, by means of Taylor’s theorem. These are particular cases of a general proposition relating to the contact of curves which may be stated thus: If two curves have a common absciss and ordinate, and if the differential co-efficients of the first order of the ordinates be equal, no third curve passing through their intersection can go between them, unless the differential co-effi∙ cient of its ordinate, corresponding to the same absciss, be equal to the differential co-efficients of their ordinates. And if, besides their first differential co-efficients, their second differential co-efficients be equal, then no third curve passing through their intersection can go between them, unless the first and second differential co-efficients of its ordinate be equal to the first and second differential co-efficients of the two curves, and so on to differential co-efficients of all orders.
[7:9:671]

In fact, the two curves meet only in the point in which their ordinates are the same, and the equality of the differential co-efficients merely indicates that no other curve in which the same equality does not take place can pass between them.

From what has been shown, it appears that the contacts of curve lines may be distinguished into different orders. The degree of contact in which the ordinates and also the first differential co-efficients are equal, may be called a Contact of the first order ; when, in addition to these, the second differential co-efficients are equal, it is a Contact of the second order ; and so on.

85. In illustration of this theory of contacts, let us consider the nature of the contact of any curve HPK (see fig. 6), with a straight line PT. Let A be the common origin of the co-ordinates. In the curve, let AB = x, PB = y. Its nature will be expressed by an equation y = f(*)∙ In the straight line, let TA = c, AB = x, PB = », angle PTB = e; the equation of the straight line is υ = (c +x) tan a. The hypothesis that the curve and straight line have a common point, gives y — υ ; and the equation of the straight line, considering that c and α must be regard-

. dv dv ed as constants, gives = tan a ; now, by our theory, = ⅛ therefore ⅛ = tan «. This result coincides with dx dx what was found in art. 66; and it gives the sub-tangent BT = √- = ⅛y.

tan α dy

It is impossible that any straight line can pass between the straight line PT and the curve; for, if possible, let the straight line PS pass between them, and meet the axis in S. Put AS = c ’, AB = X, PB ≡ «, the angle PSB = α'. The equation of the straight line PS is u = (c ’ + x~) tan α'; and hence = tan α'. Now, that the line PS may pass between PT and the curve, we should have ⅛ = ⅛ r dx dx

— (art. 83); therefore, tan a! — tan α, and a! — α; thus it appears that the lines PS, PT must coincide; therefore the straight line PT is a tangent to the curve, in the strictest sense.

86. Let us next consider the nature of the contact of a circle and any curve. Let CPD be the curve, and C'PD' a circle referred to the same axis AK, in which A is the common origin of the co-ordinates. In the curve CPD let AQ = X, PQ = y. Let H be the centre of the circle; draw the radius PH, and produce it to meet the axis in N, and draw HI, HK perpendicular to PQ and AQ. Put AQ = X, PQ = », these being co-ordinates of P any point in the circumference of the circle; and put AK = α, HK = β, the co-ordinates of its centre; and PH ≡ r its radius.

The equation of the curve CPD may be expressed generally by y =f (x). And, since IH = a — x, PI = υ — β, and PH = r, the equation of the circle will be (a-xf + (n-βf=r^ (1)

A contact of the first degree requires that ĝ = ĝ. Now, observing that a, β, and r must be considered as constants, we have ~ = * -*, hence and becausey = e, ⅛ - a ^=A (2)

The second side of this formula expresses the trigonometrical tangent of the angle PHI or PNQ. Hence (art. 65) the line PN is a normal to the curve at P, and the circle and curve have a common tangent at that point. By a second differentiation d 3 υ _ 1 α — X dυ (a — x) 1 + (»— βf dī?~~v — ß~(v — β) t ^dx~~ (v-β) i '

Now, that the circle and curve may have a contact of the second degree of closeness, it is necessary that = therefore, observing that» = y, and that (α — x) t + (» — βf — ι s , we have t ⅛≈-(y-β∕ W

The three equations (I), (2), (3) serve to determiner, the radius of the circle, and α, β the co-ordinates of its centre. From the first and second we get rdy o rdx a-x= y - L ; y— β = -- (dx* + <fy t ) s (dx* + dy t p and from these, and equation (3), we get _ (dx i + dy i )⅛ ~ dxd l y ’ gzsy -⅛.⅛ a ÷ t ⅜ t . β + d½ + dy> dx cPy * cPy

These expressions for α, β, and r determine the position and magnitude of the circle; they are manifestly identical with the radius of the circle of equal curvature, and the co-ordinates of its centre formerly found (art. 78 and 79). Hence we conclude, that the circle of equal curvature with a curve in any point, determined by the theory of evolutes, is identical with a circle, having with the curve a contact of the second order.

And since it appears that only one circle can have with a curve a contact of the second order, and that no circle can pass between that circle and the curve, therefore the same must be true of the circle of equal curvature, found by the theory of evolutes.

87. From what has been shown in regard to the degrees of contact of a straight line and circle with a curve, it appears that these depend on the number of constants which enter into the equation of the touching line. The equation of a straight line contains two constants, and it admits of one order of contact only. The equation of a circle has three constants, and it admits of a contact of the second order. It is easy to see that the number of differential co-efficients that can be made equal in the two curves will always be one less than the number of constants in the touching curve. The equation of a parabola isy = α + βx + γx i . This and the differential equations which may be deduced from it serve to determine the three constants a, β, γ, and thence the parabola of equal curvature; but since there are only two differential co-efficients, the parabola can have a contact of the first and [7:9:672] also of the second order with any curve, but no higher order of contact. A cubic parabola, whose equation is y=« + /3a: + Xaŕ + ðx 3 , may, however, have a contact of the third order, because it involves four constants, and so on.

Development and Differentiation of Functions containing two Variables.

88. Let a be a function of two independent variables, x and y; for example, u — ax 3 + bxy + cy i , and in general a —f(x, y). Suppose now that x changes its value, and becomes x + h, and that y becomes y + k, so that u' being the new value of the function, u' =f(x+h, y+k). It is proposed to expand u' into a series of terms proceeding by the integer powers of h and k. In particular cases the method of proceeding is obvious; a general formula may be found by Taylor’s theorem as follows.

It is easy to see that the result will be the same whether we substitute at once x + ĥ for x, and y + k for y, in the function u, and then expand it; or, otherwise, first substitute x + A, then expand the function, according to the powers of h, and in this first result put y + k for y, and afterwards expand it into terms proceeding by the powers of k ; or we may reverse this process, beginning with the expansion according to the powers of k, and ending with that proceeding by the powers of h.

Resuming the function u=f(x,y)∙, when x becomes X + h, we have by Taylor’s theorem f(x + h, y) ≡ , du, . (Pu h t d ’ u A 3 u + dχ h+ dx l l.2 + dχ∙ 1.2.3 + &C ’ the differentials being taken upon the supposition that x is variable, and y a constant And in this series y is contained only in the function u, and the differential co-effi- . ι du (Pu . c,ent8 ^^^ 1 * c ∙

The order in which the substitutions are made being arbitrary, the two developments otf(x + Å, y + k) must be identical, consequently the terms containing the same products of h and k must be equal. Thus, passing over the terms which are the same, we have ,du du dx _ dy dy ~ dx'

89. This formula proves an important theorem in the calculus, namely, if a function u of two independent variables X and y be twice differentiated, first, on the hypothesis that X is variable and y constant, and then the result on the supposition that y is variable and x constant. And again, if the order of the differentiations be reversed, that is, if y be made variable and x constant, and then x variable and y constant, the final result either way will be the very same.

The symbol which expresses the result of two differentiations performed on «, a function of two variables X and y (the first on the supposition that x is variable and y constant, and the second on the reverse supposition), may conveniently be simplified into By this notation the theorem just enunciated in words will be expressed in symbols thus:

(Pu _ (Pu dxdy dydx'

By continuing the two developments a term farther, we would have arrived at the conclusion that (having regard to the notation just premised), (Pu _ (Pu _ (Pu dxdydx dx i dy dydx i ’ , , (Pu (Pu . alldthat d⅛⅛^ = ⅛^> 4c ∙

90. Supposingwtobeanyfunctionofa:, and that a; becomes x+ĥ, by which u becomes u+ph + qh? + &c., or (considering h as the differential of x) u + pdx + qda? + &c. We have defined the differential of u to be the term pdx, viz. that which contains the simple power of A or dx, and called the du function p, the differential co-efficient, representing it by^-.

We may now extend these definitions to∕(x, y), a function of two variables, and changing h into dx and k into dy in the development of the function, we shall have , du . , du , dffx,y)=du=-⅛dx+ -⅛ dy.

From this it appears that the complete differential of a function of two variables consists of two parts, viz. įl dx, dx or the differential taken on the supposition that x alone is variable, and dy, or the differential taken when y only is variable.

We may also apply to functions of two variables the rules which have been given (art. 10-23) for those which depend only on one; and for this purpose we must differentiate the function first with respect to one of its variables, and then with respect to another ; and take the sum of the results for the complete differential required. By this rule clx +y) = dx + dy d (xy) = ydx + xdy, d (- ∖ = ιζaι . airf y — v dχ - χd y ∖ y)~ y y i ŕ '

Again, let u = z m y n , we have — nix m — 1 y'dx, ^dy = ιut m y t ~ 1 dy, dut= ^dx + ^dy = x m — l y n ~ 1 (mydx + nxdy).

91. The manner in which the differentials of functions which depend on more than one variable are written, gives rise to some important remarks. The expression dx must not be confounded with du, which it might be if u contained only the variable x; the symbol has in this case a particular meaning, and denotes the differential co-efficient taken on the hypothesis of x only being variable; or it is the quotient of the first term of the development of the difference taken on that supposition divided by the increment dx ; and ⅛L(y signifies the same with respect to y.

The quantities are commonly called partial differences of the first order of the function u, and generally ¢ļ m +

-,— 3 - represents one of those of the order m + n, which dx n dy n 1 arises by differentiating m times in respect of x, and n times in respect of y. A function of a single variable has only one differential co-efficient of any order;.but a function of two variables has two differential co-efficients for the first order, three for the second, &c. These may be deduced from the two first, beginning with du , 1 du , du = ⅛ dx + ⅛⅛ ’ then, taking the differentials of ⅛ and ⅛ which must be β dx dy treated as functions of two variables, we have ,du d°u , 1 d 8 w , d - τ - = - τ - i dx + - 5 - r dy, dx dx i dydx 3 ,du d a u 1 d t u , dy~ dxdy dif y, and since the second differential is nothing more than the differential of the first, d a u , . 1 _ <f s w , , 1 d°u , , d 1 u = -7-; da? + 2 - r - r dxdy + - r ° dy t . da? dxdy a dip a

Here dx and dy are considered as constant quantities, and the differential co-efficients whose denominators contain only the products of dx and dy differently arranged, are considered as identical. By a repetition of this process, an expression may be found for the third differential co-efficient of the function w, and so on to any differential.

92. What has been explained in respect of a function of two independent variables, will apply to a function of any number; thus, if w=∕(<, x, y, z), then, , du ,, , du , . du , 1 du , du =di dt + di dx+ d^ dy + di dz ' where the symbols du du au du dt' dx ’ dy’ dz' denote the differential co-efficients of the function “taken on the supposition that t or x or y or z alone varies.

This notation owes its origin to Fontaine. Euler feared that the differential co∙efficient might be confounded with the ratio of the complete differential du to the differential dx, which is equivalent to du , . du , , du , . dz , -r-dt j f∙-r-dx∙ ∖ --1-dy∙ ∖ ∙- s -dz dt dx dy 3 dz dx he therefore denoted this ratio by whilst he expresses the differential co-efficient found by supposing x alone variable by The nature of the subject, however, in general shows which of the two is intended, and renders this distinction superfluous.

Of Changing the Independent Variable.

93. Supposing y to be any function of x, we have estimated every change in the magnitude y by that of the value of x, which has been supposed to vary in any way whatever. It is, however, sometimes convenient to reverse the hypothesis, and consider x as a function of y. We are now to investigate general rules, by which we may pass from the differentials of y, regarded as a function of X, to those of X considered as a function of y.

Let y =f (x), and let us suppose that when x becomes X + h, y becomes y + k. By Taylor’s theorem, k - ⅛ h + d ⅛ + διc <n ft ~dx^dx i 2 Ύ dx 3 ' ' [7:9:674]On the reverse hypothesis, supposing x = F (y) a function of y, then, similarly, , dx, , d t xk* <Px k 3 j . Ä= d¢+^2+d’?273 + &C ;< 2 >

Let the value of k, as given by the first equation, be substituted in the second; and, in order to abridge, let usput⅛ = y,g=jΛ,*c.

also ⅞ = af, -A = x", &c. ; then we have dy ’ dy* 3

A = x'(yA + y∣* + y⅛+Ac.)

0 = (*y-1) Ä + (a ⅛Λ + x”y»)

+ (a∕y" + 3αfy∕ + a*y) I’ + &c.

Now, that this equation may be satisfied, the co∙effi∙ cients of the powers of A must be each = 0; thus, a/y —1 = 0, x'y" + x"y r2 = 0, x r y "'+ 3x"yy'+xy = 0, &c.

These equations give us

Reversely, we have

As an application of these formulae, we may transform the expression for the radius of curvature found (art. 78), on the hypothesis that y is a function of x, into another in which a: is a function of y. Employing the notation of last article, r _ α+y ι )* y ’ '

Now by the formulae y = -, and y* = —: this substi tution being made, we obtain (* t +D* _ (⅛ 8 ÷rfy , ) ∖ af dyd i x

94. Instead of supposing that one of the two variables X, y, is a function of the other, it is sometimes convenient to regard both as functions of a third quantity. Thus, in geometry, supposing x and y to be the co-ordinates of a curve, we may consider the one as a function of the other; or we may consider both as functions of the angle which a tangent makes with the axis, which angle is then the independent variable. Or x and y denoting the co-ordinates of the path of a projectile, both may be considered as functions of t, the time of the motion.

Suppose that when t becomes t + i, x becomes x + A, and that y becomes y + k ; to abridge, put a/, x", &c. for ⅞∙ S? 4c ∙ i ,l ∙ 0 s ’ ∙ r∙ “∙ f ° r ⅛ ⅞' 4c ∙* nd <A<A *e l⅛⅛'g,ic.

y = F (0 gives A = ÿi + y ļ + &c (2)

X = ρ (t’) gives A = art + a∕L + &c (3)

The three increments A, A, i are generated together, therefore these equations must all hold true at the same time. Let the value of A, found from the third equation, be substituted in the first, then, putting the two values of A equal, we have

(y) {art + a∕ ’ ⅛ +&c.|

Hence, by involution, and making the co-efficients of like powers oft equal to zero, as usual, we find

<y)=y> ≈"(y) + * λ <y>=y , ∙ &<=.

therefore (y) = *-; (y ’) = - 8ιc ∙

As an example, let us take the formula for the radius of curvature, which, by the notation just premised, will be r _ {ι+<yy}*

(y ’) ’.

By substituting for (y) and (y ff ) their values, it becomes (a * + y t )∣ ay—y®* ’ and hence, putting ⅛ for a/, ĝ sory, for af, and for y ’, we get (dx' ÷ dyrf dyd i x — dx<Py'

The independent variable t does not appear in the formula; nevertheless, in its application, we must keep in mind the hypothesis by which it was found.

Of the Method of Infinitesimals.

95. The ideas which we have of infinity may be embodied in this proposition: A quantity is not infinite so long as it admits of augmentation. If, therefore, in the quantity X + a, we suppose x to become infinite, then a must be suppressed, otherwise it would be supposed that x might be increased by the quantity a, which is contrary to the definition. To show the consistency of the proposition, let there be an equation

= M (1)

a X which being multiplied by the product ax, becomes X + a = Mar (2)

Suppose now that x increases until it becomes infinite; the fraction -, having reached its last degree of diminution, is reduced to 0, and therefore equation (1) becomes

M = ł, or Mα = 1; [7:9:675]and this value being substituted in equation (2), it becomes x + a = x. This shows that when x is infinite, x + a is reduced to x.

The quantity α, in respect of which x is infinite, is called an infinitesimal in respect of x.

Since we consider here only the ratios of quantities, the preceding demonstration holds good when x has a finite value, provided that a be infinitely small in respect of x. Thus, if we compared, a finite quantity, with the fraction p then, z being supposed to increase continually, will decrease, and may become smaller than any assignable quantity; and when z is infinite, the fraction is = 0, so that, in comparison with δ, it may be neglected.

The ratios of quantities are altogether independent of their absolute magnitude. The halves, or any like parts of quantities, have the same ratios as the wholes. The symbols we employ in our reasonings are not the representatives of absolute magnitudes, but of numbers, which have a reference to an unit; they therefore represent ratios only, and the absolute magnitudes of the terms of the ratios are never considered. The differentials of quantities are the ratios to which the ratios of the increments of the variables continually approach; these increments may have any magnitude whatever. Leibnitz supposed them to be infinitely small quantities. Upon this hypothesis a theory has been constructed, which, by following certain ascertained principles, has led to the discovery of the most recondite truths in geometry and physics.

96. The admission of infinitesimals into the mathematical sciences, necessarily leads to a succession of different orders of infinitesimals. In a circle the ratio of the diameter to the chord of an arc is the same as the ratio of the chord to the versed sine; therefore, if the chord be infinitely small in respect of the diameter, or an infinitesimal of the first order, the versed sine will be infinitely small in respect of the chord; and, consequently, in respect of the diameter, will be an infinitesimal of the second order. So also, in a series of continued proportionals, 1, x, x s , ae 3 , &c. of which the first term is finite, and the second, x, an infinitesimal of the first order, the third, x i , will be of the second order, and the fourth, z 3 , of the third, and so on. Upon the same principle, the product ab of two infinitesimals, a, b of the first order will be an infinitesimal of the second; for we may consider that 1: a = b : ab, that is, ah is a fourth proportional to three quantities 1, a, and b, of which the first is finite. In like manner, the product of three infinitesimals of the first order, also the product of an infinitesimal of the first and of the second order, will be an infinitesimal of the third order.

97. When the infinitely small increments of quantities are once taken as their differentials, the different rules for differentiation are easily found.

Thus, if u = xy ; then w, x, and y receiving the infinitely small augments du, dx, and dy, we have « + du = (x + dx) (y + dy)'= xy -f- xdy + ydx -J- dxdy ; and, taking from these equals the equals u and xy, du = xdy -f- ydx -ļ- dxdy.

Now du, xdy, ydx are infinitesimals of the first order, and dxdy is an infinitesimal of the second, therefore it is incomparably smaller, and in respect of the others ought to be rejected, so that we have simply du = xdy -ļ- ydx.

98. In this theory a curve is considered as a polygon of an infinite number of sides, any one of which is the differential of the arc, therefore the differential of the arc will be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, of which the sides are the differentials of the co-ordinates; and these being denoted by x and y, and the arc by z, we have dz i — dx 2 4- dy ’. Proceeding on the same principles, if s denote the area of a curve, the increment of s or ds will beydx + ⅛dxdy ; but the second part of this, viz. ⅛dxdy, is a differential of the second order, and therefore infinitely less than ydx, which is of the first order, therefore we have simply ds =ydx, agreeing with the formula of art. 69.

In a circle, the infinitely small increments of the cosine, the sine, and the arc form a right-angled triangle similar to that formed by the sine, the cosine, and the radius, so that x being put for the arc, the radius being unity,

1: cos X = dx : d sin x, 1: sin x — dx : — d cos x, hence d sin x = dx cos x, and d cos x = — xdx.

It is equally manifest, according to the infinitesimal theory, that the subtangent is a fourth proportional to dx (the differential of the absciss), dy (the differential of the ordinate), and y the ordinate; so that, as has been shown, art. 65, v —dy subtan =

dx " the positive sign being used if the absciss and ordinate increase together, otherwise the sign —.

The great facility which the theory of infinitesimals gives in the applications of the calculus to the higher geometry, and more especially to the doctrines of physics, is a high recommendation in its favour. Indeed, whatever view be taken of the subject, the mathematician will hardly be restrained from taking the shortest way he can find to the object he wishes to attain, and that is in general by the infinitesimal calculus. Accordingly we observe that Μ. Poisson, in the second edition of his Traité de Mécanique, distinctly premises that he will exclusively employ the method of infiniment petits throughout his work.

PART II.

INVERSE METHOD OF FLUXIONS, OR INTEGRAL CALCULUS.

99. The inverse method of fluxions, or integral calculus, treats of the analytic processes by winch a function may be found, such, that being differentiated, it shall produce a given differential. This function has been called, by writers on fluxions, the fluent or flowing quantity ; and by writers on the differential calculus, the integral of the proposed differential.

To find the integral of a differential is to integrate that differential; and the process by which the integral is found is called integration.

100. When an integral is proposed, its differential may always be found by general rules. There is however no direct rule by which we may return from the differential to the integral, except the obvious one of retracing the steps by which the differential has been deduced from the integral. When these are distinctly indicated, there is no difficulty; but in general the steps of calculation by which the differential might have been deduced from an integral are obliterated or unknown; or the differential may not have been a direct result of differentiation; and then there will be no traces to show how we may pass from it to the integral.

101. It is convenient to have a symbol by which the integral of a differential may be indicated without regard to its particular form: for this purpose the letter J ∖ the initial letter of the word sum) is employed. Thus, the integral of the differential Xu⅛ is expressed by the symbol

∕x∙ fe ∙

102. We have seen (art. 9) that in differentiating an expression of the form X ∑±z C, which is the sum or difference[7:9:676] of a variable function and a constant quantity, the constant disappears; therefore, reversely, in taking the integral of any differential, the constant, C, must be added to make the integral complete. This indeterminate quantity has been called by early English writers the correction of the fluent or integral, but now it is generally called the arbitrary constant. It may be written either with the sign + or —; its value is to be determined, as will appear hereafter, from the particular problem under consideration.

Integration of Rational Functions involving one Variable.

103. The general form of a differential of the first order of a function is X⅛ where X denotes any function of a single variable x. Now this function may have various forms, and may be rational or irrational.

The rational forms of the function may be

A√ n + Bz rt + Ca√ , + &c. = U, Ax m 4^ B a⅛ w + Cx? + &c. U

A⅛ m ' + B⅛"'+C'x π + &c. ~ v ^*

the first of which is integral and the second fractional. Irrational functions have the form uv", and transcendental functions,

AU, 1. ü), AU, sin v), &C.

104. The simplest case of a rational functionis ax n , the differential of which is nax n ~ i dx s therefore, putting m = n — 1, so that n = m + 1, we have, when dy = ax m dx, then y — JajTdx — — Lγ-ař* +1 + C.

Hence this rule: To integrate a differential of one term, such as ax n dx, we must increase the exponent of the variable by an unit, and then divide by the new exponent and by dx.

We may give the indeterminate constant C the form ab" +1 -ĵ-ŗ, and then we shall have n-t-1

l’ax n dx = Φ g+1 -⅛ "÷ 1 ) * ’ n-ł-1

This is the form the integral should have, if it has the property of vanishing in the particular case ofx = b.

105. There is a particular case to which the general rule of last article will not immediately apply; it is that in which n = — 1; in that case it gives f ad f = r aτ -χ dx = ÷ 0 -⅛ 0 ) _ l^Į _ 0 J X J 0 ~ 0 ~ 0'

From this no conclusion can be drawn, and the integral has been said to fail. This, however, ,is only in appearance; for, putting n +1 = to, we have (art. 35)

^=ı+(i x)TO+(i. a: yg+&c.

⅛"=l+(l.i)m + (l.δ)*⅛ + ftc.

x--⅛" = {1. X -1. ⅛} m+ {(1. «)»—(!. b f} g+& c .

~~ = 1 ∙ 3c ~ l ∙ 0 + { Ο· - (>∙ O’ y + &c.

This, when n÷ 1 = m ⅛ 0 and n = — 1, gives v ∕yn = α{l. X — 1. ⅛} = a 1. x÷C.

This result coincides entirely with the expression for the differential of the logarithm of a number (art. 20).

106. By the rule of art. 104 it is evident that if dy = ax m dx+bx n dx + cx p dx,

— ⅛÷⅛÷⅛κ

This is true, however many terms there may be in the differential: the indeterminate constant C represents the aggregate of all the constante of the integrals of the several terms.

In general, since (art. 15), d(u+v — z) — du+dv — dz, therefore u+v—z ~Jdu+Jdv—Jdz ; and in general, P, Q, R, being any functions of ar, f(pdx + Qdx — Rd⅛) =fpdx+ ßìdx —Jv.dx.

107. It has been found that u and v being any functions of a variable, d(uv) ⊂z udy + υdu i therefore Judy —uv— Jvdu.

In like manner, from the differential of a fraction we find

∕4=-Ξ+∕⅛

Since d(au) = adu, we may conclude that saXdx = α s'idx.

108. To integrate the differential dy — (ax + b) n dx, we may expand the given power, and integrate the terms of the result separately; otherwise, make z = ax + b, then z — b dz X = , dx = — . a a

By substitution, we have now dy = ĩľln, an ; b į nte _ a j gration, y = gm+l +C= (^+b) m+ì , c a(m +1) a(m +1) ‘ ‘

The integral of dy - (α√*+ b) m x n ~ 1 dx may be found in the same way, by putting ax^ + b — z j we thus get ( m - + ⅜)-÷ 1 j na(m +1) ψ

109. We shall next consider fractional functions, and begin with the simple case of dy = -½ t ∖ d f . making (ax + bp o z = ax + b, we find _ z — b , dz X =≡ , dx ~ — , a a and consequently dy = ⅛ z ~ b '> mdz a m + l z n

By expanding (z — b) m into a series, then multiplying the terms by dz, and dividing by z", the differential will be transformed into a series of terms of the form cz p dz, which [7:9:677] may be integrated severally by the rule (art 104). As a particular example, let m = 3, n = 2, then j A(z — bYdz

-Δ.1+~ ?.hdz + 36*z ~ 1 dz — Pi“**}: Hence, integrating by the rule, y= Aţ£_3te+3i’l z + i’2- 1 ļ + C.

We now substitute for z its value, and find a f∣(w + 0∕-3i(∞ + 0) ļ y=-?į+3Ml.(a» + i) + α ⅛f + c *

110. All differentials which are rational fractions may be reduced to this form, (A⅜"~ 1 + B®"~ 2 + C®"~ 2 . . + Dd⅛

* n + A'®"” 1 + B'®"- 2 . . . + T'

The general method of integrating such a differential consists in decomposing it into others whose denominators are more simple, which are called partial fractions. These are obtained as follows.

Assume the denominator of the proposed fraction equal to zero, thus forming the equation x n + A' ä”- 1 + B'√*- 2 .... + T' = 0.

Let the roots of this equation be x = — α, X = — α ’, X = — a", x = — a", &c. and supposing them all different, the first side of the equation will be (Algebba, art. 99) the product of n factors, X + a, X + d’, X + α ff , X + at”, &c. We now assume that the proposed fraction is the sum of the fractions N⅛ Nŵ N ’ 'd.r X + a ’ X + cľ X + a'' , C ’ of which the denominators are the factors of the proposed fraction, and the numerators are undetermined constants. These being reduced to a common denominator, and added, the result will be a fraction identical with the proposed fraction; and by putting the co-efficients of like powers of X in their numerators equal to one another, a series of equations will be had, by which the undetermined constants N, N', N", &c. may be found.

As an example, suppose the differential to be integrated is (A® 2 + B® + C) dx

®s + A'® 2 + B'® + C'

and that by the resolution of an equation we know that ®ð + A'® 2 + B⅛ + C'= (® + a)(® + d’) (® + a»).

setting aside dx, we assume that the fraction is equivalent to N N' N"

x + a X + a! x + a"'

The sum of these is N(®+zŕ)(®+rf') + N'(®+ g )(®+ a »)+N»(®+a)(®+d’) (® + a) (® + at) (® + at 1 )

The numerator of this fraction is, by multiplying its factors,

(N + N'÷N")a≈+ {N(d’+d’0 + N'(a+tf0+N'(a+a')}® + Nα ’ α" + N'∞ ’ + NW; and as this must be equal to the numerator of the proposed differential, whatever be the value of ®, the co-efficients of like powers of ® will be equal (art. 18); hence we have these three equations,

N + N' + N' = A.

N (β' + at) + N' (α + rf') + N" (a + d’) = B, Non 2 + N'aa" + NW ≡ C; which are only of the first degree with respect to the undetermined quantities N, N', N'. Resolving these equations, we find Ń, N', N β , and have

(A® 2 + B® + C)dx

®3 ÷ A'® 2 + B⅛ + C'

_ Ndr 4- 4. N g <⅛ ~ X + a x + at X + α"'

Making ® + a = z, we have dx — dz, and χ

≡ the integral of which is N 1. z = N 1. (® + a) ; similarly,

So that we have now p {λx i + B X + C)d⅛

√ ®* + A⅛ β + B⅛ + C'

= Nl.(® + a) + Nl. (® + at) + Nl. (® + a") + const.

1. {(® + a) N · (® + o , ) n ∙ (® + a") N } + const.

This process, which may be extended to all rational fractions whose denominators are decomposable into unequal factors of the first degree, has no difficulty, independent of the decomposition of the denominator into its factors, which, however, requires the numerical resolution of equations.

111. If some of the factors of the denominator of the proposed fraction are equal, the process will require to be modified to suit that case. Suppose the denominator ®» + A'®" -1 +, &c.... + T' to contain a factor (*+α) i * then, for every such factor, it will be necessary to assume a partial fraction of the form (P√ , ~ 1 + <⅛√ , - 2 +, &C....+ γy⅛ (® + a) p

This and the other partial fractions being reduced to a common denominator, and added, and the terms of the numerator in the result being put equal to those of the numerator of the proposed differential, as before, as many independent equations will be obtained as there are coefficients to be determined.

112. It is not difficult to see that the partial fraction suited to the case of equal factors may be transformed into an expression of the form Nd⅛ + N'd⅛ + N⅛ (x + a) p (x + a) p ~ l '" x + a ' therefore we may at once substitute this instead of the equivalent single fraction. We shall now have to integrate a series of differentials of the form Nd® (® + a) p which, by making x + a = z, and therefore dx ≡ dz, gives /Nd® _ ∕ ’ N τ d⅛ _ Nz -p + l (x + a) p z p 1 —P N

(1—/>)(«+α∕~ 1

These will be all algebraical except the last, J which will involve a logarithm.

113. If there be imaginary factors, these will occur in pairs of the form ® + a + ∕3√— 1, ® + a — ßV— 1, [7:9:678]and their product will be 3? + 2ax + 3? + ∕3 2 . In this case the best way to proceed will be to resolve the deno- ' minator of the proposed differential into real factors of the first and of the second degree, which is always possible (see Equations). If there be several pairs of these imaginary factors, each pair the same, the denominator of the proposed differential will have factors of the form (ar t + 2ax + a t + β l ) q . Then, for the single factor x 2 + 2αz -fa* + ∕3 2 , we must assume, in addition to the partial fractions, for factors of the first degree, one of this (Kz + L)t⅛ z 2 + 2αz + α 2 + β t ’ and for factors of the second form, this fraction, ((¾r ag ~ 1 + R¾ ag ~ a ... + Y')<⅛ .

+> + 2αx + <√ + β i ) q or, instead of this, a series of fractions, (Kz + L)d⅛ (K⅛ + L')dx

+ «* + 2ax + a t + β t ' ’ the co-efficients to be determined, as before explained.

114. To integrate the fraction

(Kz + L) dx x t + 2ax + a* + β l ' we observe that z 2 + 2<xz + α* + ∕3 2 = (a: + α) l + ∕3 s ; and if we make x + a = z, then

(Kz + L)d⅛ (Kz + L — Kα)rfz (x+ a y> + β*~ z' + β* Kzdz Udz ~z* + β ι z i + β 1 '

Here Ľ is put for the constant quantity L— Kα∙ Now, the integral of the first of these differentials may be expressed by a logarithm; for, making z 2 = u, we have zdz = ⅛du, which gives

With respect to the second part, we make z = βv, then, L'd⅛ _ Ľ dv J~+^β 2 ~ ß V* + l’

But we have found (art. 23) that 1j⅞-τ is ‘he differential of the arc whose tangent is v, which is expressed by tan " l v t therefore z∙L∕ dv Ľ 1 i f1-7+l = 7 a "-· + ·—

Adding now these results, we get = K b + J tan "* į + c ° n " t ∙

When the value of z and Ľ are replaced, we have e (Kx + L)rfz

.∕ x° + 2ax + α i + ∕3 s

115. To integrate the differential (Kz + L)<⅛ (** + 2w + α* + ∕8 s ) i, we shall at once make x + a = z, and L — Kα = Ľ. By this the differential is transformed to <Kz+L , )⅛ _ Kzdz + L⅛ (** + py (z t + β*) q (z' + p) q

To transform the first part, we make z l + β t = u, so that zdz = and consequently, ∕ Kzc⅛ _ K pdu _ K u — í + 1

(z 2 + β l ) q ~ 2d u q ~ 2 ' 1 — q '

To integrate the second part, we assume the equation ∕dz Gz y∙ dz (z* + ∕3≈)t “ (7+>) g - 1 + h *∕ (z> + β*) g ~ 1 ’ that is, we assume the integral to be equal to an algebraic quantity, together with another integral whose denominator is less by an unit than the first W r e now differentiate the terms of the assumed equation, observing that the removal of f, the sign of an integral, is equivalent to the differentiation of that integral; we also reject such factors as are common to all the terms of the result, and thus have l=GC* + β>)-2(y-D Gs≡+H(z* + l 8∙) ι and {(3-2y)G + H}∖ s + (G + H)^-1 = 0.

Now, that z may remain undetermined, we must have (G÷H)j3 i -1 = 0, (3 —2g)G÷H = 0.

From these equations, we find r - 1 h _ ⅜~ 3 tj -(2 9 -2)β* ’ (2 γ -2)^∙

The values of G and H being substituted in our assumed equation, it becomes ∕ ∙ dz _ 1 z (z i + β i ) q ~ (2q-2)β ’ (z t +β t ) q - 1 ' ⅜ — 3 p dz + (2q-2)β 1 d(ζ^+β t ) q ~ 1 '

This forrħula gives the means of depressing the index of the denominator of the proposed fraction; for, putting q — 1 instead of q, we find ∕∙ dz 1 »

Here the process must stop; tor the next transformation would involve the integral^^ψ-^y 0 , with [7:9:679]an infinite co-efficient, from which no conclusion can be drawn. Here we see the application of a method of integration at once fertile and elegant.

From what has been explained, it appears that differentials which are rational fractions may be always integrated either algebraically or by means of logarithms or circular arcs; all that is necessary is to decompose them into partial fractions, whose denominators are either binomial or trinomial quantities.

116. We shall now give some examples of the integration of differentials which are rational fractions.

1. Let the differential be τp-~^ι∙

In this case the denominator ı? — a t = lx — a) lx + α); we therefore assume adx = ∫A + ≡U,

(a:— a)lx+a) įa:— a x+a)

We now reduce the second side to a single fraction, and, leaving out dx, have a (A+ , B)¾ + (A-B)α .

lx — a) lx + a) ~ lx — a) lx + a) therefore α=(A + B)a + (A—B)a.

Now, X being indeterminate, according to the principle of art. 18, we must have

(A—B)α = α, A÷B = 0 5 these equations give A = ⅜, B = — ⅜; the proposed differential is now adx _ . dx , dx - ’ X — a *X + a' and, by integrating,

2 X + a X + a a’ + bV 2 . Let the differential be - s -¾ dx. a 2 x — x i

The factors of the denominator are x and α s — x t , which last resolves into la — x) la + x) ; therefore, leaving out dx, we assume g> + ⅛r a _ A_ , B , C xla — x)la+x)~ X a — x a + x'

The second side of this equation, by reducing its terms to a common denominator, and adding, is Aa t + a(B + C)x÷(B-A—CX xla — x) la + x)

By equating the co∙efficients of the powers of x, we have Aa t = a 3 , β(B÷C) = O, B —A —C=δ.

Here there are three unknown quantities, viz. A, B, C, and three simple equations, therefore they may be found, as taught in Algebra, sect, viii.; and accordingly we have A = a, B = ⅜(α + O, C = —⅜(a÷δ), a 9 + bx i adx a + b , a + b j a⅛ — x 3 ~ x + 2la — x) 2(a + x) ’ and, integrating,

3. Let the differential be ~t~β~pl} dx '

To resolve the denominator into simple factors, we make x t — 6x + 8 = 0, and find the roots of this equation to be X = 2, and x = 4; therefore, x t — 6x + 8 = lx — 2) lx — 4). To decompose the fraction, leaving out dx, we now assume 3¾ — 5 A B lx — 2) lx — 4) ~ x — 2 ^"^ X — 4’ _ (A÷B>-4A—2B - (i -2)(x-4) ∙

Hence, equating the like terms in the numerators, we have

A÷B = 3, — 4A — 2 B = — 5.

7 From these equations we find A = —1, B = -, and ∕ 13x — 5}dx _ , p dx 7 p dx x i - 6x + 8 - ~ i Jx- 2 + 2j^x- 4’

= 11.(«_4)-il.(x-2)+C.

4. As an example of equal simple factors in the denominator. let the differential be x s dx _ ι 2 d x lz t -d i ) lx — a) ~ lx — a) t lx + α)'

In this case we assume (art. 112), = + + _ç_ lx— a) t lx+ a) lx—a) 3 x — a x + a _ Alx + α) + B(a a -α a ) + C Ç »—α) , - lx — a/lx + a) Aa _ Ba t + Ca 2 + (A — 2αC) a: + (B ÷ C)a*

- lx-a) i lx + a)

By equating like terms of the numerators, we have Aa — Bα 2 + Ca 2 = 0, A —2aC = 0, B÷C=1. Hence, by the ordinary process for resolving simple equations involving three unknown quantities, we find A = įa, B = f, C = ⅜, and the transformed differential is x ι dx _ a dx . 3 dx_ dx lx—ay lx + a)~ 2 (a>-→) a ^ t ^ 4 x—a “x + a

By integration we have ∕⅛, ⅛i⅛-√⅛'-- therefore, supplying the co-efficients of the partial fractions, and, as usual, an indeterminate constant, we have X>-⅜⊂¾ -».÷’÷u»-«) + į 1. lx + a) + const.

5. Let the differential be — 1 y t ~ dx ∙

The denominator contains two pairs of equal factors; we therefore assume (art. 112) - ļy er l ual t0

x lx + D t (a;÷ 1) lx — 1) 2 x — 1 By proceeding as in the foregoing examples, uniting the partial fractions into one fraction, and equating the co-efficients of like powers of x, we find

A = 2, B = -⅜, C = -i, D = 1, E = -⅜∙ The proposed differential is now decomposed into these, [7:9:680]— - I dx i dx J- dx s dx x '(x+ ∖ y~*x + i + (7∑1 i)*-ii∑ZI∙ Hence, by integration, ∕⅛⅞w⅛∙ fc = i, ∙*+i+-w∙+>> ~ 1 — ĩ 1 ∙ (af — 1) + const.

6. As an example of a fraction, in which one of the factors in the denominator is a function of the second degree, which does not admit of resolution into real factors of the first degree, let the differential to be integrated be a + bx ρ≡=π dr ∙

The denominator x i — 1 ≡ (χ — 1) ( λ λ -J- x 4- n. The expression ae* + x + 1 is of that kind which cannot be resolved into real factors, although it may into two imaginary factors. For, making 3? + x + 1 = 0, and resolving this quadratic equation, we findar = 3 , and 3? + X + 1 - (x + 1 + I √⊂3) (χ + į _1√ZZsJ.

To avoid impossible quantities, we assume (art. 113)

a + ax A Bar + C

117. The method of resolving a rational fraction into ’ its component partial fractions, by the theory of indeterminate co-efficients (art. 110-113), is the most elementary of any; it is however tedious. We shall therefore now show how the labour may be abridged.

Let ŷ-be a rational fraction in its lowest terms, the denominator of which has unequal divisors of the first degree; let χ + a be one of them, and Q the product of all the other factors, whether of the first or second degree; so that

V ≡ (x + β ) Q.

In this case we assume

£ A_ + ?

V~x + α^Q ’ where A is independent of x, and P and Q are functions of χ, the latter being supposed known. By reducing to a common denominator, and remembering that V = (x + a) Q, we have the identical equation

U = AQ + P (x + a), in which, by hypothesis, neither U nor Q are divisible by ae + a. Let us make x + a = 0, that is, x z= — a, and upon that hypothesis let “and q denote the values of U and Q respectively; then the equation becomes a = Aç, and hence A ≡ This determines the numerator of the partial fraction -, and in the same way may the numerators of all the partial fractions be found.

As an example, let the fraction to be resolved be U mx + n A B

V“(x + a) (x~b)~ χ + a + " x — b’ t he n ,¾∙=A++ 5 (, + α ), ∙" d ~+ = B + -I“ - ⅛

χ + a X + α v '

Making x — — a, the first of these gives A — ma + n ma — n — a — ŵ a -f∙ b ’ and making x = + ŵ, the second gives B ≡ —ŗy ∙ Hence we have wlg ÷ w = 1 ∫ ma — n mb + n ) (x + a) (x — b) a + b ∖ x + a ~ i ^ x — b J ‘

118. The differential calculus maybe applied to the determination of the constants A, B, &c. Resuming the equation V = (x + a ) Q, we have, by differentiation, rfv « rf Q ∕ , X

⅛ = u (ae + a). Suppose that when x = — a, then b≡∞mes and, as before, that Q becomes q, the differential equation will now become t>' = q; and since A = -, therefore also A ≡ -.

9 l d

In the preceding example, in which V = (x + a) (x — b), we have

S =*+—»·

The supposition that x = — a makes — a — b dx

= √, and the supposition that x = -ļ- b makes ~ = a + ,z; theae values oi d = q give the values of A and B, the same as before.
[7:9:681]

119. Let us now suppose, that in the fraction the denominator V = (x + a) n Q, that is, the product of n equal factors, and Q, the product of all the remaining fac-

. . U U

tors: so that the assumption is 57= =

V Q (x + «) A + B C . + _Ŗ_ + Z,

(x + α) n (^÷α) n - 1 (x+α) n - 2 x+a Q where A, B, C, ...E are constant quantities, and P, Q functions of x. In this case, multiplying all the terms by

(x + a) , we have g=A + B(≈ + α) + C(. + α) 2 ...

+ E (« + a)*~ l + φ (* + «)"·

The supposition that x = — a gives to U and Q particular values, which, as before, we denote by u and q ; the terms which contain x + a all vanish, and we have A

= -; thus A is known.

Since — -q~ = B (x + α) + C (x + α) 2 + &c. the numerator, U — AQ, of the first side of the equation must necessarily be divisible by x + a, and may be expressed by U 1 (x + a). We have now

¾ =B + C (X + a)... + E (X + o) n-2 + ļ(X + a)"“1 .

The quantity U, not being divisible by x + a, the assumption that x= — a will give it a particular value, which we shall denote by w 1 . This assumption will give Q the same particular value as before; the terms which contain (x + a) as a factor will all vanish, and we shall have B = —. In this way may all the remaining numerators C, Ac. to E be found.

As a particular example of this process, let the fraction v- b '(T=w+^)∙ w ' m " me

(i +a .)(i- a ,y =(T∑=7) 5+ (T≡Tp + ī=ĩ + ĩ+? : hence, multiplying by (1 — x~) 3 , we have

= A + B (1 - x) + C ( 1 - x)' + (1 -xγ.

Making 1 —x=0, or x=l, we have A = ⅜, and -a=-⅛⅛< 1 -')= b < 1 -'>+ c < 1 -') , +i⅛ (l-.)>, " d -⅛⅛= b+c < 1 -≈>+ī+? < ’-*>∙- again, making x = 1, we find B = —∣, and

(!—*)*;

Lastly, making x = 1, we have C = — į, and the fraction

í 1 1 1 1 1 1 4. P (l+∙+(l-∙r) 3-4 (1- xp i (l-*)* *1—a∙∙ l+x 2 '

120. In this case we may also find the numerators A, B, C, Ac. by the differential calculus. From the equation of art. 119 we have u=q{ a ⅛⅛⅛ c + ⅝¾. .

If we now differentiate this equation (n—I) times in succession, and then make x + a = 0, both in this equation and those which we deduce from it, there will arise

U = AQ, S = a S÷ b ≡∙

⅛ u =A⅛ a + ≡Bg + s e a ,

5. 4 g + ∙S +l c∙ + < 1 H fc dx 3 dx 3 dx 2 ax

Ac.

equations which determine each of the unknown quantities A, B, C, Ac. by means of those which precede it, it being well understood that we substitute after each differentiation — a in the place of x in the differential co-efficients. In this case the most simple way of determining Q will be to divide V by (x — a) n . But it may also be found by differentiation, as in art. 118.

121. Let us now suppose that -y, the fraction to be decomposed, has a factor of the second degree, viz. r 2 + 2αx + α 2 + ∕3 1 , which cannot be resolved into two real factors of the first degree.

In this case, V = (x s + 2αx + α 2 + β , ) Q, and we as-

U _ Ax + B P

V ^ x s + 2αx + α* + ∕3≡ ^ t ^ Q’

Then, U = (Ax+B) Q + P (x s +2αx+α s +∕3 l )∙

If we substitute for x one of the imaginary roots of the equation x i + 2ax + a 1 + β 2 — 0, the term containing P will disappear, and the result will contain two kinds of terms; one real, and the other imaginary. We must now put the real quantities equal to each other, and also,the imaginary quantities; thus two equations will be obtained by which A and B may be determined.

Let the fraction be X _ Ax + B P

(x—1) (x* + x+ 1) - x s +x+l ^ t ^ Q' Then x = (Ax + B) (x— 1) + P(x li + x + 1).

Now x 2 +x + l =0 gives x = — ∣z±=∣V , — 3; therefore, by substituting in the last equation, it becomes, after collecting the to rms,

— į →= ⅛ √≡∑3 = — ∣B →= (IB — A)√ — 3.

Hence — į B = —.*į and į B— A = ļ, therefore B = ⅜ and A = — į.

122. In the last place, let us consider the case in which the fraction ý ≡

Ax+B 1 Cx + D,-P.

(x s +2αx + α 2 +β*y ^ t ^ (x l + 2ax+a s + β s )- 1 Q’

and here V = (x* + 2αx + a' + β r ) n Q∙ We have now

= (Ax÷B) + (Cx+D) (x* + 2ax+a'∕3 t )...

+ ξ-(x 2 + 2ax+a≈+β 2 )"V.

This case is compounded of the two preceding, and must be treated in the same manner. In the first place, we substitute for x, one of the roots of the equation, x 2 + 2αx + a- + β i = 0, by which all the terms contamine this quantity disappear, and the equation is reduced [7:9:682]V

. to = Αχ + B; and here V and Q are functions 01 the particular value of x, which satisfies the above-mentioned equation. As in the last case, we shall have an equation of the form r + j√ — J = r ’ + s ’ v' — 1, r and s being composed of constants and the indeterminate quantities A, B; and these last will be found from the equations

We now differentiate the preceding equation, and, after omitting the terms in the result that contain x ’ + 2ax + + β l , have -~p- = A + (2x + 2α) (Cx + D).

By substituting in this expression the imaginary value of X, which satisfies the equation x 3 +2ax + a t + β i = 0, and putting the real and imaginary terms on each side equal, two equations will be obtained which determine C and D.

3 3 2 χ 2 _L χ 3

As an example, let the fraction be -γ- i ∙

(ar λx ^r £)

We assume it Ax + B Cx + D

- (z 3 -2x +2)' + 3 *-2x + 2*

By reducing to a common denominator, we find x s — 2x*+ χ —3= Ax + B + (C∙r+D)(af- — 2x +2), one of the roots of the equation a? — 2x + 2 = 0 is ĭ = 1 + √ — 1; this being substituted for x, the equation, becomes

— 4 —√∑∑T≡ A+B+A√∑∑T.

Hence, to determine A and B, we have A + B = —4, and A = — 1; therefore B = — 3. Substituting the values of A and B, and transposing, we have x i -2x i + 2x = (Cx + D) lx t -2x+2)∙, and, taking the differentials, and dividing by dx,

3a*- 4x+2 = (Ca∙÷D) (2ar-2)÷, &c.

By again substituting 1 + √ — 1 for a:, this equation becomes

— 2+2√≡Π = -2C + 2(C + D)√∑∑T 5 hence C = 1, D = 0, and the proposed fraction is equivalent to

» + S 1 χ (x i -2x + 2) ’ ^ t ^ z 2 - 2a∙ + 2’

There is an extensive class of differentials, rational fractions, in which the denominator has the form x sm →=2x n cos α+l; also of this form, x n =fc 1. How these functions may be resolved into factors of the first and second degrees has been explained in Ąlġebra, art. 274-278. This resolution being effected, the integration may be performed as has been explained.

Integrals of Irrational Fractions.

123. When a differential involves irrational functions, if by any means these can be transformed into others entirely rational, their integration may be effected by the rules already explained.

For example, let the differential be

(1 +√⅜-V¾*)d⅛

1 ÷ 3 √x

It is evident, that making x = z β , all the extractions indicated by the radical signs may be effected; and since dx ≡ 6∑ 5 tZz, the differential is transformed to

6Λfc(l +z 3 -O

1 +a* ; f ∙ and by actually dividing the numerator by the denominator, this last may be expressed thus,

‘ — 6(«î — zfi —z s + 3 *-z*+ Ddz-

I whose integral is A* ć ŕ-.ŕ ŕ , 1 ∖ 1

~ 6 V8~T~6^ + 5~-3^ + 2 ~ tan z ) + c0n8t ∙

By replacing the value of *, viz. x e , the integral may be expressed in terms of a:.

124. We shall now consider those irrational functions which include the radical Va + bx + cr 2 only, and which appear under one or other of the two forms, Vdx PdxVa + bx + cx i , . ; → Va + bx + cx r where P denotes any rational function of x. These may, however, be included in one; for if the first be multiplied by the radical, and the same quantity written under it as a denominator, it becomes P(a + ⅛r + c¾ i )d⅛ Va + bx 4- <? , an expression of the same kind as the second.

d⅛

We begin with the simple form, ∙j fχ - ∣ - which, however, has two cases, according as the sign of c in the denominator is positive or negative.

125. I. To integrate the differential ===.

Assume Va + bx + cae* = py + - (1)

Here p and q are indeterminate constant quantities, to which such values are to be given as shall serve to transform the proposed differential into another that may be a rational fraction; we have now a + bx + cx i x=p t y i + 2pq +

To make the left-hand side of this equation a perfect square, we transpose its first term, then multiply both sides by c, and add ∙^- to each side of the result; it then becomes £ + bex + M = c (p'y> + 2pq - a + g + £). The second side will also become a square if we make 2pq-a + į = —2p γ ,

4αc — 5 2 or ⅛> t l = į- ’ which is evidently always a possible assumption; by this, the equation becomes

ψ + ŵcz + e⅛ s = c(p l i f — 2pq + ; and hence, by taking the square roots,

I + cx= ^c(py- 2) (2)

From this, by differentiation, we obtain V c dx = ⅛(py +^) = y Va + bx + if? and hence, dx 1 ⅜ f3> Va + bx + cx° V c y ' ’ [7:9:683]Dividing now both sides of equation (2Ί by √ c, and adding the results to equation (1), we get -½— + χ<∕ c + √α + te^+<s^≡ ⅛y∕ 2√c and, taking the logarithms,

1∙ [^r c + ⅛√c+ √α + 6® + c® 2 ) = l y +1. (⅛)∙∙∙(4)

Now 1. y = f-- + C; here, C being any constant whatever, we may suppose it = C'— 1. (2p), where C'denotes another indeterminate constant; therefore,

Ly + L(⅛)= f⅞ + C'∙ ∙' y

By comparing this last equation with (3) and (4), we find λ dx J VlT ∖ -bx + ex?

= -T-Ι· fōV+ ar √ c + Vα +bx + c-r 2 ) + C,

= -~ 1. (b + 2cx + 2√c√a + 6® + cxĳ + C.

These logarithmic functions differ from each other only by the constant 1 (2√c.)

126. II. To integrate the differential assume √α + bx — ex t z=p sin φ........... (1) p representing here an indeterminate constant, and φ a variable angle. Then a + bx — cx i =]r sin 2 φ = p 2 — ţr cos* φ ; and hence, proceeding as in last article, bex + c*® 2 = cp 2 cos 2 φ ÷ -y ÷ ac — p ’ c.

The left-hand side of the equation is now a complete square, and to make the right also a square, we assume that

„ 6* , . √δ* + 4αc cp 2 = -ļ- + αc, or p√c = ğ (2)

and thus obtain

ψ — bex + e 2 ® 2 = cp* cos 2 φ, and, taking the square roots,

- — ∞=√cpcos φ (3)

and hence, differentiating, and dividing by >∕c t dx = -,-p sin φ = + bx — cae 2 ; Vc r ^∕c and hence, ⅛ 1

Vα + bx — c® 2 V ’ Taking now the integral, we have λ dx 1

∕ .- , , — a + const.

J Va + bx — cx l V° r To determine φ, we have, (3) and (2), b — 2cx b — 2cx co8 ^- 2√F p =√⅛≡+te∙ Therefore, λ dx 1 b — 2cx JVa + bx-cx i ~ √⅛ c08 ^ l √6* + 4αc + C "

We have also dχ 1 . 2c® — b J Va + bx — c®* - V c 8 ' V6 i + 4αc ’ for the angle whose cosine is any number υ differs from the angle whose sine is — v by a right angle, which is a constant, and therefore the differentials of these angles will be the same expression.

127. We shall now integrate the formula x n dx VT+ bx + c® 2 ’

n being any whole number. We put

X = Va + bx+cii i , y = x m Va + bx+^cx t = x m X, then y* = ax 2m + 6® 2m+1 +c® 2m+2 , and differentiating, we have 2ydy = (2≡i 2m - 1 + (2m + Dte 2m + (2m + 2)cx 2m + , )d⅛; and hence, dividing by y = ® m X, 2 ⅛= 2m ≤+⅛ + ( 2ot+1 ) s ⅛

+(⅛+sj,≤^⅛

Let us now make m-ļ- 1 = », and therefore m = n — 1, m — 1=» — 2, 2nι = 2n — 2, 2m+l = 2n — 1, 2m+ 2 = 2n; thus we obtain 2dy=(2n — 2)α — χ — + (2n —1)6* χ --

and hence, by proper arrangement of the terms, xfax_dy 2n — 1 6 x n ~ l dx n — 1 a x n ~~~dx

X - nc 2n ' c ' X n ‘ c ‘ X ’ and, by integration, and putting for y and X the functions they represent, we have /» x n dx 1 _ 1 ι fva+bx+⅛=^ Va + bx + cx* 2n — 1 6 ∕∙ x" l dx 2n ’ « dVa+bx+c^ n — 1 a p χ n 2 dx n ' c dVa+bx-⅛¾

The proposed integral is now expressed by an algebraic function, and two other integrals of the same form, but in which the exponents of ® are of lower degrees. We have found its value (art. 125, 126) when » = 0, a case to which the formula just found does not apply, because then, n entering into the denominators of the fractions, they become infinite. When n = 1, the last of the two integrals in the second side of the equation vanishes, because its coefficient = 0, and we have ∕∙ xdx 1

∕ . ~√, j== = τ √α+6® + c® 2 V Va 4-6®+c®* c bp dx 2cVVa+bx+<xr'

Knowing now the integrals in the cases of n = 0 and n = I, the preceding general formula gives it in the case of » = 2; and in the case of n = 3, it is found from the cases of n ≡ 1 and n = 2; and so on to any extent, supposing n to be a positive number.

128. When n is negative, the formula will be better under another form. Writing — n instead of + », and arranging the terms of the result anew, we have [7:9:684]dx _ — 1 √a+⅛+∙c¾ t JxV n a+bx+cx t (n— Dα x n ~ 1 2n — 3 b ρ dx

~ 2n —2 ∙ aJ χ n-l v ^, bχ+c3 j i n— 2 e p dx

~η —1 ‘ aj x *- 2 Va+bx+cx i '

In this formula, n is understood to be positive.

129. This formula of transformation will not apply to the case of n — 1, because then the fractions which have n i in the denominator become infinite. It is therefore

ċŽílľ necessary to investigate the integral of —^=j===^ sepa-

, 1 , dx — dy , rately. Let x = -; then — = — ∙, and dχ — dy *Va + bx + cx i V c+ by + ag l

This transformed differential has two cases, according as a is positive or negative; when a is positive, the integral is, by article 125,

—√α l∙ 2π J∕+ 2 Vα Vc+6y+αy 1 ) +C.

We are at liberty to give the radical √α either the sign + or the sign —; therefore, giving it the latter, the integral is

— 1. (6÷2αy-2√α √c + ⅛∕+ay 2 )+C; and hence, substituting for y its equivalent p we have dx J xVa-ļ-bx+cx 2

į_ 1 2a+bx — 2√ ’ a Va+bx+ad t 1 r ,

- √α ’ * iΓ + C ’ observing, as above stated, that the radical √α may have the sign + and also the sign —.

In the second case we have dx — dy xV — e+àe+cae* Vc+by — ay-

The second of these integrals is obtained from the first by passing 1. (2α) into the arbitrary constant C. It may yet have another form; for C ^ adx (a —√α*+cir i ) , rl

132. As an example of the way of proceeding in the integration of a differential which involves radical quantities, let it be proposed to integrate the differential d⅛ ∕ a' — ¾ 2 7√ 3 *-b i '

By an obvious transformation, we find dx ∕a i — x l a°dx X √ a* —5≈-*√{(α 2 -x i )(x*-P)}

The first of these differentials may be otherwise expressed thus,

Therefore we have dx ∣ d l — x l — xdx

√{(α '- a ^)(a *-¢*)} 1√1)

^V{(⅛⅛-⅛)} ’. and it is evident that the two differentials have precisely the same form.

To integrate the first of these, let us assume ae 2 = a ’ cos' φ + b' sin' φ ; then xdx = (5' — α s ) sin φ cos φ dφ, d l — x' = (b' — a') sin' ® (1)

The differential 3^dx (α + bx t ) 9 satisfies this condition, since m = 9, n = 3, — = 3, and it is transformed into P

The differential τ m ~ 1 dx (a + bx") 9 admits of another form, by making the index of x between the brackets negative, or by dividing the quantity a + fa" by a“; then we have ŗ L x"~ 1 d⅛(β + fa-) ’ = a^ -1 d⅛{(<≡ *+*)x"} ’-+-- 1 5

134. Since it is not possible to integrate in every case £.

the formula x m ~ i dx(a + bx κ ) 9 , we may try to change it into another more simple, as has been done in integrating a differential (art. 115). We have found that fudυ = w — srdu. If therefore we can decompose the differential into two factors, one of which being integrable, may be represented by dr, and the other by u, the integration of the proposed differential will be made to depend on that of rdu, which in some cases will be more simple than the proposed differential. This method, which is at once extensive and elegant, is called integration by parts.

For the sake of abridging, we shall write simply p instead of -, supposing p to represent a fractional number.

The formula will then become x a 1 dx (a + bx n f .

Among the different ways of resolving this differential into factors, we choose this:

One of the factors, z" -, dx (a + fa" ) r , is integrable, whatever be the value of p (art. 106); representing it therefore by ŵ, we have (a + bx Y +x . ·_ r ~ +6(p+ 1) ,an whence there results

aβx m ~*~ x de (a + bx) ’ + bs x * -1 dx(a + fa-) z , [7:9:686]putting this last in the preceding equation; and collectin∣ the terms containing the integral y x m ~ 1 dx(μ + bx") ’ we obtain, after reduction,

(A.)

fχ m - l dx( a + t>*y= g Γ"< o ÷⅛") p+1 ∙∕ b (jm + m) -⅛⅛√-∙-∙- , ' l <∙+*'*'

It is obvious that since we may reduce the integration o x m 1 dx (α + bxf ,y ) p to that of x m n 1 dx(α + bx n ) p we may reduce this last to the integration oι x m ~ 2 " -1 dx (a + bx n ) p by writing m — “in the place of m in equation (A); then, by changing m — n into m — 2n, we shalì be able to determine t /'x’' L—2 " — 1 <A(α + 5χ") p by means osTx m ~ 3n ~ i dx (a + bx n ) p , and so on.

In general, if r denote the number of reductions, we shall at last come to∕x m ~ rn ~ 1 dx (a + bx^') p , and the last formula will be

∕x m -(r -ŋ "- , dx (a + bx n ) p _ ^ m ~ n (a+ bx^) p + 1 _ b{pn + m — (τ — Dw}

b d *( a + bχn ) p ∙

It appears from this formula, that if m be a multiple of n, the integration of the proposed formula x m 1 dx (a + bx n ) p may be effected in algebraic terms, since the last integral of the transformed expression will be multiplied by m — m — 0. This result agrees with that of art. 133.

135. There is another way of reduction by which the exponent of the quantity within the parenthesis may be diminished by an unit; for this purpose it is only necessary to observe that Jx m ~ l dx(a + bx n ) p fχ m ~ λ dxla + δχ n ∕ -1 (α + bχ n ) = ajχ m ~ l dx(a + bχ n ~f ~^ 1 + bJχ m + " - 1 d⅛(α + bχ n ') p ~ 1 .

Formula (A), by changing m into m + n, and p into P — 1, gives + ⅛√∙∕- 1 -

X (β + bχ ,l ) p — amjχ m l dx(a + bχ n ) p 1 b{pn + m)

Substituting this value in the preceding equation, we have (B)

fχ m ~ 1 dx(a + bχ n ) p = * n ( g + ⅜ ∙ 7 pn + m + 7 MΙ⅛√ r ~ ' d < a + hx "f ~ 1 ∙

By this formula we may take away successively from p g as many units as it contains; and by its application, along p with formula (A), we may make the integral Jx dx(a + bχ n ) p depend on Jχ m ~ rn dx(a + bχ n f~*, m being the greatest multiple of m contained in m — 1, and s the greatest whole number contained in p.

The integral Jx i dx(a + ⅛x 3 )^, for example, may be reduced by formula (A) successively to ’ Jι^dx(a + bx s )^, Jxdx(a + ŭx 3 )^;

- and by formula (B'),Jxdx(a + 6x 3 )^ is reduced to

IT Jxdx(a + δx 5 )^, and that again to Jxdx(a + ⅛x 3 )^.

136. It is evident that if m and n were negative, the “formulae (A) and (B) would not accomplish the purpose , for which they have been investigated; they would then 1 increase the exponent of x without the parenthesis, as well as that of the parenthesis itself; but by reversing them we shall find others suited to the case in question. From formula (A) we deduce β m ~ n ~ 1 dxla + bχ n f = ~-~⅝ + ^ y + 1 > α(m — n ) _ i(m + φ ) z .,-, y , a (m — n)J v ,

In this expression, substitute m + n in place of n, and t it becomes

(C)

f ∕∙m — 1 , , l , nJ χ m (a + bχ l ') p +1 Jx dx(a + bx f = —i— -i.

δ(m+n÷np) z ∙m + n-l,, , 1 nj> : ™ — J x d < a + bx > ∙

This formula diminishes the exponent without the parenthesis, since m + n — 1 becomes — m + n — 1 when — m is put instead of + m.

To reverse the formula (B), we take fχ m - 1 dx(a + bχ n ) p ~ 1 = - ⅞+ fa "∕ pna then we write p + 1 instead of p, and thus find formula

(D)

fx m - 1 dxla + bχ n ) p = - Ŵ+ļV ÷1 na (p + 1)

This formula answers the proposed purpose, since p + 1 becomes — p + 1, when p is negative.

137. Let the formula be 4 ∕^==^, where m is a whole positive number. Making α = 1, b = — 1, n = 2, p = — į, we find fx m ~ x dx _ _ χ m ~ 2 √Γ~r m —2 fx m ~ 3 dx j √1 — a» - m — 1 + m — Id √l-χ*'

From these two series of equations we deduce, as in the former article, a series of differentials integrated by logarithms, and another by algebraic formulae.

Integration by Series.

139. The integral s X dx is easily found when the function X is expanded into a series, because then we have only to integrate a series of single terms in succession, to which the rule of art. 104 immediately applies.

Thus, let X = Az m +Bz m+ "+Cz m+2 " + Dz m+3n 4- &c. If both members of this equation be multiplied by dx, and each term be separately integrated, we have . m + 1 Ţĭ m+n+1 p n>+2n+l ∕ x λ =⅜τ+‰+⅛+τ + e 4 " ÷ ∙ If in the expansion of X any term of the form — occur the integral corresponding to that term will be E 1. x (art 20). We shall now give particular examples.

Ex. 1. To integrate by a series.

We know that the integral comprehends in it Napier ’ ι logarithm of a + x (art. 20). Now, by division,

-±- = 1-Ą + 4—⅛ + ⅞ - &c. α+x a a 2 a 3 (ŕ α σ

Therefore, multiplying by dx, and integrating, pdx _x + + +c .

Jī + ī"ã 2a» + 3a’ 4α< +

This series expresses the general integral, without am regard to its particular application. If, however, we con sider it as expressing 1. (α + x), then we have [7:9:688]'∙<<∙+≈)=L≡. + s>-⅛+^ + c,

The constant quantity C is now no longer indeterminate; it must have such a value as satisfies this equation whatever be the value of x. If we make x =z 0, then all the terms of the series vanish, and we have 1. a = C.

Thus the value of C is determined, and we have

1. (α + x) = 1. a + ĩ— 2 ¾ + ⅛-&c.

This result agrees with what we found (art. 86). dx

Ex. 2. To integrate į a1 ⅝ b J r a series. By division, l * --° =1 — x 5 + ar 4 — tr β + &c.

1 + a-

Multiplying now both sides of this equation by dx, and integrating, we have ∕ dx x s , x β χl , . . r ,

Γ+^ = χ -3 + ~5~T + &C · + c ∙

As a formula purely analytical, the constant C must be regarded as indeterminate. We know, however, that dx ∙

—-j-—- is the integral of an arc of which x is the tangent, 1 + ar the radius being unity (art. 22, Ex. 3). Therefore, if we mean to express tan -1 a: by a series, then , x i 1 x 5 x t 1 0 1 _ tan~ 1 x — x θ- + ļ; -ţ ÷ &c. + C.

The constant C has now a precise value, and it may be found by giving any corresponding known values to tan - a; and x. Now we know that when tan -4 x = 0, then X = 0. Therefore, ^considering that when all the terms in the series vanish, we have 0 =0 + C; thus it appears that C = 0.

dx

Ex. 3. In the last example, the integral of ∣ -r was expressed by a series of terms formed from the ascending powers of x. We may, however, express that integral by a descending series. By division

7⅜T=⅛∙ - ⅛ + ⅛~ fiic ∙

And /?ŦĪ=-ĩ+ ⅛-⅛ + 4c ∙ + c ∙

If we now regard the integral as the angle or arc whose tangent is x, we have tan- 1 x = + į- ⅛ + &c. + C.

The value of C cannot now be found by making x = 0, because then the arc = 0, and the substitution of x = 0 makes all the terms of the series infinite. If we suppose the arc to be a quadrant = then x is infinite, and the terms of the series are each = 0; by this assumption, į<r ≡ C. We have now tan- 1 *=I<-2÷A--l s + ac c.

Ex. 4. The differential of the arc whose sine is x is dx

It is proposed to integrate this differential by a series.

By the binomial theorem, ""į¾ = ∏ — =

ιι,9i l∙3-ι 1 1∙3.5 . i 1 ∙ 3 ∙ 5 ∙ 7 - λ 1 i 1 + i a ≈* + + + + , z , dx

Hence we have sin -1 x = =

, Lar» , 1.3.l’ , 1.3.5a? X + 2.3 + 2.4.5 + 2.4,6.7 + &

When the arc =0, then the sine =0; therefore both sides of this equation vanish together, and no constant is wanted to adjust it to equality.

140. The object of integration by series being to ob∙ tain approximate values of the integrals when they cannot be found accurately, it is important to have several series, so that we may be able to choose one convergent for a proposed value of x. Ascending series, or those which proceed by positive and increasing powers of x, do not converge sufficiently unless x be a small fraction, as happens with the series of Ex. 2; whilst those which proceed by the negative powers of x, or descending series, converge only∙so as to be of use when x is a large number.

141. In having recourse to series, it is sufficient to find one, of which the terms are separately integrable, although each may not have the form Ax n dx ; they may have any form, the integral of which can be expressed by an algebraic quantity, or a logarithm, or an arc of a circle; or, in short, any function, the numerical value of which is most readily obtained, provided always that the convergency be such as to admit of the sum of all the terms which are not taken in being rejected, because of its smallness in comparison to the sum of the terms taken in.

In the application of the calculus recourse is only to be had to series as a last resource, when the integral, from its nature, cannot be found in finite terms, or by logarithms or arcs of a circle, which in fact are the sums of infinite series. Indeed it would be very convenient to have various other tables, ready computed, of the value of a function corresponding to given successive values∙of the variable. The labour of their computation, their necessary great extent, and the infrequency of their use, have hitherto limited this valuable aid in calculation to a table of Napier’s Logarithms, in addition to the Trigonometrical Tables.

Integration of Logarithmic Functions.

142. Let it be required to integrate Pdx (1. a:)", that is, the nth power of Napier’s logarithm of x multiplied by Pα⅛, P being an algebraic function of x. Here we apply the formula sudυ = uv — svdu ; and making w = (1. x)", from which we find du = n (I. xf t ~ l ~> also dv = P⅛

we have, making in order to abridge∕P<ir = N, JPdx (l ar)" = N(1.x)" — n J'~p ( 1 ∙ x )*~ * N ·

If now we represent the integral J ~~ N by M, we shall have sį N(l. as)"~^ 1 =M(1.x) λ - 1 -(π- I)/* Ş(l. x)"” 2 Μ. By this reduction the proposed integral is made to depend on another of the same kind, in which the exponent of the logarithm is an unit less. Thus, if P = x m , we have sx-dx (1. xp = ££ļ (1. x)" - ⅛√M" - 1 [7:9:689] By applying the formula to this last integral, and again ' to the result, we find Jx m dx( ∖ . x)" =

(w, + 1 ) J f

Il is evident that this will always terminate when n is a whole number.

143. If n be a whole negative number, we must apply the formula fudy = wt> — fudu so as to increase the exponent of the logarithm. Thus in the differential Pdx Px . i 1 χ∕ι " dx we make P« = u. and (Lx) * ⅛ = <fø, by which fl. x) ““ m + 1 ð . i ∕∙ Ÿdx > n _ļ_-ļ = v; for then we have J =

The integral of this last quantity is a transcendental of a peculiar kind, which cannot be otherwise expressed than by infinite series.

Integration of Exponential Functions.

144. It appears from art. 19, that d{a x ) — l.(α)α x dx, therefore

∕ aldx = ⅛ + C ·

And because dx = ; therefore, if V be any alge-

a x l,a braie function of a*, then, putting a* = u, we have Ndx = an expression which, in respect of u, has an algebraic form.

For example, let V = — α then,

^l+a~ z∙ a x dx du *' v 1 + J> x ' l a' ʹ l + ’

The integral of this last expression may be found by rules which have been investigated.

Let z be any function of x, then, e being the number of which Nap. log = 1, we have d(ze x ) = e x dz + e x zdx, therefore

∕^<k(* + ⅛) = «’ + c '

For example, let z = x 3 — 1, then ĝ = 3x t , and fe x dx(3x s + x s -1) = e x (x 3 - 1) + C.

145. In other cases we may have recourse to the method of integration by parts (art. 134). Thus, let the differential be x"α x dx, then, by the formula/wŵ = uv—svdu, making u — x ,, , dv — a x dx t we find

By treating the differential α x a≈" λ dx in the same way, and repeating this as often as necessary, we find i ∕α x x"dx =

x f x n nx n ~ 1 , »(»— Dx"~ 2 a 11.« - (1.x)» + (I.«) 3 ∖ .2.3...n ì

146. If the exponent n be negative, by following the same method we may increase the exponent of x. Accordingly, from the formula f udυ ≡ uυ —svdu, making w = a , and dv = —, we find f gx d⅛ _ -α x ∙ , 1.« F ax dx . d x n - (n—Dx" -1 n — l∙t x n ~^ i

By repeating this transformation, we bring the integral ∕a x dx ... f a x dx to depend at last on J ~ ’ χ " ∙

If we make α x = z, then x 1. a = 1. z, and x =r-^, and 1. α

, 1 dz , a x dx 1 dz dx =l’aΥ i hence — = l’a Γ∕ and z∙α x dx _ 1 pz_ J X ~ ∖ .aj ∖ .z'

These two integrals involve the same difficulty, and have greatly exercised the ingenuity of analysts. It appears they can only be integrated by infinite series. See on this subject, Lacroix, Traité du Calcul Différentiel, vol. iii. No. 1224.

147. If n be a fraction, either of the preceding methods will apply to reduce the exponent of x to some fraction between 0 and + 1 or — 1; and then recourse must be had to the method of infinite series.

Whatever has been done in regard to the integral of x n a*dx, will apply to Pα dx, supposing P to be any function of X whatever.

Integration of Angular or Circular Functions.

148. There are several ways of integrating expressions which contain circular or trigonometrical functions of a variable.

Method I.—Let x be an arc whose sine or cosine is z; for example, let sin x = z, then dz cos X = √1 — z ι , dx ≡ - t , »— 1 dx sin m X cos" x = z m (1 — z r ) 2 dx.

1. If “be any odd number, then, in the binomial differential, the radical in the transformed expression disappears.
[7:9:690]

2. If m is an odd number, the exponent of “without the parenthesis, when increased by unity, will be a multiple of z its exponent, within the parenthesis. Thus one of the conditions of art. 132 is satisfied, and the differential may be made rational.

3. If m and n are even numbers, then the second condition of art 132 will be satisfied, and the differential may be integrated.

As an example, let the differential be dx sin 3 x. This, z 3 <fe by making z = sin x, becomes Now, by art. 137, ∕∙ ĩŕdz Jvτ≡½ = ł cos x < 2 + sir,i,ir ) + c ∙

149. Method II,—The powers of the sine or cosine may be transformed into series, of which the terms are sines or cosines of the multiples of the arc; the terms to be integrated will then have the form dx cos kx, dx sin kx. Now J'dae cos kx — 1 sin kx + C; J dx sin kx ≡ — cos kx + C.

Ex. 1. Let the differential be dx cos 5 x. By the calculus of sines (Algebra, 258), cos 5 x = 1 ⅛ (cos 5 x + 5 cos 3a: + 10 cos x) ; therefore fdx cos, i X = sin 5a: + sin 3a: + ⅜ sin x + C.

This method is often used, because the sines and cosines of the multiples of an arc are more easily found than the powers of the sine and cosine.

Ex. 2. Let the differential be dx cos 2 x sin 3 x. In the first place, we have (Algebra, art. 260), cos 2 X sin 3 a: = ⅛ (— sin 5x + sin 3x + 2 sin x). Hence, multiplying by dx, and integrating,

∕ if e ι ∞* i J∕∙n a « = ⅛ cos Sx — ⅛ cos 3x — -⅛ cos x + C.

150. Method III—It has been found (Algebra, art. 270), that e being the base of Napier’s logarithms, e x√Ξ7T « √ΞTT cos x = .

2

. x sin X — _ e ,

2 √- 1

These exponential expressions for the sine and cosine enable us to transform differentials containing circular functions into others involving exponential and logarithmic functions, and to integrate by the methods explained (art.

151. Method IV.—We may reduce the integration of such a differential as sin m x cos" x dx, to that of another in which the indices of the sine or cosine are smaller numbers, by the formula J'udυ — uv — fvdu. For, making u = sin m X and do ≡ dx sin x cos" x, we find v — cos" + 1 x

~~+ 1 > and sdx sin" X cos" x — — , 1 x cos" + 1 x + ~~ų_ ∖ ^J ^ xcoa " + 2 x ein"* - 2 X.

From this expression, by putting for cos” + 1 x, its value cos" X ( 1 — sin 2 a:), and transposing, we find

(“)

/% . „ . sin m- 1 xcos" + a ∕dx Bin™ X cos” a = ; , J m + n + ∖ A x sin" - * X cos"«.

By resolving the proposed differential into the two factors dx cos i sin mx and cos" 1 x, and proceeding in the same way, we find

(ß)

fix sin" X cos" X = — -

J m + n + ⅛∕ x sin™ “cos- 2 «.

One of these formulae serves to depress the exponent of the sine, and the other that of the cosine, and by their joint application the differential may be found when m and n are two positive integer numbers. For example, ∕<rrsin 3 X cos 2 x = —∣ sin 2 a: cos 3 a: + ∣/da: sin a: cos 2 «, sdx sin X cos 2 X = ⅜ sin 2 x cos x + ⅛fdx sin x; this last term = — ⅜ cos x + C, after collecting the terms, we have sdx sin 3 x cos 2 x — cos x (— } sin 2 x cos 2 x + -⅛∙ sin 2 x — -, ⅜∙) + C.

152. When m and n are negative, these formulae require some modification. The first, by changing m into — n > gives .

(r)

l’dx sin m x sin ”* 1 a: cos" a: (j n — n)coi n — 1 a:

m — 1 pdx sin m ~ 2 x m n * cos" x

This makes the integral sought depend on that of dx sin ⅛ dx ,. . ,, . or ——, according as m is odd or even. By cos" a: cos" a; o 1 making cos x = z, the first of these becomes — of which the integral is obvious. The integral of the other will be shown presently in art. 153.

The second of the two general formulae, by making n negative, and bringing the integral in the second side of the equation to stand alone, and lastly, changing “into n — 2, gives

(«)

∕da∙sin m x _ sin m+1 aι

cos" a: (n — 1) cos" -1 x m — n + 2 pdx sin" x n — 1 J cos" ~ 2 x^

By this the integral sought is reduced to that of rfaisin" ar, or to 8 ' n X -, according as n is even or odd. The first cos a: o is found by formula (a) (art. 151), the other is presently to be noticed.

153. If we make m or n = 0, we have

When the exponents of the sine and cosine are both negative, we multiply the numerator by cob 2 x+ sin 2 x = 1, and have [7:9:691]p dx l’ dx' ļ_ p dx J sin"⅛ cos"x - v ' sin m ~ 2 x cos" x J sin m xcos" ~ t x ’ fractions with sin x or cos x in the denominator.

If m = n, then because sin x cos x = ∣ sin '2x, by making 2x = z, the fraction takes the form of the third of the preceding formulae.

155. We shall conclude this branch of the subject by integrating four of the more elementary circular functions.

Applications of the Integral Calculus.

Before we proceed farther in the explanation of the theory of the calculus, we shall apply its principles to some of the more important problems in Geometry.

Quadrature of Curves.

156. Let AQ = x, PQ = y, be the co-ordinates of a curve, of which AB is the axis; and let the area CDQP, comprehended between CD, an ordinate given in position, and PQ any other ordinate, be denoted by s. We have found (art. 69) that ds = ydx ļ therefore, in any curve whatever, area s = s ydx

Ex. 1. Let the curve be a parabola, of which p is the parameter. By the nature of the curve, y 8 = px, and y — p^ x ∖ and ydx = p⅛ x “dx ; therefore, taking the integral by art. 104, s = J ’ ydx = f j>M + c — ∣ yx + C (1)

Let AD = α, CD = b; when s = 0, then x = a, y — b. These values being substituted in the above general expression for the area, it becomes

0 = į ab + C.

If we now subtract the sides of equation (2) from the corresponding sides of (1), the indeterminate constant C will disappear, and we shall have s=%(xy-ab').

This is a convenient way of eliminating the indeterminate constant. If A, the origin of the abscissa x, be the vertex of the parabola, and if the area s be supposed to begin at the vertex, then α=0, 5=0; and the area comprehended between the axis, an ordinate, and the curve, is įxy, that is, į of the circumscribing parallelogram.

Ex. 2. Let the curve be a circle Apa (see fig. 7, art. 66), of which Aα is a diameter. Suppose the origin of coordinates to be at 0, the centre; let Ob be the radius perpendicular to OA; put OQ = X, pQ. = y, OA the radius = a, the space OQpb = s; by the nature of the circle x ι + y 3 = α 2 , and y = √a*— x 8 ; hence s ∙=jydx = Jdx Va i — x 8 .

This integral cannot be expressed in finite algebraic terms; therefore recourse must be had to an infinite series. By the binomial theorem, Va ι — x i = (a i — x 2 )⅛ =

1.x 8 1,1 .x* 1.1.3.x 6 _

a ~2T^~TΛd f ~ 2.4.6 tŕ c,

Each term of this series being multiplied by dx, and the integral taken, we have

. x 3 1.1 x β 1.1.3 χ7 t -ax~ 8∙ 3α ~ 2.4'5a 3 2.4.6 ’ 5a 5 ' + ‘

To determine C, we consider that when x = 0, then s=0, these values make both sides of the equation = 0; therefore C = 0; when x = a, then s = ļ of the area of the circle; therefore the area of a circle whose radius = α is 4β *(ι~ ï ∙ l-⅛⅛ ∙ I—⅛⅛I ∙ I - &c ·)' This series converges slowly, so that a considerable number of terms would be required to give its value near the truth. If we make x = cos arc 60°, then, drawing the radius Op, the area OQpb will manifestly be made up of the sector P0δ, which is -⅛ of the area of the circle, and the triangle OQp, which is ⅛ OQ .pQ= ^θα 9 .

Putting for X in the series, it will now converge rtiuch faster, and the sum of seven of its terms will be ∙4783057α 2 , from which subtracting —ļ a t ≡ ∙2165063α 2 , there remains ∙2617994α 2 for 1 ⅛ of the area, and 3∙1415928α i for the whole area of the circle. We have found this number by a less laborious calculation, in Algebra, 273. We may make A, one end of the diameter (fig. 7, art. 66), the origin of the co-ordinates, so that A Q = x, py = y, segment ApQ = s ∙ then, because y = √2αz — x t , the area ' s= JdxV2ax — x 8 = Jdx √2αr(l — —.

The integral of this expression will be had by converting[7:9:692] —jĩð into a series, then multiplying the terms separately by d⅛√2σx, and integrating.

Ex. 3. To find the area of the elliptic segment APQ (fig. 7, art. 66). Let OA, the semitransverse, = α, OB, the semicojugate, =b, AQ,=x, PQ=y, the area APQ=s. By the nature of the ellipse, 3t=~ ^2ax — x 3 ; therefore the elliptic segment s = Jydx ≡ "l l Jd χ ^^∙ ax — x ∙

Let APa be a semicircle on the same axis, and let s' denote the segment cut off by the ordinate, pPQ, which is common to both curves. We found in last example that s' = jdx V2ax — x l ; therefore s = s'. Thus it appears that the area of APQ, any segment of an ellipse, has to the area of ApQ. the corresponding segment of the circumscribing circle, the constant ratio of the lesser axis to the greater. Neither of the integrals require a constant, because both vanish when x = 0.

Ex. 4. To find the area of the hyperbolic sector PCA, C being the centre of the hyperbola, and CA the semitransverse axis.

Draw the ordinate PQ; let the semitransverse axis C A = a, the semicojugate axis = b, CQ = x, PQ = y, the sector PAC = s.

Because « = triangle CPQ — space APQ = įxy — sydx; therefore ds — į xdy + ⅛ydx- ydx = ļ (xdy—ydx).

Now, by the nature of the curve, y = √x 3 — α 2 , therefore dy∙=^- — ∙ , and y α √x s - a* 2d l√x*-a* i 9 Vx*-a*

Now, by art. 130, s- — - ∣ s=∏ sz 1. (x + √x 2 — a i ) + C.

<∕√x 2 — a t

Therefore s 1. (x + Vx τ —a 3 ) + C.

Here C denotes an indefinite constant: To determine its value, we consider that when x=a, then s = 0; therefore in this particular case,

0 = ⅛l.α + C.

Hence, by subtracting equals from equals, and observing that the difference of two logarithms is the logarithm of their quotient, we eliminate C, and have ab i x +Vx t -a 1 t ~ 2 ~ a

Because √x 3 — α s = therefore also

∙=⅜ l -{M}-

Ex. 5. To find the area of¾, the hyperbolic space APQ ’ we have »= triangle CPQ — sector CAP, or ∙=⅛-⅞ l - {≡+f}∙

Ex. 6. Let the curve be an equilateral hyperbola, of which AX, AY are the asymptotes: To find s, the area included by the hyperbolic arc CF, the straight lines CE, FQ, which are parallel to one asymptote, and EQ, the segment of the other asymptote between them; suppose CE one of the parallels to be given in position. Put AE = a, EC = b, AQ = x, EQ= y. By the nature of the curve, xy = ab; hence y = —, and s = ydx — ab — — ab 1. x+C.

Now, when « = α, then s = 0; in this case 0 = ab 1. a+ C, or C = — ab 1. a ; hence, substituting for C its value, and putting 1. for 1. x — 1. α, we have s = ab}.-. a

From this formula we find 1∙ ~ = ~1∙ Thus it appears that Napier’s logarithm of any number î may be expressed by a hyperbolic area; hence it has happened that the logarithms of his system have been called hyperbolic.

If M be the modulus of any system, the log of ĩ in that system will be ML···; therefore, in any system of which the modulus is M, we have 1 X M λ °^a = Tb s '

Thus we see that logarithms of any system may be expressed geometrically by hyperbolic areas, and therefore that the name hyperbolic logarithms cannot with propriety be given to one kind of logarithms rather than to another.

Ex. 7. Let the curve be the cycloid (fig. 9, art. 66), of which AC is the axis, and AH a perpendicular to the axis at the vertex A. From any point in the curve draw PG perpendicular to AH: it is proposed to find s, the area of the external space contained by the straight lines AG, GP, and the cycloidal arc AP.

Let 0 be the centre of the generating circle; draw PDQ perpendicular to AC, meeting the circle in D, and join OD. Put x = AG, y = PG, a = AO, v = angle A0D; then (art. 66) PQ = a (t>4-βin v), AQ = a (I— cos v), therefore,

X = a(υ 4- sin v), y = a( 1 — cos ι∙), dx ≡ add 1 + cos t>), ds = α 8 ( 1 — cos υ)l 1 + cos v)dυ = a 2 dv sin 8 v, and integrating by Ì53, s = a i J'dv sin t v = L-(t> — sin v cos t>)∙f-C.

When V — 0, then s ought to vanish; this requires that C = 0. Putting now the arc AD for av, and DQ ∙ OQ for α 3 sin V cos v, we have

« = ⅜ AO ∙ arc AD — į DQ ∙ OQ = circ. seg. ADQ.
[7:9:693]

Ex. 8. To find the area contained by AF, a line drawn from the focus of a parabola to the vertex, FP a line drawn to any point of the curve, and the intercepted arc AP.

Let a denote the parameter = 4AF, u = the angle AFP, r = FP, s = the parabolic sector APF. Draw PQ perpendicular to the axis AF. By the nature of the curve, PF = AQ+AF. Now, supposing PFA to be an obtuse angle, FQ = — r cos v, AQ = į a — τ cos v, AF = ⅜ «, therefore, r =ļ a — r cos v, and r( 1 + cos t>) = ⅜ a ; hence, since 1 + cos v = 2 cos 5 ⅜ v, r — —— τ -. j 4 cos 5 ⅜ V

Now, by formula 3, article 69, ds = ∣ r t dυ, therefore ds ~ 16 cos 4 ⅜ ν'

To integrate this differential, we consider that ìįdv „ , Ŵ J∕ IX

— s ⅛-r - = sec 2 ' V — = d (tan ļ v) ; cos 2 ⅜ V 2 2 v 2 , and that — 5 - r - = sec 2 ⅜ υ = l + tan 2 ⅜ v; cos 2 į v 2 2 therefore, multiplying these equations, we get cos^ř ż = c ^ tan i e )+ tan ' İ υ i ^(tan ì v ) î and hence, integrating by the rule art. 104, we find

/cŴř = tan ^+÷ tan2 ^+ C ·

Observing now that when v = 0, then s = 0; therefore C = 0, and we have

α 2

« = ļğ (tan ⅜t>+⅜ tan 3 ⅛v).

This integral might have been found by the formula of art. 153; not so easily, however. The formula here found is wanted in the astronomy of comets.

157. Since the area of any plane curve is expressed by an integral sydx, in which y the ordinate is some function of x the absciss, so, on the other hand, any integral may be represented geometrically by the area of a curve. The geometrical representation of an integral shows distinctly wherein it differs from a common analytic function, such as a-^bx n , or ax, or sinar, &c. These last have determinate values corresponding to any given value of X, and each is independent of its preceding and following values; but the magnitude of the space represented by an integral sydx is the increment that a certain area receives While the variable x passes from one state of magnitude to another. Thus the absolute magnitude of the space CDQP (fig. 11), which represents an integral sydx, and which, when the curve is a parabola, is expressed by §-ry+C, cannot be known before C is determined, or else eliminated from the expression.

Whatever be the nature of the curve, the integral sydx ≡ space CPQD is correctly indicated, so as to admit of being computed, when we say that it is generated while the variable x increases from any value = AD, to another value = AQ, the lines AD, AQ being supposed given in magnitude, and the relation between x and y known. The same thing is briefly indicated by this notation:

area CPQD = J* x ydx, in which a and x denote the lines AD and AQ.

From what has been shown it appears that an integral is an indeterminate quantity, the result of a change in the value of its variable; and that to know its absolute value we must know the values of the variable at its commencement and completion.

158. The analogy between a curvilineal area and an integral indicates a general method of finding its numerical value to any degree of nearness. Supposing y to be any function of x, let it be proposed to find the integral sydx between x = a and x = b.

Let CPD be a curve, of which the co-ordinates are X and y. In the axis AB, take AQ = a, the least value of X, and AQ" = b, its greatest value, and draw the ordinates PQ, P*'Q ’ ". The area PQQ"'P'" will be the geometrical expression of the integral between the proposed limits; and by whatever means that area can be found, the same will apply to the determination of the integral.

Divide QQ w into any number of equal parts at the points Q', Q*, &c. and draw the ordinates P ’ Q', P''Q'', &c. These will divide the whole figure into the spaces PP ’ Q'Q, P'P'Q'Q', &c. Let a series of rectangles PQ', P ’ Q', P"Q w be formed, each having the least of two adjoining ordinates for a side: these will fall within the curve, supposing it to be entirely concave or convex towards the axis. Let another series P'Q, P"Q', P"'Q" be constructed, each having the longest of two adjoining ordinates for a side: the aggregate of these will exceed the area of the curve. The length of the base of each rectangle will be known, and, from the nature of the curve, its height will also be known; hence the areas of all the rectangles may be found. The sum of the areas of the inscribed rectangles will be less than the integral, and the sum of the areas of the circumscribing rectangles will be greater. The difference between these sums is the rectangle PMSR, which, by supposing its base PM = QQ' to be sufficiently small, may be less than any assignable space. Thus an approximate value of the integral may be found, which shall differ from the truth by as small a quantity as we please.

Draw the chords PP', P'P', P β P*, thus forming a series of trapeziums, which will differ from the curvilineal area by less than the sum of either the inscribed or circumscribing parallelograms, and will be a mean between them. This will be a nearer approximation than either sum to the integral.

As an example of the application of this method, let it be proposed to approximate to the integrat that is, to the arc whose tangent is x, between the values of X = 0 and x = 1, which arc is -j∙ of a semicircle, the radius [7:9:694] being supposed = 1. In this case the equation of the curve is y = Τ1~j∙ Let us suppose the base QQ w to be divided into ten equal parts; then, making x = 0, x = ∙1, x= ∙2, &c. to x= 1, we obtain eleven equidistant ordinates or values of y as follows:
[table]

By the elements of geometry, the area of the rectilineal figure formed by the trapeziums is found by adding together all the ordinates except the first and last, and half the sum of the first and last, and multiplying the result by the common breadth of the trapeziums, which is •1. This gives ∙784981 for the area or value of the integral Ç ∙ The true value expresséd by a series is J — ⅛ ÷ ⅛ — ý ÷ &c. which converges too slowly to be of any practical use: by other methods the more correct value of the integral is ∙7854 nearly.

159. Supposing the ordinates PQ, P'Q', &c. to go on continually increasing, the inscribed rectangles will be constructed on the 1st, 2d, 3d, &c. ordinates, and the circumscribing rectangles on the 2d, 4th, 6th, &c.

Observing now that the ordinates are the values of y corresponding to AQ, AQ', &c. values of x, which differ by the common interval QQ', we have manifestly the following rule for approximating to an integral sydx between the limits otx = AQ = a and x = AQ m = b. Divide the interval QQ"' = 6 — α into “equal parts, each equal to h.

Find Y, Y', Y", .... γW the particular values of Y corresponding to x = a, x =a + ĥ, x = a + 2A .... x= a + nh = b.

Then, supposing the ordinates to go on increasing, s\ ydx > A (Y + Y' + X" ... . + γi"- 1 >), ĵ\ ydx < A (Y' + Y’ + Y*'. . .. + γW),

The difference of these is h(X^ — Y), which, by taking X sufficiently small, may be as small as we please.· We may reason in the same way when the ordinates form a decreasing series. If they first increase and then decrease, the interval b — a may be divided into two or more portions, such that y increases or decreases continually from one end of each to the other.

Whatever be the values of y, provided they be always finite from x=a to x—b, putting for them Y, Y', Y' ’. . γW, we have f∖ ydx . = YA + Y-Ä + Y"A .... + Y"~ 1 A.

Leibnitz and his followers considered the integral sydx as the sum of the infinitely little elements YA, Y'A, &c. Hence the origin of the terms integral, to integrate, integration, &c. When A is infinitely little, and represented by dx, the differential of x, then ydx is the differential of the integral.

Rectification of Curves.

160. We have found (art. 72) that z being any arc of a curve referred to an axis by rectangular co-ordinates X, y, the differential of the arc, viz. dz, = Vcbr+dy t . We are now to apply the calculus to particular curves.

Ex. 1. Let the curve be a parabola (fig. 16) of which the parameter = 2α, the absciss AQ = x, the ordinate PQ = y. The equation of the curve, 2ax = y 2 , gives adx — ydy and dz — Vdx i + dtf =. ±dyVa t + y i .

If in formula B, art. 135, we make m ≡ 1, « = 2, p = ⅛, b — 1, and put y instead of x, and α 8 instead of a, we have sdyVa' + y' = ⅛ y + ⅜

The integral in the second side of this equation is, by the formula of art. 130, 1. (y + √α s 4- y*) + C; therefore z = ⅛ v,a * ÷ y’ ÷ İ l ∙ tø ÷ V0*^+^y ’) + C.

If we suppose z to begin at the vertex, then, when z = 0, y — 0; therefore C = — 11. α, and

Ex. 2. Let the curve be the second cubic parabola of which the equation is ļs = or*. In this case the general formula gives dz = rfy *A +⅛ and z = 1 fr ⅜∕(1 + g)’+ C.

This curve is perfectly rectifiable. Indeed it is the evolute of the parabola (art. 81, ex. 1).

Ex. 3. Let the curve be a circle (fig. 7), of which the radius OA = a. Reckoning the co-ordinates from the centre, let OQ = x, pQ = y, bP = z. The equatio n of the curve is x t -ļy ’ = a t ; hence y — Va t — x', xdx adx d y~~ fi a r -z l and dz ~ V a' — ^^ ∙ τb ' sinte g ral can ' not be otherwise expressed than by an infinite series. We have already found it (art. 139, ex. 4) on the supposition that the radius = 1; when the radius = c, we have only to put - instead of x, thence we get '

, 1 x s , L3 a* 1.3.5 xr 1 ,

* ~ X + 2 * 3α* + 2.4 5α 4 + 2.4.6 7a β + &C '

There is no constant wanted; because, from the nature of the case, z and x begin together.

From this example, also from ex. 2, art. 156, and ex. 2, art. 139, it appears that the quadrature, also the rectification of the circle, is equivalent to the determination of any one of these integrals^2⅛√l.— χ t ,J~=^==, J* which is a problem in pure analysis, and which does not seem to admit of a solution in finite terms. The solution of that celebrated geometrical problem is therefore hopeless.

Ex. 4. Let the curve be an ellipse (fig. 7), of which the semitransverse axis OA = 1, the semicojugate OB = b, the eccentricity, which is √1— b i , = e. Let 0 the centre be the origin of the co-ordinates OQ — x, PQ = y; and, reckoning the arc from the extremity of the lesser axis, let BP = z. By the nature of the curve, y = b — bxdx

V 1 — x t , therefore dy = ∙ j-''⅛ , an ^

√l-→* Vl-x t [7:9:695] The integral of this differential is of such a nature as not to admit of being expressed either by arcs of a circle or logarithms. Therefore it can only be expressed by infinite series.

By the binominal theorem √1 — e⅛ 2 =

The terms of this series must now be multiplied each d⅛

by ~, and the integrals found, and their sum will express the length of the arc z.

The integrals, leaving out the numeral co-efficients, will all have the form fjγ~~1χi therefore they will be found.by the second formula of article 137. Thus, putting φ for the arc whose sine is x, we have / . dx ιt t dx y ' 3^dx ∕ 1.3 ∖ .- 1 1.3

√r≡>=-(^+2T4 a, l’ 1 - ar + 2ľīP’

These integrals being multiplied by their respective coefficients, we have the elliptic arc z =

Here no constant is wanted, because the functions on both sides of = vanish when x = 0, as they should.

If we make x = 1, then all the terms multiplied by √1— χ ’ vanish; and as in this case φ = a quadrant = į <r, we get the elliptic quadrant AB =

This expression converges pretty fast when e is small, but when e is nearly = 1, it is hardly of any use. To have a complete solution, we ought to have another series suited to the case of e = 1 nearly. Our limits, however, do not admit of our entering on its investigation here. The integration of the differential ^^L~. e = =, which,

putting φ for the arc whose sine ≡ x, may be also expressed thus, rfp√l —e 2 sin* φ, has greatly engaged the attention of mathematicians. On this subject consult the works quoted in the conclusion of our History of Fluxions, page 640.

The length of a hyperbolic arc may be found exactly in the same way as that of the ellipse from its equation y = bVx i — 1.

161. We shall here explain the remarkable property of the ellipse, first discovered by Fagnano, as has been mentioned, page 640, and which has proved the fertile germ of some of the finest discoveries in the modern analysis.

In the ellipse ABa, let DE be a tangent at any point D in the curve, draw CE from the centre perpendicular to the tangent, and parallel to it draw the semidiameter CH, which will be the conjugate to that drawn from C through D; and draw HK perpendicular to the axis. Let CA = 1, CB = b, √1 — 5 2 , the eccentricity, = e. Make the perpendicular CE = p, the tangent DE ≡ t, the angle ACE = CHK t= 0, and the arc AD = x ’. By the nature of the ellipse, C A 2 ∙HK 2 = CB 2 (CA 2 — CK 2 ), that is, because HK = CH cos φ, and CK = CH sin φ, CH 2 cos 2 φ ≡ ⅛ i (l — CH 2 sin 2 φ~), and hence δ 2 = CH 2 (cos 2 φ + 5 2 sin 2 φ) = CH 2 (1 -β 2 sin 2 p), and CH = -====.

Now, by the nature of the ellipse, CH = =

therefore p = √1 —e 2 sin 2 φ. Now it has been shown (art. 75) that in every curve d(z + t’) = pdφ, and therefore z + t =f pdφ ; hence, in the ellipse, z , + t —s p√l —e 2 sin 2 p.

In the semi-axis C A take CQ = CA ∙ sin EC A = sin p, draw the ordinate QP, and put z— elliptic arc BP. By what was shown in last article, dz = dφ V 1 — e° sin 2 <ţ, and z—sdφ √1—e 2 sin 2 p; thence it appears that the function’s z! + t and z have the same differential, therefore they can only differ by a constant, that is, t’ + t = z + C. Now when x = 0, then φ = 0, and z' = 0, also t = 0; therefore the variables z, z , , and t begin together, and the constant C = 0; thus we have x' + < = s and z -*-s ’ = t. Hence we have this very remarkable property of an ellipse. At any point D in the curve draw a tangent DE, and from the centre C draw CE perpendicular to the tangent. In CA take CQ = CA ∙ sin EC A; draw the ordinate PQ. The difference of the elliptic area BP, AD (that is, BP — AD), is equal to the tangent DE. This is in substance Fagnands theorem. Hence it follows that any arc of an ellipse being given, another may be found by a geometrical construction, such, that their difference shall be an assignable straight line.

We have found (art. 75) that in all curves t =~^∙ I“

There are corresponding properties of the hyperbola, but our limits forbid our entering on them.

Cubature of Solids.

162. Let AB be the axis of any plane curve APP', and PQ, P'Q' ordinates perpendicular to the axis; draw PH perpendicular to the ordinate P ’ Q', and PK perpendicular to PQ. Conceive now the plane figure AP ’ Q' to revolve about the axis AB; the curve AP will generate a solid AP'Ey, called a solid of revolution ; and the rectangles [7:9:696]PQQ'H, P'Q'QK will generate cylinders whose bases are circles PE», P'E⅛∕, and common altitude QQ'.

Put AQ = x, AQt = 3f, PQ = y, P'Q' = g ; the solid generated by the space APQ = », thΛ generated by AP ’ Q' = s'. Let V = 3∙1416 = the area of a circle whose radius is 1. The content of the cylinder whose base is PEp will be w(a j — x)Ip, and that of the cylinder whose base is P'E'p ’ will be w(x ’ — x)f i ∙

The solid generated by the curvilineal space PQQ'. ' being greater than the cylinder whose base is PE∕>, but less than the cylinder whose base is PE', p ’, we have t’ — s>rCtf — x)lf, and s'—s< xlx ’ - x)y t -, therefore į > *y 2 , and χ _ χ <Z *f t ∙

Conceive now the circle PE l p , to approach continually to the circle PĘp; they will ultimately coincide and be equal; therefore wy 2 is the limit of ——-, and conse-

, t⅛ . , quently = *y i , and e⅛ = *y°dx, and s = xsţfdx.

By this formula the content of a solid of revolution generated by any given plane curve may be found.

163. Ex. 1. Let the solid be a paraboloid generated by the revolution of a parabola AP about its axis AQ. By the nature of the curve, y* = ax ; therefore, in this case, s — ιrfaxdx — įrax* + C = įrxy 1 + C.

If the integral begin when x ≡ 0, then also » = 0 and C = 0; now *xf l is the content of a cylinder having the same base as the paraboloid, therefore, a paraboloid is half a cylinder of the same base and altitude.

From this geometrical theorem we may find the content of the solid between two sections of a paraboloid by planes perpendicular to its axis, which is called a frustum of a paraboloid. Let A be the area of the base of the frustum, a the area of its top, ĥ its height, x the segment of the axis between the vertex of the paraboloid and top of the frustum. The content of the whole paraboloid = ∣(x+A)A, and the content of the part cut off = ⅜xα, therefore the content of the frustum = 1(xA+AA— xa).

Now by the nature of the solid = p hence xA— xa —Im, therefore the content of the frustum is ∣(A+α)A∙ Hence it appears that a frustum of a paraboloid is equal to a cylinder of the same altitude, and whose base is a mean between the top and bottom of the frustum.

Ex. 2. Let the solid be a cone whose vertex is A, and base PEp , , a plane figure of any kind.

Let AB be the altitude of the cone, and PĘp a section parallel to the base, meeting AB in Q. Let b = the area of the base P'E'p , , v = area of section PEp, c = AB, X = AQ, s = content of solid A-PEp. In this case, ds = vdx, an expression the same as for a solid of revolution, and found in the same way. Now, sections of similar cones are proportional to the squares of their like dimensions; therefore c t : x t = b : v, hence v = and ds = ^χ∙dx, and by integration s = + C =ψ + C.

If X and s begin together, then C = 0 and s = į vx. Thus it appears that a cone of any kind is ⅜ of its circumscribing cylinder.

To find the content of a frustum of a cone, or space between the base and a plane parallel to its base; put A = area of base, a = area of top, ħ = height of frustum, x = height of cone cut off above the frustum. The content of the whole cone = ⅜ (A + x) A, and the content of the part cut off = ⅜ xa, therefore the content of the frustum = ⅜ (AA + xA — xa) — ⅜ h A + ⅛r ,. ∖ a (x + A) ’ √ A r + h

(A — a). Now — = A —and — = , ' ' a t’ √α X hence x = fl > an d « ( A — β) = √α (√A

+ √a) A = (√Aa + a) A. On the whole, the content of the frustum =⅜ (A + a + √Aa) A.

Ex. 3. To find the content of a spheroid generated by the revolution of an ellipse about either of its axes.

Let PQp be a section of the solid perpendicular to the fixed axis AB. Put AB = a, the revolving axis DE = b, also AQ = X, PQ = y. From the nature of the ellipse, y i = (ax — x s ), hence s = ^-J*(ax — x 1 )dx = ~ (⅜a∕-⅜x>) + C.

If we suppose s = 0 when x = 0, then C = 0. If we make x — a, then s, the whole spheroid, =~ğ“ =? a × area of middle section. Hence it appears that the whole solid is f of its circumscribing cylinder. This proposition was discovered by Archimedes.

If the axes a, b, be supposed equal, the solid is a sphere; hence it appears that the content of a sphere = -a 1 , a being the diameter.

Ex. 4>. Let the solid be a parabole spindle which is generated by the revolution of APB, an arc of a parabola, about ACB, an ordinate to its axis. From P any point in [7:9:697]the revolving curve, draw PQ perpendicular to the ordinate AB, and PR perpendicular to the axes of the parabola. Make DC = p, AC = q, CQ = PR = x, PQ = CR = y, the solid (between the sections DEF, PGp) = s. By the nature of the curve, PR 2 : AC 2 = DR: DC; that is, x t ∙. if = p — y p; hence p χ- = pf — f 'y, and y 2 = l^ļ l<f — 2fx i ÷ x*), and * = llA į ∖ <fdx — 2q t x i dx + 3Γdx)

If the integral begin when x = 0, then C = 0. If we make x = q, we get -l⅛p t ∙q* for half the content of the solid generated by the curve ADB.

Surfaces of Solids.

164. Let AB be the axis of any plane curve APP', and PQ, P'Q' ordinates to the axis; draw PE, P'E tangents to the curve at Pand P', meeting in E; draw EF perpendi cular to AB, and draw the chord PP. Suppose now the curve to revolve about its axis AB; the arc APP will generate a curve surface, to be found; the portion PP'of the arc will generate an increment of that surface, which, by an axiom in geometry, will be less than the sum of the conical surfaces generated by the tangents PE, P'E, but greater than the conical surface generated by the chord PP. Put AQ = x, A.Q'=3t, PQ = y, PQ' =y l , EF = f, arc AP = z, arc AP' = z ’, surface generated by arc ÁP = V, surface generated by arc AP' = v r .

By the elements of geometry, the surfaces generated by the tangents PE PE will be w(PQ + EF) PE = r(y + y") PE, w(P'Q' + EF) PE = ^(y r +f) PE, and the surface generated by the chord PP will be w(PQ + PQ')PP'= w(y + y ’)PP'∙

Therefore d - v < w{ (y + y*) PE + (√ + y") PE}, √- 1 , > r (y + y ʹ) chord PP', an . d-V . ιr (y + y^) PE + (y ’ + y') PE and T~ z < *~ aWPľ

Now, the point P being supposed to approach to P, these quantities, one of which is greater than *, and the other less, become ultimately equal; for the lines y, if, if become equal, and (y + y") PE + (y + y") PE

PE ÷ P'E becomes (y ’ + y) (PE + PE), and the fractions aj , c p , p , ch ° rd r ,^√ are ultimately each = 1; therefore, arc PP

limit ∙^~” — and 5? = ine V ’ hence, dv = 2∙rydz = 2wy √<Zx s + dy 4 .

Now 2βy expresses the circumference of the section Pp; hence it appears that the differential of the surface of revolution is equal to the differential of the arc of the generating curve multiplied by a section of the surface made by a plane perpendicular to the axis.

165. Ex. 1. Let the solid be a sphere, of which the radius is a. Then, making AQ=x, PQ= y, the arc AP=z, the surface of the segment cut off by the plane Pp = v; the equation of the curve being y = √2αx- x t , we have φ=⅛±, i =√s+9=⅛=⅞ ∙ ’ . f2ax x i V2ax — x t V dυ = ς lrydz — 2andx, and the surface v = 2airx ; here no constant is wanted, because we suppose that when X = 0, then v = 0. _

Since 2ατ is the circumference of a circle whose diameter is a, it follows that the curve surface of a segment of a sphere is equal to a rectangle contained by a straight line equal to the circumference of the sphere and the height of the segment ; and hence it follows, that the whole surface of the sphere is four times the area of one of its great circles. These conclusions were found by Archimedes.

Ex. 2. To find the surface of a paraboloid. Put AQ = x, PQ = y, arc AP = z, curve surface generated by AP = t∙, the parameter = 2a. We found (article 160)

dz = — f c? -J- y t , hence, dv = 2<rydz = ydyfa t +y°, and, integrating, v J. <* 2 +y 2 = 3^(α " ÷3 ,, )^ + C∙ When v = 0, then y = 0; therefore, at the vertex we have 0 = 2 ⅞ +candc = -⅛ iι therefore, substituting for C, we have v = g {(α 2 +y 2 )* - α 3 } = I * {Va(2x + af-a t }. Rectification of Curves of Double Curvature.

166. Let CPD be a line of double curvature referred to three co-ordinate planes Y AX, ZAX, ZAY. From every point in the curve let perpendiculars PP, &c. be drawn to one of the planes, YAX; these will all be in the surface of a cylinder that meets the plane in a curve C'PD, which will be the projection of the proposed curve. Again, from P' draw P'Q, PR perpendicular to AX, AY. Let AQ = PR = X, AR = PQ = y, P'P = z, the arc CP = v, its projection C'P = √: Then dd = Vdx i +dy i , (art 72). Suppose now the cylindric surface to be extended into a plane surface; the curve CPD will then be changed into a common plane curve, and its projection C'PD' into a straight line of the same leneth as before. We may now consider [7:9:698] d and z as co-ordinates of the curve v, and then dι = √ dd t -I- d⅛ 2 ; therefore, by substituting for dd’- its value <Zλ 2 + dy 2 , we find dv = √ dx i + dy 2 4- dz°.

This is a general formula for the rectification of any line of double curvature. The nature of the line will be expressed by two equations f lx, y) = 0, F lx, z) = 0. From these we find dy = Vdx, dz = Qŵ·, expressions in which P and Q are functions of x only. Thus we have dυ ~dxV ∖ + P i + Q i = d⅛R, R being a function of the single variable x. The integral v =J'Rdx may now be found by the ordinary rules.

Integration of Differential Equations of two Variables.

167. Every differential equation of the first order which contains only the single powers of dx and dy, has the form Μώ + Nrfy = 0, and it expresses the relation which subsists between the variable x, the function y, and its differential co-efficient ĝ. The object of inquiry is to discover, if possible, the primitive equation f lx, y) = 0, which by differentiation may produce the proposed differential equation.

168. The method which first presented itself to analysts was to endeavour to separate the variables, so as to give it the form Xd⅛ 4- Υdy = 0, X being a function of x alone, and Y a function of y. When this can be done, the differentials Xdx, Υdy are separately integrable, and we have ļ* Xdx 4- Υdy = C an arbitrary constant.

Let the equation be mydx -f- nxdy = 0; by dividing its ∙∙. , n <dx ndy . terms by xy, it is changed to — Į- -f- = 0. lhe va-

∕ mdx ∕∙ ndu ~E J y — m 1. X -ļ- n 1. y — C, or 1. (a") 4- 1. (y") = C, or 1. lx m y n ) = C. We may suppose C = 1. c, and then x m y n = c is the primitive equation.

The variables may be separated when the differential equation has the form Xdy 4- Υdx = 0, X being a function of X, and Y a function of y; for then 4- = 0.

169. The variables may always be separated in homogeneous equations, the distinguishing property of which is, that, the sum of the exponents of x and y is the same in each of its terms. For example, ax rn y r '<lx 4- bx, rn ~ x y n + λ dy is a homogeneous equation; because the sum of the exponents of X and y is m 4- n in each term. Let Mdx 4. ìidy = 0 be a homogeneous equation. Make y = xz, then M will take the form Zx ra , and N the form Z,ar", Z and Z 1 being functions of z only; and since dy — zdx 4. xdz, the equation will be, after dividing by x m , Zdx 4. Z lxdz 4. zdx) = 0, a result which may be put under the form

⅞ 4, - z √ g 0 ∙

X + Z4-zZ 1 -υ, from which we get

A+A⅜⅛ = c ∙

170. Ex. I. Let us apply this transformation to the equation xdx 4- ydy = nydx or lx — ny) dx 4- ydy — 0, which, making y = xz, and therefore dy = xdχ 4- zdx, becomes a: (1 — nz) dx 4- x i zdz 4- xz i dx = 0, or (1

nz 4- z 5 ) dx 4- zdz = 0, and∕"⅛4- i'-. — — 3 = C, J X J ∖ -nz- ∖ - z i or l∙ x + Jι nz + z 2 = T Uis * nte g ra l ®ay be sim plified by observing that zdz 1 2z<fe — ndz 1 1 ndz

1 — nz + z e - 2 1 — Mz 4- z» + 2 1 — riz 4- z' ’ for it then becomes

'∙ ∙ + 11∙ < l +-> + ifī ~+ 7 = c.

The integral which yet remains to be found will depend on logarithms, if ⅜ n > 1; on arcs of circles, if ∣ n < 1; and will be algebraical if ⅜ n = 1. In each case it may be had by the methods given for integrating rational fractions.

Ex. 2. Let it be proposed to integrate the equation xdy — ydx — dx Vx 2 4- x 2 .

By making y = xz, bringing all the terms to one side o f the eq uation, and dividing by x, we shall have dx VI 4- z i — xdz = 0, and hence

-- - 4z -0∙, x √1 + r and by the separate integration of each term,

1∙ x ~1.(« + VTΨT≡) = 1. C, or ^-^== = c. and replacing z by. its value x, there will result c ∙ + vír +?= c ∙

and hence again, by transposing y, and squaring, x s = C‘ 4- 2Cy, which is the primitive equation.

The equation la 4- mx + ny) dx + lb + px + qy) dy = 0, which is not homogeneous in its present form, may be transformed so as to become homogeneous. Assume x z= t -ļa, y = u 4- β, then dx = dt, dy = du, and the proposed equation becomes la 4- ma 4- n ∣ 3 4. mt-}- nu)dt-1- lb -fpa 4- qs -l-pt-1-qu)du=∙0. To make the constant terms disappear, we assume a 4- ma 4- nβ = 0, b 4- pa 4- qβ'= 0, equations which determine a and β, and then there remains the different equation lmt -Į- nu) dt 4- lpt 4- qu) du =. 0, which is homogeneous in respect of the new variables t and w. This transformation gives no result when mq — tip = 0, a case in which a and β become infinite; but then q = ~; ≡ n d consequently m lpx 4- qy) = p lmx 4- ny). The proposed equation being changed to adx 4^ bdy 4- lmx 4- ny) ldx 4- dy) = 0, [7:9:699]j dz — mdx we now make vnx + ny = z i so that ay = —; by substitution and proper reduction our equation now becomes

, 4. (fon + P*) dz _ α aim — bur + m (n — p) z

The integral of this equation will contain logarithms, except in the case where n = p, when it will be 2⅛wz + pz 2 _ c X *^ 2m (an — bm) ~

171. The separation of the variables is easily effected in the equation dy + Pydx = Q⅛ 1 where P and Q denote any functions whatever of x. Substituting Xz and zdX + Xrfz instead of y and dy, it becomes zdX + Xrfz + P×zdx = Qr⅛.

Here X denotes an indeterminate function of x, to which we may give such a form as shall conduce to the separation of the variables. For this purpose we make Xdz + PXz<te = 0, which requires that zdX. = Qdx. If we divide the first equation by X, it becomes dz + Pzdx = 0, from which we deduce — + Pdx = 0, and 1. z + ∕P∙r

— 0; and passing from logarithms to numbers, z-e~∙^ P<te (here e is the base of Napier’s logarithms), we neglect the arbitrary constant in the mean time, as it will be added at the end of the operation. Afterwards, deducing the value of dX from the second equation, and substituting it in the first, we shall have dX= √ pir Q,dx t X = fe fvdx ddx + C, and consequently, y = e -∙f pdr { fe^ x Qdx + C}

Ex. Let the equation be dy + ydx = ox 3 dx : then P = 1, Q = ax ∖ fPdx = x, e fidx = e x , e~T f,dx = e~ x i f e l vdx Qjdx =fae x x s dx= ae x (x s — 3∙r≈ + 6x — 6); therefore y = e~ x { ae x (x 3 — 3x t + 6x — 6) + C} = Ce~ x + a (x 3 -3x* + 6x — 6).

172. The early writers on the integral calculus classed differential equations by the number of their terms. In equations which had but two terms, and whose form is consequently βuPz h dz = <xu e z∙hdu, the variables are separated immediately, since we thence deduce βz h ~∙ldz -au e — e du. This however is not the case with equations of three terms, which are expressed by the formula γu'J c dz + 8u s z λ du — au z∙ldu.

This may be simplified by dividing the terms by γu'zf, it then becomes z t Afe +~u ff 'z l ∙ldu = - u e ’ du.

Suppose now z i ~A⅛= ⅛-T + ï* ^~' du ~ g—i-j- 1 ’ then we have a*~∙f +1 = y, w ff * +1 = x, and

To abridge, let us put

A^ (⅜-∕+i)β a - √⅞-∕+ υ*

O —∙ + ŋ7 Ò — l + 1 ) 7 _ _ *— ∕ m _ e ~ ff . n -k~f+P m -g-i+ 1’

and the equation will become dy + by n dx = ax rn dx.

When n = 1, the equation belongs to the class treated of in last article. When n = 2, the equation is dy + bļfdx = axΓdx, which was first considered by an Italian geometer, Riccati, whose name it bears. When m ≡ 0, the variables are separable, and we have dr=-⅛∙ a —Iff

Proceeding from this case, analysts have succeeded in separating the variables when m is any number of the form 9 ~~⅛ t -, i being supposed an integer number. Riccati’s equation was first considered by James Bernoulli, who gave an approximate solution of it. (Jac. Bernoulli Opera, p. 1053.) The general problem, however, remains yet unresolved.

173. When a differential equation is the immediate result of the differentiation of a known function, then that function, put equal to C a constant, will be the integral required. The differential equation xdy+ydx = 0 is of this class; it is the differential of the product xy, therefore the primitive equation is xy = C. A differential equation may, however, not be the immediate result of the differentiation of a function of x and y; it may be formed by the elimination of some constant quantity contained in the function and also in its differential (art. 54); or it may be the result after the differential of the primitive has been divided by some factor common to all its terms. Thus, if the primitive be y = ex, or y —; ex s≡ 0, the differential equation is dy — cdx =0. If however we eliminate c by the usual algebraic process, we find xdy — ydx=0, an expression which is not the immediate result of any differentiation. The same result will be obtained if the primitive x = cy be put under the form - = c; for then, by differentiating, y dx ~ xd V = o, and, rejecting the factor J- 1 ydx — xdy = 0. This expression is not an exact differential; however, it becomes so by restoring the factor -Ļ, and then it is the differential of -.

y 2 y

174. In general let w —ffx, y) be the primitive equation, the differential being du = Md⅛ + Ndy, where M denotes ⅛ that is, the differential co-efficient found on dx the supposition that x is variable and y constant, and N denotes ⅛ the co-efficient taken on the reverse hypo-rfy thesis of y being variable and x constant; now we have found that įA- =4-⅛- (art. 89); therefore, if Mdx + Ndy dxdy dydx v be the differential of u =-f(x, y), then dM_dN ...

dy ~ dx ς ,

Hence, If Mdx + Ndy is an exact differential the condition expressed by formula (1) will always be satisfied. And, conversely, if M and N are such functions of x and y that = ļp·, then Mdx+Ndy shall be an exact differential and in every case its integral may be found. This is called the Condition of Integrability.

To prove the second part of the proposition, let us suppose[7:9:700] that the integral of Mdx is taken on the supposition that in the function M, x is variable and y constant; and let the integral be P 4- Y, where Y is any function of y, which comes in the place of the indeterminate constant that enters into every integral, and P is a known function of X and y, which results from f^Adx relatively to x only, so that M = .

j dx

The complete differential of P + Y is (art. 91)

dx ⅛÷ dΥ, or M<fe + dy+dΥ. By comparing this with the differential Md⅛+ ĩsdy, it appears that if such a value be given to Y that Na⅛ = ~ dy+dY, or that y " y =(n -⅞> ∙∙∙w then the integral of Mrfz+Nrfy will be Ρ-t-Y. Now, by differentiating M= in respect of y, we have = , but by hypothesis = and = (art. 89), ay dx dydx dxdy κ 7

therefore -÷ = —— and — — —— = 0, that is, ax dxtiy dx dxdy 9 c ^N — —) = 0, the differential being taken supposing X only to be variable; therefore N — Şľ is constant in respect of x, and is a function of y only; hence the possibility of finding Y =J¶N — j~)'h∕ is proved, and we have the integral of M e ⅛+Nd⅛ expressed by P+ -p)<fy> and here P =∕M⅛ the integral being taken on the supposition that y is constant.

We may begin with finding the integral of Ndy, supposing X to be constant, proceeding in aD respects as has been explained. In general we ought to begin with the term which brings out the integral with least calculation.

Ex. 1. It is proposed to find whether the differential ydx — xdy " x ∙i _)_ yt satisfies the condition of integrability, and, if it does, to integrate it.

We put the differential under the form

<fw = „ ?—ō- dx — ; f - du, ≈* + y 2 *' + y i y, therefore M = — , N — — x ^ + y i x i + y i ' dfi _ x t -y t dN _ x a -y t d U ( χ3 + y i T dx ~ (x^+ y>)r

The condition of integrability is in this case satisfied, and therefore x l ⅛- ∣' g an exact differential.

To determine the integral, we have

α⅛ p =^=∕i¾=∕⅛=-"-i.

whence u = tan~* - + Y.

y - l

Differentiating, and considering the whole as variable,

This, compared with the proposed differential, shows that dΥ = 0, and Y=Ca constant.

Ex. 2. To find the integral of the differential du =( 2y⅛ + 3y s ) dx + (2x*y + 9 x f + 8ff) dy.

In this example, AI=2y⅛+3y>, N=2afy+9∙+ i + 8 ι 5f ’, - = 4yx + 9y = - j - i the proposed function is therefore a complete differential. Integrating in respect of x, we find

∕M<fr = y⅛* + 3 i f⅛+ Y, and w = y s ∙r s -f∙ 3y 3 x -fY.

Differentiating this expression in respect of y, ⅛= 2 ^ + 9 -∕ + ⅛> but we had = 2x 2 y + 9xy 2 -f- 8y 3 ; therefore, ~- = 8y 3 , and Y =J"8y 3 dy = 2y i + C, and consequently the integral is u = yx i + 3y 3 x + 2y* + C.

175. If in the equation Μώ + Ndy = 0, the condition e . t .... . dM rfN .

of integrability, viz. — = —, is not satisfied, we may next inquire whether some factor, a function of x and y, can be found by which the expression Mdx + N<Zy can be rendered a complete differential.

Let the equation be put under the form ⅛ + K = 0, dx

M

where K ≡ ∙^∙. This equation is the result of the elimination of a constant quantity c between a primitive equation, which maybe represented byffx,y,c) = 0 and its immediate differential. Or else c may be eliminated directly by bringing the primitive equation to the form F(∙r, y) = c, which will lead to the same result (art 53). Put u for F(x, y), also Pdx for the differential of “taken relatively to x, and Qdy for its differential relatively to y, so that du = Pdx + Qdy, and — = P 4- Q ⅛ = 0

i∕A dx ’ therefore P + = 0. Since this equation does not contain C, it ought to be identical with the equation ĝ + K = 0; therefore ⅛÷K=⅛ + ⅞≡ ľ^L÷ Q<fr, that i . ⅛ dx dx~ Q Qdx dχ

+ K = and hence Q(dy + K<Zz ’) — du.

Now the second side of the equation is a complete integral; hence it appears that there is always a factor Q, by which, if the differential equation dy + Kdx = 0 be multiplied, the result will be a complete integral.

Let both sides of the equation be multiplied by U, any function of U, and we have

UQ(rfy÷Kd⅛) ~ Udu.

Now Udu is still a complete differentia], and as the factor IJQ may have an infinite variety of forms, it follows that there are an infinite number of factors, such that if a differential equation be multiplied by any one of them, it will be a complete differential.
[7:9:701]

Since it appears that when the equation M<⅛ + Ndy = 0; does not satisfy the condition of integrability, it is because differentiation and subsequent elimination of the arbitrary 1 constant have caused a factor to disappear, which, if it ∙ were known and restored, would render the expression a complete differential, the discovery of that factor is a most important problem in the calculus. Its solution, how- ' ever, transcends the present powers of analysis, although it can be resolved in particular cases. When the functions M and N are homogeneous, the factor can be found; but that case can always be integrated as has been explained. When the variables can be separated, a multiplier can be found, but then it is not wanted. It can also be found when the equation has the formrfy + Pydx=Q,dx{ but this also can be integrated by other means.

Euler, who has entered deeply into this subject, has reversed the problem; and, in his Calculus Integralis, supposing the integrating factor given, has investigated the nature of the functions which must enter into a differential equation of a given form, in order that it may be integrable. These investigations, however, frequently lead to differential equations, which cannot be integrated by any known method; and the cases in which they are successful are of no great importance or extent.

176. Let M be any function ofz andy, and let w =∕M⅛ the integral being taken on the supposition that x is variable and y constant: it is sometimes required that the differential co-efficient be found; or, in other words, that the differential of∕Md⅛ relatively to y be found without having actually integrated the expression relatively to x. Because w =s Μώ, therefore = M, and J⅛ d 2i . but ⅛- = (art. 89), therefore ~

d<xdy ~ dy dxdy dydx dydx

Ex. Let w = sJ=≈> here M = - z ,∕ -y and J y∕y* χ i V↑l’ X d M — x* , du ∕∙ — x*dx

⅛ ~ (y 2 -≈≠ Ŵ "^ t ' (y 2 — x*)≡

The theorem investigated in this article was found by Leibnitz, and was reckoned an important discovery in the calculus. (See Bossut, Traité du Calcul Biff. &c. vol. ii. P∙ ðS·) . , .

177. The elimination of a constant contained in a primitive equation may introduce the second or higher powers of the differentials into the resulting differential equation (art. 53): in such cases we must find the values of -A by the resolution of an equation.

For example, if dy i — α 2 d⅛ 2 = 0, or = α 2 , we have ⅛ — →= a and dy + adx·= 0, also dy — adx = 0; therefore y +ax+c = 0 and y — ax+d = 0 are two primitive equations, from each of which the differential equation may be derived; also from their product (y + ax + c) (y—αx+√) = 0.

178. When the equation contains only one of the variables, X for example, we deduce from it A = X, and y — sXdx ; but if the equation be more easily resolvable with respect to x than with respect to the co-efficient ⅛l, which we will represent by », and if we have also dx X = P, a function of p, and thence dx = dP ; then, since dy = pdx, therefore dy = pdP, and y = pP — sPdp. The relation between x and y is now to be found by eliminating/» by means of the equations X = P, y = Pp -fPdp.

Let us take as an example xdx + ady = bVdx i + rfy s , or X + ap = b √1 + p t , by writing p in the place of

This last equation gives immediately x = — ap + bVl + p 2 , and consequently y = bp √1 + p i — ⅜ qp a — bsdp √1 + ∕ι 2 .

179. When the primitive equation cannot be deduced from the differential equation by any of the known artifices of analysis, then, as a last resource, recourse must be had to approximation by infinite series.

Ex. Let the differential equation be dy + ydx = mx π dx, and suppose it to be known that when x = a, then y = b : we now make ar=α + t, y = b + u, the equation by this transformation becomes du + (Z> + u)dt = m (α + t) n dt∙ We now assume that u = At* + B< β + 1 + Cŕ + 2 + &c.

and hence, putting instead of u and du their values, and bringing the terms to one side, we have

αAi ’ ~ 1 + (α + DBr β + (α + 2)Ct β + 1 + &c. ’ + 5 + Af* + B< β +1 + &c. .

— ma n -m ya”- 1 1— 2 — α" -2 < s — &c.

In this equation we must suppose α — 1 = 0, and we shall then find 1 , mna n ~ 1 — ma" + b

A = ma n - — b, B = -γ 2 , mn(n-V)a n ~ a — mna n ~ 1 + ma π —b C - 1.2.3 ’ ’

These values being substituted in the series, we have u expressed by t and known quantities; we may then put x _ a for t, and y — 5 for u, and the result will express the relation between x and y.

In the series assumed for the value of u, the exponents of ŕ form an arithmetical progression, of which the common difference is 1. In many cases, however, the common difference will be a fraction, as in this example, {dx + dy) y = dx. Here we assume y = Ax β + B?+ C√+ &c.

By proceeding as before, there is obtained

A 2 αx 2α-1 + AW +u, + ΑCax a+e ~ ' 1 +⅛c.I

+ ABδz a +b - 1 + B‰ 2 b - 1 + &c. L =0 + ACcx a + c ~ 1 + &c.

Hence 2a — 1 = 0, a + b — 1 = a, a + c— 1 = b, &c. therefore a = ⅜, b = 1, c = ∣, &c.

Again, A 2 a = 1, AB (α + b) + A = 0, Ac. Hence A = √2, B = — f. C _ ∙⅛ √2, &c.

Differential Equations of the Second and Higher Orders.

180. The difficulty of the integrations becomes so much the greater the higher the order of the differential coefficients which they involve, and we only succeed in effecting it in a very small number of very limited equations.

Let the expression /(®> y, e, d) = 0 .... (1)

represent any primitive equation composed of the variables X, y, and two constant quantities c, c ’, besides any other constants. By differentiation (as explained art. 48-54), there is formed its differential equation of the first order, which will contain ⅛ Let this differential co-efficient be dx represented by p, and let <z = ⅛ = The differential of the first order will contain x, y, p, c, d, and may be represented by ,> j ∙⅛ f' v, p, Ġ ' ,i 'l = 0 ( 2 )

By differentiating this equation we obtain another which contains also — ≡ g, and may be expressed by o . ‰p,i<⅛<0 = O (3)

Since these three equations must hold true at once, we may eliminate the constants c, d, and the result will be a single equation,

F(ar,y,^, 7 )=0 (4)

in which c, d are not found. This will be the differential equation of the second order, deducible from the primitive (1), and which is independent of the constants c, d.

We may arrive at the very same equation (4) in two other ways. We may give the primitive (1) these forms: φ{x,y c) = d, ⅛( x ,y,d) = c, from which, by differentiation, two results will be obtained, one entirely free from d, and the other from c: these again may have the forms φ ’ (x,μp) = c -V(x,y,p) = d.

By taking now the differentials of these equations, we shall obtain the very same equation from each, which will be identical with equation (4).

For example, let the primitive equation be x i — 2ax + 2by = 0, in which a and b represent the constants c, d ∙, by differentiation, we find x ~ a + b Tx= 0 > 1+0 S = 0 ∙

After eliminating a and b by the three equations, we have this differential equation, 2y-2xţ + x^ i = 0. dx dx ι

We may otherwise put the primitive equation under these forms:

≤J⅛ = 2 α , ĩĩ=z^ĩ = _ 2à ® y

Taking now the differentials, and arranging the results so that the constante may stand alone, and putting p instead of ĝ, we have -^- = 2b, = y- χ p y- χ p

By differentiating either of these, the constants disappear, and in each case the result is the same, viz.

2 *~ 2 *ζ÷ χs ζ= o ∙

181. Since two of the constants in a primitive equation may not be found in the differential equation of the second order derived from it, so, reversely, in returning from a differential equation of the second order to its absolute primitive, the latter cannot be complete unless it contain two arbitrary constants, which are not in the former; and as the same differential equation of the second order may be obtained from two distinct differential equations of the first order, it follows that every differential equation of the second order has two distinct differential equations of the first order, each having its own arbitrary constant; and these again have one and the same absolute primitive equation. The properties of differential equations of the third and higher orders are perfectly analogous to these.

182. The most simple differential equation of the second order is — X, a function οΐχ; then ⅛=Jχdx. Let P be the variable part of the integral∕Xd⅛, and c the constant, so that = P + c ; hence again dy — Pdx + cdx, and by a second integration, y — fPdx + ex + d. Since sPdx - Pχ —fxdP = xfXdx-f x Xdx, therefore,’ y = xsXdx —fxXdx + ex + d.

The primitive of the differential equation <l’y — Xdx s = 0 may be found in the same way. We first put it under the form = Xdx ; then we have by a first integration ^⅛=∕Xdx =P + c; and hence ~ — Pdx + cdx ; by a second integration, ĝ = ,∕Pd⅛ + ex + d ≡ P' + cx -ļc; here P ’ = sPdx. We have now dy — P'dx + exdx + ddx ; and lastly, y — fP’dx + icx 1 + dx + d’. The primitive thus containing three arbitrary constants: a like differential equation of the fourth order would contain four, and so on.

183. When a differential equation of the second order involves ĝ and ĝ, and constants; if we put ĝ ≡ p, then, regarding dx as constant, = ⅛; the equation will now involve p, dp, dx and constants; and it will be of the first order, in respect olp and x. We may thence find dx — Pdp, P being here put for some function of p i and since dy = pdx = Ppdp, we have ® =fPdp, y = fPpdp.

These integrals being found, and a constant added to each, by eliminating p, we find an equation expressing the relation between x and y.

Ex. To integrate the equation = a ∙ By putting pdx for dy, and dpdx for <l’y, the equation is changed to = α > from which we deduce

* = -⅛- p ⅛ = p * = -JE⅛U.

. (l.+ ^)∙ (1 +∕√

lhe integration gives a: = c + ap — d a VΓ+ff , y ~ √1 + ff

Hence (e — xf + (y — d) t ≡s-β t .

The proposed differential equation is nothing more than the general expression of the radius of curvature (art 78) made equal to a constant quantity a. We have resolved the geometrical problem, to find a curve whose radius of [7:9:703]curvature is a constant, and found it to be a circle, as was obvious.

184. We may remark, that the equation x = C+ į -~, and ⅛ = C + J→ , severally satisfy the differential equation ⅛ = P; and that, by supposing their second mem-

ax bers integrated, they will be only of the first order. This agrees with what was observed, art. 181, viz. that there are two equations of the first order which satisfy a differential equation of the second order.

185. Let us now consider differentials of the form = Y, ax

Y representing any function of y. If we make<Zy = pdx, . , , , <ty , , d°y dp pdp we thence deduce dx = -p which gives = =

Substituting this in the proposed equation, there results from ∖ tpdp = Ydy ; by integrating, we find ∕> s = 2∕Yrfy, C, and hence r= Ž - ∙π+*m∙ ≡' ∙ =s vēÿņĩ¶ì +c ·

It is proper to observe that the above integration may be effected by multiplying the proposed equation by dy, for thence we find ⅛.⅛ = Y<⅞∕; and since = d ⅛l, dxdx dx dx we have į ⅛ = J'^dy + C, or⅛ = √2 C -∣- 2 Pidy.

Ex. Let the equation be d’y Vay = dx 2 ; we shall have 1_ dytPy_ d^ dx 2 V ay ’ dx' dx Vay ’ and, by integrating, ⅜ = | Vāÿ + C; changing C into

2e

ζ∕~, we shall deduce from thence

⅛∕ 2 4 . . , . ’ 2dx dy__ dj^~ ,∕a"' y + c ' ’ V« - √c^+√y

Now, making c + *∕y = z, there will result ⅛ f2rfz = < ii - c2 ~ i )' fe ∙∙ and finally,

7⅛ = ļ ½ - 2 ¢z* + e-=⅜(√y -2 c)√c + √y. + d.

186. Wehaveseen inthedifferentialcalculus,art,93,that beyond the first order the form of the differential equations would be changed, according as x or y, or even a function of these quantities, was assumed as the independent variable ; which comes to the same thing as assuming that dx, or dy, or a given function of these variables, was constant. It is therefore necessary, in integrating equations which exceed the first degree, to know upon which of these hypotheses it has been calculated. The preceding examples all correspond to the case of y being a function of X, and consequently of dx being constant; but it will be easy to discover, among relations deduced relatively to other hypotheses, to which of them they may be referred.

It is immediately evident that, if we represent by Q any function whatever of A, every equation of the form

= Q, and in which dy is constant, may be treated in dy dx the same way as that in art. 183, by making = q, and

= ⅛. It may also be reduced immediately to the form = P, by passing by the formula of art. 93, to the hypothesis of dx being constant, which will be effected by . , c — dxd t y. rf⅛ the substitution of —- r ^ in place of - r -.

dy i h dy

If the p roposed e quation had been taken on the supposition of √d⅛ 3 +⅛^ being constant, and if it involved only dx, dy, d 3 y, or dy, dx, dx 2 , it might still be treated in the same manner as that of art. 183, after transforming it into one in which dx was constant.

187. When the equation contains ⅛L ⅛ and the va-

Ί dx i dx riable x, it may, as before, be transformed into a differential equation of the first order, by substituting pdx for dy, and dpdx for d?y ; then, if the primitive of that differential equation, and thence the value of p in terms of x, can be found, we may have the value of y from the formula y = fpdx ; or else, if we have the value of x in terms of p, then, because spdx = px — sxdp, we shall have y=zpx — f xd P∙

Ex. Let the equation be (dx 2 +d 2 yp _ (l÷p⅜ _

dxd' 2 y - dp ’ where x denotes a given function of x ; then

⅛=^⅛-,.nd∕⅞+C=-≤L.

x (l +pS)¾ ∙∕ x √l+p 2

Let V represent+ C, then p = -^===, and y =jpdx+ C' = + C'; y is now expressed by means of x only. This is the analytical solution of the geometrical problem to find the nature of a curve whose radius of curvature shall be a given function of x, the absciss.

If we suppose X=^-, then p — = - -fC, 1 2ae √ i + p 2 J a s σ√ r ’

p ~dx i ~ α 4 — (? + e*)» an y ~Jv{<r — (a 2 +c) s } 5 here c is put generally for an indeterminate constant. This is the equation of the elastic curve.

188. If the proposed differential equation is composed of ĝ, ĝ, and y, we may, as before, put p = ⅛l, from which we get = ⅛ =; the equation will now involve dp, dy, p and y only. When the primitive equation can be found, and thence the value of p in terms of y, we may find x by the formula x ≡ ; but when y is expressed by p, we may then employ the formula *=f+∕9∙

189. Differentials of the second order, which have this form,

⅛ + r⅛ + Q,,= R, [7:9:704]in which P, Q, R are any functions of x, are called linear, also equations of the first degree, because y is only of one dimension. It will easily be understood that the difficulty of finding the primitive equation will be greater than in the like equation of the first order; and, indeed, except in particular cases, there is no known method of reducing the integration to the finding of the differential of a single variable; that is, to the quadrature of a curve. If R = 0, in which case the equation is g + P⅛ + ¾,= 0, it may be reduced to a differential equation of the first degree, by a very simple transformation. Let e, as usual, denote the base of Napier’s logarithms; assume y = eh udx , then, regarding x as constant, we have dy — udxe∙l^ udx , d s y = e∙ fudl {dudx + uW) : the value of dy and d’y being substituted in the equation, and the common factors rejected, it becomes du + (u l + Pu + Q) dx — 0.

When P and Q are constants, which may be represented by A and B, the equation becomes du + (« 2 + Au + B) dx = 0; in which the variables are separated, if we give it the form dw

• 8 , —-τ∙-s + dx — 0. u i + Au + B

As it is merely necessary to satisfy this equation, we may make w = m, m being any constant; then du = 0, and m l + Atn + B = 0. This last equation gives, in general, two values of m ; if we represent them by a and b, we shall have two values of sudx ; viz. ax + c and bx + c', and hence we have two values of y, viz.

y = e ax + c , y= for+ < or, putting C for e c , and C' for e , y — Ce ax , y=Ce tx .

These, however, are only particular values of the function y, because each contains only a single arbitrary constant; but by adding them, we get y = Ce“ + C'e bx as the complete primitive equation.

To prove this, by differentiating, we get

ĝ = aCe ax +bCe bx , g = α 2 Ce“ + V* C'e bx ∙

From these and the above primitive equation, we have, after eliminating C and C',

Ö + (α + i )⅛- a ⅞∕ = 0 ∙

This will agree with the proposed equation, if we give a and b such values that a + b = P, ab = — Q.

If a and b come out impossible quantities, the exponents of a and b in the value of y will have the form a — α + β V — 1, ft = α— ∕S√— 1; we have then y = Ce" x+βx ^~ l +

_ e « (c ⅛ t √~^i + c , e -^√~ .

This result is rendered real by eliminating the imaginary quantities, by means of sines and cosines; thus we have (Algebra, art. 269), e rx√ 1_ cog β χ ^,^ — ļ sin β χ , e ⅛r√ 1_ cog β χ — —J g ∣∙ n y = «“{(c + C') cos βx +(C — C')√-ī sin βx} ; and making C+C' = c, (c—c')√— 1 — d, yτ=e* x (c cos ßxĄ-d sin βx) ; or, making c~p sin q, d ∙=,p cos q, y = pe xx sin (βx+x).

When the roots a and ft are equal, the value of y being reduced to

Ce“÷C'e“ = (C + C')e", it becomes incomplete. In this case we may proceed, as in art. 58, by supposing that a and b differ by a very small quantity. Let us suppose that ft = a + k, there thence results y=Ce ax + C'e“+ * x = e“ (C+C'A r ): developing e k ' τ according to the powers of k, we have y = e“(C + C'+ C'kx+C'^- + &c.)

or, putting C + C' = c and dk = c'

y = e ax (c +dx + c ’ A^ + &c.)

This last expression, which satisfies the proposed equation for all values of k, agrees with it likewise if A = 0,orft= a; and, in that case, it becomes y = e ax (c+dx),

190. When P and Q are variable quantities, functions of X, then if t> and t∕ are two values of y which each satisfy the equation , g + P⅛ + Q⅜=o, we may take y = cv-1-c ’ υ for the complete primitive equation. For then dy = cdy +cdv ’ , d*y= cd s v + cd s v, and the differential equation becomes c (S+ p S +Qt ) +< (S+ŝ+ qv, )= o ∙ Now, by hypothesis, g + P* + ¢, = o i g + p* + ⅛ λ ,= α Therefore the equation is identical, and so the value of y is truly determined.

As an example of the integration of a differential equation of the second degree, see the article Arch (art. 57).

191. We shall now give an example of the integration of a differential equation of the first degree and the second order.

Let the equation be

¢řy + a3r ’ ydx 1 = 0.

If we suppose y = Ax' + Bx* + , + Cx' + 2 ’ + &c and that the series of exponents is an increasing one, or that ft is positive, we may, when x is supposed very small, conceive y to reduce itself to its first term, since the others are too small to be compared with this first. On this supposition, we may confine ourselves to assuming y = Ax'; then diy — α (a — 1) Ax'~ 2 dx t , and the proposed equation will become

α(α — 1) Ax' ^^ 2 + a Ax' + “ = 0.

It is not possible to determine α so as to make the two exponents a — 2 and a -f- n equal, except in the particular case of n — — 2; but the exponent of x being greater in the second term than the first, we may neglect one of these terms in comparison with the other; and the equation may then be verified in two ways (by approximation[7:9:705]), viz. by making α = 0, and a = 1, since upon either hypothesis the term α(α — 1) Ax“ 2 (the greatest in the equation) vanishes: A, therefore, remains indeterminate, and we have two series, one beginning with A, and the other with Ax.

If we take successively y = A + B?+ ∞ 2j + &c.

y = Ax 1 + 3 + Ba: 1 + 21 + ca∙ 1 + 2 a + &c. and substitute for y these values, and for d i y its corresponding values, we shall then find, by properly arranging the terms, that ð must be = 2; and, in either case, determining the values of the co-efficients A, B, C, &C. we arrive aķ these two series, oAi" +2 AVt 2 " + 4 A (n÷ D(n÷2) + (n÷D(n-∣-2)(2n + 3)(2n + 4) d t Ax* l + 6

(« + 1) (n + 2) (2n -∣-3) (2λ + 4) (3n + 5) (3n + 6) + &c.

aAx n + 3 , a i Ax 2 n + δ A X (n+2)(n+ 3) + (n + 2)(n ÷3)(2n + 4)(2n+5)

≡Α 3 " + 7

(n + 2) (« + 3) (2n + 4) (2n + 5) (3n + 6) (3n + 7) + &c.

These developments are only particular cases, since they contain each but one arbitrary constant A; but, on account of the particular form of the proposed example (189), we shall obtain a general expression for y, by writing in the latter of them A 1 for A, and taking their sum.

Having now given as full a view of the principles of the fluxional calculus as we conceive to be compatible with the nature of our work, we shall conclud with a few more examples of its application to geometry. '

Problem 1.

To find the length of the enlarged meridian in Mercator's., or rather Wrights projection of the sphere.

In this projection, the meridians and parallels of latitude are straight lines, which intersect each other at right angles; and the projection of any small arc of a meridian (as one minute), reckoned from any parallel, is to the projection of a like arc of longitude in that parallel, as radius to the cosine of the latitude of the parallel, that is, in the same ratio as the arcs themselves in the sphere. Supposing the radius of the sphere to be unity, let v be any arc of latitude reckoned from the equator, z its projection on the chart, or the enlarged meridian. Let it and z , be any small increments of v and z ; then, by the principles of the z ’ rad 1 . , „ , projection, - = therefore, putting the ratio of the differentials for the limit of the ratio of the increments, ⅛ dv

— , and dz = . Therefore, taking the integral cos v cos V >66

(art. 155), z = 1. {tan (45°-f- ⅜t>)}. Here no correction is wanted, because when υ = 0, then z = 1. (tan 45°) = 1∙ (D≡.0, as it should be.

Henry Bond, in the year 1650, discovered, by chance, that the enlarged meridian might be expressed by the logarithmic tangents of half the complements of the latitudes, a rule easily found from the preceding solution; but the difficulty of proving this was then considered so great, that Mercator offered to wager a sum of money against any person that should undertake to prove it either true or false. James Gregory, however, proved it in his Exercitationes Geometricae, published in 1668; also Barrow, in his Geometrical Lectures: their demonstrations, however, were intricate. Afterwards Dr Wallis and Dr Halley gave demonstrations which were sufficiently simple and elegant.

Problem 2.

If any number of straight lines are drawn according to some determinate law, it is required to find the nature of a curve to which these are tangents.

For example, let AE be a straight line given by position, and K a given point without it; let any number of lines KD, KD ’, &c. be drawn to meet AE in D, D ’, &c.; and let perpendiculars DC, D ’ C ’, &c. be drawn to these lines; it is required to find the nature of the curve ACC ’, to which these perpendiculars are tangents.

Without attending to the particular case, we shall resolve the general problem, and suppose AE to be the axis of the curve, A being the origin of the co-ordinates, and CD any position of the tangent, which meets the axis in D. From the point of contact C draw the perpendicular CB; and, considering C as a point in the curve, put AB = x, BC = y; but again considering C as any point whatever in the tangent, put AB = at’, BC = ιj. Then, whatever be the conditions that determine the position of the tangent, the relation of A ’ and y ʹ, the co-ordinates of any point in it, may be expressed by the equation y = Pa∕ -ļ-Q, where P and Q are put to denote generally certain functions of constant quantities, and some quantity p, which has the same value for any given position of the tangent, but which changes its value if the tangent changes its position. For example, p may express the angle which the tangent makes with the axis, or it may represent the subtangent BD, &c.

Let us now suppose that the variable quantity p changes its value, and becomes p -ļ- h, and that C ’ D ’ is the new position of the tangent corresponding to p -j- h ; then, considering P and Q as functions of p, by Taylor’s theorem (art. 31),

„ u τ , rfP l <PP A s

P becomes P-U — A+- τ -— + &c. ⅛> π dp t 2 ’

Q becomes Q+^Ä + ^Ş + &c.

The relation of at to if in the new position of the tangent will now be expressed by the equation s ∙=P^ + a+ (^ 1 - + ")A + KΛ. + te Where KΛ 2 + &c. is put for all the remaining terms of the series.

Now, as this equation holds true of every point in the [7:9:706]tangent C' D ’, and the equation y = Px ’ + Q holds true of every point in the tangent CD, it follows that at c, the intersection of the two tangents, both equations must be true at the same time; therefore at c we have and, dividing by A, + + KΛ -f- &c. = 0.

Conceive now the two tangents to approach to coinci∙ dence; when C' comes to C, then c will also fall at C; and A, and all the terms into which it enters, vanish; also x ’ and y become x and y: and, to determine the nature ol the curve, we have these two equations:

y = P* + Q (B

0 = ^ + Ş (2)

dp dp v '

By eliminating ρ from these, the resulting equation will express the nature of the curve.

Ex. 1. Let us now recur to the particular case of AE, a straight line given by position, K a given point, and KDC a right angle: Draw KA perpendicular to AE; put AB = x, BC = y, KA = a, and let AD be the variable quantity p. The triangles KAD, DBC are manifestly similar; therefore KA: AD = DB: BC, that is, a : p = X — p∙.y, hence ay ∙=px — p t , and y = ^x — í

Compare this with equation (1), and it will appear that n p r , √ dP 1 ¢ZQ 2p

I = -, Q = — —; therefore— =- ,∙ — — —; hence a a dp a dp a the nature of the curve is expressed by the two equations y = P-X-Γ. 0 = A i -⅛, a a a a

The second of these equations gives p = ⅜∙r; and hence χ 1 a p the first becomes y = - —; therefore 4 ay — x s is ia 4α i, the equation of the curve, which is evidently a parabola, of which AK is the axis, K the focus, and A the vertex.

Ex. 2. Suppose a ray of light RD, coming from the sun, to fall upon FEG, the concave surface of a sphere, at D, and to be thence reflected in the direction DH; it is proposed to find the nature of the curve to which this, and all rays reflected in the same manner, are tangents.

Draw AD the radius of the sphere, and AE parallel to the incident ray RD; let C be the point in which the reflected ray touches the curve; let DC meet AE in H, and draw CB perpendicular to AE. Put AD = a, AB = x, BO =y, an d let p be the variable angle DAE.

By the principles of optics, AD bisects the angle RDH, which is equal to DHE, that is, to the sum of the angles DAH, ADH; therefore the angles ADH, DAH are equal, and angle DHE = 2p. Now, by trigonometry,

AH = ⅛4gg× AD = ⅛ a , sin AHD sin 2p

„„ cos CHB cos 2p BH = riñCĪĪB × CB = Sn⅛

Hence z= (AH + BH)- α + S2L⅛ v

' ' sin 2p ’ sin 2p y, (

By comparing this with the general formula (1), it appears that τ , sin 2p λ sin p ,

P = ~, Q = £- a i hence, cos 2p cos 2∕ι

rfP 2 rf⅛ _ cos p 2 sin 2p sin p dp ~ cos' 2p ’ dp ~~ cos 2p cos' 2p a "

Hence, by formula (2), 2j _ f cos p 2 sin 2p sin p ì

cos 2 2p~ (cos 2p *" cos 2 2ρ ) 'Pl

From equations (oe) and (β) we readily find X = (⅜ cos 2p cos p -∣- sin 2p sin p) a, y — (į sin 2p cos p — cos 2p sin p) a ; and hence, by observing that sin 2p = 2 sin p cos p, and that cos 2p = 2 cos' p — 1=1 — 2 sin' p (Arithmetic of Sines, Algebra), we have also X = ∣ cos p (1 + 2 sin’ p) a ; y = sin 3 pa.

From these equations it is easy to eliminate the trigonometrical quantities cos p and sin p, and the result will be the equation of the curve, which is an epicycloid. The curve in question is the catacauslic curve to a circle.

It is easy to see that the general problem, of which we have now given two examples, is very comprehensive. We may evidently find, by the formulae (1) and (2), cata∙ caustic and diacaustic curves in all cases whatever. These, and an infinite number of other geometrical problems, are contained in the following more general problem.

Problem 3.

Determine the nature of a curve which touches an infinite number of lines of a given kind, described upon a plane according to some determinate law. For example, suppose the lines to be parabolas described by a projectile thrown from an engine with a given velocity, at every possible elevation in a vertical plane.

Let HCD be any one of the lines of a given kind (a para bola, for example), and suppose it referred to an axis AB, by the rectangular co-ordinates AB = x , and BC =y ’. Let p denote some quantity belonging to the line or curve HCD, which has always the same value in the same curve, but which has different values in different curves. Thus, if the curve be a circle, p may be its radius; or if the curve be a parabola, p may be its parameter, &c. This quantity ρ may also by analogy be called the parameter of the curve HCD. Let us suppose the nature of this curve to be expressed by the equation W p ) = o (i)

that is, let some function of α<, .y ’, and p, be supposed = 0. If p now be supposed to change its value, and become p + It, then the curve HCD will change its figure, and have some other position H ’ C ’ D ’. Let AB ’ = x", and B ’ C ’ [7:9:707]= y, be any co-ordinates of this other curve, and as, by hypothesis, the two curves are expressed by equations of 1 the same form, we must have W,ι∕,p + h)=O i and this expression, by Taylor’s theorem, is equivalent to

/<«. ¢·. + κ *∙+ s ≈∙∙

the differential beipg taken upon the hypothesis that p alone is variable, and KA' + &c. being put for all terms of the series following the second, each of which is multiplied by a power of h.

Let the two curves intersect each other in c, and let Aδ = x, and cb = y, be the common co-ordinates; then, as equation (1) holds true of every point in the curve HCD, and equation (2) holds true of every point in H'C'D ’, both must hold true at once, if we substitute in them x and y, the co-ordinates belonging to their common point c ; that is, we must have /(«> y, p) = 0,

∕(z, y> p) + A+KAa + &c · = 0; and hence we must also have ^{f(*i3t,p)} + KÄ+&C . _ 0 . dp

Let C and C' be now supposed the points in which the curves HcD, H'cD' touch the curve PCC'Q, whose nature is required; then, if we suppose h to decrease continually, and at last to vanish, the points C' and c will approach to C, and at last will coincide with it, so that x and y, which are co-ordinates of c, the intersection of the two curves HcD, H'cD', will then become the co-ordinates of the curve PCQ. As all the terms which contain Ä will then vanish, we have evidently this rule.

Let the equation of the given curves be

A a, >y>p) = 0 (“)

X and y being the co-ordinates, and p a variable parameter. From this equation, by taking the differential, supposing p to be variable, and all the other quantities constant, we deduce this other equation, d ∖ fl*,y,p)} _ 0 (ß) d P

By these eliminate p, and the result will be an equation, which expresses the nature of the curve that touches all the given curves.

Ex. Let ACD, ACT>', &c. be parabolas described by a projectile thrown from a given point A, with a given velocity, in a given vertical plane. It is proposed to find the curve PCQ whic⅛ touches them all. Let EF be the axis of any one of the curves, AD an ordinate to the axis, AP = a the height due to the velocity of projection, AB = X, BC = y, the co-ordinates of C, any point in the curve. Put the parameter of the axis = p, and considering AD as a function of p, which is to be regarded as variable, put AD = q.

By the theory of projectiles, EF = a — ļp, and by the nature of the parabola, AF 2 = p × EF, and AB × BD — p × BC; hence we have these two equations, qx — Jp=py, (1) q t =lap-př, (2)

From the first of these,

∕(<r, y, p) = x i + py — qx = 0: and, taking the differentials, considering x and y as constant, and q as a function of the variable quantity j) 9 d{flx,y,p)} _ dt l x -o dp - y dp - ’ therefore 2 = ⅛; but from equation (2), taking the X dp J 2a _ ' differentials, qdq — 2adp —pdp,&nåhenze-P= and by the first equation = , therefore g ¾ =

2a p an( ļ hence q i — qx= 2ap — f ; and substituting q for its value given by equation (2), we get qx = 2qp; hence, and by equation (1), aŕ _ 2ax p ~ 2a— y * 1 ~ 2a —y

These values of p and q being substituted in the second equation, and the common denominator rejected, it becomes

4α 2 s 2 = (8α s — 4ay — a s )A s .

Hence 4 ay = 4 a 2 — x i , and this is the equation of the curve PCQ, which is evidently a parabola having its focus at A, the common intersection of all the parabolas, its axis perpendicular to the horizon, and its parameter = 4 a.

The geometrical theory comprehended in the second and third problems has a corresponding analytical theory relating to the integrals of certain differential equations. This is the theory of singular primitive equations, which are not included in the complete primitive equation. Thus, the differential equation dy f (x i -Į- if — V) — ydx — xdx = 0, has for its complete primitive equation x e — 2ay — o? — b — ũ, where a is the arbitrary constant quantity; but, besides this, it has a singular primitive equation, a· 2 + if — b = 0, which does not admit of an arbitrary constant, although it equally satisfies the differential equation, as is easily proved by differentiating. The bounds within which it was proper to confine this treatise have not allowed us to enter into this branch of the subject, which, although interesting, is yet not elementary.

Investigation of the Properties of the Catenary.

Suppose a chain or thread of uniform thickness, and perfectly flexible, but inextensible, to be fastened by its extremities at two points A, B in a vertical plane; by the action of gravity it will take the form of a curve ACPB, called the catenary.

The curve will evidently be all in one plane, and a horizontal line CD, in that plane, at C its lowest point, will manifestly touch the curve, which is retained at rest by a mutual balancing of the forces produced by the weight of the particles of the chain.

If we suppose its lowest point to be fixed at C, it is easy to understand that the part BC will not on that account change in the least its figure, because the tension of the chain at C, when it was free, is now replaced by the reaction of the force exerted in the horizontal direction CD.
[7:9:708]

The forces exerted on the points B, C will evidently be the same in quantity and in direction, whether the chain be considered as flexible, or rigid like a solid wire; hence it may be regarded as kept at rest by three forces, viz. its gravity acting vertically, and the re-actions of the tensions at B and C; the former exerted in the direction of a tangent to the curve at B, and the latter in the direction CD, the tangent at the lowest point C.

In like manner any portion PC between P and its lowest point may be considered as kept at rest by the joint action of the gravity of the mass PC, the tension of the chain at C, which is constant, and the tension at P, which is variable; and by the nature of an equilibrium (Mechanics), these forces will be to each other as the sides of any triangle which are parallel to their directions. Draw a horizontal line OX in the plane of the curve as an axis, meeting the vertical through C in 0, which may be taken as an origin of co-ordinates; draw PQ perpendicular to OX, and PT touching the curve and meeting the axis in T. From what has been explained, the tension of the curve at C will be to the weight of the matter in PC as TQ to PQ, that is, as radius to the tangent of the angle which PT makes with any horizontal line.

Put 0Q = x, PQ = y, arc CP = z, angle PTQ = φ∙ and let a be the tension of the curve at the vertex C: we have then a : z = 1: tan φ ; hence tan P=^ (ŋ

This is the distinguishing property of the curve, from which we are to deduce its other properties.

From equation (1), by differentiation, dφ _ dz cos 8 φ ~ a

Now in all curves, dz=- dx = -⅛-∙ cos φ sin φ ’ hence we obtain dx=a.-⅛-, dy = a. d A^. cos φ cos φ

From these, by integration, x = a ∖ . tan (45° + ⅛ φ) 4. const, (art. 155) y =^ + const ∙

If we assume that 0C measures the tension at C, which is a constant quantity, then because when φ = 0, x = 0, and y = a, we have the relation of the quantities x, y, φ, expressed by these equations, x = a ∖ . tan (45° 4- į φ), ì a J. (9) y = = a sec a. í v ’ cos φ r J

The constant line a is called the parameter of the curve, also its modulus. From the first of these equations, putting ∙ψ for 45° 4- I <p, we have tan ∙ψ = e β , cot ∙ψ = e a , ĩ. — λ tan ∙ψ + cot ∙ψ = e β 4- e a .

Now, tan ∙ψ + cot 4, = + ∑⅛

This exponential equation expresses the relation between X and y by means of e, the base of Napier’s logarithms. Iront this last equation, observing that y-=,a sec ®, we get f ~ ~ ì

But it was found that z — a tan φ, therefore z=∣{ e β - e a } (4)

From formulae (3) and (4) we have y + z = ae a , y-z = ae a ............ (5)

therefore y 2 — z i = α 2 (6)

hence again, *

y = V ’ α 8 4- z 3 , z = √y i — a s (7)

Let s denote the area bounded by the arc PC and the straight lines CO, OQ,PQ; then, since dx = and cosp y = —— , therefore j cos φ ds = ydx — ∙ a dt i , = adz. cos s p and s = az (10)

Thus it appears that the ąŗc CP is always proportional to the conterminous area CPQA. It is evident that the catenary, if inverted, would form an equilibrated arch. From this property it appears that if a wall, whose height above the crown of the arch is equal to the line CO, be horizontal at the top, the structure thus formed will constitute an equilibrated arch with a straight roadway. (See on this subject our article Arch.) (b.) [7:9:709]
