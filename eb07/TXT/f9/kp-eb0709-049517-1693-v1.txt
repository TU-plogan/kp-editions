FAWKES, Francis, a poet of some note, who received his school education at Leeds, wdιence he was removed to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he took the degrees in arts. Having early entered into holy orders, he settled first at Bramham in Yorkshire, near the elegant seat of that name, which he celebrated in verse in 1745, in a quarto pamphlet published anonymously. His first poetical publications w ere, Gawin Douglas’s Description of May nd Winter modernized. Having afterwards removed to the curacy of Croydon in Surrey, he recommended himself to the notice of Archbishop Herring, then residing there on account of his health, to whom, besides other pieces, he addressed an ode on his recovery in 17û4, which is printed in Mr Dodsley’s collection. In 1755 his grace collated him to the vicarage of Orpington, with St Mary Gray in Kent; and Mr Fawkes lamented his patron’s death m 1757 in an elegy styled Aurelius, first printed, with his graces's seven sermons, in 1763. In April 1774, by the favour of Dr [7:9:496] Plumtree, he exchanged his vicarage for the rectory of Hayes. He was also one of the chaplains to the princess dowager of Wales. He published a volume of poems by subscription in 8tfo, 1761; the Poetical Kalendar, 1763, and Poetical Magazine, 1764, in conjunction with Mr Woty; Partridge Shooting, an eclogue, to the honourable Charles Yorke, 1767, 4to; and a Family Bible with notes, in 4to, a compilation. But his great strength lay in translation, in which, since Pope, few have surpassed him. His fragments of Menander; his works of Anacreon, Sappho, Bion, Moschus, and Musaeus, 12mo, 1760; his Idyllia of Theocritus, by subscription, 8vo, 1767; and his Argonautics of Apollonius Rhodius, by subscription, a posthumous publication, completed by the Reverend Mr Meen of Emanuel College, Cambridge, 8vo, 1780, may be referred to in proof of this observation. He died on the 26th August 1777.
