FIRLOT, a dry measure used in Scotland. The wheat firlot contains 21j- pints of that country, or about 2214 cubic inches; and the barley firlot, 31 standard pints, or 3232 cubic inches. Hence the Scotch wheat firlot exceeds the old English bushel by 33 cubic inches, and the imperial bushel by 4 cubic inches.
