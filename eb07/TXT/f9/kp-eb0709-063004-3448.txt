FLUX, in Medicine, an extraordinary issue or evacuation of some humour. Fluxes are of different kinds and variously denominated, according to their seats or the humours thus voided; as a flux of the belly, uterine flux, hepatic flux, salival flux, and the like. See Medicine. Flux, in Hydrography, a regular periodical motion of the sea, happening twice in twenty-four hours, in which the water is raised and driven violently against the shores. The flux or flow is one of the motions of the tide; the other, by which the water sinks and retires, is called the reflux or ebb. There is also a kind of rest or cessation of about half an hour between the flux and reflux, during which time the water is at its greatest height, and thence called high Î¹cater. See Tides.
