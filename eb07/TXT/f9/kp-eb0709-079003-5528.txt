FOUL, in nautical language, is used when a ship has been long untrimmed, so that grass weeds, or barnacles, grow on her sides under water. A rope is also foul when it is either tangled in itself, or hindered by another from running or being overhauled.

Foul imports also the running of one ship against another. This happens sometimes by the violence of the wind, and sometimes by the carelessness of the people on board, to ships in the same convoy, and to ships in port by means of others coming in. The damages occasioned by running foul are of the nature of those in which both parties must bear a share. They are usually made to fall half upon the sufferer, and half upon the vessel which did the injury; but in cases where it is evidently the fault of the master of the vessel, he alone must bear the damage.
