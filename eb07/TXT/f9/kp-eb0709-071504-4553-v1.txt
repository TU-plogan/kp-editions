FOLKES, Martin, a philosopher and antiquary of considerable eminence, was born at Westminster, in the year 1690. A Mr Cappel, once professor of Hebrew at Saumur, was his private tutor. When about seventeen years of age he was sent to Clare-hall, Cambridge, where he applied himself to the study of philosophy and the mathematics; and when only twenty-three years of age he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society. His ingenious communications acquired him so much applause that he was frequently chosen into its council. He was in habits of friendship with the illustrious Newton, at that time president; and by his influence was elected one of the vice-presidents in the year 1723. Mr Folkes became a candidate for the chair on the death of Sir Isaac Newton; but the superior interest of Sir Hans Sloane rendered his application ineffectual. In 1733, and the two subsequent years, he resided for the most part in Italy, with the view of improving himself in the knowledge of classical antiquity. To ascertain the weight and value of ancient coins, he carefully consulted the cabinets of the curious; and on his return home he presented to the Antiquarian Society, of which he was a member, a dissertation on the subject. He read before the same learned body a dissertation on the measurement of Trajan’s and Antoninus’ pillars, together with other remains of antiquity. The fruits of his observations he presented to the Royal Society, particularly Remarks on the Standard Measure preserved in the Capitol of Rome, and the model of an ancient globe in the Farnese palace. He visited Paris in 1739, where he was received with great respect, and admitted into the society ot the most distinguished literary characters of that metropolis. This respect indeed he was entitled to by bis unwearied application to many branches of knowledge alike curious and useful. His valuable work upon English Silver Coins was printed in the year 1745. Amongst the many honours conferred upon Mr Folkes, was that of being created doctor of laws by both universities, and chosen president of the Antiquarian Society. He continued to furnish the Philosophical Transactions with many learned papers, till his career was cut short by a paralytic stroke, which terminated his useful life in the year 1654. He was a man of extensive knowledge and approved accuracy; but the chief benefit to science which resulted from his labours was his treatise on the intricate subject of coins, weights, and measures. His cabinet and library, which were large and valuable, were exposed to public sale after his death. His private character was distinguished for politeness, generosity, and friendship.
