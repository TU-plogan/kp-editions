FERRARA, one of the delegations of the papal dominions in Italy, which extends over 1210 sonare miles. It contains two cities, thirteen market-towns, and 254 villages, with 170,727 inhabitants. The greater portion of the district is the delta formed by the mouths of the Po, and is very unhealthy; but it is fertile, and produces good crops of wheat, rice, maize, hemp, flax, oil, and silk. The breed of cattle is very good; the dairy is extensively followed, and produces excellent cheese. There are two fortified places, which are occupied by Austrian garrisons. The capital is a city of the same name, situated on a branch of the Po, one of the finest in Italy, with broad and regular streets; but the houses and magnificent palaces are nevertheless very thinly inhabited. It contains, besides the cathedral, 100 churches, twenty-two monasteries, sixteen nunneries, and 5100 houses, but only 23,100 inhabitants. The university has been destroyed. There is little or no trade, and no manufactures. The citadel is garrisoned by Austrian troops. Long. 11. 31. 5. E. Lat. 44. 49. 56. N.
