FARM, Farin, or Ferm (Firma), in Law, signifies a little country messuage or district, containing house or land, with other conveniences, and which is hired or taken by lease, at a certain yearly rent. See Agriculture.

In the corrupted Latin, firma signified a place inclosed or shut in; and hence, in some provinces, as MÃ©nage observes, they call closerie, or closure, what in others they call a farm. We also find locare adfirmam, signifying to let to farm ; probably on account of the sure hold the tenant here has in comparison of tenants at will.

Spelman and Skinner, however, chuse to derive the word farm from the Saxon fearme, or feorme, that is, victus, provision; by reason of the country people and tenants having anciently paid their rents in victuals and other necessaries, which were afterwards converted into the payment of a sum of money. Hence a farm was originally a place which furnished its landlord with provisions. Amongst the Normans, farms which pay in kind, that is, in provisions, and those which pay in money, are still distinguished; the former being simply called fermes, and the latter blanche ferine, or white farm.

Spelman shows, that the word firma anciently signified not only what we now call a farm, but also a feast or entertainment, which the farmer gave the proprietor or landlord, during a certain number of days, and at a certain rate, for the lands held of him. Thus fearmc in the laws of King Canute has been rendered victus ; and thus also we read of reddere firmam unius noctis, and reddebat unum diem de firma, denoting provision for a night and day. About the time of the conquest rents were all paid in provisions; a custom which is said to have been first altered under King Henry I. We also speak of farming duties, imposts, and the like.
