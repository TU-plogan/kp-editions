FISC (Fiscus), in the Civil Law, the treasury of a prince or state, or that into which all things due t° Jae public fall to be paid or delivered. The word is derive from the Greek φιΰχος, a great basket, used when they « en to market. By the civil law, none but a sovereign prince has a right to have a fisc or public treasury. At y under the emperors, the term cerarium was used for . . revenues destined to support the charges of the empire, [7:9:589] the fiscus for those of the emperor’s own family. The treasury, in fact, belonged to the people, and the fiscus, to the prince. Hence the goods of condemned persons, if appropriated to the use of the public, were said publicari ; if to the support of the emperor or prince, confiscari.
