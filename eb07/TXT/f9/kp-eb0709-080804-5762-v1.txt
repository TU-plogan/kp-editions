FRAME, in Joinery, a kind of case, in which a thing is set or enclosed, or even supported; as a window frame, a picture frame, and the like.

Frame, among printers, is the stand which supports the cases.

F rame, among founders, is a kind of ledge enclosing a board, which, being filled with wetted sand, serves as a mould to cast their works in.

Frame is more particularly used for a sort of loom, on which artificers stretch their linens, silks, or stuffs, to be embroidered, quilted, or the like.

Frame, among painters, is a kind of square, consisting of four long slips of wood joined together, whilst the intermediate space is divided by threads into several little squares like a net, and hence sometimes called reticula. It serves to reduce figures from great to small, or to augment their size from small to great.
