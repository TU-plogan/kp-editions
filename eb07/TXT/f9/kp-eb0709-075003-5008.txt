FORMENTERA, one of the Balearic Islands, in the Mediterranean Sea, belonging to the crown of Spain. It lies to the south of Ivica, is twelve miles in length, in some parts eight miles, and in others, from great indentations, not more than half a mile in breadth. Its name is derived from the abundant crops of wheat which are produced on the western part of the island, whilst the eastern part is almost wholly covered with thick woods. There is no town on the island; but it is peopled by 1500 inhabitants, who live in villages or sequestered cottages. It is separated from Ivica by a strait two miles across, in the middle of which is the small island Espalmado.
