FEODOSIA, one of the circles into which the Russian province of Taurida is divided. It stretches along the eastern side of the peninsula which separates the Black Sea from the Sea of Azoph. It is a fertile tract of land, and was formerly much more thickly peopled, and much better cultivated, than it is at present. The chief place, known before the Russian possession by the name of Kaffa, but now by that of the province, is situated on a bay in the Black Sea, and has an excellent harbour, though not safe in the winter. It contains from 400 to 500 houses, and about 4500 inhabitants. It was declared a free port in 1806, since which period its inhabitants and trade have greatly increased. It is situated in latitude 45. 4. N. and longitude 35. 14. E.
