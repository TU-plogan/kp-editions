FALSI Crimen, in the civil law, is fraudulent subornation or concealment, with design to darken or hide the truth, and make things appear otherwise than they are. The crimen falsi is committed, first, by words, as when a witness swears falsely; secondly, by writing, as when a man antedates a contract, or the like; and thirdly, by deed, as when he sells by false weights and measures.
