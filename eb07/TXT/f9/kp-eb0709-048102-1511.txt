FAKENHAM, a market-town of Norfolk, in the hundred of Gallon, 109 miles from London. It is situated in an open district, but fertile, especially in wheat and barley, with a large corn market on Thursday, but little other trade, since the spinning of worsted has been performed by machinery. The river Var runs near it towards Lynn. The church is a very handsome building. The population amounted in 1801 to 1236, in 1811 to 1382, in 1821 to 1626, and in 1831 to 2077.
