FORT GEORGE, a fortress of Scotland, in the county of Inverness. It is an irregular polygon of six bastions, mounted with eighty pieces of cannon, and is situated on the southern extremity of a low peninsula which projects into the Murray Firth, about twelve miles north-east of Inverness. The whole fortress covers an area of ten Scotch acres, and the barracks possess accommodation for about 3000 troops. This fortress was begun in 1746, and completed in 1764, at an expense of L.160,000. It was constructed with the intention of keeping the Highlands in check; but for this purpose it is now no longer required, and only serves as a barrack for soldiers. It is usually occupied by a governor, lieutenant-governor, several inferior officers, and one or two companies of soldiers. The view from the ramparts is extensive and varied.
