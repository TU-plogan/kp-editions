FECHINGSE, a small and neatly-built city of China, in the province of Pe-tche-li, near Pekin. It has a good appearance, though the houses are low, from the walls and pavilions being kept in good repair. Near the town is a fine bridge crossing the river; it is built of stone, and is 216 paces in length.
