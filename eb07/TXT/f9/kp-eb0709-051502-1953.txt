FERIAE, in Roman antiquity, holidays, or days upon which the people abstained from work. Proclamation was generally made by the herald, by command of the Rex Sacrorum or Flamines, that all should abstain from business; and whoever transgressed the order was severely fined.

The Feriae were of two kinds; public and private. The public feriae were fourfold: first, Stativae, which were kept as public feasts by the whole city upon certain immoveable days appointed by their calendar, as the Compitalia, Carmentalia, and Lupercalia ; secondly, Feriae Conceptivae, which were moveable feasts, the days for the celebration of which were fixed by the magistrates or priests, as the Feriae Latinae, Paganalia, Compitalia, and others, which happened every year, though the days for observing them were left to the discretion of the magistrates or priests; thirdly, Feriae Imperatives, which were instituted by the mere command of consuls, praetors, or dictators, upon the gaining of some victory or other fortunate event; and, fourthly, Nundinoe. The private feriae were holidays observed by particular persons or families, on several accounts, as birth-days, funerals, and the like. The feriae belonged to and formed one division of the dies festi. Feriae Latinae, a festival at which a white bull was usually sacrificed. On this occasion the Latin and Roman towns provided each a quantity of meat, wine, and fruits; and during the celebration, the Romans and Latins swore eternal friendship to each other, taking home a piece of the victim to every town. The festival was instituted by Tarquinius Superbus, when, having overcome the Etruscans and made a league with the Latins, he proposed to build a common temple to Jupiter Latialis, at which both nations might meet and offer sacrifices for their common safety. At first the solemnity lasted but one day, but it was at different times extended to ten days. It was held on the Alban Mount, and celebrated with chariot races at the capitol, where the victor was treated with a large draught of wormwood drink.
