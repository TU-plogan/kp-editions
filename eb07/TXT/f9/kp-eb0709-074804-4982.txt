FORLI, one of the delegations of the papal dominion, in Italy, 1232 square miles in extent. It contains six cities, nineteen market-towns, and a great number of villages, [7:9:749]with 150,930 inhabitants. It extends from the foot of the Appennines to the sea-shore, and is watered by several streams descending from those mountains, one of which, but not accurately ascertained, is the celebrated Rubico. On the sea-shore are many morasses which generate malaria, but the remainder of the province is tolerably healthy, and highly fertile. The chief city, of the same name, is situated on the Via Aemilia, between the rivers Mentone and Ronco. It contains nine parish churches, sixteen monasteries, and seven nunneries. The population is 15,520. It has fabrics of silks, refineries for salt and for sulphur, linen weaving, and wax bleaching. Long. 12. 18. 5. E. Lat. 44. 13. 25. N.
