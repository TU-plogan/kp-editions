FACIES Hippocratica, in Medicine, is when the nostrils are sharp, the eyes hollow, the temples low, the tips of the ears contracted and cold, the forehead dry and wrinkled, and the complexion pale or livid. The Hippocratic face is chiefly observed towards the close of phthisis pulmonalis, and other consumptions, and is held as a sure prognostic of death. If it appear within three days after the attack of an acute disease, it is deemed a fatal symptom.
