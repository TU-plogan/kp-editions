FEVERSHAM, a town of the county of Kent, in the hundred of that name, within the lathe of Scray, and forty-eight miles from London. It is a very ancient town, and from several of our early monarchs obtained various charters and privileges, especially as regards the judgment and punishment of offences committed within its own jurisdiction. Although it sends no members to parliament, it has, besides a mayor, jurats, and commoners, a steward, two recorders, and a chamberlain, and the corporation are trustees for various charitable institutions. Feversham is of comparatively less importance than forrnerly, as may be seen by its curious church, its town-hall, and some other buildings of great antiquity. It is now chiefly of consideration from the great manufactory of gunpowder carried on by the government, which gives occupation to many families; whilst others are employed in the fishery for oysters for the supply of London. Near to it the river Swale enters the sea, and the quarantine rendezvous of Sandgate Creek is so near as to form a communication with the ships under detention. There arc good markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The great road from London to Canterbury avoids the town, though it passes within less than a mile of it. The population in 1801 amounted to 3488, in 1811 to 3872, in 1821 to 4208, and in 1831 to 4429.
