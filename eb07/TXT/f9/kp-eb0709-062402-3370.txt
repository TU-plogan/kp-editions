FLORALES Ludi, or Floral Games, in Antiquity, were games celebrated in honour of Flora, the goddess of flowers. The ludi florales, according to Pliny (lib. xviii. c. 29), were instituted by order of an oracle of the Sibyls, on the 28th of April; not in the year of Rome ιoxvι. as we commonly read it in the ancient editions of that author, nor in ιoxiv. as Hardouin has corrected it, but, as Vossius reads it, in 513; though they were not regularly held every year till after 580. They were chiefly held in the night time, in the patrician street; but some will have it there was a circus for the purpose on the hill called Hortulorum.
