FINLAND, a province formerly of Sweden, but at present under the dominion of Russia, of which it is called a stadtholdership. It extends from 19. 35. to 33. 1. east longitude, and from 59. 50. to 69.55. north latitude; and, including Lappmark, extends over the vast space of 140,844 square miles, although the inhabitants in the year 1814 amounted to no more than 1,460,000. The country is generally hilly rather than mountainous, as none of the elevations exceed 3500 feet, and the highest are only in the north and in the west parts. In the east it is filled with sand hills, rocks, woods, marshes, lakes, and rivers; but between the hills are some spots, either cultivated, or affording natural pasture. On the sea shore both in the Gulf of Bothnia and in that of Finland, the rocks and sands, and the small islands and shores, are so numerous as to render the navigation highly dangerous.

The climate, though varying with the degrees of latitude, is unfavourable to a great population, from the excessive cold of the long winter, and the excessive heat and aridity of the short summer. Yet, when under the Swedish government, Finland not only produced sufficient corn, chiefly rye, for its own consumption, but supplied a part of the demand, of the metropolitan provinces. Of late the culture of potatoes has been extended. Finland produces hemp and flax; the former inferior in quality to the latter. The chief articles of export are the productions of the forest, which supply fuel to Stockholm, and masts and ship-timber to other countries. Considerable quantities of pot and pearl ashes, of pitch and tar, are also exported, and some salted fishes; but salt is a scarce commodity, and the want of it is felt by others as well as by the fishermen. The inhabitants being of different races, speak dialects of the Finnish, Lappish, and Swedish languages, whose origin being the same, are understood without much difficulty. The whole adhere to the Lutheran confession, except in some of the southern parts, where the Greek church has adherents among those of the Russian nation.

Since Russia possessed the country, the administration of that empire has been in part introduced, but with much deference to the ancient customs and laws of the inhabitants. The province is now divided into twelve circles.
