FISHGUARD, a market-town of Pembrokeshire, in South Wales, within the hundred of Komyss, 151 miles from London. It is situated on the shore, at the spot where the river Gwaine falls into the sea. It is governed by a mayor and corporate body. The trade is but trifling, but there is a well-supplied market on Friday. A corps of 1200 French troops, composed chiefly of enlisted felons, landed here in 1797, but were speedily made prisoners by the local volunteers. The population in 1801 amounted to 1503, in 1811 to 1572, in 1821 to 1837, and in 1831 to 1990.
