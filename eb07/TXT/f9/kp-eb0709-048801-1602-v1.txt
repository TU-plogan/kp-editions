FARNABIE, Thomas, son of a carpenter in London and born in 1575, staid a short time at Oxford, where being enticed to abandon his religion, he went to Spain, and was there educated in a college belonging to the Jesuits. Being weary of their severe discipline, he accompanied Sir John Hawkinsand Sir Francis Drake in their last voyage in 1595. He was afterwards a soldier in the Low Countries; but being reduced to great want, he returned to England, where, wandering about for some time under the name of Thomas Bainrafe, the anagram of his name, he settled at Mattock in Somersetshire, and there taught a grammar school with good reputation. He afterwards removed to London, and opened a school with large accommodations for young gentlemen. Whilst he taught this school, he was made master of arts at Cambridge, and incorporated into the university of Oxford. In 1636, he removed to Seven Oaks in Kent, and taught the sons of several noblemen and gentlemen, who boarded in his house, with great success, and grew rich. His works gained him reputation. Upon the breaking out of the civil commotions in 1641, he was cast into prison, and it was debated in the House of Commons whether he should be sent to America; but this motion being rejected, he was removed to Ely House, in Holborn, where he died in the year 1647. Farnabic was a very eminent grammarian; and many writers have spoken with great approbation of his labours. Mr Bayle in particular says, “His notes upon most of the ancient Latin poets have been of very great use to young beginners; being short, learned, and designed chiefly to clear up the text.”
