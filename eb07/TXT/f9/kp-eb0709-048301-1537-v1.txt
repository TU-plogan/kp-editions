FALKLAND, a small town of Scotland, in the county of Fife, and the chief place of a parish of the same name. It is situated in rather a secluded part of the district, some miles west from the great thoroughfare through the county. It consists of a single street, broad and spacious at the east end, but insignificant at the opposite extremity, with several cross lanes. The houses are in many cases covered with thatch, and of an antique and primitive appearance. The chief occupation here is weaving; but there is little or no traffic of any kind. The principal attraction in Falkland is the royal palace, originally a stronghold belonging to the Macduff's, earls of Fife. On the attainder of Munro Stewart, the seventeenth earl, it became forfeited to the crown in 1424. James V. who was very fond of the place, enlarged and improved it. The remains evince its former magnificence and elegance, and the fine taste of the princely architect. The gateway is placed between two fine round towers, and on the right hand adjoins the chapel, whose roof is of wood, handsomely gilt and painted, but in a most ruinous condition. Beneath are several apartments. The front next to the court was beautifully adorned with statues, heads in bas-relief, and elegant columns not reducible to any order, but of fine proportion, with capitals approaching the Ionic scroll. Beneath some of these pillars was inscribed I. R. M. G. 1537, or Ja~ cobus Rex, Maria de Guise. This place was also a favourite residence of James VI. on account of the fine park and abundance of deer. The cast side was accidentally burnt in the time of Charles II. and the park ruined during Cromwell’s usurpation, when the fine oaks were cut down in order to build a fort at Perth. There are various historical associations connected with Falkland. In a dungeon of the original castle, which is supposed to have constituted the north side of the court-yard of the palace, Robert, Duke of Rothesay, brother of James I. was s±απm⅜ to death by his uncle Albany. Falkland was erected into a burgh by James II. in 1458; and in 1595 James VI. renewed and confirmed its charter. The population of the place amounted in 1821 to 1050, and in 1831 to 2658.

Falkland, Lord. See Carey.
