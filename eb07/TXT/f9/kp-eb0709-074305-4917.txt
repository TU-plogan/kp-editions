FORELAND, or Foreness, in Navigation, a point of land jutting out into the sea.

North Foreland, in the Isle of Thanet, Kent, of which it is the north-eastern point, is the promontory ascertained by act of parliament to be the most southern part of the port of London, which is thereby extended north in a right line to the point called the Nase on the coast of Essex, and forms what is properly called the Mouth of the Thames. A sea-mark was erected here by the Trinity-house corporation, at the public expense. All vessels which pass on the south side of this head-land are said to enter the Channel; and all the towns or harbours between London and this place, whether on the Kentish or Essex shore, are called members of the port of London.

South Foreland, in Kent, a head-land forming the eastern point of the Kentish shore; and called South, in respect to its bearing from tire North Foreland, which is about six miles to the north. Its situation is a great security to the Downs, the road between both, which would be very dangerous for ships, did not this point break off the sea, which would otherwise come rolling up from the west to the Flats; so that these two capes breaking all the force of the sea on the south-east and south-west, make the Downs be accounted a good road, excepting when the wind blows excessively hard from south-east, east-by-north, or east-northeast, when ships in the Downs are driven from their anchors, and often run ashore, or are forced on the sands, or into Sandwich Bay, or Ramsgate Pier.
