FLECKNOE, Richard, an English poet and dramatic writer in the reign of Charles II. who has been more indebted for the preservation of his name to Dryden’s satire of Mac-Fleckηoe, than to the merit of his own productions, is said to have been originally a Jesuit, and connected with some persons of distinction belonging to die Roman Catholic persuasion. 1he origin of Dryden’s antipathy to this man has not been ascertained. It was confirmed, however, when die office of poet-laureat, of which Dryden had been deprived on account of his religion, was conferred upon Flecknoe; and resentment of this wrong appears to have produced the celebrated satire above mentioned, which, besides being equally spirited and amusing in itself, served m some degree as the model of the Dunciad.

Flecknoe wrote some plays, but not more than one of them was ever acted. His comedy called Damoiselles à la Mode was printed in 1667, and addressed to the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle; but the players refused to perform it. His other dramatic pieces were Errnina, ar the Chaste Lady ; Loves Dominion, printed in 1654; and The Marriage of Oceanus and Dritannia. His other works consist of, 1. Epigrams and Enigmatical Characters, 1670 in 8vo; 2. Miscellanea, or Poems of all sorts, with divers other pieces, 1653, in 12mo; 3. Diarium, or the Journal divided into twelve Jornadas, in burlesque verse, London 1656, in 12mo. Flecknoe died in 1678. Mr Southey, in his Omniana, has generally endeavoured to vindicate him from some of the ridicule thrown upon him as a writer and from certain grave reproaches made against his character as a man.
