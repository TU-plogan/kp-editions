FINAL, in general, whatever terminates or concludes a thing; as final judgment, final sentence, and the like.

Final Cause, is the end for which a thing is done. The final cause is the first thing in the intention of an agent, and the last in the execution.

Final Letters, among Hebrew grammarians, five letters so called,, because they have a different figure at the end of words from that which they have in any other situation.
