F, THE fourth consonant and sixth letter of the alphabet. The letter F is borrowed from the digamma or double gamma, F, of the Aeolians, as is evident from the inscription on the pedestal of the Colossus at Delos; and though this letter is not found in the modern Greek alphabet, yet it was in the ancient one, whence the Latins received and transmitted it to us. It is formed by a strong expression of the breath, and joining at the same time the upper teeth and under lip. It has but one sort of sound, which has a great affinity with v and ph, the latter being written for it by us in all Greek words, as philosophy, though the Italians write the same term filosofia. The Romans for some time used an inverted F, instead of V consonant, which had no peculiar figure in their alphabet. Thus, in inscriptions we meet with TERMINAAIT, DITI, and so on. Lipsius and others say, that it was the Emperor Claudius who introduced the use of the inverted digamma or; but it did not long subsist after his death; for Quintilian observes, that it was not used in his time. F or fa, in Music, is the fourth note in rising in this order of the gamut, ut, re, mi, fa. It likewise denotes one of the Greek keys in music, destined for the bass. F, in physical prescription, stands for Fiat, or Let it be done; thus, fi s. a. signifies fiat secundum artem. F was also a numeral letter signifying forty; according to the verse,

Sexta quaterđenos gerit quae distat ab alpha.

And when a dash was added at top, thus, F, it signified forty thousand. In the civil law, two f’s joined together thus, v ^ signify the Pandects. In the law of England, F was a stigma or brand put upon felons (by stat. 4 Henry VII. c. 13) with a hot iron, on their being admitted to the benefit of clergy.
