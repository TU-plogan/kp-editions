MAGELLAN, or Magelhaens, Ferdinand de, an eminent navigator, was by birth a Portuguese, and of a good family. He served with reputation in the East Indies for five years under Albuquerque, and in 1510 he greatly distinguished himself at the battle of Malacca. Deeming his services poorly repaid by his own court, he entered into the employment of Charles V. king of Spain. He has been charged with peculation by some of his countrymen, who assign this as the reason why he quitted Portugal. In conjunction with Ruy Folero he formed the bold design of discovering a new passage by the west to the Molucca Islands, which, he offered to prove, fell within the division of the globe assigned by the pope to the crown of Castille. It is said that he first proposed this enterprise to Emanuel king of Portugal, who rejected it, as opening a way for other nations to have access to the East Indies, the trade of which was then monopolized by the Portuguese. The proposition was agreed to by the king of Spain, and, on the 20th of September 1519, Magellan sailed from San Lucar, with five ships and 236 men under his command. His officers soon murmured at this appointment, considering it as a disgrace to be commanded by a renegade Portuguese; and when the fleet was lying at a port in South America, which they named San Julian, a conspiracy was formed against him by three of the captains, but he discovered and quelled it. He caused the captain of one of [7:13:679]the ships to be put to death, he boarded a second and secured the mutineers, and the third submitted.

The coast on which they lay was that of Patagonia; and this first voyage contains accounts of the extraordinary stature of the natives. About the end of October they reached a cape to which they gave the name of De las Virgines, forming the entrance of the straits which now bear the name of Magellan. He exerted all his authority to induce his men to venture on this unknown passage, with the view of crossing a vast ocean beyond it, at the hazard of running short of provisions, of which a supply for three months was all that he had remaining. One of his ships abandoned him, and made the best of her way to Europe. But the rest proceeded, and on the 27th of November they discovered the South Sea, which made Magellan shed tears of joy. They continued their voyage across this ocean, now visited for the first time by Europeans, and were not long in suffering those evils from famine which they had apprehended. The men were reduced to the necessity of eating the hides with which the rigging was covered. The weather proved so uniformly calm and temperate, that they gave to the ocean the name ļof Pacific. On the 6th of March they came in sight of the Ladrones, so called from the thievish disposition of the inhabitants; and thence they sailed to the Philippines. At Zebu, Magellan obtained with little difficulty the conversion of the king; and, on condition of his becoming a vassal bf Spain, the Portuguese assisted him in reducing some neighbouring chieftains, and the cross was erected over 'some burned villages.

I With about fifty men Magellan landed upon Matan, the phief of which had refused to submit to Zebu, and an engagement took place between them, which lasted for the greater part of the day. His troops having spent all their ammunition, found it necessary to retreat, during which Magellan rvas wounded in the leg by an arrow, beaten [down, and at last slain with a lance. This happened in 1521. By this act of imprudence he lost the honour of being the first circumnavigator of the globe, which fell to ihe lot of Cano, who brought his ship home by the East ⅛ndics∙ Yet Magellan has secured an immortal name imongst maritime discoverers, by the commencement of This great enterprise, in which he displayed extraordinary skill and resolution, but disregarded justice and humanity.

Straits of Magellan, a narrow passage between the sland of Tierra del Fuego and the southern extremity of he continent of America. This passage was first discovered by Ferdinand Magellan, who sailed through it into the ∣r>cuth Sea, and thence to the East Indies. Other navigators have passed the same way; but as these straits are exceedingly difficult, and subject to storms, it has been Common to sail round by Cape Horn, rather than through lie Straits of Magellan.
