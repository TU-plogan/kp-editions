MAEANDER, in Ancient Geography, a celebrated river of Asia Minor, rising near Celaenae. It flows through Caria and Ionia into the Aegean Sea between Miletus and Priene, after having been increased by the waters of the Marsyas, Lycus, Eudon, Lethaeus, and other tributaries. It is celebrated amongst the poets for its windings, which amount to no less than six hundred, and from which all recurring sinuosities have received the name of moeanders.
