MAGLOIRE, St, a native of Wales, in Great Britain, and cousin-german to St Sampson and St Mallo. He embraced a monastic life, and went into France, where he was made abbot of Dol, and afterwards provincial bishop in Bretagne. He subsequently founded a monastery in the island of Jersey, where he died on the 14th of October 575, about the age of eighty. His remains were transported to the suburb of St Jacques, and deposited in a monastery of Benedictines, which was ceded to the fathers of the Oratory in 1628. It became the seminary of St Magloire, and celebrated on account of the learned men whom it has produced. This saint cultivated poetry with considerable success, the hymn which is sung at the feast of All Saints, Caelo quos eadem gloria consecrat, having been composed by him.
