MABILLON, John, a learned writer of France in the seventeenth century, was born at Perremonte, on the frontiers of Champagne, in the year 1632. He was educated in the university of Rheims, and afterwards entered into the abbey of the Benedictines of St Rémy. In the year 1663 he was appointed keeper of the treasures and monuments of France at St Denis; but having unfortunately broken a looking-glass, which was alleged to have belonged to Virgil, he desired leave of his superiors to quit an employment which frequently obliged him to say things he did not believe. Next year he went to Paris, and ∣proved very serviceable to Father d’Acheri, who was desirous of having some young monk who could assist him jin compiling his Spicilegium. This made Mabillon known. Soon afterwards the congregation of Saint-Maur having formed a design of publishing new editions of the Fathers, revised from the manuscripts in the libraries of the Benedictines, Mabillon was charged with the edition of St Bernard, which he prepared with extraordinary diligence. After this he published many other works evincing great capacity and industry. In 1682, he was employed by Μ. Colbert in examining some ancient titles relating to the royal family. In the year following the same minister sent him into Germany, to search the archives and libraries of the ancient abbeys, for all that seemed calculated to illustrate the history of the church in general, and that of France in particular. Mabillon published an account of this journey. In the year 1685 he undertook another journey into Italy, by order of the king of France, and returned the year following with a very noble collection. He placed in the king’s library above three thousand volumes of rare books, printed and in manuscript, and composed two volumes respecting the pieces which he had discovered in that country. He was highly esteemed for his virtues as well as his learning.
