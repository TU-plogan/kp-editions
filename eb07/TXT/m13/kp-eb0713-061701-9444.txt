M, Α liquid consonant, and the twelfth letter in the alphabet. It has one unvaried sound, and is pronounced by striking the upper lip against the lower. In this the pronunciation of the letter m agrees with that of b, the only difference between the two consisting in a little motion made in the nose in pronouncing m, and not in b ; and hence it happens that those who have taken cold, ordinarily pronounceanfor b, the nose in that case being disabled from making the necessary motion. All consonants are formed with the aid of vowels; but in m the vowel precedes (em), in b it follows (be ), and m is never mute. Quintilian observes, that the m sometimes ends Latin words, but never Greek ones; the Greeks in that case always changing it into n, for the sake of the euphony. Μ is also a numeral letter, and amongst the ancients it was used for a thousand; according to the verse,
Μ caput est numeri, quem scimus mille teneri.

When a dash is added on the top of it, as Μ, it signifies a thousand times a thousand, or a million. Μ, as an abbreviation, stands for Manlius, Marcus, Martius, and Mucius; Μ. A. signifies magister artium, or master of arts; MS, manuscript, and MSS, manuscripts. Μ, in astronomical tables, and other things of that kind, is used for meridional or southern, and sometimes for meridies or mid-day. Μ, in medicinal prescription, is frequently used to signify a maniple or handful; and it is sometimes also put at the end of a recipe, for misce, mingle, or for mixtura, a mixture; thus, m f. julapiurn, signifies mix and make a julep. Μ, in law, is the brand or stigma of a person convicted of manslaughter, and admitted to the benefit of his clergy.
