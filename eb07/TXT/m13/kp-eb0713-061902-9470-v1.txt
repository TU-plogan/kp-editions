MACCLESFIELD, a large market-town of the county of Chester, in the hundred of its own name, 168 miles north-west by north from London. It is pleasantly situated on an eminence at a short distance from the river Bollin. Many of the buildings in the principal streets are of a superior order. The town is lighted by gas, and well supplied with water derived from a spring on the neighbouring common. The river Bollin passes through the lower part of the town, and although the stream is small, it turns several mills. There are three established churches in the town, several dissenting places of worship, and a chapel for Roman Catholics. There is likewise a free grammar school, endowed with landed property of the yearly value of L.500, and a national school, with several Sunday schools. By the new municipal act, the town is divided into six wards; and the civil government is vested in a mayor, twelve aldermen, and thirty-six councillors. The justices of the peace are seven, one of them being the mayor for the time being. It returns two members to the ∣House of Commons. There are markets on Monday and Saturday, which are well supplied. It was long celebrated for making buttons, silk-twist, sewing-silk, and bands for hats; but of late years these have been superseded by those öf silk and cotton goods of various descriptions. The number and magnitude of the factories, as 'stated below, demonstrate the extent and importance of these manufactures, as connected with this town. There are also iron and brass founderies, nail factories, rope and twine works, and hat manufactories. The number of silk mills in the town, and in the remaining .part of Prestbury parish, amounts to fifty-eight (eighteen of them being unemployed at the present time, 1836), and they furnish employment to 2429 males and 3525 females. The number of cotton mills is fourteen, employing 1370 males and 1429 females. The population amounted in 1801 to 8743, in 1811 to 12,999, in 1821 to 17,746, and in 1831 to 23,129.
