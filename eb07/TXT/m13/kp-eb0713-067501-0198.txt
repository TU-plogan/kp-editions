MADRIGAL, a short, amorous poem, composed of a number of free and unequal verses, neither confined to the regularity of a sonnet, nor to the point or antithesis of an epigram, but only consisting of some tender and delicate thought, expressed with a beautiful, noble, or elegant simplicity. Menage derives the word from mandra, which, in Latin and Greek, signifies a sheep-fold; imagining that it had been originally a kind of pastoral or shepherdâ€™s song, whence the Italians formed their madrigale, and the English madrigal. But others derive it from the word rnad-rugar, which in the Spanish language signifies to rise in the morning; the madrigales having been formerly sung early in the morning by those who had a mind to serenade their mistresses.
