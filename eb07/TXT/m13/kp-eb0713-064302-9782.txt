MACER, Emilius, an ancient Latin poet, was born at Verona, and flourished under Augustus Caesar. Eusebius relates that he died a few years after Virgil. Ovid speaks of a poem of his, on the nature and quality of birds, serpents, and herbs, which he says Macer, being then very old, had often read to him. There is extant a poem under Macerâ€™s name, upon the nature and power of herbs; but it is evidently spurious. He also wrote a supplement to Homer, as Quintus Calaber did afterwards in Greek.
