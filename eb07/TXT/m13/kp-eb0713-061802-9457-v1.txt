MACARIANS, in Ecclesiastical History, the followers of Macarius, an Egyptian monk, who, towards the close of the fourth century, was distinguished for his sanctity and virtue. In his writings there are some superstitious tenets, and also certain opinions which seem tainted with Origenism. The name has also been applied to those who adopted the sentiments of Macarius, a native of Ireland, who about the close of the ninth century propagated in France the error afterwards maintained by Averroes, that one individual intelligence or soul performed the spiritual and rational functions in all the human race.
