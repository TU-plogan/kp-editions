MACQUER, Pierre Joseph, was born at Paris on the 9th of October 1718, and died there on the 16th ofFebruary 1784. He was member of the Academy of Sciences, and professor of pharmacy; and was engaged in the Journal de Sçavans for articles in medicine and chemistry. With the last of these sciences he was intimately acquainted. He had a share in compiling the Pharmacopoeia Parisiensis, published in 1758, in 4to. His other works are, 1. Elémens de Chimie Théorique, Paris, 1749, 1753, 12mo; 2. Elémens de Chimie Pratique, 1751, in two vols. 12mo; 3. Plan d’un cours de Chimie Expérimentale et Raisonnée, 1757, 12mo, in the composition of which he was associated with Μ. Beaumé; 4. Formulae Medicamentorum Magistralium, 1763; 5. L’Art de la Teinture en Soie, 1763; 6. Dictionnaire de Chimie, contenant la Théorie et la Pratique de cet Art, 1766, in two vols. 8vo, which has been translated into German with notes, and into English with notes by Mr Keir. Macquer has, by his labours and writings, greatly contributed to render useful an art which formerly tended only to ruin the health of the patient by foreign remedies, or to reduce the professors of it to beggary, whilst they prosecuted the idle dream of converting every thing into gold.
