MAGINDANAO, the most southerly of the Philippine Islands, in the Eastern Seas, and situated principally between the sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude. It is of an extremely irregular shape, and may be estimated at 300 miles in length by 105 in average breadth. This island is of a very singular shape, having three remarkable promontories, one near Samboangan to the westward, Cape St Augustine to the eastward, and Surigao to the northward. It may be divided into three parts, under distinct and independent governments; the first, under the sultan, who resides at the town of Mindanao or Selangan, formerly comprehending the greater part of the sea-coast; the second, under the Spaniards, comprehending a large portion of the seacoast to the west, north, and north-east, where they have settled colonies of Christians from the Philippines; the third, under the sultans or rajahs, who inhabit the banks of the Great Lake, or Lano, and thence a good way inland towards the hills. This island is so remarkably indented by the sea, that it is extremely favourable to piracy, and has always been the haunt of pirates. The interior of the island is intersected by lofty chains of mountains, with intervening plains, which afford pasture for vast herds of cattle. The country is well watered and well wooded, and covered towards the sea-coast with impenetrable jungle and forests. Rice is abundantly produced, also yams, sweet potatoes, and generally all the fruits common to the tropical climates. Gold is found in the sands of the rivers, and in the mountains. The exports consist of wax, rice, cassia, rattans, tobacco, pepper, &c. All sorts of cloth are here in great demand, especially long cloth, white and blue, and red handkerchiefs of all kinds; chintz, with dark grounds; Surat goods, and all kinds of European cutlery. Many articles of Chinese manufacture have been imported. The inhabitants have not made any great advances in civilization. They can manufacture nothing beyond a common nail. They are, however, much given to cock-fighting. The women do not suffer the same confinement as in other eastern countries.

Magellan first took possession of this island in 1521, in the name of Charles V.; and the Spaniards made some settlements, and subdued the northern coast, but never made any farther progress, and now with difficulty retain their feeble colonies. It was visited by the Portuguese about the year 1537, and by the Dutch in 1607, 1616, and 1627. The intercourse of the British with this island has not been frequent. The pirates, by whom it is inhabited, made an attack on the British settlements on Prince of Wales Island in 1788, and were repulsed with loss. In 1798 the sultan seized a boat’s crew of a British frigate, who were afterwards ransomed. In 1803 they fitted out a fleet of prows with a view of invading the Company’s settlements in Celebes, when they were met by the Swift cruiser, and dispersed with great loss. Long. 119. 30. to 125. E. Lat. 5. 40. to 9. 55. N. The principal town of the island is of the same name, and the residence of the sultan. It is situated about six miles up the Pelangy or Magindanao River, and forms, properly speaking, one town with Selangan, which is on the opposite side of the river, communicating by several bridges. It extends about one mile down the river Pelangy, forming a tolerable street, about half the distance. Long. 124. 40. E. Lat. 7. 9. N.
