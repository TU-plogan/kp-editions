MADURA, an extensive district of Hindustan, in the Southern Carnatic, situated chiefly between the ninth and tenth degrees of north latitude. It was annexed in 1742 to the dominions of the nabob of the Carnatic, and in 1801 came into the possession of the British. It is bounded on the north by the Polygar territory and Dindigul, on the south by Tinevelly, on the east by the district of Mara was, and on the west by that of Dindigul. The Vay-garoo and Candaroo are the chief rivers, and the principal owns Madura and Seholavanden. It has a tolerably fertile soil, and is well supplied with water; but its cultivation has always been inferior to that of Tanjore, which was probably owing to the warlike habits of the Zemindars and Polygars, living in castles surrounded with woods, in a constant state of war with each other. The name of the capital is Madura, which is an ancient city of the Southern Carnatic, the four sides of which front nearly the four cardinal points. It was formerly well fortified with a ditch, rampart, and square towers, and from 1740 to 1760 sustained many sieges, and was often in possession of refractory Polygars. Since it has come into the possession of the British, the peace of the country has been firmly maintained, so that it is now quite superfluous to keep up this or any other fortress. The travelling distance from Seringapatam is 240 miles, and from Madras 307 miles. Long. 78. 13. E. Lat. 9. 51. N.

Madura, an island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the north coast of the island of Java, from which it is separated by the Strait of Madura, which is a hundred miles in length by sixteen in average breadth. The channel at its [7:13:676]narrowest part is only eighty-three fathoms wide, and is marked by buoys. There is a depth of only three fathoms at the entrance, which can easily be passed by ships of a large size, the bottom being of a soft mud, through which a vessel is carried by the slightest breeze, aided by the current, which is strong. The inhabitants resemble the Hindus in their appearance, and worship their divinities, namely, Indra, Surya, and Vishnu. The inhabitants of the interior are rude and barbarous. They attack their enemies with poisoned arrows, which they blow through a tube. The Dutch invaded and subdued this island in 1747 i and made slaves of a great number of them. Long. 112. 54. E. Lat. 6. 44. to 7. 15. S.
