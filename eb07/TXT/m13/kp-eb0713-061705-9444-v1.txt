MACAO, an island and town of China, belonging to the Portuguese, and the only European settlement within the limits of that empire. It was in consequence of the aid afforded by the Portuguese to the Chinese against the pirates who infested their coasts, that the privilege of a settlement was conceded to them. At first the Chinese refused to trade with the Portuguese; but being forced to have recourse to their aid, and having by their means compelled the pirates to raise the siege of Canton, and pursued them to Macao, which they took, most of the marauders were put to death. This service being reported to the emperor, he published an edict, by which the Portuguese were to have possession of Macao, with the power of forming a settlement, which they gladly accepted. They accordingly made choice of a peninsula, where they built a town, and fortified it after the European manner; but the Chinese have effectually provided for their own security, by not allowing them any provisions except what they receive through themselves. The peninsula on which the town is built is connected with the mainland by a neck of land not more than 100 yards in breadth. The territory attached to it is about three miles in length, and half a mile in breadth. The isthmus connecting it with the rest of the island is crossed by a wall projecting on both sides into the sea, and there the Chinese keep a gate and guardhouse. Beyond this wall the Portuguese are seldom permitted to pass, so that their communications with the continent are entirely in the power of the Chinese. Still the possession of the place was of great service to the Portuguese, who carried on a lucrative commerce with Japan, by which Macao became one of the richest places in their possessions. But since their expulsion from Japan, and the other European nations shared in the Canton trade, the place no longer enjoys its former prosperity.

The city of Macao is of considerable extent, the houses being built of stone, and constructed on the European plan, but without any attempt at exterior elegance, and the streets narrow and irregular. The public buildings consist of churches, convents, and the senate-house; the latter terminates the only spacious and level street of the town. The governor’s house is situated on the beach, and near it is the English factory, a plain commodious building. The harbour has not a sufficient depth for vessels of great burden; and large ships generally anchor about six or seven miles off the town, bearing west-north-west. It is defended by several forts mounted with heavy cannon, and garrisoned by Portuguese troops. There is a Portuguese customhouse and quay on the south side of the town, where all ships, as they come into the bay, are obliged to send their boats. The Chinese treat the Portuguese with great hauteur, exacting duties sometimes in the port, and punishing individuals under the Portuguese regime; and the moment any resistance is made, the supply of provisions is stopped until harmony be restored. All sorts of provisions, vegetables, and fruits are found at Macao in great abundance. Long. 113. 32. E. Lat. 22. 10. N.
