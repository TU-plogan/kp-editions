MAFFEI, Scipio, a celebrated Italian poet, descended of an ancient and illustrious family at Verona, was born in 1675. After having finished his studies, he took arms, and distinguished himself by his'valour at the battle of Donawert; but he more particularly signalized himself by his love of learning, which made him undertake several journeys into France, England, and Germany. He conversed with the learned in all these countries, and obtained their friendship and esteem. He was a member of the academy of the Arcadians at Rome, an honorary foreign member of that of Inscriptions at Paris, and died in 1755. He wrote many works in verse and prose, which are esteemed. Of these, the best known are, 1. The Tragedy of Merope, of which there are two French translations in prose; 2. Ceremony, a comedy; 3. A Translation, into Italian verse, of the first book of Homer’s Iliad; 4. Many other pieces of poetry, in a collection entitled Phyme and Prose, 4to. His principal works in prose are, I. Verona Illustrata; 2. Istoria Diplomatica; 3. Scienza Cavalleresca, an excellent work, in which he attacks duelling; 4. An edition of the Theatro Italiano; 5. An edition of Cassiodorus on the Epistles, Acts of the Apostles, and Apocalypse; and, 6. Galliae Antiquitates quaedam selectae, atque in plures Epistolas distributae; besides several other works.
