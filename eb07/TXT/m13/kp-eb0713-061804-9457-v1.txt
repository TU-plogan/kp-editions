MACASSAR, the chief settlement of the Dutch in the island of Celebes, named by them first Rotterdam, and situated on the south-west coast of the island. The fort is about half a mile from the beach, opposite to the road, where a pier extends which serves for unloading the ships, and close to which there are fifteen or sixteen feet of water. The walls of the fort are high and strong, being built of rock Stone. Without is a large plain, on the north side of which is situated the town, where most of the Europeans reside. The Chinese live all together in one street, which is named after them. The Portuguese obtained permission to establish themselves here in 1525; but they were expelled by the Dutch in 1660, who hold the first and surrounding district in consequence of a treaty entered into with the native prince. The English in 1815 established a factory, which, however, they were soon under the necessity of abandoning. Numerous Chinese are settled here, who carry on a considerable trade with their native country. Macassar was formerly an extensive kingdom, which, before its conquest by the Dutch, comprehended a great extent of coast. The Straits of Macassar separate the island of Borneo from Celebes. They extend about 300 miles from north to south, and in average breadth 126 miles, excepting at the northern extremity, where it contracts to about sixty miles. It is of very dangerous navigation, abounding with shoals, rocks, and rocky islands, and in January and February a strong current is forced through this strait to the southward by the north winds.
