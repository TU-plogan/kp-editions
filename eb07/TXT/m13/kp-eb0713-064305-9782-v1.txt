MACHAON, a celebrated physician amongst the ancients, was the son of Aesculapius and brother to Podalirius. He went to the Trojan war with the inhabitants of Trica, Ithome, and Oechalia. According to some, he was king of Messenia. He was physician to the Greeks, and healed the wounds which they received during this long war. Some suppose that he was killed before Troy, by Eurypylus, the son of Telephus. He received divine honours after his death, and had a temple in Messenia.
