MAGGI, Jerome, in Latin Magius, one of the most tamed men of the sixteenth century, was born at Anghiari iı Tuscany. He applied himself to all the sciences, and ven to the art of war; and distinguished himself so much iı this last study, that the Venetians sent him into the Hand of Cyprus in quality of judge of the admiralty. When ∣he Turks besieged Famagusta, he performed all the ser- , ices that could be expected from the most excellent engineer, inventing mines and machines for throwing fire, by means of which he destroyed all the works of the besiegers, and in an instant overthrew what had cost’the Turks infinite labour. But the Ottomans had their revenge; for, having taken the city in 1571, they plundered his library, carried him loaded with chains to Constantinople, and treated him in the most inhuman and barbarous manner; nevertheless he comforted himself by the example of Aesop, Menippus, Epictetus, and other learned men; and, after passing the whole day in the meanest drudgery, he spent the night in writing. By the help of his memory alone, he composed treatises filled with quotations, which he dedicated to the imperial and French ambassadors. These ministers, moved by compassion for this learned man, resolved to purchase him; but whilst they were treating for his ransom, Maggi found means to make his escape, and to get to the imperial ambassador’s house; when the grand visir, being enraged at his flight, and remembering the great mischief he had done to the Turks during the siege of Famagusta, sent to have him seized, and caused him to be strangled in prison in 1572. His principal works are, 1. A Treatise on the Bells of the Ancients; 2. On the Destruction of the World by Fire; 3. Commentaries on Aemilius Probus’s Lives of Illustrious Men; 4. Commentaries on the Institutes. These works are written in elegant Latin. He also wrote a treatise on fortification, in Italian; and a book on the situation of ancient Tuscany. He ought not to be confounded with his brother Bartolomeo Maggi, a physician at Bologna, who wrote a treatise on gunshot wounds; nor with Vincent Maggi, a native of Bresse, and a celebrated professor of humanity at Ferrara in Padua, who was the author of several works.
