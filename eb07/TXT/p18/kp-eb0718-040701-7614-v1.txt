POPO is the name of one of the states comprised in what is denominated the Slave Coast, on the western shores of Africa. In the strictest acceptation, the Slave Coast includes the states of Coto, Popo, Widah, and Ardra, the whole being subject to the king of Dahomey. The maritime flat country here is broader than that of the Gold Coast, and very fertile. The inhabitants are warlike, and addicted to cheating and thieving. This state is divided into the Great and Little Popo. The capital of the former stands on an island at the mouth of a river, which is rendered useless for the navigation of vessels, on account of a formidable bar at its mouth. The capital of Little Popo is situated on the shore near a small river or inlet of the sea. Poultry are here in uncommon abundance; and the flocks of bats are so numerous that they darken the air like dense clouds.

Popo Isle, an island or cluster of islands in the Eastern Seas, the chief of which is about fifty miles in circumference. They are distant five leagues from the islands of Bo, and exceed them in height. They are inhabited, and afford a supply of nuts and dried fish. Long. 130. 0. 15. E. Lat. 19. 14. S.
