PLEA, in Law, is what either party alleges for himself in court, in a cause there depending; and in a more restricted sense, it is the defendant’s answer to the plaintiff’s declaration.

Pleas are usually divided into those of the crown and common pleas. Pleas of the crown are all suits in the king’s name, or in the name of the attorney-general in behalf of the king, for offences committed against his crown and dignity, and against his peace; as treason, murder, felony, &c.

Common pleas are such suits as are carried on between common persons in civil cases. These pleas are of two sorts; dilatory pleas, and pleas to the action. Dilatory pleas are such as tend merely to delay or put off the suit, by questioning the propriety of the remedy rather than by denying the injury; pleas to the action are such as dispute the very cause of suit.
