PLATFORM, in the military art, an elevation of earth, sometimes covered with planks of wood, upon which cannon are placed to fire on the enemy. On the ramparts there is always a platform, where the cannon are mounted. It is made by heaping up earth upon the rampart, or by an arrangement of madriers, rising insensibly, for the cannon to roll on, either in a casemate, or, on attack, in the outworks. All practitioners are agreed that no shot can be depended on unless the piece can be placed upon a solid platform; for if the platform shakes with the first impulse of the powder, the piece must likewise shake, which will alter its direction, and render the shot uncertain.

Platform, in Architecture, is a row of beams which support the timber-work of a roof, and lie on the top of a wall where the entablature ought to be raised.

This term is also used for a kind of terrace'or broad smooth open walk at the top of a building, whence a fair prospect may be obtained of the adjacent country. Hence an edifice is said to bc covered with a platform when it is flat on the top, and has no ridge. Most of the oriental buildings are covered in this manner, as were all those of the ancients.
