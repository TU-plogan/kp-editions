POLYPUS, a species of fresh-water insects. The name of hydra was given to them by Linnaeus, on account of the property they have of reproducing themselves when cut in pieces, every part soon becoming a perfect animal. Dr Hill called them biota, on account of the strong principle of life with which every part of them is endowed. These animals were first discovered by Leeuwenhoeck, who gave some account of them in the Philosophical Transactions for 1703; but their wonderful properties were not thoroughly known till the year 1740, when Mr Trembley began to investigate them. Previously to his discoveries, indeed, Leibnitz and Boerhaave, by' reasonings a priori, had concluded that animals[7:18:330] might be found which would propagate by slips like plants. Their conjectures have been verified.

Marine Polypus is different in form from the fresh-water polypus already described, but is nourished, increases, and may be propagated after the same manner; Mr Ellis having often found, in his inquiries, that small pieces cut off from the living parent, in order to view the several parts more accurately, soon gave indications that they contained not only the principles of life, but likewise the faculty of increasing and multiplying into a numerous issue. It has been proved by Peyssonel, Ellis, Jussieu, Reaumur, Donati, and others, that many of those substances which had formerly been considered by naturalists as marine vegetables or seaplants, are in reality animal productions; and that they are formed by polypuses of different shapes and sizes, for their habitation, defence, and propagation. To this class may be referred the corals, corallines, keratophyta, eschara, sponges, and alcyonium; nor is it improbable that the more compact bodies, known by the common appellations of star-stones, brain-stones, petrified fungi, and the like, brought from various parts of the East and West Indies, are of the same origin. To this purpose Mr Ellis observes, that, in all the warmer latitudes, the ocean, near the shore, and wherever it is possible to observe, abounds so much with animal life, that no inanimate body can long remain in it unoccupied by some species. In these regions ships’ bottoms are soon covered with the habitations of thousands of animals; rocks, stones, and everything lifeless are instantly covered with them; even the branches of living vegetables which hang into the water are immediately loaded with the spawn of different animals, shell-fish of various kinds; and shell-fish themselves, when they become impotent and old, are the basis of new colonies of animals, from whose attacks they can no longer defend themselves.
