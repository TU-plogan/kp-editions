PRIME, Primus, an appellation given to whatever is first in order, degree, or dignity, amongst several things of the same or a similar kind. Thus we say, the prime minister, prime cost, and so of others.

Prime is sometimes used to denote the same with decimal, or the tenth part of an unit.

Prime Figure, in Geometry, one which cannot be divided into any other figures more simple than itself; as a triangle amongst planes, and the pyramid amongst solids.

Prime of the Moon, is the new moon when she first appears, which is about three days after the change.

Prime Vertical, is that vertical circle which passes through the poles of the meridian, on the east and west points of the horizon; and hence dials projected on the plane of this circle are called prime vertical, or north and south dials. Prime, in the Catholic Church, is the first of the canonical hours succeeding to lauds.
