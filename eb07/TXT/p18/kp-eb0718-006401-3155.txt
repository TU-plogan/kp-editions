PLUTO, in Pagan worship, the king of the infernal regions, was the son of Saturn and Ops, and the brother of Jupiter and Neptune. This deity, finding himself childless and unmarried, mounted his chariot to visit the world; and, arriving in Sicily, fell in love with Proserpine, whom he saw gathering flowers with her companions in the valley of Enna, near Mount Aetna; when, forcing her into his chariot, he drove her to the river Chemarus, through which he opened for himself a passage back to the realms of night.

Pluto is usually represented in an ebony chariot drawn by four black horses, sometimes holding a sceptre, to denote his power; at others, a wand,âˆ™with which he drives away the ghosts; and at others, some keys, to signify that he had the keys of death. Homer observes, that his helmet had the qualitv of rendering the wearer invisible, and that Minerva borrowed it in order to remain concealed from Mars when she fought against the Trojans. Pluto was greatly revered both by the Greeks and Romans, who erected to him both temples and altars. To this god sacrifices were offered in the night, and it was net lawful to offer them by day.
