PLTENEY, William, the famous opponent of Sir Robert Walpole in parliament, and afterwards Earl of Bath, was descended from one of the most ancient families in the kingdom, and born in the year 1682. Possessing an affluentfortune, he early procured a seat in the House of Commons, and distinguished himself as a warm partisan against Queen Anne’s ministry, whose errors he had the sagacity to detect and the eloquence to expose. When George I. came to the throne, Mr Pultency was made secretary at war, and soon afterwards cofferer to the king’s household; but the good understanding between this gentleman and Sir Robert Walpole, who then acted as prime minister, was interrupted in 1725, on a suspicion that Walpole" was desirous of extending the limits of prerogative, and of promoting the interests of Hanover, to the prejudice of those of Britain. His opposition to Sir Robert was indeed carried to such indiscriminate lengths, that some persons have been of opinion he often acted against measures beneficial to the public, merely from personal motives. It would be impracticable here to trace his parliamentary conduct. It may suffice to observe in general, that he became so obnoxious to the crown, that in 1731 the king called for the council-book, and with his own hand struck out his name from the list of privy-councillors; a proceeding which only served to inflame his resentment and increase his popularity. He still continued to attack the minister with a severity of eloquence and sarcasm that worsted every antagonist; and Sir Robert was heard to declare, that he dreaded that man’s tongue more than another man’s sword. At length, in 1741, when Walpole found the place of prime minister no longer tenable, and resigned, amongst other promotions Mr Pulteney resumed his place in the privycouncil, and was created Earl of Bath; a title purchased at the expense of that popularity which he afterwards naturally enough affected to contemn. In 1760, towards the close of the war, he published A Letter to two Great Men, recommending proper articles to be insisted on in a treaty of peace; a production which, though the writer was then unknown, was greatly applauded, and went through several impressions. He died in 1764; and, as his only son had died before him, the title became extinct.
