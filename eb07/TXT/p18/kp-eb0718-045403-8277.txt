PORTICO, in Architecture, a kind of gallery formed on the ground; or a piazza encompassed with arches supported by columns, where people walk under covert. The roof is usually vaulted, but sometimes flat. The ancients called it lacunar. Though the word portico be derived from porta, a gate or door, yet it is applied to any disposition of columns which form a gallery, without any immediate relation to doors or gates.
