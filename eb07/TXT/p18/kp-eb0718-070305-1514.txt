PUBERTY denotes the age at which the person is capable of procreating or begetting children.

Puberty, in Law, is fixed at the age of twelve in females and fourteen in males; after which they are reckoned fit for marriage. But as to crimes and punishments, the age of puberty is fixed at fourteen in both sexes.
