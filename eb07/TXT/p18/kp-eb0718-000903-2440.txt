PLATINA is a metallic substance, the name of which has an allusion to its colour. It is a diminutive of plata, and signifies little silver. From its great specific gravity, and other resemblances which it has to gold, it has been called or blanc, or white gold; from its refractory nature, diabolus metallorum ; and from some doubts entertained of its character as a metal, juan blanco, white jack, white rogue, or white mock metal. It has also received the appellation of the eighth metal; and, probably from some district which affords it, has been called platina del Pinto.
