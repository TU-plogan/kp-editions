PORONNISHIR, one of the Kurile islands in the North Pacific Ocean, about 44 miles in length and 12 in breadth. It is unequal in its surface; the northern part being mountainous, but the north-west less so, though it is still diversified by hills and valleys, one chain of hills rising to a great height, and being never wholly free from snow. It contains abundance of minerals, but is destitute of timber. Wolves and red foxes are found here in plenty; and there is a considerable bay at the north-eastern extremity. The most northern point of the island is Cape Wasitieff, in long. 156. 14. E. Lat. 51.38. N.
