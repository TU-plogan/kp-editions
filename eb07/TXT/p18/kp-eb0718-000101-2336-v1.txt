PLATA, LA.

LA PLATA is the name of an extensive tract ofcountry in Soutlι America, extending from the eastern declivities of the Chilian Andes, to the great rivers Paraguay, Parana, and La Plata. During the latter period of Spanish domination, it formed the viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, or Buenos Ayres, having then annexed to it Bolivia or Upper Peru, Paraguay, and the Banda Oriental. By subsequent changes these have been erected into independent states, and the remaining territory has been constituted a republic under the name of the Argentine Republic, or the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata. It is a federal state, consisting of a number of provinces, of which Buenos Ayres is the head. Before describing this country, we shall briefly glance at its past history.

To the Spaniards belongs the honour of first discovering this part of the South American continent. In the year 1515, Juan Dias de Solis or Salis, having been furnished by the court of Spain with two ships for the purpose of exploring Brazil, arrived, on his voyage thither, at the mouth of the Rio dc la Plata. Touching on the north coast between Maldonado and Monte Video, he took formal possession of the land in name of his sovereign; but, thrown off his guard by the deceitful friendship of the natives, he was slain, along with a few attendants who had followed him on shore. The coast was immediately abandoned by the survivors on board of the vessels; but in the year 1526 a fresh expedition, under the celebrated Sebastian Cabot, then in the service of Spain, entered the river, and cast anchor opposite the present site of Buenos Ayres. This took place at the time when a Spanish captain called Garcia was making discoveries in other parts of the same river. Advancing about a hundred and twenty leagues upwards, Cabot discovered a fine river flowing into the main stream. Up this he sailed with his fleet, and disembarking his men, built a fort, in which he left a garrison; whilst he himself, with his remaining followers, pursued his discoveries still farther up the river. The Indians with whom he came in contact exhibited abundance of gold and silver plates, particularly the latter, brought by them from the eastern parts of Peru; but the circumstance led Cabot to believe that mines of •the precious metals existed in the country in which he then was, and accordingly he gave the name of Rio de la Plata, or River of Silver, to the noble stream by which it was watered. The Spaniards soon determined on colonizing this valuable acquisition; and, to prevent any interference on the part of the other nations of Europe, Don Pedro de Mendoza, with two or three thousand followers, was sent from Spain to secure the possession, and establish a relationship between it and the mother country. He landed upon the western shore of the La Plata in the year 1535, and founded the city of Buenos Ayres, which he so named from the salubrity of the climate. Pursuing his way into the interior, he conquered all the country as far as Potosi, at which mines of silver were discovered nine years afterwards. The first settlers at Buenos Ayres were most unfortunate; their town was burned by the Indians, and after suffering every privation, they were shortly afterwards compelled to abandon the place. Previously to this event, Assumption, the capital of Paraguay, had been founded; and thither the wretched remains of the expedition retreated. A second armament was fitted out, and an attempt made to rebuild the town, in 1542; but it was overwhelmed by a calamity similar to that which had overtaken the former. The chief attention of the Spaniards was for some time directed to forming settlements in Paraguay, in order to facilitate their communication with the mines of Peru, where Pizarro and his successors were gathering in a golden harvest. Contentions with the Indians were frequent and bloody, for the inhabitants of the vast plains upon either bank of the La Plata proved much more difficult to subdue than the timid and tractable Peruvians.

It was not until the year 1580 that the Europeans succeeded in their attempts to found a town upon the site chosen by Mendoza. Before this period, however, they had established themselves at Santa Fe, Mendoza, and some other places in the interior; so that, as Dr Southey observes, the history of this part of South America differs from that of any other colony in one remarkable circumstance: The first permanent settlement was formed in the heart of the country, and the Spaniards colonized from the interior towards the sea. But they were not permitted quietly to enjoy the success of their third attempt to found Buenos Ayres.
[7:18:2]

Stimulated by the recollection of their previous triumphs in demolishing the works of the invaders on the same ground, the Indians once more attacked it, and were so far sueeessful as to set fire to the tents and temporary erections of the settlers. Their leader, however, being slain, they were compelled to retreat with loss; and before they were in a eondition to renew the work of demolition, the town was so well fortified and garrisoned as to bid defianee to their efforts. Again the leader of the savages fell, and his force was completely defeated and put to flight. From this period the eity began to prosper, and the ship which earried to Castille the intelligenee of its refoundation took home a cargo of sugar, and the first hides with whieh Europe was supplied from the wild eattle which now began to overspread the eountry, and soon produced a total change in the manners of all the adjoining tribes. The immense pampas of La Plata appear to have been originally stoeked with cattle from a few which had been brought by the earliest settlers; and so rapidly had they multiplied, that, about the year 1610, no less than a million is said to have been driven from the country in the neighbourhood of Santa Fe into Peru.

In the year 1620 Buenos Ayres was erected into a bishoprie; but for nearly two eenturies it eontinued to be a place of little note, and eomparativcly scanty population. From the first period of the eolonization of this country till the year 1778, the government was dependent on that of Peru, although the ehief of Buenos Ayres had the title of captain-general. A false idea of what constitutes wealth led Spain to estimate the value of her possessions by the number and riehness of their mines of gold and silver; and Buenos Ayres being deficient in these, its more solid advantages of a fertile soil and a salubrious elimate were consequently overlooked. The pernieious system of political economy practised by Spain towards her eolonies was the main cause why this city remained for such a length of time almost entirely unknown to Europeans. Apprehensive lest commodities might be introduced into Peru by way of Buenos Ayres, and thus prejudice the sale of the eargoes imported by the fleets whieh they sent to Panama, the early traders solicited and obtained from the government the prohibition of every kind of eommerce by the Rio de la Plata. Those whom this measure most nearly affeeted put in a strong remonstrance against it, and were so far successful that, in 1602, permission was granted them to export for six years, in two vessels belonging to themselves, and on their own account, a certain quantity of flour, tallow, and jerked beef, but only to two ports. Upon the expiration of the term an indefinite prolongation was soli- . cited, with an extension to all kinds of merchandise, and liberty to trade also with other ports. This application was vehemently opposed; but notwithstanding, in the year 1618, the inhabitants of the shores of the Rio de la Plata were authorized to fit out two vessels, not exceeding one hundred tons burden each. Several other vexatious restrictions were imposed on them; and, to prevent any traffic with the interior of Peru, a custom-house was established at Cordova del Tucuman, where a duty of fifty per cent, was levied upon all imports. This custom-house was also designed to prevent the transmission of the precious metals from Peru to Buenos Ayres, even in payment for mules fur- . nished by the latter city. By an order of 1622 this permis- . sion was prolonged for an indefinite period; and, with a view to promote the prosperity of the country, a royal audience was established at Buenos Ayres in 1665.

Under such a miserable system of policy, it is not surprising that the provinces of the Rio de la Plata languished in indigence and obseurity. But the resources of so extensive and fertile a territory could not remain for ever concealed. As the population and wealth of the country increased, the continual remonstrances of the people at last opened the eyes of the Spanish government to the importance of the colony, and a relaxation took place in the system of commereial monopoly, which had hitherto been rigorously adhered to. Indeed the absurd restrictions had been followed by their natural eonsequence, smuggling; and to sueh a height was the eontraband trade carried, that, in order to put a stop to it, the government of Castille gave permission to register ships to sail under a license from the eouneil of the Indies at any time of the year. The flota which hitherto had embarked from Spain once a year, and was the only legitimate means of communication with Ameriea, dwindled away from 15,000 to 2000 tons of shipping; and in 1748 it sailed for the last time to Cadiz, after having carried on the trade of Spanish America for two centuries. The register-ships now supplied the market with European eommodities at a cheaper rate and at all seasons of the year; and from that time Buenos Ayres gradually rose into importance. Other relaxations in the mercantile system followed soon afterwards. In the year 1774 a free trade was permitted between several of the American ports; and this was subsequently followed by additional liberties.

The improvements which took place in Buenos Ayres by this enlargement of its commercial relations were frequently interrupted by circumstances which carry us back to an early period of its history. The Spaniards and Portuguese have, by a singular coincidence, been destined to be rivals, not only in the Old, but in the New world. The neighbouring territory of Brazil belonged to Portugal, and bitter hostilities frequently took plaee between the two countries. It is computed that, in the hostile incursions which the Brazilians made into the Spanish possessions in this quarter of America, they destroyed upwards of four hundred towns and villages. These marauders, bom of Portuguese, Dutch, Freneh, Italian, and Brazilian women, were called Mamelucos. Their principal objeet was to earry into slavery the Indians whom the Jesuits had partially civilized; and in exercising their inhuman trade they committed the most horrid enormities. It is asserted, that in one hundred and thirty years two millions of Indians were slain or carried into captivity by the Mamelueos of Brazil, and that more than one thousand leagues of country, as far as the river Marañon, were almost depopulated. It may well be believed that the settlements of the Rio de la Plata did not escape the same cruel devastation. But it does not appear that the acts of these marauders were authorized by the government which they professed to obey; for repeated decrees were passed in favour of the oppressed Indians. These, however, were seldom or never observed; and governors and others, who profited by the captivity and sale of the native tribes, winked at the traffic. But the rivalry and animosity of the Portuguese were productive of other evils besides those consequent on hostile incursions. We have alluded to an extensive contraband trade, originating, in the first instance, in the blind poliey of Spain. This was ehiefly carried on by the Portuguese, who were enabled, by means of the immense and thinly-inhabited territory of the Banda Oriental, to organize a system of smuggling which ultimately almost annihilated legitimate commerce. But the government having gained over Artigas, one of the most daring of the contrabandists, were at length enabled, with his assistance, to crush the illicit trade, and to put an end to the atrocities which it had inflicted on the country.

In the year 1778, the provinces of the Rio de la Plata, Paraguay, Tucuman, Los Chareos, and Chiquito, were erected into a viceroyalty, of which Buenos Ayres was constituted the capital. At the same time it was thrown open to free trade of every description, even with the interior of Peru; and such was the effect of this wholesome measure, that the number of vessels trading with South America was at onëe augmented from fifteen to one hundred and seventy. They kept gradually increasing from year to year; and, in 1796, sixty-three vessels from Old Spain alone [7:18:3] arrived in the single port of Buenos Ayres, with cargoes valued at nearly three millions of piastres; and fifty-one sailed from it for the mother country, fourteen to the Havannah, and eleven to the coast of Africa. The value of the exports was about five millions and a half of piastres, including upwards of four millions in gold and silver. During the war which broke out between Great Britain and Spain, the trade of this colony suffered severely; indeed for a time it was all but annihilated. Immense quantities of hides and other native productions, pent up in the warehouses of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video, were allowed to rot, there being no outlet for them; whilst at the same time many kinds of European goods rose to exorbitant, prices, or were not to be procured at any cost. This situation of affairs afforded the people of the United States of North America an opportunity of carrying on a contraband trade, by which the inhabitants of the provinces of the Rio de la Plata were supplied with European commodities; and this traffic was connived at by the Spanish government. The fortune of war, however, in a few years placed Buenos Ayres for a short time in the hands of the British, and an end was put to the trade with the great western republic.

In the year 1806, a British squadron, under the command of Sir Home Popham, appeared in the Rio de la Plata. From this armament a body of troops was landed, for the purpose of taking the capital. The British force was small, but, by the culpable negligence of the viceroy, the Marquis de Sombre Monte, who does not appeal· to have made any attempt to defend this important city, General Beresford accomplished his object on the 26th of June. This rash and unauthorized enterprise was fortunate in the first instance, but exceedingly disastrous in its issue. The viceroy having retired to Cordova, Don Santiago Liniers, a Frenchman in the service of Spain, put himself at the head of all the troops he could collect on both banks of the Plata, and on the 12th of August attacked the city at several points. So vigorous and successful was the assault, that the British general and his troops were compelled to surrender themselves prisoners of war. The disgraceful retreat of the viceroy having completely alienated from him the esteem of those over whom he ruled, they accordingly stripped him of his authority, and made the most strenuous efforts to obtain the office for Liniers, but without success. He was covered with honours, but a new viceroy arrived from Spain. Never was there a more favourable opportunity for these provinces entirely throwing off the yoke of the mother country; but no spirit of revolt existed in the country. The fact is, that, at the period of this invasion, Spain nowhere possessed more faithful subjects than those who peopled the banks of the Rio de la Plata. There cannot be a doubt, however, that this successful repulse of an enemy common to both, taught the people of Buenos Ayres “a deep lesson ;” and it ought to be regarded as the first step to that revolution in which the power of Spain in America was completely overthrown.

In the mean time, British reinforcements arrived from the Cape of Good Hope, whence the original expedition had sailed; and Sir Home Popham, after making an unsuccessful attempt on Monte Video, took Fort Maldonado, at the mouth of the river Plata. But the intelligence of the first capture of Buenos Ayres was so well received by the British public, that government resolved on maintaining possession of the banks of the Plata; and an armament was therefore fitted out for effectually reducing the country. The first body of troops, which were commanded by Sir Samuel Auchmuty, enabled the British to undertake the conquest of Monte Video, which was carried by storm in February 1807. In May following, General Whitelocke arrived at the head of a formidable force; and about a month afterwards these were joined by a further reinforce ment under General Crawford. The army now amounted to 8000 men, and the chief command was confided to General Whitelocke, a man destitute alike of courage and ability. The reduction of Buenos Ayres was now resolved upon; but if the British had acquired sufficient local and political knowledge of the coun!⅜y, they would never have attempted the conquest of that city. The attacking army sailed up the river, and, disembarking below the capital, marched towards it, but met with a reception which was little anticipated. The inhabitants of Buenos Ayres had made every preparation for a desperate resistance. The streets were intersected by deep ditches, defended by cannon, and the windows and house-tops were thickly planted with armed men. No sooner had the British troops begun to penetrate the streets in columns, than they were assailed by grape and musketry, under which they perished in great numbers, without being able to retaliate on the citizens. The cool, determined valour of the troops, and the heroic energy of the leaders of the several columns, were exerted in vain. About one third of the British army was either killed, wounded, or taken prisoners, without any material advantage having been gained. In these circumstances, it would have been madness to persist in such a mode of operation; and next day an armistice was concluded. A convention followed, the terms of which were, that the British should evacuate the possessions on the Plata in two months, and that all prisoners taken on both sides should be restored. By this capitulation, Monte Video, which might have been safely maintained against any enemy, and which would have afforded a secure dépôt for our manufactures, was alsö lost.

But the events which were now passing on the continent of Europe were destined to change completely the aspect of affairs in South America. The unprincipled invasion of Spain by Napoleon in 1808 had placed that country in a situation extremely critical. Ferdinand VII., in concert with the emperor, had intrigued to wrest the sceptre from the feeble hands of his father; the French everywhere overran the Peninsula, and numerous petty juntas were formed. These began to extend their authority to the colonies, and despatched several mandates to the New World, demanding implicit obedience to the resolutions which they contained. As far as possible, the provinces of the Rio de la Plata conformed to their dictates, and sent money and supplies of various kinds to repel the attempts of the French, a nation peculiarly offensive to them.

Whilst the public mind at Buenos Ayres was thus kept in a state of excitement by the aggression of Napoleon, the transfer of the court of Lisbon to the Brazils inspired the princess regent of Portugal with the ambition of establishing herself in a similar manner at Buenos Ayres. Her father and her brother having at Bayonne renounced their right to the crown of Spain, she despatched emissaries to La Plata to assert her contingent claim, and to concert measures for her residence in the capital. Her proposals were received with enthusiasm, not only by the people, but also by the most influential persons of the country. But when her projects were on the point of being crowned with success, they were rendered abortive by the arrival, in May 1809, of the viceroy Cisneros, who, having touched at Monte Video in ascending the river Plata, there concerted measures with the governor-general, Elio, who, like himself, was a staunch supporter of the rights of Ferdinand. In the mean time Napoleon, having turned his attention to the colonies of Spain, had, like the princess already mentioned, sent an emissary to Buenos Ayres to gain over the inhabitants. Liniers, whom the course of events had brought prominently forward, is said to have secretly favoured the interests of France; but he was deposed from all authority, and banished to Cordova. In no instance was Napoleon successful in seducing the American colonies from [7:18:4] Spam, although it is perfectly evident that the doubtful nature of their allegiance, thus brought palpably before them, was well calculated to afford a plausible pretext for their adopting measures to secure their own individual independence, should circumstances hold out a well-grounded hope of success. These were not long in arriving.

Cisneros, the new viceroy, exerted himself to the utmost to fulfil the orders of the court of Madrid, and to close the ports of the Plata against British traders, who, in spite of reiterated prohibitions, continued to land their goods. An intelligent native of the name of Don Mariano Moreno addressed a pamphlet to the viceroy, demonstrating the necessity of re-modelling antiquated institutions, no longer compatible with national prosperity. The enlightened views of Moreno, though strongly opposed by the privileged merchants of Cadiz and Buenos Ayres, were generally favoured by his countrymen, and the necessity of a relaxation of the prohibitory system, as the only means of replenishing the exhausted treasury, at length compelled the reluctant acquiescence of Cisneros.

From this period the principal supporters of the Princess Cariota changed their views, and formed plans of ultimately setting up the standard of independence. After some political struggles, they succeeded in deposing the viceroy, and, on the 25th of May 1810, named & junta gubernativa, composed of nine members, with Don Cornelio de Saavedra as their president, and Dean Funes and Don Mariano Moreno as their secretaries.^[1. Memoirs of General Miller, vol. i. p. 60.]

Moreno, the secretary, possessing a genius fitted for the times, became the life and soul of the new government. As the eyes of the people in the provinces were opened to the daring nature of the step which had been taken, the authority of the junta became more and more circumscribed, and was soon reduced to the limits of Buenos Ayres. Monte Video did not recognise it at all. As the port of this city contained a naval dépôt, there were there concentred a greater number of civil and military officers, who, being Spaniards, immediately took alarm, and decisive measures were adopted to prevent the heresy from spreading beyond the limits of Buenos Ayres, if not to crush it there. But the Creoles viewed the matter very differently. They assembled at the municipality, and unanimously resolved that it was expedient to join the party in the capital. But this wise resolution was rendered abortive by the precaution of the governor, Elio, and by the address and intrigue of an individual, Dr Obes by name, whose ambition was the original cause of the misfortunes which befell the Banda Oriental. He succeeded in drawing over many of his countrymen to his own views; and ultimately an answer was transmitted to Buenos Ayres, the purport of which was, that the Monte Videans could not give in their allegiance to an authority not appointed in a legitimate way by the nation. But Moreno was nothing dismayed by this intelligence, and his measures became more decisive as the emergency increased. He succeeded in expelling the viceroy and the oidores from the country; and had not the junta itself become infected by schism, such a man at the head of affairs would have soon brought matters to an issue. It became impossible for the junta to exist in its then disjointed state. Moreno and his party withdrew; and he having accepted a mission to England, unfortunately died on his passage.

The people of Buenos Ayres having so far succeeded in establishing their independence, considered themselves powerful enough to proselytize in the provinces. A division of patriots under Ocampo was sent against Cordova, where a formidable faction opposed to the new order of things had been organized by Liniers; and this leader was taken prisoner and shot, along with several other influential persons. Such severe measures, however, not harmonizing with the moderate views of Saavedra and the junta, Ocampo was recalled, and the chief command intrusted to Don Antonio de Balcarce. The history of La Plata is now for some years closely interwoven with that of Upper Peru. In September 1811 the junta gubernativa at Buenos Ayres was dissolved, and Saavedra the ex-president compelled to fly. An executive was thereupon vested in the hands of a triumvirate, Don Manuel Sarratea being its head. Monte Video still stoutly maintained the sinking cause of Spain; the effort was unavailing. Twice the soldiers of the fortress, in attacking the soldiers of Buenos Ayres, were driven back. In one of these the noted Artigas displayed his characteristic heroism, and at the head of his brave Gauchos performed prodigies of valour in the patriot cause. But he had long displayed symptoms of insubordination. About this period he withdrew from the command of Rondeau, and, in acting independently, evinced ever afterwards great dislike to the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres. In October 1812 another change was effected in the government, and in the January following a sovereign constituent assembly was convened at Buenos Ayres. It was not until now that the Spanish flag and cockade were abolished, and replaced by the bicolor. Now also the coinage bore the republican arms. The assembly elected an executive consisting of three individuals, and Don Carlos Alvear was chosen president of the assembly. But this form of government was as short-lived as any that had preceded it. On the 31 st of December 1813 it was abolished, and Señor Posadas was elected supreme director of the republic, with a council of seven to act along with him.

Monte Video, which still held out for the mother country, was soon afterwards taken, when between 5000 and 6000 royalist troops laid down their arms, and an immense quantity of military stores was likewise given up. But the refractory Artigas, who had assumed the title of chief of the Banda Oriental, demanded possession of the place, which being refused, he in a short time took it by force, and retained possession of the fortress until a Brazilian army ejected him in the year 1817. The mutations and changes which the government of Buenos Ayres underwent we need not follow; and the civil dissensions by which the country was afflicted are equally endless and uninteresting. In 1816 a new congress met at Tucuman, which named Pueyrrcdon director of the republic; in July it declared the countries .on the Plata independent, and, having transferred its sessions to Buenos Ayres, issued a declaration,^[2. Manifestation ĭùstŭrìca y politica de la Revolution de la America, Octr. 25.] containing a list of twenty-eight articles. This remarkable document describes the cruelties which the united provinces of the Rio de la Plata, as well as other parts of America, had endured, whilst under the yoke of Spain, and the motives which led them to shake it off.

The republic now assumed the title of the United Provinces of South America, and on the 3d of December 1817 it proclaimed a reglamento prow,sorio, as preliminary to a constitution. The congress chosen in compliance with the reglamenü) was opened in February 1819, and on the 25th of May the new constitution was published; but it afterwards underwent many important changes. It was on the model of that of the United States, and secured personal freedom and equality, liberty of conscience and of the press, and the right of suffrage. The country, however, still continued in a disturbed state, and these troubles were increased by the intrigues of France and Austria to impose upon the natives of Buenos Ayres a Bourbon or an Austrian prince; but the latter were happily defeated by the good sense and patriotism of the people, notwithstanding the an [7:18:5] archy which had reduced them to the brink of destruction. To enumerate the factions which successively got the upper hand at Buenos Ayres, or to describe their various intrigues to maintain themselves in power, would be to draw a most disgusting picture of the reign of anarchy. Numerous successive governors seized upon office, and retained it but for a few weeks, and in some instances for a still shorter period. These rapid changes were generally preceded by sanguinary struggles, and followed by banishments and proscriptions; but in no instance was confiscation of property resorted to, so far had public opinion wrought an improvement. In October 1833 an attempt was made to effect a revolution in Buenos Ayres, and in June of the year following the government resigned spontaneously. The internal provinces were as usual the theatre of petty dissensions and skirmishes. In March 1835 the chamber elected General Don Rosas governor and captain-general of the province of Buenos Ayres for five years; giving him extraordinary powers, whilst he was at liberty to resign whenever he might judge fit, and only restricting him in one point, by obliging him to maintain and uphold the Catholic religion. The peace of the republic was disturbed throughout the year by petty insurrections, and by an attempt in the province of Tucuman to foment a revolution in favour of the Unitarians; but it was completely put down, and during the year 1836 the republic remained in a comparatively tranquil state. It is worthy of record, that on the 4th of December Spain acknowledged the independence of La Plata, and of all the other provinces in America which formerly belonged to her. Since then, up to the present time (1838), no event of any moment has occurred, with the exception of a declaration of war against Peru; but a peace was concluded between the two powers before any blood was shed on either side.

La Plata is situated between 20° and 38° or 39° of south latitude, and between 55° 36' and 7l 0 of west longitude. Its extreme length is about 1400 miles, and in breadth it varies from 500 to 800. It is bounded on the north by Bolivia; on the east by Paraguay, Uruguay, and the Atlantic Ocean; on the south by Patagonia and the Atlantic Ocean; and all along its western limits, the lofty ranges of the Andes separate it from Chili. In the northwest, the eastern declivities of the Andes project a considerable way forwards, so that this district, which comprises the provinces of Salta, Tucuman, Santiago, Mendoza, San Juan, Rioja, and Catamarca, is a high and rugged tableland. All the rest of La Plata constitutes one continuous plain, perhaps the most extensive and uniform in the whole world. The geology of this country presents little variety, and almost nothing that is interesting. Rocks are seldom seen, except in the mountainous region. Some gypsum occurs in the vicinity of Buenos Ayres, and limestone is said to occur in several places. The stones used in paving the streets, or in building, are brought from the island of Martin Garcia, at the mouth of the Uruguay, or as ballast in vessels from Europe.

Of the rivers, the principal is that which gives name to the region. The country, however, is traversed by several other large streams, the general bearing of which is to the south-east. Passing over the Pilcomayo, the Bermijo or Rio Grande, and the Salado, which have been described in the articles Paraguay and Parana, the next in importance is the Saladillo. The course and extent of this river are very imperfectly known. It appears to rise in the mountainous parts of Cordova, and after traversing the province of Buenos Ayres, it falls into the sea at Rosas, in the bay of Samborombon. The Tercero, which also rises in the province of Cordova, and falls into the Parana, has been proved to be navigable for barges as high as the Pass of Fe-reira, about thirty leagues below the city of Cordova.

Considerable light has recently been thrown on the hydrography of the southern portion of the Argentine Republic, by the publication of a journal kept by La Cruz, a Chilian gentleman, who, in the year 1806, undertook the command of an expedition which had for its object the discovery of a more direct means of communication between the southern provinces of Chili and Buenos Ayres, than the old one by Mendoza. An abridged account of the hydrographical facts which have resulted from this expedition we shall give in the language of an able writer.

“As we retrace his (La Cruz’s) route, proceeding from east to west (from the frontiers of Buenos Ayres towards the Andes), the first considerable body of water which we meet with is the Desaguadero of the Diamante, in the middle of the continent, fifteen leagues north of the lake in which it terminates, and which is many leagues farther south than has been hitherto supposed. We next find, at a very short distance, the Chadileubu, which rises in the cordillera of Melalgué, and flows into the Desaguadero. Proceeding some leagues farther, we come on the Cobuleubu, or Rio Colorado, making a bold circuit eastward through the Pampas, as it descends from the Andes near Maule, before it turns southwards to the sea. As we approach the Cordillera, we arrive at the Cudileubu and the Neuquen, the latter receiving the Tocoman and Reingui-leubu, all considerable rivers, the united waters of which, under the name of Mucum-leubu, flow southwards into the Rio Negro. The Neuquen and Cobuleubu both appeared to him to be navigable downwards from the place where he crossed them.

“Respecting the Limayleubu, which La Cruz frequently made the object of his inquiries, the accounts of the Indians were positive and distinct. All concurred in stating it to be the greatest river with which they were acquainted on the eastern side of the Andes; that it was nowhere fordable, and that it received the Neuquen, Cudileubu, and all the other rivers of the Eastern Andes northwards to the sources of the Rio Colorado. It issues, according to them, from a beautiful lake called Alomini, of great size; for the cacique Manguel had travelled a day and a half along its shores. It is situated between the Cordilleras Miguen and Quenuco, and has an island in the middle of it. The river Limayleubu is small at first, but is soon swelled by the accession of a great many streams, of which the last in order, as named by the Indians, is the Naguelguapi. This river springs, they said, not from a lake, but from a morass of the same name. Besides the lake" Alomini, the Indian chiefs also knew a lake called Guechulauguen, situated farther south, and the waters of which flow into the Limayleubu.”^[3. Edinburgh Review, No. cxxxi. p. 101-2.]

This account differs somewhat from those which were previously given by Falkner the Jesuit and others, and which have found their way into all geographies, and vitiated all maps, thus giving rise to extreme confusion. The conclusions to be deduced from the statements of La Cruz we give in the language of the writer just quoted.

“Thus it appears to us to be clearly established that the main branch of the Rio Negro rises in the lake Alomini, situated in the Cordilleras, east of Villarica; and that, issuing thence under the name of Limayleubu, and being joined by numerous streams, among others by the Naguelguapi, mentioned by Falkner, it soon becomes a great river, of considerable width, and nowhere fordable. It afterwards receives the Cariguenague, coming from the north, and lower down, the Mucumleubu, itself a great river; the numerous tributaries to which were crossed by La Cruz.

The latter river is evidently the Sanguel, or Reed River of Falkner. These united waters proceed southwards a short way, till, meeting the southern branch of the Rio Negro, they turn eastward to the ocean.”^[4. Edinburgh Review, No. cxxxi. p. 103.]

Numerous rivers take their rise in the eastern declivities of the Andes, and, after irrigating considerable tracts of country, are either absorbed by the soil or flow into inland lakes. Amongst these may be mentioned the Rio Dolce, which originates in the lofty mountains of Tucuman, and, after watering the capital of the same name, passing near Santiago del Estero, capital of the province so named, and traversing Cordova, is lost in a salt lake situated in that province, and called “lagunas saladas de los Porongos.” Lakes are distributed over the whole expanse of the Pampas, and some of them are of considerable size, one in Entre Rios being one hundred miles in length; but they cannot be said to correspond in grandeur to the other features of this region. The soil is almost everywhere impregnated with fossil salt; and the water of most of the lakes and pools is brackish and disagreeable to the taste. So plentifully is this saline matter distributed, that whole tracts of country are covered with its efflorescence. But a want of water is universally experienced; for, notwithstanding the number of lakes and inferior rivers, many of them disappear during the dry season. A growth of rushes overspreads their bottoms, serving as lairs for the pumas, who lie in wait for the cattle that, perishing of thirst, fly to the green stagnant water which lies on the marly surface, is as thick as refuse oil, and swarms with myriads of mosquitos.

The soil of this vast territory is a rich mould, perfectly free from stones, not one being seen on its surface for many hundred miles together. Though an uninteresting level, devoid of picturesque scenery, it is divided into regions different in climate and in produce. On leaving Buenos Ayres, and proceeding in a westerly direction, the first of these regions is covered for the space of 180 miles with clover and thistles, or artichokes; the second region, which extends for 450 miles, produces grass; and the third, which reaches the base of the cordillera, is a grove of low trees and shrubs. The first region varies in a striking manner with the seasons of the year. In winter the leaves of the thistles are large and luxuriant, and the whole surface of the country has the rough appearance of a turnip field. The clover in this season is extremely rich and strong, and amongst it the wild cattle graze at liberty. In spring the clover disappears, the leaves of the thistles droop along the ground, and the country has still the appearance of a rough crop of turnips. But in less than a month the whole region becomes a luxuriant wood of thistles in full bloom, and reaching ten or even eleven feet in height. Summer, however, is not over before another change takes place. The thistles suddenly lose their verdure and sap, their heads droop, the stems become black and dead, and being levelled by the pampero or hurricane, they are rapidly decomposed, when the clover rushes up, and all again becomes a sea of verdure. The second and third of these regions present nearly the same appearance throughout the year; for the trees and shrubs are evergreens, and the immense plain of grass only changes its colour from green to brown. Not a weed is to be found throughout its vast extent; and over its ever-verdant and luxuriant surface innumerable herds of cattle range at large. The region of wood is equally remarkable. The trees are not crowded; but in their growth such beautiful order is observed, that the traveller can gallop between them in every direction.^[5. Rough Notes taken during some rapid journeys across the Pampas and among the Andes. By Captain F. B. Head]

The tropical climate which prevails in the northern districts disappears more and more towards the south, so that snow and ice are not unknown. Upon the east coast the air is humid; rain, thunder, and violent storms are not unfrequent; but in the western district the atmosphere is so free from vapour, that at mid-day the planet Venus is often distinguishable in the heavens, and the drought is so great that dead bodies are actually parched into mummies. The climate of the Pampas is subject to a great difference of temperature in winter and summer, although the gradual changes are very regular. The winter is about as cold as November is in England, and the ground at sunrise is invariably covered with white frost; but the ice is very thin. In summer the sun is oppressively hot; and not only is manual labour suspended during the middle of the day, but even the wild horses and cattle are exhausted by it. The only great irregularity in the climate is the pampero, or south-west wind, which sweeps these plains with a velocity and a violence which it is impossible to withstand. These periodical visitations, however, produce beneficial effects, the weather being particularly agreeable after they have exhausted their fury; and, taken as a whole, the Pampas may be said to enjoy as beautiful and as salubrious an atmosphere as the most healthy parts of Greece and Italy, and without being subject to malaria. With regard to humidity, the atmosphere is not uniform at places under the same latitude. In the provinces of Mendoza and San Luis, or in the regions of wood and grass, the air is very dry, and there is no deposition of dew at night. But in Buenos Ayres a considerable quantity of moisture prevails in the atmosphere, probably from the vicinity of the place to the ocean.

The productions are gold and silver, copper, tin, lead, and iron (of which large masses are often found), saltpetre, selenite (which is used instead of glass for windows and lanthorns), marine salt, barrero (a loam impregnated with salt, and greedily devoured by sheep and oxen); and there are also numerous mineral springs, besides the saline lakes already mentioned, from which salt can be procured. In some parts of La Plata there are wooded tracts consisting of palms, cedars, and other trees; but from the Rio de la Plata to the Straits of Magelhaens, as well as throughout the most part of the Pampas, we find neither tree nor shrub. Of fruits there are sugar, vines, and others; of grains, wheat and maize are especially cultivated; melons, pumpkins, beans, potatoes, and vegetables of all sorts, are raised; as also rice, manioc, and a shrub resembling aloe, from the fibres of which ropes and cordage are made; ricinus, earth almonds, flax, hemp, rhubarb, indigo, vanilla, ipecacuanha, tobacco, cotton; monkshood, with which the Indians poison their arrows; St John’s wort, capaiva, and others.

This country has long been celebrated for the abundance of its cattle, oxen, horses, sheep, goats, asses, mules, and swine. The horses are both wild and tame, and the number of them, as well as that of the cattle, is immense. The inhabitants of the Pampas who superintend the herds are called Gauchos, an account of whom will be found in the article Buenos Ayres. Amongst the wild animals may be mentioned many species of large wild cats, the jaguar, cougar, chibi-guazo; puma, which may be said to represent the lion in the new world; different kinds of pole-cats, the zorillo, tajassu, tapir, armadillo, marten, wild dog, guanaco; chameleon, sometimes of an enormous size; monkey, deer, hare, rabbit, elk, rigua; many species of serpents, as the boa, rattlesnake, great waterserpent, viper, adder; crocodile, mosquito, wasp, ant, and so on. Amongst the birds of this country may be mentioned the white raven, the gold-coloured sparrow, the partridge as large as a domestic fowl, the ostrich, pigeon, wild turkey goose, and some others. There are seven kinds of bees [7:18:7] of which several produce honey that has a very considerable, and sometimes alarming effect, when taken in large quantities. Of fish there are sca-bream and gold-fish; crawfish, perch, shad; whales and seals, which yield train oil and fish-bone for exportation; sharks, eighteen thousand of their skins being annually exported; and turtles.

The inhabitants present the same national diversities here as in the other states of South America. Their number has been variously cstimatcd at from half a million to nearly three millions; a sufficient proof of the uncertainty which prevails regarding the exact amount of the population of La Plata. In the Weimar Almanack for 1838 they are stated at 2,024,995, viz. Creoles of Spanish descent, 600,000; Mestizoes, 600,000; Indians, “fideles,” 800,000; negroes, 25,000. Of aboriginal Indians there are numerous nations; but, as will be seen, the whole do not comprise a population at all commensurate with the varieties of distinct tribes. The Indians of the Pampas are said not to exceed eight or ten thousand souls.

La Plata consists of the following provinces, most of which have a capital city of the same name: Buenos Ayres, Cordova, Entre Rios, Corrientes, Catamarca, Mendoza or Cuyo, Rioja, Salta, Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe, San Juan, San Luis, Tucuman, and Tarija. Missioncs is sometimes reckoned a province of La Plata, but it now belongs to Paraguay. Buenos Ayres, the capital, having already been described, we shall pass on to the other provinces.

Cordova is bounded on the north by Santiago, on the south by the Indian territory and Buenos Ayres, on the east by Santa Fe, and on the west by San Luis. It extends about 110 leagues from north to south, and about the same distance from east to west. This is a fine province, the soil being rich and fertile, and well irrigated. It is pretty thickly set with trees, possesses excellent pasturage, and abounds in fine clover. Cordova, the capital of the province, is picturesquely situated in a deep valley, beside a river surrounded by mountains, in lat. 31. 15. south, long. 62. 40. west. It was founded in 1573, and became a place of considerable importance in the time of the Jesuits. In 1804 and 1810 attempts were made to render the river Tercero, which passes near Cordova, navigable from this point to its junction with the Parana; but the commerce of the country was too limited, labour too dear, and overland carriage too easy and cheap, to render this an eligible speculation, so that the attempt was abandoned. The population of the whole province has been estimated at 315,000.

Entre Rios is situated between the two great rivers Parana and Uruguay, and is bounded on the north by the province of Corrientcs, and on the south by Buenos Ayres. It possesses several peculiar advantages, and is one of the most fertile and pleasing provinces in the whole republic. Embraced on all sides but one by the two great rivers just named, it is easily accessible by shipping; and being thus insulated, it is protected from the incursions of the Indians. It is copiously irrigated, and the soil is distinguished for its fertility. Wood is abundant, but small in size. The pastures are extensive; but the wild cattle, which formerly abounded, are much reduced in number. There are two small towns in the province, each of which is dignified with the name of city; one is Badaja, opposite to Santa Fe, on the Parana, the other is Villa del Arroyo de la China, on the Uruguay. Farther south, and nearer to Buenos Ayres, there are two other towns, called respectively Gualeguay and Gualeguaychu, but they are still smaller than the two former. The great natural advantages of Entre Rios must ultimately raise it into a place of considerable importance. At present the population is computed at 105,000.

Corrientes is situated to the north of Entre Rios, and forms a continuation of that province, being also situated between the rivers Parana and Uruguay. On the north it is bounded by the state of Paraguay. It has an average breadth of about two hundred miles, and its length may exceed that, though the boundary line between it and Entre Rios has not been laid down with accuracy. The territory of Corrientes is intersected by several rivers, some of which are navigable for a considerable distance. Besides the celebrated lake Ybera, there are in the province numerous sheets of water, by which it is rendered one of the most fertile countries on the face of the globe. Corrientes, the capital, is admirably situated on the banks of the Parana, near its junction with the Paraguay. It is a very ancient city, but the population is inconsiderable. That of the whole province is estimated at 140,000.

Santa Fe is situated between the river Parana and Cordova, which constitute its boundaries on the east and the west. On the south it is bounded by Buenos Ayres, and on the north by Santiago del Ostero. This fertile country is irrigated by numerous rivers, some of which are of considerable size. The chief employment of the inhabitants consists in the breeding of vicumras and horses, the skins of which animals are conveyed to Buenos Ayres. Santa Fe, the capital, is situated on the western part of the Parana, at about eighty leagues from Buenos Ayres, and has risen to importance by becoming a dépôt for goods on the river. The inhabitants of the town amount to about 4000, and those of the province to about 52,500.

San Luis is bounded on the east by the provinces of Buenos Ayres and Santa Fe, on the west by Mendoza, on the south by the territory of the Pampas Indians, and on the north by Cordova. This province is reckoned about a hundred leagues in extent from north to south, and from fifty to sixty in breadth from east to west. The soil is uniformly productive, and the climate is salubrious, but the inhabitants are very indolent, and agriculture is not pursued to any extent. San Luis, the capital, is a very ancient town, and the only place of any importance in the journey between Buenos Ayres and Mendoza. It is situated in a fertile valley at the foot of a range of hills, and the entrance to it is through long lanes, having dead mud-walls on either side. The population of the town has been estimated at 15,000, and that of the province at 103,000.

Mendoza or Cuyo is a well-irrigated and fertile plain, bounded on the east by San Luis, on the west by the cordillera of the Andes, on the north by San Juan, and on the south by the Indian territory. From north to south it extends about a hundred and fifty leagues, and from east to west rather more than a hundred leagues. The inhabitants of this province are very industrious, and they raise wheat and maize for exportation. Their chief occupation, however, is the cultivation of vines and clover grass. A considerable quantity of wine is made, in which article an extensive trade is carried on, and also in brandy and dried fruits. One of the most productive branches of commerce is the transport of maté to the various provinces of the republic. Mendoza, the capital of the province, is a large town, situated in an extensive and well-cultivated plain at the foot of the Andes, between 32° and 33° of south latitude. Its most remarkable feature is a fine alameda, or public promenade, of great length and beauty. The town covers a considerable space of ground, as there is generally a vineyard, orchard, and garden attached to every house. The population of the city is estimated at 16,000. There are several other towns of some note, such as San Carlos, to the south, in the valley of Uco; Coricouto, to the east; and another in the same direction, eleven leagues from the city, called Los Barriales. Over the whole country there are numerous establishments and farms for breeding cattle and prosecuting various agricultural operations. The population of the entire province may be estimated at 103,335.

San Juan is situated to the north of Mendoza, extending [7:18:8] about a hundred and twenty leagues from north to south, and about the same distance from west to east, terminating, like Mendoza, at the foot of the Andes. The country is remarkably fertile, producing wheat, maize, olives, and vines, in abundance. The produce of the olive plantations is much esteemed in Buenos Ayres; but the natives direct their attention chiefly to the cultivation of the vine, which grows luxuriantly, and to the making of wines and brandies, which they export in large quantities as far as Potosi, Buenos Ayres, Santa Fe, and a great portion of the eastern side of the Rio de la Plata. The city of San Juan, situated in latitude 31. 15. south, and longitude 68. 35. west, was founded as early as 1560, and is consequently one of the most ancient places in the republic. It is now considered as the town which most closely follows Buenos Ayres in the march of social reform. The mines of gold and silver which were said to enrich this province have never yet been discovered. The population of the city of San Juan is estimated at 19,000, that of the whole province at 103,330.

Rioja is situated to the north of San Juan, and also at the foot of the Andes. It is about one hundred and forty leagues in length, by nearly the same in breadth. Like the other provinces in this region, it is a mountainous tableland; and it shares with Mendoza and San Juan in the growth of vines, wheat, and maize. Rioja, the capital, is a small and unimportant city, situated in latitude 28.30. south, and longitude 68. 35. west, two hundred and ninety leagues from Buenos Ayres. It contains about 3000 inhabitants; and the population of the entire province is reckoned at 87,500 souls.

Catamarca is a tract of country extending about one hundred leagues in length and nearly as much in breadth. It is situated near the foot of the Andes, under the twentyeighth degree of south latitude, and is bounded by Tucuman and Salta on the north and east, by the Andes on the west, and by Rioja on the south. It consists of a mountainous table-land, but is noted for an extensive and fruitful valley, called the Valley of Catamarca. The temperature of this district is of the most genial description, and the country produces cotton of a very superior quality. The city of Catamarca is situated about sixty leagues south-east of Tucuman, in latitude 27. 45. south, and longitude 66. 0. west. It was founded more than a century and a half ago, and stands in the beautiful valley which bears its name. It contains about five thousand inhabitants. The other towns in this province are unimportant. The population of the whole province is estimated at 105,000 souls.

Tucuman, one of die most important and fertile provinces in the republic, is situated in the twenty-seventh degree of south latitude, having Salta on the north, and Santiago on the south and south-west, and extending fifty-eight leagues from north to south, and about fifty leagues from east to west. The rice which is called de castilla grows here in abundance, and is of a very superior quality. The other productions are, wheat, maize, ground pistachio-nuts, and tobacco, of which thousands of bales are exported to Cordova, San Luis, San Juan, Mendoza, and other cities. Fruits of various sorts are abundant; and potatoes here attain an enormous size. To the west of the city is a delightful mountain, of great height, from which sixteen rivers descend to fertilize and beautify the surrounding territory. These streams unite and form the river Santiago del Estero. Along all the lower parts of this mountain are immense clusters of trees, and amongst them many of bitter oranges. The city is surrounded by these woody tracts, which occupy a space of fifteen leagues. The trees sometimes attain an extraordinary size, and the timber is of the best quality used in America. Tucuman, the capital of the province, is a straggling city, situated in 26. 5Ò. of south latitude, and 64. 35. of west longitude. The houses in ge neral are of an inferior description; but the place is memorable from its having taken a distinguished part in the revolutionary struggle. The inhabitants, who amount to ten or twelve thousand, are described as hospitable, honourable in their dealings, of a mild disposition, and much inclined to labour. The other towns are Monteros, Suares, Chiqui-ligasta, Rio Chico, Francas, and Burroyaco, each of which constitutes a large parish, at the same time that it contains minor parishes. The population of the whole province is estimated at 140,000 souls.

Salta is situated to the north of Tucuman, and is of considerable extent. Its western part belongs to the great range of the Cordilleras, and is rich in metals. Here are found gold and silver, copper, iron of various qualities, sulphur, alum, vitriol; and there are also indications of the existence of tin and quicksilver. Many branches of mountains, off-shoots from the colossal chain of the Andes, extend into the province, from which proceed pleasant and beautiful valleys, intersected by numerous streams which irrigate and fertilize the country. In one of the intervals between the low collateral branches of the Andes is situated the capital. To the eastward of the city the country becomes flat, and continues so to the borders of the Bermijo and Parana. The city of Salta, the capital of the province, is situated in lat. 24. 15. south, and long. 64. 0. west, on the great road leading from Buenos Ayres to Lima by the way of Potosi. It was founded in 1582, and has long been a place of some consideration in this thinly-peopled region. The population amounts to about 9000 souls. The other towns in the province are Caldeva, Rosania de la Frontera, Rosario de SerriIIos, Chicoana, Atua, and a few small villages. The population of the whole province is estimated at 140,000 souls.

Santiago del Estero is situated between Tucuman and Cordova, being south of the former and north of the latter. It is of great extent in all directions, and is one of the most fertile of these provinces. Agriculture is the chief occupation of the inhabitants of Santiago. Wheat produces eighty fold, and it requires little or no aid from art to raise this heavy crop. All kinds of grain may here be brought to perfection, yet the inhabitants are slow to avail themselves of the advantages presented by nature. The city of Santiago, situated on the road to Bolivia through Cordova, in 27. 55. south latitude, and 63. 20. west longitude, is thinly peopled, and of little importance. The river Santiago runs close past it in its course to the great lake by which its waters are absorbed. The population of the whole province is estimated at 210,000 souls. This province, along with those of Tucuman and Cordova, are all bounded on the east by that vast territory called Grand Chaco, extending hence to the river Parana. It is the native country of the Abipones, and once contained 2,000,000 of aboriginal inhabitants. The Spaniards formed several establishments here, but their cruelties drew down upon them the vengeance of the Indians, who effected their extirpation. The inhabitants of the Grand Chaco, although now very much reduced in number, still retain their independence.

Tarija is the most northerly province in the Argentine Republic, and consequently borders upon Bolivia, to which it in reality belongs, although politically it forms one of the provinces of the Rio de la Plata. It consists of a succession of charming valleys, with a delightful climate and a fruitful soil. Corn, maize, the yerba-maté of Paraguay, the cocoa, flax, and every necessary of life, are produced here in the greatest abundance. No part of America indeed seems to be superior to this district of Tarija; and the reason why it is so little known is, that, possessing no mineral treasures, and being inhabited merely by an agricultural people, the Spanish authorities never deemed it worthy of the slightest attention. To the south-east of this province lies Jujuy, [7:18:9] which, in the event of Tarija being permanently united with Bolivia, will be erected into a province of the Argentine Republic; indeed some recent writers reckon it such already. It is of much the same character as Tarija, having a very prolific soil, and producing abundance of similar productions. There are some mines of gold in this territory, but they have not been worked to advantage. The city of Jujuy lies on the road from Buenos Ayres to Upper Peru, and is a very old place. The whole district contains from 50,000 to 60,000 inhabitants.

Don Juan de Rosas was in 1835 appointed dictator of the republic for five years. There are four principal ministers, one for each of the foreign, home, finance, and war departments. The state religion is the Roman Catholic, which is under the direction of four bishops. The Jesuits, who nearly three fourths of a century ago were expelled from this and other parts of South America, have been allowed to return.

The commerce of the country, the state of education, and its moral aspect generally, will be found described in the article Buenos Ayres.

According to official accounts from Buenos Ayres, the finances stood thus on the 7th of April 1836: Income, 11,727,446 dollars; expenditure, 8,439,165 dollars; surplus, 3,288,281 dollars. On account of the public debt, 7,747,000 dollars fall to be deducted, thereby giving rise to a deficiency, which was covered by the sale of 1200 leagues of the states land. It appears, however, that these aceounts are little to be depended upon; for, according to the budget for 1837, the income was 12,000,000 dollars, and the expenditure 18,315,124 dollars, thus making a deficit of more than 6,000,000 of dollars. To cover these deficiencies, and wipe out the accumulated debt, it is proposed to obtain a native loan of 17,000,000 dollars. Altogether, the accumulated debt of the Argentine Republic amounts to 42,000,000 dollars.

The constitution of this federal republic has not yet been completely organized. The head state, tb,e seat of the congress or legislative assembly, is Buenos Ayrés. The number of senators amounts to forty-eight, and that of deputies to eighty-eight. The states are all at liberty to manage their own affairs, each having a governor, with subordinate functionaries. In all of them the principle of democracy is recognised, but practically it is more acted upon in some states than in others. Where the governor has great influence, either from his wealth or from other circumstances, he is frequently found to evince a distaste for legislative control. Occasionally, indeed, they openly avow themselves absolute; and as Buenos Ayres can exercise but a feeble authority over those provinces which are situated far in the interior, they are not always called to a strict account of their stewardship.

In conclusion, it may be observed, that ths union of the provinces forming this republic is far from being perfect. They exercise too much individual independence, and are too jealous of each other, and of the capital in particular, heartily to entertain common views for the general good. They are as yet but weakly cemented together, and a long period will elapse before they are fused into one homogeneous mass. This is no doubt in part owing to their being spread over a vast extent of country; but, when communication between distant parts becomes more easy and frequent, which it will be when the rivers are rendered properly navigable, so as to facilitate commerce, then a more complete amalgamation of the whole may confidently be anticipated.
