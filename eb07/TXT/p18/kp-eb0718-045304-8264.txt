PORTARLINGTON, a borough town, situated in King’s County and Queen’s County, Leinster, Ireland. It is 44 miles from Dublin, and is situated on the river Barrow, which divides it into two parts, and it consists principally of one long street, about two miles in length. The houses are generally large, and regularly built; but the town possesses neither commerce nor manufactures, nor is it situated on any high road of communication. The prosperity of the town depends on a greater proportion of gentry residing in it, than is generally to be found in towns of its size in Ireland; and also on the reputation of its schools. There are two Protestant churches, a Methodist, and Roman Catholic chapel. The borough possessed, before the year 1784, a large property; but the corporation in that year, and in the year 1802, conveyed over to Lord Portarlington, the patron of the borough, the whole of the property, which brings yearly to the noble proprietor L.800 sterling, and forwhich he pays to the corporation the sum of L.60 late Irish currency. The borough is governed by a sovereign, two bailiffs, and a recorder, and it returns one member to parliament. The population in 1821, amounted to 2877, and in 1831, to 3091.
