PURNEAH, an extensive district of Bengal, forming the north-western division of that province, and situated about the twenty-sixth degree of north latitude. Its boundaries are, to the north the Morung Hills, in the Nepaul territories; on the south Monghir and Rajemahl; on the east Dinagepoor; and on the west Tirhoot and Baglipoor. It is a fertile, compact, and well-watered flat, comprehending 5119 square miles, intersected by various streams, is extremely fertile, and abounds in luxuriant pastures, on which are fed remarkably fine cattle, which are employed in the work done by horses in Europe. These bullocks are of fine proportions, and of a large size, and very superior to the draught cattle in Calcutta. It produces also rice, oil, pulse, wheat, besides other vegetables; opium and saltpetre for foreign commerce; and valuable timber from the Morung forests, which is cut in hot weather, and floated dowr the rivers in the rainy season. It is also celebrated for it» sugar and indigo, the latter being one of its staple commodities; and it exports a considerable quantity of ghee, or butter of buffaloes, clarified. About 1796, from an official inquiry into the population of Purneah, it was found to contain 89,914 husbandmen holding leases, 22,324 artificers paying ground-rent, in 2784 villages, and on 2531 square miles. From official inquiries in Ĭ801, it was found to contain 1,450,000 inhabitants, in the proportion of seven Mahommedans to ten Hindus. The chief rivers are the Cosah and Muhanada. In 1722 Sief Khan was appointed governor of Purneah, with absolute power over that district, and with permission to conquer from the independent rajahs near him all the territory that he could. He accordingly made considerable additions to the territory during the twenty-seven years which he ruled over it; and whilst other parts were overrun by the Mahrattas, his dominions continued to increase in prosperity and in population. In 1749 the son-in-law of Aliverdy Cawn suc cceded, and he handed down the inheritance to his son. After various revolutions, the government devolved on an officer, Khadcm Hussein, who engaged in a war with the British, but was finally obliged to retire to Oude. The principal towns are Purneah and Tajepore. The former is pleasantly situated on the eastern bank of the Seraw River, and carries on a considerable trade. Long. 88. 23. E. Lat. 25. 45. N.
