PORTLAND, a town of Maine, one of the United States of North America. See Maine. Portland, an island on the coast of Dorsetshire, or rather a peninsula, since it is joined to the mainland by a lofty bank of pebbles, which runs parallel to the sea, about three miles in length. Within the beach is a small arm of the sea, called the Fleet, the passage over which, by a ferry, is the common communication with Weymouth, from which it is distant about three miles. The island is a solid mass of stone, peculiarly adapted for buildings of the first class; and the extracting it from the quarries, and placing it on vessels, form the chief employment of the inhabitants. The surface of the rock is covered with a soil, the herbage of which feeds a small race of sheep, celebrated for the delicate flavour of their flesh. Some cows are also kept, and a small part of the land yields corn, but not sufficient for the inhabitants. The parish comprehends seven hamlets. It has a church near the centre; and towards the south end is the well constructed light-house, so important to navigation. Portland road is a secure anchorage, and is defended by a small fort. Lat. of the light-house 50, 31.22. Long. 2. 26. 59∙ W. The population was in 1801, 1619; in 1811, 2079; in 1821, 2254; and in 1831, 2670.

Portland vase, a celebrated funeral vase, long in possession of the Barberini family, but which was purchased for a thousand guineas by the Duke of Portland, from whom it derived its present name. Its height is about ten inches, and its diameter where broadest six. There are upon it a variety of figures of most exquisite workmanship, in bas relief, of white opaque glass raised on a ground of deep blue glass, which appears black except when held against the light. It seems to have been the work of many years, and there are antiquarians who date its production several centuries before the Christian era; since sculpture was declining in excellence even in the time of Alexander the Great-
