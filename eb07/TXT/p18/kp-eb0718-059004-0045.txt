PRIVATEERS are a kind of men-of-war, fitted out and provided with military stores by private individuals; and the persons concerned, instead of pay, are permitted to retain their captures, allowing the admiral his share.

Privateers may not attempt any thing against the laws of nations; as to assault an enemy in a port or haven under the protection of any prince or republic, whether he be friend, ally, or neutral; and before a commission can be granted to any privateer, the commander is to give security, if the ship be not above 150 tons, in L.1500, and if the ship exceeds that burden, in L.3000, that the owners will make satisfaction for all damages which they shall commit in their courses at sea.

Besides these private commissions, there are special commissions for privateers, granted to commanders of ships and others, who take pay, are under a marine discipline, and, if they do not obey their orders, may be punished with death.
