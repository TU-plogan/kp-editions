PRINKIPO, the largest and most easterly of the Princeâ€™s islands. They are situated in the bay of Marmora, about a league distant from the coast of Asia Minor. It is abouta mile in length and half a mile in breadth, and contains what was formerly a considerable and well-built town, but which is now in a ruinous condition. The island was formerly inhabited by the French merchants, who have however abandoned it, owing to the brackishness of the water. It is now inhabited by Greeks, who support themselves by selling wine and provisions to the pleasure parties which arrive from Constantinople. Long. 28. 56. E. Lat. 40. 51. N.
