POTIPHAR, or Putiphar, an officer of the court of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and general of his troops, according to our translation, Le Clerc, and the version of the vulgate; but according to the Hebrew and Septuagint, the chief of his butchers or cooks. The Hebrew text, the Septuagint, and vulgate, call him Eunuch. But it is probable it in this place means only an officer of the king’s court, for he was certainly married and had children. We have no other account of him but what appears in Scripture.
