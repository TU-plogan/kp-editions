PROTOGENES, a celebrated painter, was a native of Xanthus, in Caria, and flourished 330 b. c., in the time of Alexander the Great, being the contemporary of Apelles. Protogenes lived principally in Rhodes, where he was held in little honour by his neighbours, until Apelles paid him a visit, and declared that Protogenes was only inferior to himself in one particular, that he bestowed too much pains in finishing his paintings. From that moment the reputation of Protogenes was established. His finest painting was that representing the grandson of Sol, whieh he took seven years to finish, having put on it four courses of colour, that it might be less liable to be obliterated by age. Having been placed in a temple at Rhodes, when the city was besieged by Demetrius, and the painting in danger of being destroyed, Demetrius is said to have retired rather than it should run any risk. It was afterwards carried to Rome and placed in the Temple of Peace, where it was destroyed by fire. There was a dog in this picture, whieh the painter wished to represent with foam at its mouth; but, after many vain attempts, he threw his brush in a fury at the spot, and by a strange accident produced the very effect he wanted. He also painted a satyr playing on the shepherd’s pipe, which is said tb have been very fine; likewise a portrait of Pythias the mother of the philosopher Aristotle, a Pan, and portraits of Alexander. He was the author of two books on painting.
