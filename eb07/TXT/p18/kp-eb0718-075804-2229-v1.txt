PYRRHO, the founder of a school of philosophy, was the son of Pleistarchus, a native of Elis, and flourished B. c. 336, in the time of Philip the Great. He was originally a painter, but subsequently devoted himself to the study of philosophy, having been the pupil of Anaxarchus, whom he attended to India. There he became acquainted with the magi of Persia and the gymnosophists of India. On his return to Greece he acquired great renown, and was presented by the Athenians with the freedom of their city. He lived to the age of ninety. Pyrrho was the chief advocate of the sceptical school of philosophy; and from him all those who adhered to such doctrines were called Pyrrhonists. He denied that it could be proved that there was any thing in itself just or unjust, honourable or dishonourable. He considered every action and event as indifferent, and carried this idea so far as to assert that he saw [7:18:759] no difference between life and death. It is said that he showed no fear of death when the vessel in which he was sailing was threatened with shipwreck, and pointed to a pig, which was feeding in the utmost unconcern, remarking, that such ought to be the security of the wise man. The principle of his philosophy was, that there existed no motive'for belief to which one cannot oppose a doubt of equal weight. Thus he affirmed nothing, and denied nothing. Amongst his disciples were Timon of Phlius, and Nausi-phanes, who taught Epicurus. The life of Pyrrho has been written by Sextus Empiricus, and by Diogenes Laertius.
