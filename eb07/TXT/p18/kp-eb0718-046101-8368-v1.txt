PORTSOY, a burgh of barony and a sea-port town, in the parish of Fordyce, and county of Banff. It is situated on a point of land, jutting into a small bay, of the same name, on the Moray Frith, and consists of a few streets, irregularly built. The harbour is small, but safe, and is capable ofadmitting vessels of 150 tons. The chief trade is in linen and thread, manufactured principally for the Aberdeen, London, and Nottingham trade. Grain is also shipped from the port, and there is a considerable trade arising from the herring fishing. Portsoy is famed for the serpentine, erroneously called Portsoy marble, which is quarried to a considerable extent near the town. It is beautifully variegated, and as it is susceptible of a high polish, it is much used for ornaments. There is also found the splendid variety of flesh-coloured granite, possessing Labrador feldspar, which is nowhere else to be found, except in Arabia, where it was first discovered. The population in 1821 amounted to 1,700, and in 1831 i , the population of the parish and burgh was 3,364.
