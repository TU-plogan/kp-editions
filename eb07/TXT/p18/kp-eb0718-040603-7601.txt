POPLAR, a parish of the county of Middlesex, in the hundred of Ossulton. It stands on the banks of the river Thames, and was formerly a hamlet in the parish of Stepney. It is extensive, and comprehends the Isle of Dogs, which was formerly a rich marsh, but is now in part converted into docks and canals. The construction of the West India Docks has of late years tended very much to increase the population, which consists chiefly of persons directly or in [7:18:407]directly connected with shipping. In that part of the parish known by the name of Blackwall is the largest private establishment for ship-building in the kingdom. In it there are also many manufactories for rope-making, anchor-forging, and preparing the several other component parts of vessels. There is also a commodious hospital for persons who have been in the service of the East India Company. The population amounted in 1801 to 4493, in 1811 to 7708, in 1821 to 12,223, and in 1831 to 16,849.
