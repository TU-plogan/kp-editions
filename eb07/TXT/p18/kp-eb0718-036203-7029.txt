POOGUL, a small town of Hindustan, in the province of Mooltan and district of Bikaneer, in the midst of a sandy desert. It has several brackish wells, and some reservoirs of good rain-water vaulted over with brick, from the sale of which to travellers parched with thirst the inhabitants derive a precarious income. They also rear camels and a few goats. It is twenty-four miles north-west of Bikaneer.
