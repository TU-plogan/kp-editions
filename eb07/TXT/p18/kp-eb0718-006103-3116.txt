PLUCHE, Antony, a celebrated French writer, was born at Rhcims in 1688; and having distinguished himself by his engaging manners and proficiency in the belles lettres, was appointed professor of humanity in the university of that city. Two years afterwards he obtained the chair of rhetoric, and was admitted into holy orders. The Bishop of Leon, informed of his talents, conferred upon him the direction of the college of his episcopal city. By his ’ industry and superior knowledge, a proper order and subordination were soon established in it; but some peculiar opinions respecting the affairs of the time disturbed his tranquillity, and obliged him to resign his office. The intendant of Rouen, at the request of the celebrated Rollin, intrusted him with the education of his son. Abbé Pluche having filled that situation with success and great honour to himself, left Rouen and went to Paris, where, by the patronage of some literary friends, and his own excellent writings, he acquired a distinguished reputation for learning. He published, 1. Le Spectacle de la Nature, in nine volumes 12mo. This work, which is equally instructive and entertaining, is written with perspicuity and elegance; but the form of dialogue which is adopted has rendered it somewhat prolix. The interlocutors are not distinguished by any striking or characteristic features; and though the author has given the conversations a pretty ingenious turn, and even some vivacity, yet now and then they assume the tone of the college. 2. Histoire dn Ciel, or History of the Heavens, in two vols. 12mo. In this performance we find two parts almost independent of each other. The first contains some learned inquiries into the origin of the poetical heavens. It is nearly a complete mythology, founded upon ideas which are new and ingenious. The second is the history of the opinions of philosophers respecting the formation of the world. The author shows the inutility, inconsistency, and uncertainty of the most esteemed systems; and concludes with pointing out the excellence and sublime simplicity of the Mosaic account. Voltaire called this work Fable du Cid. 3. De Linguarum Artificio, a work which he translated under the title of Le Mécanique [7:18:62]des Langues, in 12mo. In this treatise he proposes a short and easy method of learning languages, which is by the use of translations instead of themes or exercises. 4. Harmony of the Psalms and the Gospel,.or a translation of the Psalms and Hymns of the Church, with notes relative to the Vulgate, the Septuagint, and Hebrew Text, printed at Paris in 1764, in T2mo. In 1749, Abbé Pluche retired to Varenne St Maure, where he gave himself up entirely to devotion and study. Having become so deaf that he could not hear without the help of a trumpet, the capital afforded him little enjoyment. It was in this retreat that he died of an apoplexy, on the 20th of November 1761, at the age of seventy-three years. He possessed those qualities which form the scholar, the honest man, and the Christian; temperate in his meals, true to his word, an affectionate parent, a sensible friend, and a humane philosopher, he gave lessons of virtue in his life as well as his writings. His submission to all the dogmas of religion was profound. Some deists having expressed surprise that, in matters of faith, he should think and speak like the vulgar, his answer was, “I glory in doing so; it is infinitely more rational to believe the word of God, than to follow the glimmering lights of a reason which is limited and subject to error.”
