PODALIRIUS, son of Aesculapius and Epione, was one of the pupils of the centaur Chiron, under whom he made himself such a master of medicine, that during the Trojan war the Greeks invited him to their camp to check a pestilence which had baffled the skill of all their physicians. On his return Podalirius was shipwrecked upon the coast of Caria, where he cured of epilepsy a daughter of the king of the place. He fixed his habitation there; and built two towns, one of which he called after his wife Syrna. On his death, the Carians built him a temple, and paid him divine honours.
