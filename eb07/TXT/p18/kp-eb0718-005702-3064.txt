PLECTRUM, Greek, πληκrgoι, a small implement of wood, horn, ivory, metal, &c. employed to strike the strings of certain musical instruments used among the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Arabians. It was of various shapes, often consisting of a heart-shaped head, and a short handle. In some of the ancient Egyptian paintings at Thebes, are representations of a three-stringed guitar, with an oval body and long neck, having a plectrum attached by a string to the neck, close to its junction with the body. Several foreign stringed instruments are still played with a plectrum, and amongst them the Tamboora of Hindustan.
