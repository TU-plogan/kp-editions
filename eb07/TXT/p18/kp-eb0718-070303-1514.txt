PTOLMEY Soter, or Lagus, king of Egypt, a renowned warrior and an excellent prince. He established an academy at Alexandria, and was himself a man of letters. He died at the age of ninety-two, 281 years before Christ.

Ptolemy Philadelphus, his second son, succeeded him, to the exclusion of Ptolemy Ceraunus. He was renowned as a conqueror, but more revered for his great virtues and political abilities. He established and augmented the famous library of Alexandria, which had been begun by his father. He also greatly increased the commerce of Egypt, and granted considerable privileges to the Jews, from whom he obtained a copy of the Old Testament, which he caused to be translated into Greek, and deposited in his library. This is supposed to have been the version denominated that of the Septuagint. He died at the age of sixty-four, 246 years before Christ.

Ptolmey Ceraunus, the elder brother of the preceding, fled to Seleucus king of Macedonia, who received him hospitably; in return for which Ceraunus assassinated him, and usurped his crown. He then invited ArsinoÃ«, the widow and the sister of the murdered king, to share with him the government; but as soon as he got her in his power, he put her and her children to death. He was at length defeated, killed, and torn limb from limb, by the Gauls, 279 years before Christ.

Ptolmey, Claudius, a celebrated mathematician and astrologer, was born at Pelusium in Egypt. He flourished at Alexandria in the second century, under the reigns of Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius, about the 138th year of the Christian era. There are still extant his Geography, and several learned works on astronomy, the principal of which are, 1. The Almagest; 2. De Judiciis Astrologicis ; 3. Pla-nisphaerium. His system of the world was for many years adopted by philosophers and astronomers; but the learned have long rejected it for the system of Copernicus.
