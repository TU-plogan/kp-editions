PRIOR, in general, something before or nearer the beginning than another with which it is compared.

Prior more particularly denotes the superior of a convent of monks, or the next under the abbot.

Grand Prior is the superior of a large abbey, where several heads are required.

Prior, Matthew, an eminent English poet, was born at London in the year 1664. His father dying whilst he was very young, an uncle, a vintner, gave him some education at Westminster school, and then took him home to train him up to his own trade. However, at his leisure hours he prosecuted the study of the classics, particularly that of his favourite Horace. Through the influence of the Earl of Dorset he was sent to St John’s College in Cambridge, where, in 1686, he took the degree of bachelor of arts, and afterwards became fellow of his college. In 1710, he was supposed to have had a share in writing the Examiner. In 1711, he was made one of the commissioners of the customs; and was sent as minister plenipotentiary to France, for negotiating a peace with that kingdom. Soon after the accession of George I. to the throne of England in 1714, he presented a memorial to the court of France, requiring the demolition of the canal and new works at Mardyke. The year following he was recalled; and upon his arrival was seized by a warrant from the House of Commons, and strictly examined by a committee of the privy council. Mr Robert Walpole moved the House of Commons for an impeachment against him; and Mr Prior was ordered into close custody. In 1717, he was excepted out of the act of grace; however, at the close of that year he was set at liberty. The remainder of his days he spent in tranquillity and retirement, and died in 1721.
