PORT-PATRICK, a sea-port town and parish, on the west coast of Wigtonshire, at the distance of 133 miles from Edinburgh. It is situated on the shore of the Irish Sea, at the nearest point to Ireland, the distance being only twenty-one miles to Donaghadee∙ From this cause, as well as from being the best place for crossing between the two countries, steam packets and sailing vessels regularly sail between the two ports with the mails from Edinburgh, London, and Dublin. The town is not large, but it is beautifully situated, with a fine southern exposure, and encompassed on the other side by a ridge of small hills, which shelters it from the cold air of the sea. The climate is therefore salubrious, and on that account is much resorted to during the summer months for sea-bathing. The harbour was formerly small and inconvenient, but very extensive improvements having been carried on by the late Sir James Hunter Blair and by government, to render the harbour fit for shipments at all times of the tide, it has, especially its quay, been made one of the best in the kingdom. The chief trade arises from the importation of cattle and horses from Ireland. The population in 1821, amounted to 1818, and in 1831, to 2239∙
