PORT-GLASGOW, asea-port town of Scotland, is situated on the south bank of the Frith of Clyde, in the shire of Renfrew, about nineteen miles below Glasgow, and three above Greenock. This place originally formed part of the adjoining parish of Kilmalcolm, and consisted of the small village of Newark, so called from the barony of that name, which lay in its immediate vicinity. On a point of land projecting into the river, a little above the town, is situated the ancient and now deserted castle of this barony. The ground on which the town stands was, in 1668, purchased from Sir Patrick Maxwell of Newark, by the magistrates of Glasgow, with a view to provide a convenient harbour for the vessels belonging to the merchants of that city. A harbour was therefore constructed, and streets were laid off, according to a regular plan. In 1695 the place was, by the competent authority, detached from the parish of Kilmalcolm, and, with a few adjacent farms, erected into a distinct parish, approaching in form nearly to a square, and not exceeding an English mile either in length or in breadth. It was called New Port-Glasgow, or more commonly Port-Glasgow, a name simply expressing the design of its erection as the port or harbour of Glasgow. In 1775 it was created a borough of barony; and by the reform act of 1832 it became a parliamentary borough of the third class, uniting with Kilmarnock, Rutherglen, Dumbarton, and Renfrew, in returning a member.

Port-Glasgow is one of the most handsome and regularly built sea-port towns of Scotland. The streets arc straight, and for the most part cross each other at right angles; whilst the houses, pretty nearly equal in size, and generally whitewashed, give to the whole a light and uniform appearance. The only buildings worthy of particular notice are the town-house and the parish church. Of these the former is of plain but substantial workmanship, ornamented in front with a portico, resting on four massy fluted columns, surmounted with a handsome spire, which rises from the centre. The parish church was built in 1823. It is square in form, and plain in outward appearance, but is deservedly admired for the simple elegance of its internal construction. A commodious chapel of ease belonging to the establishment was built in 1774. The only other place of worship in the parish belongs to the Associate Synod.

The land of this parish church lies along the bank of the river, having been long occupied as gardens, presenting a rich and highly cultivated appearance. The town itself is romantically situated at the bottom of a hill, which, covered with wood and verdure, exhibits a beautiful object to travellers passing along the river.

Attached to this port are two capacious harbours, substantially built, and completely sheltered from the storm. The first dry or graving-dock in Scotland was constructed herein 1762, and has since been improved at great expense. Some years ago, the harbour accommodation having been found too small, the inhabitants resolved to avail themselves of their local advantages, by converting the bay of Newark, which is naturally adapted to the purpose, into a spacious dock, where vessels of the largest class might be kept securely afloat in every state of the tide. Accordingly, in June 1830, the trustees of the harbour obtained an act of parliament, investing them with the necessary powers; and the work, which was contracted for by Mr. Gibb, an eminent architect, was commenced in the spring of 1834, and carried on with every dispatch until 1836, when a small portion of the outer wall gave way. In consequence of this untoward incident, the operations were considerably impeded, and it was even deemed expedient to erect a ruble breakwater, to enable the trustees to restore the outer wall so soon as the works had been allowed sufficient time to consolidate. As a substitute for the outer wall, and in order to secure the full benefit of the wet-dock, the trustees have, in the mean time, resolved to construct a wooden wharf on the outside. The works having since been considered as sufficiently consolidated, and the inner walls having afforded abundant evidence of their stability, the necessary sheds, together with the wharfs alluded to, have lately been contracted for, and are at present in rapid progress; so that this important undertaking, which has cost its enterprising promoters about L.40,000, may now be considered as completed. Many ships have already discharged their cargoes in it. Besides the numerous sail of merchantmen at present, (December 1838), within its walls, there is the British Queen, steam-ship, (receiving her machinery), the largest vessel ever built in the United Kingdom. This is the only wet-dock of the kind on the west coast of Scotland. It extends over a space of twelve imperial acres, is 25 feet deep, has an entrance-gate of 55 feet in width, is provided with spacious quays and commodious sheds, cranes, and other conveniences, and possesses extraordinary facilities for ingress and egress, owing to the great depth of u ater in the roads and entrance, and the protection afforded by the lofty hills by which the dock is sheltered. With all these advantages, in addition to an extensive tide harbour, Port-Glasgow now affords shipping accommodation of a very superior description. The charges on shipping at this port are much lower than at any other in Scotland. This is in a great measure owing to the extensive bonded warehouses held by the corporation, situated alongside the dock-walls, where every description of goods may be deposited at trifling rates.

The foreign trade of this port is chiefly with the West Indies and North America. It is the principal place on the Clyde for the importation of North American timber, for the reception of which it has large wood-ponds. Not less than 27,975 tons were imported in 1834. A comparative view of the tonnage employed in the foreign trade of the town during the last eight years indicates considerable improvement; the average inward tonnage for the four years prior to the 5th of January 1834 having been 23,901, and for the four years ending the 5th of January 1838, 28,761 tons. The harbour revenue exhibits a corresponding annual increase. In 1831, the harbour-dues amounted to L.1454; in 1834, to 1639; in 1836, to L.1800; and at present they average about L.2000 per annum. The customs collected have for the year ending in January 1838 amounted to L∙94,16l, a sum .much less than what was received a few years ago. But the deficiency is not to be attributed to any decline of trade; for under the existing laws the amount of customs collected at any warehousing port forms no criterion for ascertaining the real extent of its commerce. The deficiency is attributable to two causes, which bear no direct reference to the decline or the improvement of trade; namely, first, the collection at Glasgow since the year 1834, of the duties upon tobacco, which were formerly paid here; andsecondly, the facilities afforded byrecentlaws forrecover-ing bonded goods from the port of importation without payment of the duty. Thus, merchandize of every description, although imported here, is daily removed under bond to other places, where the duties are paid, which causes a diminution of the customs paid at this port, and may at first sight lead to the inference that the commerce of the place is declining, whilst, in point of fact, it is on the increase.

The coasting trade of Port-Glasgow was at one time very considerable; but owing to the great facility with which vessels of inferior burden now find their way up the river, nearly the whole of this branch has been transferred to Glasgow.

The work of ship-building is carried on here to a considerable extent. Of late years the carpenters have been chiefly employed in the construction of steam-boats, of which they have produced a great number, some of them of the largest class, and all of them of remarkable symmetry and superior workmanship. The manufacture of ropes and sail-cloth has been prosecuted for about a century. A considerable trade is carried on in sugar-refining.

In 1700 the population was not more than 400 souls; but in 1718, the inhabitants amounted to twice that number. From this period the population continued steadily, though not rapidly, to increase until the year 1790, when it consisted of 4036 persons. At each of the four decennial censuses which have since been taken, it was as follows :—In 1801, 3865; in 1811, 5116; in 1821, 5262; and in 1831, 5192. From a survey which was taken expressly for the New Statistical Account, in the summer of 1835, it was ascertained that the population had increased to 6018. The comparatively slow increase of population in this place, and its occasional falling off, as above indicated, are referable to the fluctuations of foreign trade, and to the depressing influence of the neighbouring ports of Greenock and Glasgow.
