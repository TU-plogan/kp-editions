PORTO RICO, or Puerto Rico, one of that group of West India islands called the great Antilles, and the smallest of the four in population and extent, but yielding to none in fertility and genera] importance. It is situated to the east or windward of Hayti, Cuba, and Jamaica, being separated on the west from the first named island by a channel twenty-five leagues in breadth, and having the Atlantic Ocean on the north, with the Carribean Sea on the south. It is about ninety miles in length from east to west, by thirty-three miles in average breadth; and contains, according to an exact admeasurement, a plane superficies of 2970 square miles.^[1. These are the dimensions assigned to the island by Colonel Flinter in his Account of the Present State of the Island of Puerto Rico 1884. Malte Brun, on what authority does not appear, makes it one hundred and twenty miles in length by forty in breadth; and other geographical writers extend its longitudinal dimensions still further. Probably the discrepancy arises from extreme points being taken in the one case, whilst a medium measurement is that given by Colonel Flinter, who had the most ample means of knowing every thing connected with the island. To hi» work on Porto Ricowe have been chiefly indebted for the present account of it. ] A chain of lofty mountains intersects it from east to west; the highest part, called Luguilla, at the north-east extremity of the island, being 1334 Castillian yards in height. Valleys, levels of table land, and gentle declivities, all highly fruitful, are every where found embosomed in these mountains; and they are themselves susceptible of cultivation to the very tops. To the north and south of this interior ridge, situated between it and the sea coast, are those richly fertile valleys which produce the chief wealth of the island. They are formed by smaller ridges of hills, which run north and south from the principal chain, and are much more level than those situated amongst the loftier mountains, which present an unequal, undulating surface, and a continued succession of gentle acclivities, covered with trees displaying all the varied colours and vivid foliage of the tropics. The valleys of the north and east coasts are the richest in cattle, and the most picturesque, the pasturage there being always verdant and luxuriant, from the abundant supply of rain which they receive; whilst those of the south coast, richer than the north in sugar, are often parched by excessive drought. This, however, can easily be remedied, for water is found by digging only half a yard below the surface of the ground. Few countries of the same extent as Porto Ricoare watered by so many streams. Seventeen rivers, taking their rise in the mountains, cross the valleys of the north coast and fall into the sea. Some of them are broad and deep, and navigable for two or three leagues [7:18:456]from their emboucheurs, which, however, are much obstructed by bars. These rivers arc well stocked with excellent fish; and the banks of the whole of them are nearly all under cultivation. The south, west, and east coasts are well supplied with water, notwithstanding the nnfrequency of rain. There are several large streams, besides numberless rivulets, and branches of navigable water. Porto Ricotherefore possesses great natural facilities for inland navigation, particularly upon the north coast. Of course we find the year divided in this island, as in the others belonging to the West Indies, into the wet and dry seasons, the former the winter, the latter the summer. But this distinction does not give a proper idea of the seasons in Porto Rico for on the north coast it sometimes rains during the whole year, whilst on the south coast a perfect deprivation of rain for twelve or fourteen months isnouncommon phenomenon, even when in the mountains there are daily showers. The climate of the north and south coasts of this island, therefore, are essentially different, although under the same tropical influence. The only difference of temperature to be observed throughout the whole island, is between the valleys and the mountains, which happens in every country similarly situated. In the mountains the inhabitants enjoy the coolness of spring, whilst the valleys, were it not for the daily breeze which blows generally frorft the north-east and east, would be uninhabitable. In August the atmosphere is oppressively hot, the thermometer being frequently above 90° of Fahrenheit; and during the coldest season it is never below 70°. In September the rains descend like a deluge, and the rivers swell and overflow their banks, completely inundating the low lands, whilst the smallest brooks become deep and rapid torrents. In October the weather becomes cooler, and in the following month the north and north-east winds generally set in, diffusing an agreeable coolness through the atmosphere. When the fury of the north wind abates, the most delightful weather is experienced. Hurricanes, the scourge of the West Indies, sometimes visit this island, generally between the months of July and October. In the year 1825, one occurred on the 27th of July, which nearly laid it desolate. Notwithstanding the general heat of the climate, and the humidity of some parts of Porto Rico it is reckoned healthy. The number of mountains and running streams, the absence of stagnant water, and the general cultivation of the land, no doubt powerfully contribute to purify the atmosphere and render it salubrious to man. This island exhibits a singular scarcity of indigenous animals. There are no venomous snakes or reptiles, no beast of prey, or indigenous quadrupeds of any kind to be found in the forests, scarcely any of the feathered tribes, and no noxious insects. But rats of an enormous size and in great numbers infest the country, and sometimes commit dreadful ravages upon the sugar canes.

The principal wealth of Porto Ricoconsists in agriculture. No manufactories are carried on, and no mines of gold and silver have been explored, if such exist. The soil is of the richest description, and a prolific and luxuriant vegetation covers every part of the island. The agriculturist is not limited by the nature of the soil to the exclusive cultivation of any particular produce. Every species of fruit and vegetables, congenial to tropical climates, may be planted with the certainty of reaping an abundant .harvest. Ι he best and most luxuriant pasture for rearing cattle; the rich, deep, vegetable mould necessary for the sugar cane; the hnnful soil in which the cocoa vegetates; and the cool mountain glades, so congenial to the coffee plant, may all be found within a small circle. Cotton, tobacco, and indigo, the latter being a spontaneous product of the fields, only require a little attention to render them objects of importance.

The whole agricultural riches of the island, houses, lands, and slaves, not included, were valued in 1832 at 37,993,599 dollars, and the produce at 6,883,371 dollars; of which there were exported through the custom houses to the value of 3,411,845½ dollars. The contributions levied on this property amounted only to 266,526 dollars, which is less than 3½ per cent, on the value of property, and less than 5⅛ per cent, on the value of produce. We have no doubt that the value of property and produce is much greater than what has just been stated; for as the people of the country themselves make the valuation, they always endeavour to make it appear as small as possible, in consequence of the direct tax levied on property.

Colonel Flin ter thinks that there cannot be fewer than two hundred thousand horned cattle on the island, the other animals being proportionally more numerous than they appear to be from the statement given; and he thinks that the total value of the cattle maybe estimated at 7,858,774 dollars. A great traffic has long been carried on in them, with the English, French, and other settlements. They bring a higher price than those of South America, in consequence of being fattened from the finest pasture land in the world, and from their extreme tameness. Vast quantities of raw and tanned hides are likewise exported. The production of sugar is the next great branch of industry. That the soil and climate are admirably adapted for the cultivation of the cane will be seen from the following fact. The proportion of sugar produced from the land employed in its cultivation, is in Jamaica and Dominica, ten quintals per acre; in Grenada, fifteen quintals per acre; in St. Christopher’s and Tobago, twenty quintals per acre, and in St. Vincent’s, twenty-five quintals per acre; whilst in Porto Ricoit is estimated at thirty quintals per acre.

Notwithstanding the great natural resources of this island, there are imported, besides manufactured goods, considerable quantities of provisions and other articles, of which, by attention, Porto Ricomight be made itself to yield sufficient supplies. However, an examination of the exports and imports shows, that of late years, the produce of the land exported, considerably exceeds the value of goods and provisions imported.

Amount of Exports and Imports for several years.
[table]

In 1830, there entered about 60,000 tons of shipping, of which one-half belonged to America, one-fourth to Spain, and the remaining fourth chiefly to England, France, and Denmark. The importations from America, which in value amount to one-third of the whole, consist of salt fish, flour, butter, lard, grain, lumber, boards, staves, and articles of furniture. The mother country exports her olives and brandies, her wines and dried fruits, oils of olive and almond, carpets for kneeling on, and other manufactures, alpute, anchovies, and so forth. England imports cotton goods, Irish linen, hardware, earthen-ware, and the like; and France imports linens, cambrics, ladies’ dresses and ornaments, toys and jewellery. Foreign goods pay seventeen per cent, of importation duties, ad valorem ; and an export duty of six per cent, is levied on all goods sent from the island, with the exception of timber and live stock, which are charged much higher. Spanish vessels from the peninsula pay six per cent, of importation duty, and the export tax is also much less than it is for foreign vessels. It is scarcely necessary to say, that the exports from Porto Rico consist of live stock, sugar, coffee, tobacco, and the other rich productions of the island. Colonel[7:18:457] Flinter states his conviction that the value of the exportations and importations exceeds the amount which appears in the custom-house returns; for goods are undervalued in general, and a considerable contraband trade is carried on. The nett revenue of the island in 1832amount- ed to 798,404 Spanish dollars (each equal to 4s.3^d sterling), and the expense of maintaining the civil and military establishments, amounted to 630,300 dollars; thus leaving a balance in the treasury, of 168,104 dollars. The taxes, although levied in an obnoxious manner, being for the most part direct, arc comparatively light. In 1832, the direct taxes produced 207,141; the custom-house duties, 493,930; and the indirect taxes, 97,333 dollars. The government, laws, and institutions of this island, are nearly similar to those formerly established by the kings of Spain in every part of the western hemisphere. There is a regular military force stationed on the island, and likewise a strong disposable body of well-disciplined militia.

Porto Ricocontains fifty-eight towns and villages, thus giving nearly one to every six square leagues. The largest place is San Juan, the capital. It is finely situated on the slope of a hill, on the north coast of the island. The streets, which run parallel and cross each other at right angles, are perfectly straight, and run down to the side of the bay. It is enclosed on every part by strong fortifications, which render the town almost impregnable. It is considered as one of the best and healthiest towns in the West Indies. It is adorned by a number of useful public edifices and institutions. Amongst these may be mentioned, the cathedral, a large mass of building, which has never been finished; four churches, two chapels, three convents, an episcopal palace, and a seminary for the education of the clergy; the royal military hospital, a large síone edifice, and an establishment of the same kind for females; the government house, called the fortress of Santa Catalina, which has stood for upwards of two hundred years; the royal goal, a large stone edifice; a house of correction; a large and handsome town-house; a beautiful theatre, built at the public expense; a custom-house; an arsenal, and some others. A society, called the Economical Society, is established for promoting the fine arts. There is also a mathematical class; whilst two schools for boys, and one for girls, are paid for by the municipality. There is an excellent and secure harbour, and a commodious wharf. This town is the residence of the governor, and the Catholic bishop, and here all the principal courts are held. San Juan was founded in the year 1514. Within a century afterwards it was twice taken and plundered by the English, who, however, could gain no permanent footing on the island, neither at these times nor at a later period under General Abercromby. The population is estimated at 30,000.

Some of the provincial towns may be considered as large with reference to the extent of the island; such as Mayagues and Aguadilla on the west coast, Pouce on the south, Pepino and Cayey in the interior, and Humacao on the eastern coast. The other towns and villages, with few exceptions, are merely skeletons, containing a large square, with the church, the houses of the curate and magistrate, the militia quarters, and a few residences of wealthy people. There are fifteen ports in which custom-houses and recep-tories have been established. By far the greater number of the inhabitants are scattered over the island in agricultural establishments. The total number will be seen from the following table:

[table]

This shews an extraordinary rate of increase; and allowing that the population has augmented in the same ratio since the last census was taken, we may safely estimate the number of inhabitants of this island in 1839 at about four hundred thousand souls. The island of Bieques, situated three leagues from the north-east coast of Porto Rico is under the command of the captain-general of the latter. It is ten leagues in length, by two in breadth, and reckoned one of the most fertile spots in the West Indies. It has several commodious ports and harbours, and from its position to the windward might be made of considerable importance to Porto Rico if properly settled, which it is not.

Porto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, and was supposed at the time to contain 660,000 inhabitants. Having learned that the Spaniards had made themselves masters of Española, these savages looked upon the invaders as invincible and immortal. But to put the matter to the test, they tried an experiment on one of the domestics of Columbus, and finding that he was mortal, they rose upon the Spaniards, and made a great slaughter of them, whilst employed in plundering the treasures of the natives. The Spaniards seldom required so good a pretext for retaliation, and they accordingly rose upon the inhabitants, and effected their total extermination. Since then it has been gradually settled by Spaniards; and from the census given above, it will be seen that it promises at no distant date to be as thickly peopled as it was when first visited by the prince of navigators. r r.r.
