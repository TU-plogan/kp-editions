POOL, a seaport of the county of Dorset, within the hundred of Cogdean, and a county of itself, 106 miles from London. It is situated on a peninsula stretching into a large estuary at the mouth of the river Froome; and vessels drawing sixteen feet water can approach the quays. Themouth of the estuary is defended by a castle on the [7:18:363]island of Browsea; and near it, in Studland Bay, as well as in Swanage Bay, there is good anchorage. The chief pursuits are the fishery and the trade with Newfoundland, that give occupation to more than 200 sail of vessels, which repair to that island and load with salted cod and other fish, a few for England, but mostly for the ports of Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean; and the latter return with the productions of the several countries where they sell their fish. There is, besides, a considerable coasting trade, especially for coals; and within the estuary and under the port, at a place called Russellâ€™s Quay, the greater part of the best pipe-clay, which is dug near it, is shipped for the use of the manufacturers of china and pottery in Staffordshire. It must have been a considerable port in the time of the Romans, as one of their roads may be traced from Winchester to Pool. The town is incorporated, and is governed by a mayor, who is an admiral within the port, and holds an admiralty court, a recorder, sheriffs, and aldermen, together with eighteen councillors. Till of late years one of the judges on the western circuit went to Pool to try criminals, but they are now tried at Dorchester. The town returns two members to parliament. The markets are held on Monday and Thursday. The old part of the town is ill built, but many houses recently erected are good. The population amounted in 1801 to 4761, in 1811 to 4816, in 1821 to 6390, and in 1831 to 6459.
