PONZA, or Pontia, is the name of a small island of the Tuscan Sea, well known as·the place to which many illustrious Romans were banished. It is situated on the coast of Italy, near Tcrracina, and in the neighbourhood of other small islands or rocks. All these islands were visited by Sir William Hamilton in the year 1785; and an account of his journey is given in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions (vol. lxxvi. p. 365). Sir William arrived at Ponza on the 20th of August; and, according to his account, it is situated about thirty miles from Ventotienne. On the 21 st he went round it in a boat. Its length is about five miles, but its breadth is nowhere above half a mile, and in some places not more than five hundred feet. It is surrounded by a multitude of detached rocks, some of them very high, and most of them composed of a compact lava. There are many irregularly-formed basalts, but none in large columns. In some places they have a reddish tinge, from iron ochre, are very small, and irregularly laid over one another. Some stand perpendi cularly, others obliquely, and some lie horizontally. The rocks themselves in which these masses are found are lava of the same nature with the basalts. At first sight they appear like the ruins of ancient Roman brick or tile buildings. One rock is composed of large spherical basalts, and in other places our author found the lava inclined to take the like spherical form, though on a much smaller scale, some of the former basalts being nearly two feet in diameter. All these rocks, in our author’s opinion, have been detached by the sea from this island, which is entirely composed of volcanic matter, lavas, and tufas of various qualities and colours, as green, yellow, black, and white. Some of these matters are more compact in their texture than others; and in some parts great tracts seem .to have undergone similar operations, which still subsist at a spot called the Pisciarelli, on the outside of the Solfatara, near Puzzoli, and where a hot sulphureous vitriolic acid vapour converts all which it penetrates, whether lavas, tufas, volcanic ashes, or pumice-stones, into a pure clay, mostly white, or with a tint of red, blue, green, or yellow.

In one part of this island there is a sort of tufa remarkably good for the purpose of building. It is as hard as Bath-stone, and nearly of the same colour, without any mixture of lava or pumice-stone, which usually abounds in the tufas of Naples, Baiae, and Puzzoli.

The island of Palmarole, which is about four miles from Ponza, is not much more than a mile in circumference. It is composed of the same volcanic matter, and probably was once a part of Ponza; but, in our author’s opinion, it looks as if the island of Zannone, which lies about the same distance from Ponza, was once likewise a part of the same; for many rocks of lava rise above water in a line between the two last-mentioned islands, and the water there is much more shallow than in the Gulf of Terracina.

Zannone is much larger and higher than Palmarole, and the half of it next the continent is composed of a limestone similar to that of the Apennines near it, whilst the other half is composed of lavas and tufas, resembling in every other respect the soil of the islands just described. Neither Palmarole nor Zannone arc inhabited; but the latter furnishes abundance of brushwood for the use of the inhabitants of Ponza, whose number, including the garrison, amounts to near 1700. The uninhabited island of St Stefano in like manner furnishes wood for the people of Ventotienne. It is probable that all these islands and rocks may in time be levelled by the action of the sea. Ponza, in its present state, is the mere skeleton of a volcanie island; little more than its hard or vitrified parts remaining, and these seem to be slowly and gradually mouldering away. The governor of the castle of Ponza, who had resided there fifty-three years, informed our author that the island was still subject to earthquakes; that there had been one violent shock there about four years before, and that the ιpost violent one he ever felt was on the very day and at the very hour when Lisbon was destroyed. Two houses out of three which were then on the island were thrown down. “This,” says our author, « seems to prove that the volcanic matter which gave birth to these islands is not exhausted.”
