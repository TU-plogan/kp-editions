POLIGNA, Melchior de, a French cardinal, was born of an ancient and noble family at Piry, the capital of Velay, in 1662. He was sent by Louis XIV. as ambassador extraordinary to Poland, where, on the death of Sobieski, he formed a project of procuring the election of the prince of Conti; but failing in this, he returned home under some disgrace. When restored to favour, he was sent to Rome as auditor of the Rota. He acted as plenipotentiary during the congress at Utrecht, at which time Clement I. created him cardinal; and upon the accession of Louis XV. he was appointed to reside as minister of France at Rome, where he remained till the year 1732, and died in the year 1741. He left behind him a manuscript poem, entitled Anti-Lucretius, seu De Deo et Natura, the plan of which he is said to have formed in Holland in a conversation with Bayle.
