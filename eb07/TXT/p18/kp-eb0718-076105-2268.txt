PYTHON, in fabulous history, is the name given to a monstrous serpent, produced by the earth after Deucalionâ€™s deluge. Juno being exasperated at Latona, who was beloved by Jupiter, commanded this serpent to destroy her; but Latona flying from the pursuit of the monster, escaped to Delos, where she was delivered of Diana and Apollo, the latter of whom at length destroyed Python with his arrows, and in memory of this victory the Pythian games were instituted.
