PUCIIMARY, a town of Northern Hindustan, in the province of Kemaon, situated at the top of a very steep pass in the mountain, in the neighbourhood of which is a cave containing an image of Maha Dco, and his wife Bowanee, to which pilgrims pay their devotions. A perpendicular cliff is also pointed out here, from which the Hindus precipitate themselves as an offering to their idols. Lat. not ascertained.
