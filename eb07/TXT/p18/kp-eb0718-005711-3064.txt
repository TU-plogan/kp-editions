PLETHORA, in Medicine, from πkη0ος, plenitude. A plethora is, when the vessels are too much loaded with fluids. The plethora may be sanguine or serous. In the former there is too much crassamentum in the blood, in the latter too little. In the sanguine plethora, there is danger of a fever, inflammation, apoplexy, rupture of the blood-vessels, and obstructed secretions; in the serous, of a dropsy, and other affections. A rarefaction of the blood produces all the effects of a plethora; it may accompany a plethora, and should therefore be distinguished from it. Mr Bromfield observes, that a sanguine plethora may be known to be present by the pulse. An artery overcharged with blood is as incapable of producing a. strong full pulse, as one that con [7:18:58] tains a deficient quantity; so that in both cases there will be a low and weak pulse. To distinguish rightly, the pulse must not be felt with one or two lingers on the carpal artery; but if three or four fingers cover a considerable length of the artery, and we press hard for some time on it, and then suddenly raise all these fingers except that which is nearest to the patient’s hand, the influx of the blood, if there is a plethora, will be so rapid as to raise the other finger, and make us sensible of the fulness. The sanguine plethora is relieved by bleeding; the serous by purging, diuretics, and sweating.
