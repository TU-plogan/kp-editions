PRUDENTIUS, or Aurelius Prudentius Clemens, a famous Christian poet, who flourished under the reign of Theodosius the Great. Born in Spain in the year 348, he first followed the profession of advocate, was afterwards a judge, then a soldier, and at length had an honourable employment at court. A great number of his poems remain; but the style is barbarous, forming a singular contrast to the purity of the Augustan age. The best editions of his works are that of Amsterdam, 1667, with Heinsiusâ€™s notes; and that of Paris, 1687, in usum Delphini. .
