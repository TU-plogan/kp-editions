PORPHYRIUS, a famous Platonic philosopher, was bornât Tyre in 233, in the rcign of Alexander Severus. He was the disciple of Longinus, and became the ornament of his school at Athens, whence he went to Rome, and attended Plotinus, with whom he lived six years. After Plotinus’s death he taught philosophy at Rome with great success, and became well skilled in polite literature, geography, astronomy, and music. He lived till the end of the third century, and died in the reign of Diocletian. There are still extant his book on the Categories of Aristotle; a Treatise on Abstinence from Flesh; and several other pieces in Greek. He also composed a treatise against the Christian religion, which is now lost. That work was answered by Methodius bishop of Tyre, and also by Eusebius, Apollinarius, St. Augustin, St. Jerome, St. Cyril, and Theodoret. The Emperor Theodosius the Great caused Porphyrius’s book to be burned in 338. Those of his works that are still extant were printed at Cambridge in 1655, 8vo, with a Latin version.

“Porphyrius,” says Dr. Enfield, “was, it must be owned, a writer of deep erudition; and had his judgment and integrity been equal to his learning, he would have deserved a distinguished place among the ancients. But neither the splendour of his diction, nor the variety of his reading, can atone for the credulity or the dishonesty which filled the narrative part of his works with so many extravagant tales, or interest the judicious reader in the abstruse subtilties and mystical flights of his philosophical writings.”
