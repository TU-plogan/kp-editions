PLYERS, in fortification, denotes a kind of balance used in raising or letting down a drawbridge. They consist of two timber levers, twice as long as the bridge they lift, joined together by other timbers, framed in the form of a St Andrew’s cross, to counterpoise them. They are supported by two upright jambs, on which they swing; and the bridge is raised or let down by means of chains joining the ends of the plyers and bridge.
