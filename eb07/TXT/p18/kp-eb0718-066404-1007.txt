PROROGATION, the act of prolonging, or adjourning, or putting off to another time. The difference between a prorogation and an adjournment of parliament is, that by prorogation the session is ended, and such bills as passed in either house, or both houses, and had not the royal assent, must at the next assembly begin again.
