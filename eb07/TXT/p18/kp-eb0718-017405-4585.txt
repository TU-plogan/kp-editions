POINT, a term used in various arts.

Point, in Grammar, is a character used to mark the divisions of discourse. A point proper is what is otherwise called a period or full stop. See Punctuation. Point, in Geometry, according to Euclid, is that which has neither parts nor magnitude.

Point, in Music, a mark or note anciently used to distinguish the tones or sounds. Hence we still call it simple counterpoint, when a note of the lower part answers exactly to that of the upper; and figurative counterpoint when any note is syncopated, so that one of the parts makes several notes or inflections of the voice, whilst the other holds on one.

A point is still used to raise the value of a note, and prolong its time by one half. Thus a point added to a semibreve, instead of two minims, makes it equal to three; and so of the other notes.

Point, in Astronomy, a term applied to certain points or places marked in the heavens, and which are distinguished by proper epithets.

The four grand points or divisions of the horizon, namely, the east, west, north, and south, are denominated the cardinal points.

The zenith and nadir are the vertical points ; the points in which the orbits of the planets cut the plane of the ecliptic are called the nodes ; the points in which the equator and ecliptic intersect are called the equinoctial points ; that whence the sun ascends towards the north pole being called the vernal point ; and that by which he descends to the south pole the autumnal point. The points of the ecliptic, where the sun’s ascent above the equator, and descent below it, terminate, are called the solstitial points ; the former being the estival or summer point, and the latter the brumal or winter point. Point is also used to signify a cape or headland jutting out into the sea. Thus seamen say two points of land are in one another when they are in a right line against each other, so that the innermost is prevented from being seen by the outermost.

Point, in Perspective, is used for various poles or places, with regard to the perspective plane.

Point, in Poetry, denotes a lively brisk turn or conceit, usually found or expected at the close of an epigram.

PoiNT∙Blank, in Gunnery, denotes the shot of a gun levelled horizontally, without either elevating or depressing the muzzle of the piece.
