PLATONIC, something which relates to Plato, his philosophy, his opinions, or the like. Thus, Platonic love denotes a pure and spiritual affection, for which Plato was a great advocate, sa subsisting between the different sexes, abstracted from all carnal appetites, and regarding no other object but the mind and its beauties; or it is even a sincere, disinterested friendship subsisting between persons of the same sex, abstracted from any selfish views, and regarding no other object than the person, if any such love or friendship has aught of a foundation in nature.

Platonic Year, or the Great Year, is a period of time determined by the revolution of the equinoxes, or the space wherein the stars and constellations return to their former places in respect of the equinoxes. The Platonic year, according to Tycho Brahe, is 25,816; according to Ricciolus, 25,910; and according to Cassini, 24,800 years. This period once accomplished, it was an opinion amongst the ancients that the world would begin anew, and the sameseries of things return in the same order as before.
