POLEMO, who succeeded Xenocrates in the direction of the academy, was an Athenian of distinguished birth, but in the earlier part of his life a man of loose morals. The manner in which he was reclaimed from the pursuit of infamous pleasures, and brought under the discipline of philosophy, affords a memorable example of the power of eloquence employed in the cause of virtue. As he was, one morning about sunrise, returning home from the revels of the night, he passed by the school of Xenocrates, and saw him surrounded with his disciples. Unable to resist so fortunate an opportunity of indulging his sportive humour, he rushed without ceremony into.the school, and took his place amongst the philosophers. The whole assembly was astonished at this intrusion, and all but Xenocrates discovered signs of resentment. Xenocrates, however, preserved perfect command of his temper, and turning his discourse from the subject on which he was treating to the topics of temperance and modesty, he recommended them with such strength of argument and energy of language, that Pôlemo was constrained to yield to the force of conviction. Instead of turning the philosopher and his doctrine to ridicule, as he at first intended, he became sensible of the folly of his former conduct; was heartily ashamed of the contemptible figure which he had made in so respectable an assembly; assumed a sedate and thoughtful aspect; and resolved from that hour to relinquish his licentious pleasures, and devote himself to the pursuit of wisdom.
