PLUMMING, amongst miners, is the method of using a mine-dial, in order to know the exact place of the work where to sink down an air-shaft, or to bring an adit to the work, or to know which way the lode inclines when any flexure happens in it.

It is performed in this manner. A skilful person, with an assistant, and provided with pen, ink, and paper, a long line, and a mine-dial, after his guess of the place above ground, descends into the adit or work, and there fastens one end of the line to some fixed thing in it; then the incited needle is let to rest, and the exact point where it rests is marked with a pen. The person in question then goes on farther in, the line being still fastened, and at the next flexure of the adit he makes a mark on the line, by a knot or otherwise, and, letting down the dial again, he there likewise notes down that point at which the needle stands in this second position. In this manner he proceeds, from turning to turning, marking down the points, and marking the line, till he comes to the intended place. This being done, he ascends and begins to work on the surface of the earth what he did in the adit, bringing the first knot in the line to such a place where the mark of the place of the needle will again answer its pointing; and continues this till be come to the desired place above ground, which is certain to be perpendicular over the part of the mine into which the air-shaft is to be sunk.
