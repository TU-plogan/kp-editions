PRAXITELES, a very famous Greek sculptor, who lived 330 years before Christ, during the rcign of Alexander the Great. All the ancient writers mention his statues with high commendation, especially a Venus executed by him for the city of Cnidus, which was so admirable a piece, that Nicoedes offered to release the inhabitants from their tribute as the purchase of it; but they refused to part with it. The inhabitants of the isle of Cos requested of Praxiteles a statue of Vcmis; and in consequence of this application the artist gave them their choice of two, one of them representing the goddess entirely naked, and the other covered with drapery. Both of these were of exquisite workmanship. Although the former was esteemed the most beautiful, nevertheless the inhabitants of Cos had the wisdom to give the preference to the latter, from a conviction that no motive whatever could justify their introducing into their city any indecent statues or paintings, which are so likely to inflame the passions of young people, and lead them to immorality and vice.
