PRESTER JOHN, an appellation formerly given to an emperor of the Tartars, who was overcome and killed by Genghiz Khan. Since that time it has been applied to the Emperor of Abyssinia or Ethiopia; but in Ethiopia itself this name is utterly unknown.

Prester, a meteor, consisting of an exhalation thrown downwards from the clouds with such violence, that by the collison it is set on fire. The word is Greek, πpηστηp, the name of a kind of serpent, called also dipsas, to which this meteor is supposed to bear a resemblance. The prester differs from the thunderbolt in the manner of its inflammation, and in its burning and breaking every thing it touches with greater violence.
