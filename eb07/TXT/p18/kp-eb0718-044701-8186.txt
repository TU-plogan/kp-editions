PORK, the flcsh of swine killed for the purposes of food. The hog is the only domestic animal that we know which is of no use to man when alive, and therefore seems properly designed for food. Besides being loathsome and ugly to every eye, it is killed without reluctance. The Pythagoreans, whether to preserve health, or on account of compassion, generally forbade the use of animal food; and yet it is alleged that Pythagoras reserved the use of hogâ€™s flesh for himself. The Jews, the Egyptians, and other inhabitants of warm countries, and all the Mahomedans, reject the use of pork. It is difficult to discover a satisfactory reason for this, or for the precept given to the Jews respecting it, though unquestionably some good one might be assigned. The Greeks greatly commended this food; and Galen everywhere speaks in its praise. The Romans considered it as one of their delicacies; and if some of the inhabitants of the northern climates have taken an aversion to it, that probably arose from their country not being fitted to rear it. Pork is of a very tender structure, increased perhaps from a peculiarity in its economy, namely, taking on fat more readily than any other animal. Pork is a white meat even in its adult state, and then gives out a jelly in great quantity.
