POITIERS, an arrondissement of the department of the Vienne, in France. It extends over 792 square miles, and comprehends ten cantons, divided into 101 communes, and containing 88,600 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, the seat of the departmental government and of the courts of law. It is an elevated spot, almost surrounded by lofty rocks, at the foot of which run the river Elain on the east side, and the river Boivre on the west; both of which streams unite to the north of the city. It is surrounded with ancient walls, and is built in an antique style and irregular manner. It is the see of a bishop, and has an old cathedral and several other churches, three hospitals, an academy, a lyceum, a public library, 4160 houses, and about 19,500 inhabitants. It is a place of little commerce, chiefly confined to making a few woollen cloths, some hosiery, leather, and distilling brandy. Near to it are some Celtic and some Roman antiquities. It is celebrated for the battle which bears the name of the city, though fought at Beauvoir, between Edward the Black Prince of England, and King John of France, in the year 1356, when the latter was made prisoner.
