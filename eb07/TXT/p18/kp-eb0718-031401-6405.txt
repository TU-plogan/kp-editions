POLYGARS â€™ Territory. This is a district in the Southern Carnatic, and it is situated between the tenth and eleventh degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by Trichinopoly, to the south by Mara was and Madura, to the east it has Tanjore and the sea, and to the west Dindigul. The Polygars, amongst whom this country is divided, are military chieftains, resembling the Zemindars of Bengal. Their estates are called Pallams. The country, before it was finally subdued by the British, having been long the scene of violence and disorder, where might was the rule of right, these Polygars were extremely averse to the British yoke, and defended their independence and their properties with resolution. They were, however, brought under subjection by the irresistible power of the British arms, and forced to yield to whatever terms were imposed upon them. Those who resisted the demand of tribute imposed on them, or showed signs of turbulence, were made prisoners, and deprived of their lands; others fled to the hills, where they made inroads on the lower country, collecting the tribute of their lands, or marauding and plundering the country. They have been now, however, mostly subdued, and the country has been restored to tranquillity, under the rule of the British.
