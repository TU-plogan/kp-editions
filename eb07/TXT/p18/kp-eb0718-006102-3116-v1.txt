PLOWDEN, Edmund, sergeant at law, descended from an ancient family in Shropshire, was born in 1517, and was first a student of the university of Cambridge, where he spent three years in the study of philosophy and medicine. He then removed to Oxford, where, having continued his former studies about four years more, he was in 1552 admitted to the practice of physic and surgery; but probably finding the practice of the healing art less agreeable than the study of physic, he entered himself of the Middle Temple, and began to read law. Wood says, that in 1557 he was summer reader to that society, and Lent reader three years afterwards, being then sergeant and oracle of the law. He died in the year 1584, aged sixty-seven; and was buried in the Temple church. He wrote, 1. Commentaries or Reports of divers Cases in the reigns of Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, London, 1571, 1578, 1599, and 1613. written in the öld Norman language; and, 2. Queries, or a Mootbook of Cases, translated, methodized, and enlarged, by H. B. of Lincoln’s-Inn, London, 1662, in 8vo.
