PYRMONT, a city of the principality of Waldech, in Germany, and the capital of the district of the same name. It is a well-built place, containing 320 houses, and 2400 resident inhabitants. It is chiefly remarkable for its mineral springs, which are much frequented in'the summer months by invalids. It is situated at the northern extremity of a pic turesque valley on the river Emmer. It is surrounded with pleasing groves and other public walks, as well as with all the accommodations which can contribute to the gratification of those who resort to its waters. The principal spring, called the holy well, has an intoxicating quality and a vinous spirited taste, and has long been the most celebrated of the steel waters. From this well more than 400,000 jugs are annually filled, and despatched to other parts of the world; and it is said to lose none of its qualities by the longest journey. There are other springs, of various component parts; and one from which a large quantity of culinary salt is made. The Prince of Waldech has a palace near the city, which was formerly occupied by Frederick the Great, who frequently had recourse to these springs in his latter years. Lat. 51. 59. 28. N.
