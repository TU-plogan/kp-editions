PREJUDICE, or Prejudgment, from prae and judicium, means a judgment formed beforehand, without examination; the preposition prae expressing an anticipation, not so much of time as of knowledge and due attention; and hence the schoolmen have called it anticipation and & preconceived opinion. See Metaphysics.
