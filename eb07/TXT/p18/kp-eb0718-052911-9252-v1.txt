PRIAPUS, in Pagan worship, the son of Bacchus and Venus, who presided over gardens and the most indecent exhibitions. He was particularly adored at Lampsacus, a city at the mouth of the Hellespont, said to have been the place of his birth; and his image was placed in gardens to defend them from thieves and birds destructive of fruit. He was usually represented naked, with a stern countenance, matted hair, and holding either a wooden sword or sickle in his hand. The sacrifice offered to this obscene deity was the ass; cither on account of the natural uncomeiiness of this animal, and its propensity to venery, or from the disappointment which Priapus met with on his attempting the chastity of Vesta, whilst that goddess was asleep, when she escaped the intended injury by being awakened in conse quence of the braying of old Silenus’s ass.
