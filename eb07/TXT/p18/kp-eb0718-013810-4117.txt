POECILE was a famous porticoat Athens, which received its name from the variety(πo∕κ∕λog) of paintings which it contained. Zeno kept his school there; and there also the Stoics received their lessons; whence their name, from στοα, a porch. Amongst other things, the Poecile was adorned with a picture of the siege and sacking of Troy, another .of the battle of Theseus with the Amazons, and a third of the fight between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians at Oenoe in Argolis. It was also accounted a great distinction to have one’s portrait placed in this national gallery. In fact, the only reward which Miltiades obtained after the battle of Marathon, was to have his picture drawn more conspicuously than those of the rest of the officers who fought [7:18:139]with him on that occasion, in the representation which was made of the engagement, and to have it hung up in the Poecile in commemoration of that celebrated victory. This was accounted glory enough for so great and memorable an achievement.
