PURITAN, a name formerly given in derision to the dissenters from the Church of England, on account of their profession to follow the pure word of God, in opposition to all traditions and human constitutions. It was likewise given in the primitive church to the Novatian schismatics, because they would never admit to communion any one whom dread of death had led to apostatize from the faith.
