PURIFICATION, in matters of religion, a ceremony which consists in cleansing any thing from a supposed pollution or defilement.

The Pagans, before they sacrificed, usually bathed or washed themselves in water; and they were particularly careful to wash their hands, because with these they were to touch the victims consecrated to the gods. It was also customary to wash the vessel with which they made their libations. Previously to the duty of prayer the Mahommedans also use purifications, which are of two kinds; namely, either bathing, or only washing the face, hands, and feet. The first is required only in extraordinary cases, as after having lain with a woman, touched a dead body, or the like. But lest so necessary a preparation for their devotions should be omitted, either where water cannot be had, or when it may be of prejudice to a person’s health, they are allowed in such cases to make use of fine sand or dust instead of it; and then they perform this duty by clapping their open hands on the sand, and passing them over the parts, in the same manner as if they were dipped in water.

There were also many legal purifications amongst the Hebrews. When a woman was delivered of a male child, she was esteemed impure for forty days, and when of a female, for sixty; at the end of which time she usually carried a lamb to the door of the temple to be offered for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or turtle for a sin-offering, and by this ceremony she was cleansed or purified.
