POLESINA, a delegation of Austrian Italy, in the province of Milan. It is bounded on the north by Padua, on the east by Venice, on the south by the papal states, and on the west by Mantua and Verona. It is 434 square miles in extent, and contains 135,200 inhabitants. It is a level district, without woods; but abounding in lakes and morasses, which render it unhealthy. The district is enclosed by the rivers Po and Etsch; and the interior is drained by the Adigetto, Tartaro, Castognaro, and many canals. The soil is very fruitful, and yields abundantly of maize, oats, wheat, and rice; and also much fruit, hemp, flax, wine, and good silk. The soil likewise furnishes abundance of nitre, the preparation of which affords much employment. The only other manufactures are those of leather, bricks, and tiles. The capital is Rovigio. In the time of the Romans this district was a marsh, known as Paludes Padusae. It is now divided into seven districts, which are subdivided into fifty-six communes.
