PROTESTANT, a name first given in Germany to those who adhered to the doctrine of Luther, because, in 1529, they protested against a decree of the Emperor Charles V. and the Diet of Spires, declaring that they appealed to a general council. The same name has now become a common denomination for all those of the reformed churches.
