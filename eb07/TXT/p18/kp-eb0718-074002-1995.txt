PURCELL, Henry, the most distinguished musical composer that England has produced. He was born in 1658, and died in 1695. At the early age of eighteen his genius and attainments procured him the appointment of organist of Westminster Abbey. His genius for composition was original and vigorous, as is evinced by his various works for the church, the chamber, and the theatre. A detailed analysis of some of these productions is given by Dr Burney in the third volume of his History of Music. Purcell entertained the highest respect for the great Italian composers of his period. Burney (vol. iii. page 508) says, in a proper spirit of liberality, “Let those who shall think Purcell has sacrificed the national honour by confessing his reverence for the productions of Italy, compare the secular productions of English musicians, from the death of Queen Elizabeth to the year 1683, with those of Carissimi, Cesti, Stradella, and innumerable others of great abilities, and, if they do not equally hate music and truth, they will admire Purcell’s probity as well as his genius.” Burney remarks afterwards (page 510), with a just feeling towards Purcell’s great abilities, “If a parallel were to be drawn between Purcell and any popular composer of a different country, reasons might be assigned for supposing him superior to every other great and favourite contemporary musician in Europe.” Purcell was interred in Westminster Abbey, and a monument erected there to his memory.
