POINT DE GALLE, a seaport and fortified town on the south-western point of Ceylon, reckoned the third in consequence in the island, whilst in point of trade it ranks next to Columbo. The petlah or native town is extensive, and enclosed with a wall, and the houses are superior to those at Trincomalee. It has a good and spacious harbour, especially the outer road; whilst the inner harbour is secure during a great part of the year, but the egress is not so easy, as it requires the wind from a particular quarter to carry the vessels out. During the season when the roadstead from Columbo is unsafe, ships frequently wait at Point de Galle till their cargoes are ready. The fortress stands very high, but is much out of repair; and not above six families reside in it constantly, except when the homeward-bound fleet is assembled there, when a much greater number is collected. There is no regular rainy season at Point de Galle; but being open to both monsoons, it has more rain than the continent of India. The shore, both to the westward and in the vicinity of the port, is lined with rocks; and it is therefore advisable to keep in twenty-five fathoms till near the entrance into the harbour. The exports are cinnamon, cardamums, arrack, oil, salt fish, and cotton. Fisheries are carried on to a considerable extent. Cinnamon is also grown, but not to such an extent as about Columbo. Near the fort is a colony of Chinese, established by government as gardeners for the purpose of raising vegetables, in which they have at length succeeded, and have also thriving plantations of sugar-cane. At Billegam, about twenty miles south-east from Point de Galle, is a celebrated Buddhist temple, in which is a recumbent figure of Buddha. There is also a gigantic four-handed figure of Vishnu, of a dark colour; and the walls are covered with painted figures of Buddha. In a corner is another figure seated on a cobra de capella snake coiled up, the hood of which forms a canopy over his head. Point de Galle was occupied by the Portuguese in 1517, and taken from them by the Dutch in 1640. It came into the possession of the British in 1796. It is sixty miles south from Columbo. Long. 80.15. E. Lat. 6. N.
