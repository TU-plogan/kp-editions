PUTEOLI, a town of Campania, so called either from its wells, there being many hot and cold springs thereabouts, or from the stench caused by sulphureous exhalations. It is now called Puzzuoli, and is pleasantly and advantageously situated for trade. In a very remote age the Cumeans made it their arsenal and dock-yard, and to this naval establishment they gave the sublime appellation of I)icearchia. The Romans were well aware of the utility of this port, and took great pains to improve its natural advantages. Nothing remains of their works but a line of piers, built to break the force of a rolling sea, and which are vulgarly called the bridge of Caligula, because that madman is said to have marched in triumph from Puzzuoli to Baiae on a bridge, which however was a bridge of boats.
