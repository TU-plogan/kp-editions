PUNJAB, or Five Waters, an extensive region of Hindustan, principally situated in the province of Lahore, but including Moultan. The province of Lahore is also frequently named the Punjab. This tract has no very definite boundary. On the east the boundary is properly the ridge of the Snowy Mountains, from which spring the five rivers by which it is watered; but, in its more restricted sense, it means the country situated to the west of this hilly tract. This territory is watered by five celebrated streams, that fall into the Indus, namely, the Sutleje, the Beyah, the Ra-vèy, the Chinaub, the Jhylum or Belut. It is very extensive, and remarkably fertile, abounding in all the necessaries of life, besides wine, sugar, indigo, cotton, and many luxuries. ‘ The tract between the Jhylum and the Indus contains salt-mines, that furnish inexhaustible stores of this article, which is largely exported. The lower part of the country is inundated, like Bengal, by the overflowing of the rivers during the periodical rains.
