PROJECTION, in Perspective, denotes the appearance or representation of an object on the perspective plane. The projection of a point is a point through which an optic ray passes from the objective point through the plane to the eye; or it is the point in which the plane cuts the optic ray; and hence may be easily conceived what is meant by the projection of a line, a plane, or a solid.

Projection, in Alchemy, the casting of a certain imaginary powder, called powder of projection, into a crucible or other vessel full of some prepared metal or other matter, which is to be hereby presently transmuted into gold.

Powder of Projection, or of the philosopher’s stone, is a powder supposed to have the virtue of changing any quantity of an imperfect metal, as copper or lead, into a more perfect one, as silver or gold, by the admixture of a little quantity of the powder. The mark to which alchemists directed all their endeavours, was to discover this powder of projection.
