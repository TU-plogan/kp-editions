PRIMING, in Gunnery, the train of powder that is laid from the opening of the vent along the gutter or channel on the upper part of the breech of the gun, which, when fired, conveys the flame to the vent, by which it is further communicated to the charge, in order to discharge the piece. This operation is only used on shipboard at the proof, and sometimes in garrison; for, upon all other occasions, tubes are used for the purpose.

Priming, amongst painters, signifies the laying on of the first or original colour.
