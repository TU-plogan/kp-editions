PRESENTATION, in ecclesiastical law. Sec Patronage. Presentation of the Virgin, is a feast of the Catholic church, celebrated on the 21st of November, in memory of the blessed Virgin being presented by her parents in the temple, to be there educated. Emanuel Comnenns, who began to reign in 1143, makes mention of this feast in his Constitutions. Some imagine it to have been established amongst the Greeks in the 11th century; and think they dis [7:18:528] cover evident proofs of it in some homilies of George of Nicomedia, who lived in the time of Photius. Its institution in the west is ascribed to Gregory XI. in 1372. Others think it was instituted in memory of the ceremony practised amongst the Jews for their newly-born females, and corresponded to the circumcision on the eighth day for males.

Presentation of our Lady also gives the title to three orders of nuns. The first of these was that projected in 1618, by a maid named Joan of Cambray. The habit of the nuns was to be a grey gown of natural wool; but this project was never accomplished. The second was established in France, about the year 1627, by Nicholas Sanguin, bishop of Senlis, and approved by Urban VIII. This order never made any great progress. The third was established in 1664, when Frederick Borromeo, being apostolical visitor in the Valteline, was intreated by some devout maids of Morbegno to allow them to live in community in a retired place; a request which he granted, and erected them into a congregation, under the title of the Congregation of our Lady. They live under the rule of St. Augustin.
