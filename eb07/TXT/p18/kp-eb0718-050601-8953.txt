PREADAMITE, a denomination given to the inhabitants of the earth, conceived, by some people, to have lived before Adam.

Isaac de la Pereyra, in 1G55, published a book to evince the reality of Preadamites, by which he gained a considerable number of proselytes to the opinion; but the answer of Desmarets, professor of theology at Gr√∂ningen, published the year folloAving, put a stop to its progress, though Pereyra made a reply.
