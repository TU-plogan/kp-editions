POTATOES, of the order solaneae. See Botany. It seems to be the prevalent opinion that potatoes were first introduced into Europe from America, by Sir Walter Raleigh, about 1586. Gerard, an old English botanist, mentions that he had reared seedlings of the potatoe in 1590, and that it grew as well in his garden as in its native soil, Virginia. Gerard gave to the potatoe the botanical name of solanum tuberosum, — a name adopted by Linnaeus, and which it still retains. Previously to 1684, its cultivation in England was confined to the gardens of a few of the nobility and gentry. It was then first planted in the open fields in Lancashire, a county in which it is now very extensively cultivated. In an account of the household expenses of Queen Anne, wife of James I., who died in 1618, and which is supposed to have been compiled in 1613, the price of potatoes is stated at Is. a pound.

Potatoes were not introduced into Ireland until 1610, when a small parcel was sent by Sir Walter Raleigh to be planted on his estate in the vicinity of Youghall. There is no other instance of the cultivation of an exotic having been so rapidly extended in so short a period as has elapsed since potatoes were introduced into Ireland.

Potatoes were not raised in Scotland, except in gardens, till 1728, when they were planted in the open fields by Thomas Prentice, day-labourer at Kilsyth. Prentice died at Edinburgh so late as 1792.

It has been estimated that one acre of land will produce three times, or at least twice, as much food when growing potatoes, as when employed in the culture of wheat; consequently, where the inhabitants live upon potatoes, the population will be twice or thrice as dense as where they are fed entirely on corn. While, however, the use of the potato as a principal article of food renders population comparatively dense, it tends also to render the people habitually poor, and to multiply the chances of famine. For the cultivation of the potato see Agriculture. For the political views see M‘CuIloeh’s Commercial Dictionary, and his notes to Smith’s Wealth of Nations.
