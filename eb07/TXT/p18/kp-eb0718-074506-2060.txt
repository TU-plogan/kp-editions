PYLADES, was a son of Strophius, king of Phocis, by one of the sisters of Agamemnon. He was educated together with his cousin Orestes, with whom he formed the most inviolable friendship, and whom he assisted to revenge the murder of Agamemnon, by assassinating Clytemnestra and Aegysthus. He also accompanied him into Taurica Chersonesus; and for his services Orestes rewarded him, by giving him his sister Electra in marriage. Pylades had by her two sons, Medon and Strophius. The friendship of Orestes and Pylades became proverbial.

Pylades, an actor of pantomime, who was the first to bring that species of histrionics to a high degree of perfection at Rome. He was a native of Cilicia, and had been the slave of Augustus, who gave him his freedom. He was the rival of Bathyllus, but their mode of dancing was perfectly distinct; that of Pylades was full of dignity and of passion, whilst that of Bathyllus was of a more joyous character. Pylades even wrote a book on the principles of his art. For some reason or other he was banished from Rome, and his recall by Augustus was so palatable to the people that in their joy they'forgot some severe measures which the emperor had passed. According to Suetonius, his banishment was caused by his having pointed with his finger to some one who had hissed his performance.
