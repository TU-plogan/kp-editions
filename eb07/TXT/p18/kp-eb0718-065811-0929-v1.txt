PROMETHEUS, the son of Japetus and Asia or Clymene, was the brother of Atlas, Epimetheus, and Menoetius. He was a prince of Meconë (the ancient name of Sicyon in the Peloponnesus), if we may trust the legend told by Hesiod. It is said that the inhabitants were debating with the gods which part of the animal ought to be offered to them in sacrifice, and that Prometheus recommended that the flesh and best parts should be covered with the caul, whilst the bones were enveloped in fat. Jupiter was then requested to make choice of the part he preferred; and, being deceived by the trick of Prometheus, he selected the bones, which were ever afterwards offered upon his altar. Indignant at this proceeding, he deprived men of the use of fire; but Prometheus is said to have again outwitted him, and drawn down fire from heaven, which he presented to man. This is explained by supposing that Prometheus was the first who discovered that fire could be extracted from two pieces of wood rubbed together. By another tradition, we find him making a man of clay, into which he conveys [7:18:659] the fire he had stolen from heaven, and for this daring invasion of his privileges, Jupiter orders Vulcan to chain Prometheus on Mount Caucasus, where he was visited daily by an eagle, which fed on his liver. Here he is said to have remained thirty thousand years, until Hercules accidentally visited him whilst in seareh of the Gardens of the Hesperides. He pointed out the way to him, and from gratitude Hcreules slew the eagle and released Prometheus. Another tradition represents him as having been released by Jupiter, in return for warning him against marrying Thetis, as it was fated that her son should be more illustrious than his father. He was the fatlιer of Deucalion by Clymenë or Pandora.

Prometheus, in Ancient Astronomy, was the name of a constellation of the northern hemisphere, now called Hercules Eugoηasin.
