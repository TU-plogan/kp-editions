POLYCHORD, from the Greek τroaυχοξδος, a bow instrument resembling the double-bass, but smaller. It had ten strings, and a compass from C the second space in the bass clef, to C the third space in the treble clef. Its fingerboard could be lengthened or shortened at pleasure, in order to tune the instrument. It was invented in 1799, by Hilmer, at Leipzig.
