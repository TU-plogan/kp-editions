PROSE, the natural language of mankind, loose and unconfined by poetical measures or restraints; and in this sense it stands opposed to verse. The word prose comes from the Latin prosa, which some have derived from the Hebrew œÅoras, which signifies expendit ; whilst others deduce it from the Latin prorsa, of prorsus, going forwards, by way of opposition to versa, or turning backwards, as is necessary in writing. 1
