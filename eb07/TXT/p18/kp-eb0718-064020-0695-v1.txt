PROFILE, in Architecture, the draught of a building, fortification, or other structure, in which are expressed the several heights, widths, and thicknesses, such as they would appear were the building cut down perpendicularly from the roof to the foundation.

Profile, in this sense, amounts to the same with elevation, and stands opposed to plan or ichnography. Profile is also used for the contour or outline of a figure, building, member of architecture, or the like; as a base, a cornice, and the like. Hence profiling is sometimes used for designing, or describing the member with rule, compass, and other instruments.

Profile, in Sculpture and Painting. A head, or a portrait, is said to be in profile, when either is represented sidewise, or in a side-view; as, when in a portrait there is but one side of the face, one eye, one cheek, &c. shown, and nothing of the other. On almost all medals, the faces are represented in profile.
