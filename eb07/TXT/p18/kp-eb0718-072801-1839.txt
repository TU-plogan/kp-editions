PUN, an expression where a word has at once different meanings. The practice of punning is the refuge of those who wish to pass for wits, without having a grain of it in their composition. James I. of England delighted in punning; and the taste of the sovereign was studied by the courtiers, nay, even by the clergy. Hence the sermons of that age abound with this species of false wit. It continued to be more or less fashionable until the reign of Queen Anne, when Addison, Swift, Pope, and Arbuthnot, with the other real wits of that age, united their efforts to banish punning from polite composition. It is still admitted sparingly in conversation, and only from those who cannot furnish anything better.
