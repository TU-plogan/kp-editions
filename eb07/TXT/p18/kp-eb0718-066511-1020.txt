PROVERB, according to Camden, is a concise, witty, and wise speech, grounded upon experience, and for the most part containing some useful instruction.

Book of Proverbs, a canonical book of the Old Testament, containing a part of the proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of Israel. The first twenty-four chapters are acknowledged to be the genuine work of that prince; the next five chapters are a collection of several of his proverbs made by order of King Hezekiah; and the two last seem to have been added by different but unknown authors.
