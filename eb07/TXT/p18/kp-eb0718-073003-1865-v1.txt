PUNDERPOOR, or Pundepore, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapore, situated on the left bank of the river Beemal. It is not very large, but is a prosperous and populous place. The streets are broad and well paved, and adorned with very handsome houses, almost all the principal members of the Mahratta empire having dwellings there, where they spend some months of every year, when they are not engaged in hostilities with each other, or with some foreign power. It has an extensive market, well supplied not only with grain, cloth, and the productions of the country, but with many articles of English manufacture. There is also a handsome temple dedicated to Vishnu, which is regarded as of peculiar sanctity. The surrounding country is well wooded and watered, and near the town the soil is good. It is eighty-six miles south-east from Poonah. Long. 75. 12. E. Lat. 17. 56. N.
