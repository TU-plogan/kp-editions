PUTNEY, a parish of the hundred of Brixton, in the county of Surrey. It is four miles from London, on the south bank of the Thames, over which there is a bridge that unites it to Fulham. It is situated on a gentle elevation, many of the houses in it commanding pleasant views on the river. It contains many houses of noblemen and gentlemen within it, some of the first order, and with highly ornamented gardens. It was the birthplace of Thomas Lord Cromwell, of West, Bishop Ely his contemporary, and, at a later period, of Gibbon the historian of Rome. It was also the head-quarters of Oliver Cromwellâ€™s army. The population amounted in 1801 to 2428, in 1811 to 2881, in 1821 to 3394, and in 1831 to 3811.
