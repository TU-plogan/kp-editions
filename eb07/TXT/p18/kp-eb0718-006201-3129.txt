PLUG, a certain piece of timber, formed like the frustum of a cone, and used to stop a hause-hole, or a breach made in the body of a ship by cannon-balls. Plugs used for the former purpose are therefore called hauseplugs, and those for the latter shot-plugs ; and they are formed of various sizes, in proportion to the holes made by the different sizes of shot which may penetrate the shipâ€™s sides or bottom in battle. Accordingly they are always ready for this purpose.
