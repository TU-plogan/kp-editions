PYRENEES, Eastern. The eastern extremity of the Pyrenees gives its name to a department watered by the Agly, the Tet, and the Tech, which flow in an easterly direction towards the Mediterranean Sea. It possesses a warm and genial climate, very favourable to the culture of the vine; but the lands near the sea are marshy, from which arise exhalations prejudicial to health. The chief towns are Perpignan, the seat of a prefecture and a diocese, on the right bank of the Tet; Elne, on the left bank of the Tech, the site of the ancient Illiberis, under whose walls Hannibal encamped; Foix, in the valley watered by the Ariège; and Saint Giron’s, on the Salat, a small river, on which are several paper-mills and other manufactories. The extent of territory of the department is 209 geographical square miles. It is divided into three arrondissements, seventeen cantons, and 226 communes. The inhabitants in 1837 amounted to 164,325.

Pyrenees, Upper, a department of France, which derives its name from the highest part of the Pyrenees. It is formed almost entirely of the ancient country of Bigorre. From the plains in the confines of Gers, to Mont Perdu, the highest point of the department, is experienced every gradation of European climate. No great quantity of corn is raised, but the country abounds in wine. The shepherds who inhabit the mountains are an active and hardy race of men. The principal towns are, Vicq en Bigorre, on the right bank of the Lâchez; Tarbes, on the banks of the Adour; Bagnères de Bigorre, remarkable for its mineral waters; Campan, which carries on a considerable trade in paper and woollen stuffs; Cauterets, not far from the summits of the Pyrenees, celebrated as the residence of Margaret of Valois. The thermal springs of Bareges vary in temperature from 106° to 122° of Fahrenheit. The department consists of 229 geographical square miles, divided into three arrondissements, twenty-six cantons, and 492 communes. The population in 1837 amounted to 244,170.

Pyrenees, Lower, includes part of Navarre and the ancient principality of Béarn. The Pyrenees do not occupy one half of the department, and do not rise to a great elevation. The heights are crowned with forests, and the valleys are fruitful and well peopled. The Bidassoa bounds the department on the west, and determines the line which separates the kingdoms of France and Spain. Near the extremity of the heights that command the fruitful valley watered by the Gave, stands Pau, a town of some elegance, celebrated as the birthplace of many extraordinary persons, amongst whom may be mentioned Henry IV., Gaston de Foix, the celebrated Duke de Nemours, and Joan d’Albert. Further down the river stands Orthés, renowned as the scene of a destructive battle fought at the gates of the town in 1814, where the Duke of Wellington purchased a victory [7:18:747] over Marshal Soult with the loss of 10,000 men. Bayonne, a place of considerable trade, and a strongly fortified town, stands at the confluence of the Nive and Adour, about two miles from the Bay of Biscay. The department contains 379 geographical square miles, divided into five arrondissements, forty cantons, and 630 communes. The population in 1837 amounted to 244,170.
