POLYCLETUS, a celebrated statuary and architect, who is said to have been a native of Sicyon, and a disciple of Ageladas. He was the fellow-disciple of Myron. But it seems doubtful whether he was born at Sicyon, since Plato, who was his contemporary, calls him in his dialogue entitled Protagoras, a native of Argos, and Maximus of Tyre expressly says that the statue of Juno was a work of Polycletus of Argos. He is not, however, to be confounded with another statuary of Argos, who lived at a later period. It is believed that he was born about 480 b. c., and was still alive 405 b. c., after the battle of Oegos-potamos, as Pausanias states that he executed one of the bronze tripods which the Spartans consecrated in the temple of Apollo at Amyclae. By far the most celebrated of his statues was that of the Argive Juno, which is thought to have been executed about 416 b. c., eighteen years after the consecration of Jupiter of Olympia, and twenty or twenty-four years after that of the Minerva of the Parthenon. The statue of Juno was colossal, and seated on a golden throne, in a majestic attitude; the head, breast, arms, and feet, were of ivory, and the drapery of gold. She had a crown on her head, on which the artist had represented the Hours and Graces. In one hand she held a sceptre, with a cuckoo seated on it; in the other she bore a pomegranate. Her mantle was ornamented with vine branches, and her feet rested on the skin of a lion. Another celebrated statue was called Canon, or the Rule, because it was so perfect that it was looked upon as the model after which all others ought to be made. Galen says, that he composed a treatise on the proportions which constitute the harmony, and consequently the beauty of the human body, and that his statue was designed to illustrate his work. Winckelman suspects that this statue was also called Doryphorus, as Lysippus states that he formed his taste principally by studying it. The group called Canephorae, two young girls carrying sacred baskets on their heads, formed part of the plunder of Verres, carried off from Messana in Sicily. It is believed that we have still a copy of his Diadumenus, in a young athlete attaching to his forehead a garland as the sign of victory, which is now in the Museo Borbonicoat Naples. This Diadumenos was sold for about one hundred talents. As an architect, Polycletus is known to have constructed two buildings at Epidaurus, which are highly spoken of; the Tholus, a circular building, and a theatre, of which considerable remains are still to be seen. Varro thought that he had too much sameness in his statues; and Quintilian says that he never was able to represent the awful majesty of the gods, probably meaning such statues as the Jupiter and Minerva of Phidias. Amongst his pupils were Asopodorus, Aristides, Dinon, Athenodorus, and Pericletus the brother of Naucydes.
