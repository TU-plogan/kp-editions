PORT-AU-PRINCE, the capital and seat of govern- , ment of the republic of Hayti, formerly called St. Domingo or Española, one of the West India Islands. It stands at the bottom of the large bay of the same name, in a situation so low and marshy as to render the climate very unhealthy. It is mostly built of wood; the streets are broad but unpaved; nor are any of its edifices remarkable for their architectural elegance. It contains the president’s palace, several literary and scientific institutions, a lazaretto, and some other public buildings. There is an academy for medicine, astronomy, law, literature, and other branches of knowledge; a drawing seminary, Lancasterian and primary schools, and a national library. There is also a military school, where the pupils receive instruction gratuitously; and several newspapers and periodical journals are published here. The city is supplied with water by a conduit three English miles in length. It has a spacious and secure port and roadstead, where five hundred vessels may anchor at once. It is surrounded by hills which command the town and harbour; and both the hills and the valliesare abundantly fertile. To the east is situated the noble and celebrated plain of Cul de Sac, extending from thirty to forty miles in length, by nine in breadth. It is chiefly laid out in sugar plantations, most ofwhich can bewatered in times of drought by means of canals admirably adapted for the purpose. Commerce is the principal occupation of the inhabitants of Port-au-Prince. The amount of imports may be estimated at twenty millions of francs; but the exports, consisting chiefly of coffee, cotton, Campeachy wood, sugar, and other articles, are much greater. This city was founded in the year 1745; but twenty-five years afterwards it was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake. It was rapidly rebuilt, but was nearly reduced to ruins by fire in 1791. In 1830, it again experienced several shocks of an earthquake, some of w hich did considerable damage. The inhabitants of the district of Port-au-Prince are estimated at about 90,000, and those of the city at about 30,000. Lat 18. 34. N. Long. 72. 27. W.
