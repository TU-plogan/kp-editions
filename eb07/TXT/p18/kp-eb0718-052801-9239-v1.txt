PRESIDENT, Praeses, is an officer, created or elected to preside over a company or assembly, and is so called in contradistinction to the other members, who are termed residents. Lord President of tπe Council, is a great officer of the crown, who has precedence next after the lord chancellor and the lord treasurer. The lord president is as ancient as the time of king John, when he was styled consiliarius capitalis. His office is to attend upon the king, to propose business at the council-table, and to report to the king the several matters transacted there.
