PLOMO, in Metallurgy, is a name given by the Spaniards who have the care of the silver mines, to the silver ore when found adhering to the surface of stones, and incrusting their cracks and cavities like small and loose grains of gunpowder. Though these grains be few in number, and the rest of the stone have no silver in it, yet they are always very happy when they find it, as it is a certain token that there is a rich vein somewhere in the neighbourhood. And if in digging forwards they still meet with these grains, or the plomo, in greater quantity, it is a certain sign that they are getting nearer and nearer the good vein.
