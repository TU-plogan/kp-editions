POOLE, Matthew, a very learned writer in the seventeenth century, was born at York in 1624. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and afterwards incorporated in the university of Oxford. He succeeded Dr Anthony Tuckney in the rectory of St Michael de Quern, in London, about 1648. In 1658 he set on foot a project for maintaining youths of great parts at the universities, and was honoured with the approbation of the heads of houses in both of them. He solicited the affair with so much vigour, that in a short time L.900 per annum was procured for that purpose; but this design was laid aside at the Restoration. In 1662 he was ejected from his living for nonconformity. He was ten years employed in composing his Synopsis Criticoum ; and, besides this great work, he published several other pieces. When Titus Oatesâ€™s depositions concerning the popish plot were printed, our author found his name in the list of those who were to be cut off, so that he was obliged to retire to Holland, where he died in 1679, leaving behind him the character of a very able critic and casuist.
