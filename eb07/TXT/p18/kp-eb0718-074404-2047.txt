PUY de Dôme, a department in the south of France, formed out of the ancient province Lower Auvergne. It extends in north latitude from 45. 26. to 46.11. and in east longitude from 2. 17. to 3. 54. In extent it is 3389 square miles, and is divided into five arrondissements, and these into fifty cantons and 438 communes, containing by the last census 573,100 persons. It is bounded on the north by the department of Allier, on the east by that of the Loire, on the south by the Upper Loire and the Cantal, and on the west by the Corrèze and by the Creuse. It is an elevated district, covered with hills and mountains, with few or no plains, but some beautiful valleys, not very wide, through which the streams flow. One of the most picturesque of these vales is that of Limagne, which extends along both banks of the Allier, from the entrance of that river into the department, to its passage out of it. It is remarkable for its fertility. The roads are planted with large walnut and elm trees, the sides of the hills arê covered with vines, and on the tops are ornamented with towns, villages, and castles. Some of the mountains in the northern part, the highest of which reach to about 4000 feet, have marks of volcanic origin, and are composed of basalt or of lava. In the south the elevations are greater, and that called the Mont d’Or is about 6300 feet. The chief river is the Allier, which comes out of the department of the Upper Loire, is navigable in its course through Puy de Dôme, and receives the waters of various streams. There are several lakes in some of the districts, but none of them of any great extent. The climate is raw and variable on the mountains, but in the valleys it is mild, intensely hot in summer, and severely cold in winter; and occasionally most violent storms, accompanied with hail, are experienced in the most fertile of the valleys. The chief products, besides corn, of which there is a surplus for the supply of the neighbouring departments, are hemp, flax, wax, honey, fruit, especially cherries, walnuts, and wine. The last is abundant, but in general not highly estimated. The best is in the valley of Limagne; but even there the greater part of the produce of the vines is distilled into brandy. The nuts arc so abundant that a great quantity of oil is made from them; and as fuel is scarce, many of the walnut trees are made use of for that purpose. There are mines both of iron and of coal, but they are not extensively worked. The manufactures are linen cloths, blond lace, silk stockings, some cotton, and thin woollens, ribbons, jewellery, leather, and paper. The population is so much beyond the means of employment, that a great number of labourers yearly go to the neighbouring department to procure work in summer, and return in winter with the wages which they have earned. The department elects four deputies to the legislature. It is in the diocese of Clermont, and under the judicial power of the courts of law at Riom.
