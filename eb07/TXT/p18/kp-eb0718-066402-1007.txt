PROPRETOR, or Propraetor, a Roman magistrate, who, having discharged the office of praetor at home, was sent, into a province to command there with his former praetorial authority. It was also an appellation given to those who, without having been praetors at Rome, were sent extraordinarily into the provinces to administer justice with the authority of praetors.
