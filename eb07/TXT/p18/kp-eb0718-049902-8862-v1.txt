POTENTIAL, in the schools, is used to denote and distinguish a kind of qualities which are supposed to exist in the body in potentia only; that is, to be capable in some measure of affecting and impressing on us the ideas of sueh qualities, though not actually inherent in themselves. In this sense we say, potential heat, potential cold, &c.

Potential, in Grammar, an epithet applied to one of the moods of verbs. The potential is the same in form with the subjunctive, and is, aeeording to Ruddiman, implied in that mood, for which reason it is rejected by that grammarian; but others consider that it differs from the subjunctive by always implying in it either possum, volo, or debeo. It is also called the permissive mood, because it often implies a permission or concession to do a thing.
