PROSEUCHE, . in Antiquity, properly signifies prayer ; but it is taken for the places of prayer of the Jews, and was pretty nearly the same as their synagogues. But the synagogues ' were originally in the cities, and were covered places; whereas, for the most part, the proseuches were out of ⅛e cities, and on the banks of rivers, having no covering except perhaps the shade of some trees or covered galleries. The word is Greek, οτgοσευχη, prayer.
