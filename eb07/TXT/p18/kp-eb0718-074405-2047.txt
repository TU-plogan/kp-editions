PUZZULANA or Pozzolana Terra, is a grayish kind of earth employed in Italy for building under· water. The best is found about Puteoli, Baiae, and Cumae, in the kingdom of Naples, from the first of which places it derives its name. It is a volcanic product, composed of heterogeneous substances, thrown out from the burning mouths of volcanoes in the form of ashes; sometimes in such large quantities, and v∕ith so great violence, that whole provinces have been covered with it at a considerable distance. In the year 79 of the common era, the cities of Herculanum, Pompeii, and Stabia, although at the distance of many miles from Vesuvius, were nevertheless buried under the matter thrown out during these dreadful eruptions. This volcanic earth is of gray, brown, or blackish colour, and of a loose glanular, or dusty and rough, porous or spongy texture, resembling a clay hardened by fire, and then reduced to a gross powder. It contains various heterogeneous substances mixed with it. Its specific gravity is from 2500 to 2800, and it is in some degree magnetic; but it scarcely effervesces with acids, although partially soluble in them. It easily melts per se ; but its most distinguishing property is, that it hardens very suddenly when mixed with one third of its weight of lime and water; and forms a cement which is more durable in water than any other. According to Bergman’s analysis, a hundred parts of Terra Pozzolana contain from fifty-five to sixty of siliceous earth, twenty of argillaceous, five or six of calcareous, and from fifteen to twenty of iron. Its effects, however, in cement may perhaps depend only on the iron it contains. It is evidently a martial argillaceous marl that has suffered a moderate heat. Its hardening power arises from the dry state of the half-baked argillaceous particles, which makes them imbibe water rapidly, and thus accelerates the desiccation of the calcareous part; and also from the quantity and peculiar state of the iron and manganese which it contains, on which metals its properties chiefly depend. It is found not only in Italy, but also in France, in England, and elsewhere.
