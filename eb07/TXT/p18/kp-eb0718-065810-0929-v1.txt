PROME, a city of the Birman empire, in the province of Ava, situated on the eastern bank of the Irrawaddy River, in a fertile plain between the hills and the river. It was the original and natural boundary of the Birman empire to the south, before conquest had extended its dominion beyond it. It was formerly surrounded by two walls, constructed partly of brick and partly of timber. It is composed of the myo or fort, being a common square stockade, resembling that of Rangoon, but much larger; and of two suburbs, the one lying to the east and the other to the west of it, along the banks of the river. The first contains two streets running parallel to each other and to the river. The houses are few and scattered; and the principal space is occupied by gardens, or rather by patches of ground planted with fruit or ornamental trees, or coarse esculent vegetables, such as gourds, pumpkins, and cucumbers, the whole overgrown with rank weeds, and without order or neatness. Prome is, according to Mr Crawford, a thriving place; and he estimates its population at 10,000. It carries on a very considerable trade in grain, oil, wax, ivory, iron, lead, flagstones, and timber. The rains of the former city, which extend far beyond the modern town, contain the remains of a number of temples dedicated to Buddha. Adjacent to the town is a royal menagerie of elephants, consisting of two rows of lofty and well-built stables, in which these animals are lodged during the rains. Long. 95. E. Lat. 18. 50. N.
