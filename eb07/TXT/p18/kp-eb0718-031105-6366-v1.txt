POLYDORUS, a son of Priam by Hecuba, or, according to others, by Laothe, the daughter of Altes, king of Pedasus. Being young and inexperienced when Troy was besieged by the Greeks, his father removed him to the court of Polymnestor, king of Thrace, to whose care he intrusted the greater part of his treasures, until his country should be freed from foreign invasion. On the death of Priam, Polymnestor made himself master of the riches which were in his possession; and to insure them the more, he murdered the young prince, and threw his body into the sea, where it was found by Hecuba. According to Virgil, his body was buried near the shore by his assassin; and there grew on his grave a myrtle, the boughs of which dropped blood, when Aeneas, going to Italy, attempted to tear them from the tree.
