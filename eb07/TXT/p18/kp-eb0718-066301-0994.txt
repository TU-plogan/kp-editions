PROPHECY is a word derived from πvοφnitia, and in its original import signifies the prediction of future events. As God alone can perceive with certainty the future actions of free agents, and the remote consequences of those laws of nature which he himself established, prophecy, when clearly fulfilled, affords the most convincing evidence of an intimate and supernatural communion between God and the person who uttered the prediction. Hence this, together with the power of working miracles, is indeed the only evidence which can be given of such a communion. See Theology.
