PLATAEAE, in Ancient Geography, the name of a strong town in Boeotia, which from its situation was exposed to the north wind. It was burned to the ground by Xerxes; and it was famous for the defeat of Mardonius the Persian general, as also for the signal victory of the Lacedaemonians and other Greeks under Pausanias the Lacedaemonian, and Aristides an Athenian general, in memory of which the Greeks erected a temple to Jupiter Eleutherius, and instituted games which they called Eleutheria. Plataeae stood at the foot of Mount Citlrteron, on the road to Athens and Megara, and on the confines of Attica and Megaris.
