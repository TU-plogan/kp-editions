PONTOON, in War, a kind of flat-bottomed boat, the body of which is composed of wood lined without and within with tin. Pontoons serve for the construction of bridges over rivers, to facilitate military operations. The French pontoons, and those of most other powers, are made of copper on the outside; and though these cost more at first, yet they last much longer than those of tin, and, when worn out, the copper sells nearly for as much as it originally cost; whereas when ours are rendered useless, they sell for nothing. Our pontoons are twenty-one feet in length, five feet in breadth, and in depth within two feet 1∙5 inches.

Pontoon- Carriage is made with two wheels only, and two long side pieces, the fore ends of which are supported by a limber; and it serves to carry the pontoon, boards, cross-timbers, anchors, and every other thing necessary for making a bridge.

Pontoon -Bridge consists of pontoons slipped into the water, and placed about five or six feet asunder, each fastened with an anchor when the river has a strong current; or to a strong rope that goes across the river, running through the rings of the pontoons. Each boat has an anchor, cable-baulks, and chests. The baulks are about five or six inches square, and twenty-one feet in length. The chests are boards joined together by wooden bars, about three feet in breadth and twelve feet in length. The baulks are laid across the pontoons at some distance from one another, and the chests upon them are joined close; which in a very short time makes a bridge capable of supporting any weight.
