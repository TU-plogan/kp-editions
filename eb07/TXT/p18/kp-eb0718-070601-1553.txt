PULTAWA, a government of the Russian empire, extending in north latitude from 48. 48. to 51. 4. and in east longitude from 30. 20. to 35. 55., and comprehending 16,236 square miles. It is bounded on the north-west by Tchernigow and a part of Kursk, on the north-east by Slobodsk-Ukraine, on the south-east by Ykaterinoslav, on the south-west by Cherson, and on the west by Kiew. It contains twenty-two cities and towns, and 983 parishes, with 1,933,000 inhabitants. It is generally a plain, with scarcely any elevations, and is drained by the river Dnieper, which passes on its western sides, receives the waters of all the smaller streams, and is navigable to the sea. It is perhaps the best cultivated and the most productive of all the Russian provinces, yielding very good crops of corn, chiefly rye, and also affording more of wheat, barley, oats, and buckwheat, than the domestic consumption requires. The produce of flax, hemp, and tobacco, as well as beans and pease, is abundant. Wine is raised, but not copiously, because, there being no hills to protect the vines from the sharp northerly and easterly winds, they are injured by frost. The steppes cover a part of the province, but they produce excellent grass, and fatten numerous herds of black cattle. There are no mines in the province; but some chalk, limestone, and saltpetre are obtained. There are some manufactures of woollen and of linen cloth of the coarser kinds, and some excellent leather is prepared. The chief manufactured article for exportation is corn brandy, to which purpose the greater portion of the surplus grain is applied. Though the river Dnieper is always navigable, yet the small streams are not so, except for a short time in the spring; and as the roads are heavy, this obstacle opposes the export of the productions, and limits the trade to very narrow bounds.

Pultawa, a city of Russia, the capital of the government of the same name, as well as of the circle. It is situated on the river Borskla, where the Pnltawka falls-into that stream. It is the see of a bishop of an extensive diocese, is surrounded with earthen walls, has a cathedral and nine other churches, 1200 houses, and 10,000 inhabitants. It has been rendered celebrated as the place of refuge of Charles XII. of Sweden, after his defeat in 1709. It is 948 miles from St Petersburg. Long. 34. 35. E. Lat. 43. 33. N.
