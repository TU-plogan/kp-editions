ERIE, a great lake of North America. It is about 280 miles in length from south-west to north-east, from ten to sixty-three in breadth, and about 658 in circumference. It has a depth of 120 feet; and its surface, which contains 12,000 square miles, is elevated 334 feet above that of Lake Ontario, with which it is connected by a canal, and 565 feet above the tide water at Albany, with which it is joined by the great Erie Canal. Through this immense sheet of water runs the boundary line which separates Canada from the United States. On its northern shore there are numerous projecting rocks, which render the navigation dangerous, particularly as there is no shelter from storms in that quarter. On the southern shore, however, there are several tolerably good harbours. The lake is navigated by a number of steam-boats, which of course are continually increasing in number, as civilization advances and commerce extends. The navigation upwards is rendered tedious, on account of a constant current which sets down the lake; and this is increased by the north-western and south-western winds, which here prevail. Long. 78. 35. to 83. 10. W. Lat. 4L 20. to 42. 50. N.
