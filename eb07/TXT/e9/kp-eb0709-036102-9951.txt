ERISICHTHON, in fabulous history, a Thessalian, son of Triops, who derided Ceres and cut down her groves. This impiety irritated the goddess, who afflicted him with continual hunger; in consequence of which he squandered all his possessions in order to gratify the cravings of his appetite, and at last devoured his own limbs for want of food. Some say that his daughter had the power of transforming herself into whatever animal she pleased, and that she made use of this artifice in order to maintain her father, who had sold her,Â· after which she assumed another shape, and again became his property.
