EUMENES, a native of Cardia, a city in the Thracian Chersonesus, was born 360 and died 315 b. c. At a very early age he was employed as private secretary by Philip king of Macedonia, on account of his friendship for his father. On the death of that prince he was confirmed in the same office by Alexander; and it was in this capacity that he accompanied that monarch into Asia. So highly did Alexander esteem him that he gave him in marriage a Persian lady of noble birth, sister to her who had married Ptolemy. Upon the death of Alexander, the provinces and armies were divided amongst his generals, and the countries assigned to Eumenes were Cappadocia and Paphlagonia, with the sea-coast of Pontus as far as Tra∙ pezus; but as they were not yet subdued, Leonatus and Antigonus were commissioned to put him in possession. Antigonus disregarded the orders of Perdiccas, and Leonatus having in vain attempted to induce Eumenes to accompany him to the assistance of Antipater in Europe, made an unsuccessful attack on his life. Eumenes escaped and joined Perdiccas, who assisted him in taking possession of Cappadocia.

About this time Craterus and Antipater, having reduced Greece, determined to pass into Asia and overthrow the power of Perdiccas. It may be easily imagined that Cappadocia was the first object of their attack; and accordingly Eumenes was appointed commander of all the forces in the neighbouring countries. But to this Neoptolemus, One of the generals, refused to submit; and being defeated by Eumenes, he fled to Antipater and Craterus. The presence of Antipater was required in Cilicia, and the army destined to act against Eumenes was therefore commanded by Craterus and Neoptolemus. They were, however, completely defeated; Neoptolemus was killed, and Craterus died of his wounds, 321 u.c. The pride of the Macedonians was hurt by this defeat of two of their generals by a person whom they considered as a stranger; and the news having reached them a few days after the death of Perdiccas, the Macedonian chiefs condemned Eumenes to death, and charged Antipater and Antigonus with the execution of their order. Eumenes was at first successful, but being defeated through the treachery of one of his officers, he fled to Nora, a strong fortress on the confines of Cappadocia and Lycaonia. Here he made a successful resistance, and was afterwards appointed by Olympias to command the army against Antigonus, whose intentions could no longer be misunderstood. He gained a battle against his adversary, but was unlucky enough to lose the baggage and wives belonging to his Macedonian phalanx. Antigonus offered to restore them on condition that the soldiers would surrender Eumenes into his hands, which they were base enough to agree to; and Antigonus immediately murdered his opponent, in the fortieth year of his age. (Plutarch, Life of Eumenes; Nepos; Diodor. Sic. xviii. 30.

Eumenes I. a king of Pergamus, succeeded his uncle Philotaerus 263 b. c., and having engaged in hostilities with Antiochus, king of Syria, defeated him near Sardes. But he fell a victim to his habits of drunkenness 241 b.c. and was succeeded by his cousin Attalus. (Strabo, xι∏∙ 624; Athenaeus, x. p. 445.)

Eumenes II. eldest son of Attalus I. succeeded to the government of Pergamus on his father’s death, 197 B. c-, and continued to maintain the intimate alliance which it had been his father’s policy to form with the Romans. Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, who at that time se ' cretly meditated contesting the supremacy of the Romans, tried to seduce him by offering one of his daughters in marriage; but Eumenes suspecting the interested intentions of Antiochus, prudently refused the honour of th' s alliance. In the war which soon afterwards broke out he proved himself the firm friend of the Romans, and assisted Livius Salinator in his victory over the fleet of Antiochus (191 b. c.), on which occasion he was greatly distinguished for his bravery. Again, in the decisive batte [7:9:401] which was fought at the foot of Mount Sipylus, in which Antiochus was completely defeated (188 b. c.), the troops of Eumenes greatly distinguished themselves; and on the conclusion of peace this prince received a great addition to his territories at the expense of Antiochus. He was afterwards attacked by Prusias, king of Bithynia, whose forces were under the command of the celebrated Hannibal, and by Pharnaces, king of Pontus; but the powerful mediation of the Romans compelled all parties to lay down their arms. Having become acquainted with the designs of Perseus against the Romans, Eumenes set out for Rome (172 b. c.), to warn the senate of the preparations for war which were making against them. On his return he wished to offer sacrifices to Apollo at Delphi, when he was attacked by a party of assassins stationed by Perseus, and narrowly escaped with his life. He was-then carried by his friends to the island of Aegina, where he remained in concealment for some time. A report of his death having reached his brother, the latter assumed the reins of government, and married Stratonice the wife of Eumenes. When he reappeared, this proceeding does not seem to have changed his conduct towards his brother; and they lived in the same amity as before. His close intimacy with the Romans seems to have been broken off towards the end of his reign, and that people endeavoured to embroil him with the neighbouring princes. In this embarrassing state of affairs he died 157 b. c. leaving his throne to his brother Attalus II. (See Sevin, Recherches sur les Rois de Pergame, in the Mémoires de ľ Acad, des Iriser. xii. p. 260.)

Eumenes, a celebrated orator of Athens about the beginning of the fourth century, some of whose harangues and orations are still extant. Also an historical writer in Alexander’s army.
