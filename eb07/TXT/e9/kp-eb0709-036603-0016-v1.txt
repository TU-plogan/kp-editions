ERYX, a son of Butes and Venus, who, relying upon his strength, challenged all strangers to fight him with the cestus. After many had yielded to his superior dexterity, Hercules accepted his challenge, and Eryx was killed in the combat, and buried on the mountain, where he had built a temple to Venus (Virg. Aen. v. 402). A mountain of Sicily near Drepanum also received its name from Eryx, who was buried there. This mountain was so steep that the houses which were built upon it seemed every moment ready to tumble down; but Daedalus enlarged the top, which he enclosed with a strong wall, and also consecrated to Venus Erycina a golden heifer, which so much resembled life that it seemed to exceed the power of art.
