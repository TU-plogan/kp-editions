EURYSTHEUS, a king of Argos and Mycenae, son of Sthenclus, and Nicippe the daughter of Pelops. Juno hastened his birth by two months, that he might come into the world before Hercules the son of Alemena, as the younger of the two was doomed by order of Jupiter to be subservient to the will of the other. This natural right was cruelly exercised by Eurystheus, who was jealous of the fame of Hercules; and who, in order to destroy so powerful a relation, imposed upon him the most dangerous and uncommon enterprises, well known by the name of the labours of Hercules. The success of Hercules in achieving these perilous labours having greatly alarmed Eurystheus, he furnished himself with a brazen vessel, in which he might secure himself a safe retreat in case of danger. After the death of Hercules, Eurystheus renewed his cruelties against the children of the hero, and made war against Ceyx, king of Trachinia, because he had given them support, and treated them with hospitality. But he was killed in the prosecution of this war by Hyllus, the son of Hercules, and his head was sent to Alemena, the mother of Hercules, who, mindful of the cruelties which her son had suffered, insulted it, and tore out the eyes with inveterate fury. Eurystheus was succeeded on the throne of Argos by Atreus his nephew. The death of Eurystheus happened about thirty years before the Trojan war.
