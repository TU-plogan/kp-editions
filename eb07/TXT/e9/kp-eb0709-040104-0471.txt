EUNOMIANS, in Ecclesiastical History, Christian heretics in the fourth century. They were a branch of the Arians, and took their name from Eunomius, bishop of Cyzicus, who died at a very advanced age, about the year 374, after experiencing a variety of sufferings. The greater part of his works are lost. Besides two or three small pieces, however, there remains a confession of his faith, which Cave has inserted in his Historia Literaria, from a manuscript in Archbishop Tennisonâ€™s library.
