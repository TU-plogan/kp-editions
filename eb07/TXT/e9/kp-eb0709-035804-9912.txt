ERATOSTRATUS, an Ephesian who burned the famous temple of Diana, the same night on which Alexander the Great was born. This burning, as some writers have observed, was not prevented or seen by the goddess of the place, who was then present at the labour of Olympias, and at the birth of the conqueror of Persia. Eratostratus committed this crime merely to eternize his name by a memorable though infamous action.
