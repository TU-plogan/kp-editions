EUXINUS PONTUS, Black Sea, lying between Europe and Asia, into which several of the largest rivers in the world flow; on the west the Danube, Dniester, and Dnieper, on the east the Phasis, and on the south the Helys and Thermodon. A large peninsula stretches into the centre, and divides it into two great gulfs; the cape in the Crimea was called Criu-metopon (Karadje-Bourmin,'), and that in Asia, Carambis (^Kerempi-Bouroun) i being distant from each other 170 miles. According to Strabo, its circumference was 25,000 stadia, equal to 715 leagues, which is very nearly correct. The ancients believed that at one time it had no communication with the Mediterranean, but that the rivers which flow into this sea having opened for themselves a passage, the waters rushed into the Mediterranean by the Hellespont, and caused that sea to burst a passage through the Straits of Gibraltar. (Strab. i. 49.) In the time of Diodorus the inhabitants of the island Samothrace preserved the recollection of an inundation which had elevated the waters of the Mediterranean to such a height that their ancestors were obliged to take refuge on the summits of their highest mountains; and so late as the first century of the Christian era they had the custom of sacrificing on altars placed on the spot to which they believed the waters to have risen. There seems every reason to believe that the Black Sea, Caspian, and Aral, were once united, and perhaps found a vent to the North Sea by the valley through which the river Oby flows from Tobolsk. This immense lake was bounded to the north by the lofty mountains of Asia Minor and Armenia; and when by their weight the waters burst the barrier opposed to them on the side of the Bosphorus, it may easily be conceived with what a fearful shock they must have poured into the Mediterranean.
