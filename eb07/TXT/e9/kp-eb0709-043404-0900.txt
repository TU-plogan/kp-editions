EVORA, a city of Portugal, in the province of Alemtejo. It is the seat of an archbishop, and is well fortified, though the fortifications are now of no possible use as means of defence. There is a most superb aqueduct, which conveys fresh water to the city from the distance of four or five miles. A college, or rather university, was established here in 1553; but it has gradually dwindled away, and is now almost extinct. This city contains 3000 houses and 12,000 inhabitants; and in its neighbourhood are many Roman ruins, particularly one of a temple to Diana. Lat. 38. 28. N.
