EULOGY, Eulogia, in Ecclesiastical History. When the Greeks cut a loaf or piece of bread to consecrate it, they broke the rest into little bits, and distributed it among the persons who had not yet communicated, or sent it to persons who were absent; and these pieces of bread were what they called eulogies. The word is Greek, iυλoy∕α, formed from eυ, ,bene, well, and λεyω, dico, I say or speak; meaning benedictum, or blessed. The Latin church, for a great many ages, had something like eulogies; and thence arose the use of the holy bread. The name eulogy was likewise given to loaves ór cakes brought to church by the faithful to have them blessed. Lastly, the use of the term passed hence to mere presents made to a person without any benediction.

Eulogy likewise means an encomium pronounced on any person by reason of some virtue or good quality.
