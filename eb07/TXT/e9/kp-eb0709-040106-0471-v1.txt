EUPATRIDAe, in Antiquity, a name given by Theseus to the nobility of Athens, as distinguished from the Geomori and Demiurgi. By the establishment of Theseus, the Eupatridae had the right of choosing magistrates, teaching and dispensing the laws, and interpreting religious mysteries. In all other matters the whole city was reduced to an equality. The Geomori were husbandmen, and inferior to the Eupatridae in point of fortune; the Demiurgi were artificers, and fell short of the Eupatridae in number.
