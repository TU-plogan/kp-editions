ETYMOLOGY, that branch of grammar which explains the origin and derivation of words, and which has for its object to arrive at their primary signification; for which reason Quintilian calls it originatio. The word is formed from the Greek, ιτυμος, verus, true, and λ>yω, dico I speak; and hence Cicero calls etymology notatio and veriloquium ; though Quintilian chooses rather to denominate it originatio.

A judicious inquiry into etymologies is thought by some to be of considerable use, because nations who value themselves for their antiquity have always looked upon the antiquity of their language as one of the best titles they could plead; and the etymologists, by seeking the true and original reason of the notions and ideas attached to each word and expression, may often furnish an argument of antiquity, from the remaining traces thereof, compared with the ancient uses. Add to this, that etymologies are necessary for the thorough understanding of a language. For, to explain a term precisely, there seems a necessity for recurring to its original import, in order justly and satisfactorily to explain its meaning in its secondary applications. The force and extent of a word is best conceived when a person knows its origin and etymology.

It is objected, however, that etymology is in some measure arbitrary, and built altogether on conjectures and appearances; and the etymologists are charged with deriving their words from whatever source they please. Nor indeed is it an easy matter to go back into the ancient British and Gaulish ages, and to follow, as it were, by the tract, the various imperceptible alterations which a language has undergone from age to age; and as these alterations have sometimes been merely owing to caprice, it is easy to assume a mere fancy or conjecture as a regular analogy; so that the public may easily be prejudiced against a science which seems to stand on so precarious a footing. It must be owned, however, that etymologies are frequently so far fetched as sometimes to render it impossible to perceive any resemblance or correspondence between roots which are alleged to be identical. Quintilian has shown that the ancient etymologists, notwithstanding all their learning, adopted very ridiculous derivations.
