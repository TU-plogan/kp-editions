EROUAD, or Erroad, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Coimbetoor. It contained during the reign of Hyder about 3000 houses, but was reduced to one third in the reign of Tippoo; and during the invasion of GÃªnerai Meadows the town was destroyed. It is now fast recovering, and contains about 400 houses. It was taken by the British in 1768, and retaken the same year by Hyder. It was again taken by the British in 1790, and retaken by Tippoo; but it came into the final possession of the British, along with the province, in 1799. A canal has lately been cut in its vicinity, and is expected to be productive of much benefit to the inhabitants. Long. 77. 50. E. Lat. 11. 19. N.
