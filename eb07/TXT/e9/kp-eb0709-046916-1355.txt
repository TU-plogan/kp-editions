EZEKIEL, a canonical book of the Old Testament, referring chiefly to the degenerate manners and corruptions of the Jews at the time when it was written. It abounds with fine sentences and rich comparisons, and discovers much learning in regard to profane matters.
[7:9:470]

Ezekiel was carried captive to Babylon with Jehoiachin, and began his prophecies in the fifth year of the captivity. He was contemporary with Jeremiah, who prophesied at the same time in Judaea, and foretold many events, particularly the destruction of the temple, the fatal catastrophe of those who revolted from Babylon to Egypt, and the happy return of the Jews to their native land.
