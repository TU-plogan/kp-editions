ERITH, a town of the county of Kent, in the hundred of Lessness and lathe of Sutton, fourteen miles from London. It stands on the right bank of the Thames. It is chiefly inhabited by fishermen and other seafaring people; but Belvedere House, on the site of an ancient monastery, is one of the most striking objects to passengers in vessels ascending or descending the Thames. The population amounted in 1801 to 969, in 1811 to 1119, in 1821 to 1363, and in 1831 to 1533.
