EXETER, a large city, the capital of the county of Devon, 170 miles from London. It rises gradually from the banks of the river Ex; and the whole city being on a declivity, it i s remarkably clean, notwithstanding the narrowness of all but the principal street. The best parts are without the line of the ancient walls; and both the suburbs of Southernay and Nornay are beautiful and well built. The surrounding country is highly fruitful, affording good 0r , tl > pasture, dairy, and fattening land, and abounding in ru, fi especially apples, from which the best of cider is P entifully yielded. These circumstances, with the cheapness offish and poultry, and the salubrity of the air, con- ∏bute to attract to Exeter numerous families of easy but moderate fortune.

Exeter was formerly the emporium of the thinner kind 0 woollen goods, such as serges, druggets, estamines, and long ells, which were spun and woven in the towns around, and dyed and finished within the city. From thence they were shipped to Holland, Italy, and especially to Spain, and many were supplied to the East India Company; but the introduction of machinery, and the lower price of fuel in the north of England, have now nearly destroyed those branches of trade, with the exception of that for the supply of India, which is still considerable. As Exeter is a kind of metropolis for Devon and Cornwall, it has considerable internal trade, and is the channel by which these counties are supplied with many' foreign commodities. 1he river Ex is so far navigable that, by means of locks, vessels of 150 tons burden can come up to the city; but those of greater draught of water remain at Topsham,’ three miles lower, and the largest of all at Exmouth, at the mouth of the river. Exeter contains a cathedral and fifteen other churches, besides several other places of worship for the separatists from the establishment. The cathedral is a magnificent pile, a part being very old, but many additions are of more recent construction, though on the plan originally formed. The western window is an object of peculiar admiration. The sec includes nearly the whole of Devonshire and Cornwall. It was first founded at Bodmin, then transferred to Taunton, afterwards to Crediton, and finally', in 1094, to Exeter. The city is governed by a corporate body, consisting of the mayor, twenty-four aldermen, and other officers. Two members are returned to the House of Commons. The markets are held on Wednesday and Friday, and there is a good fish-market daily. The population amounted in 1801 to 16,827, in 1811 to 18,896, in 1821 to 23,479, and in 1831 to 28,201.
