EXTRAVAGANTES, a name given to those decretal epistles which were published from the Clementines. They were so called, because at first they were not digested or arranged with the other papal constitutions, but seemed to be as it were detached from the canon law. They continued to be called by the same name when they were afterwards inserted in the body of the canon law. The first extravagantes were those of John XXII. successor of Clement V. The last collection was brought down to the year 1483, and was called the common extravagants, notwithstanding that they were likewise incorporated with the rest of the canon law.
