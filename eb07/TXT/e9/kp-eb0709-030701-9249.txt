EPICEDION (from εw∕, upon, and xrçőoç, funeral^), in Greek and Latin poetry, a poem, or poetical composition, on the death of any one. At the obsequies of persons of consequence there were three kinds of discourses usually made: that rehearsed at the bustum or funeral pile was called nenia ; that engraven on the tomb, epitaphion ; and that spoken in the ceremony of his funeral, epicedion. We have two beautiful epicedions in Virgil; that of Euryalus, and that of Pallas.
