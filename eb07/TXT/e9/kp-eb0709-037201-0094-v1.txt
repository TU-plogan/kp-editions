ESTHONIA, or Esthland, a province of the Russian empire, on the Baltic Sea, extending over 7106 square miles. It is divided into four circles, viz. Revel, Hapsal, Weisenstein (formerly Jenven), and Wesenburg (formerly W τ ierland). It contains five cities, one market-town, fortyseven parishes, and 630 estates of nobles, with 30,000 peasants’ dwellings. The whole population amounts to 412,000 persons. It is a level and generally a sandy district, but mixed with portions of clay and stones. It is full of brooks and morasses. As agriculture is the chief employment, the land produces rather more corn, chiefly rye, than is required for the consumption. The fishery occupies a number of hands. The manufactures are of a domestic kind; and, during the long winters, coarse linen and woollen cloths are spun and woven for their own clothing in each family. The capital, Revel, is the chief place of foreign trade, from which is exported corn, spirits, butter, salted fish and flesh, and tallow, with a small quantity of flax and flax seed.
