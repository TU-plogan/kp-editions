EXERCISE, amongst physicians, such movement and agitation of the body as produce salutary effects in the animal economy.

Exercise may be said to be either active or passive. Active exercise consists in walking, hunting, dancing, playing at bowls, and the like; as also in speaking and other labours of the body and mind. Passive exercise consists in riding in a coach, on horseback, or in any other manner. Boerhaave recommends bodily exercise in diseases of a weak and lax fibre. By riding on horseback, says his commentator, the pendulous viscera of the abdomen are shaken every moment, and gently rubbed as it were one against another, whilst in the mean time the pure air acts on the lungs with greater force. Sailing in a ship is also an exercise of great use to weak people. If the vessel proceeds with an even motion, by increasing perspiration it usually excites a wonderful alacrity, creates an appetite, and promotes digestion. These exercises arc more especially serviceable to weak people; but, in order to strengthen the body by muscular motion, running and bodily exercises are to be used. In the latter, however, persons should begin with the most gentle, such as walking, and increase it by degrees till they come to running. Those exercises of the body are most especially serviceable which at the same time give pleasure or occupation to the mind, as tennis, fencing, and the like; for which reason, the wisdom of antiquity appointed rewards to those who excelled in gymnastic exercises, that the bodies of their youth might be prepared for enduring warlike toils.

Exercise, in military affairs, is the ranging a body of soldiers in order of battle, and making them perform the several motions and military evolutions necessary to render them expert in the use of their arms. See War.
