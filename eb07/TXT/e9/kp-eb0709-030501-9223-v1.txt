EPHETAe, judges who in early times presided over he five criminal courts of justice at Athens, taking cog-ιizance of every description of homicide. They were ifty-one in number, and required to be of noble birth, >olon first separated the Areopagus from the other four :ourts; and from this time the jurisdiction of the ephetae vas confined to cases of unintentional or justifiable homi-ide. It formed part of their duty to see that the person rho had committed the act should be properly expiated ∣y sacrifice and other rites. He was obliged to leave his ountry, by a particular road, for a certain time, which vas generally eight years, though at Athens it was pro- ∣ably undetermined. During this time he was bound to eep at a distance from places of public resort; and when f ιe returned, a reconciliation took place, either with the indred, or certain chosen ploratores. (See Plutarch, ĩolon, 29; Pollux, viii. 125.)
