ESTEPONA, a small town on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, in the province of Granada, in Spain. It contained nearly 5000 inhabitants before the ravages of the epidemic fever in 1804, which almost desolated the coast on which it stands. On this occasion it lost one third of its inhabitants. The principal occupation of the people consists either in fishing, or in cultivating fruits of various kinds, and conveying them to the British garrison of Gibraltar; in making earthenware and bricks; and in the manufacture of linen, which employs twenty looms.
