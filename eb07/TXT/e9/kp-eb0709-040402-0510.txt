EUROPA, in fabulous history, a daughter of Agenor, king of Phoenicia and Telephassa. She was so beautiful that Jupiter became enamoured of her; and, in order to seduce her, he assumed the shape of a bull, and mingled with the herds of Agenor, whilst Europa, with her female attendants, were gathering flowers in the meadows. Europa caressed the beautiful animal, and at last had the courage to sit upon his back. The god took advantage of her situation, and with precipitate steps retired towards the shore, crossed the sea with Europa on his back, and arrived safe in the island of Crete. Here he assumed his original shape, and declared his love. The nymph consented, though she had once made vows of perpetual celibacy, and became mother of Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus. After this amour with the king of the gods, Europa married Asterius, king of Crete. This monarch, seeing himself without children by Europa, adopted the fruit of her loves with Jupiter, and always esteemed Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus, as his own children. Some suppose that Europa lived about 1552 years before the Christian era.
