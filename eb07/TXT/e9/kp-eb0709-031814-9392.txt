EPULUM, in Antiquity, a solemn feast prepared for the gods in times of public danger. The feast was sumptuous, and the gods being formally invited, attended by proxy; for the statues were brought on rich beds furnished with soft pillows, called pulvinaria ; and thus accommodated, their godships were placed on their couches at the most honourable part of the table. The care of the epula belonged to the epulones, and the gods were plentifully served with the richest dainties, as if they were able to eat; but the epulones performed that function for the divinities, and no doubt showed themselves competent proxies.

Epulum is also used to signify any solemn feast; and hence w e meet with epulum ferale, a funeral entertainment.
