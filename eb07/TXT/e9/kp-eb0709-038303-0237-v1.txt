ETON, or Eaton, a town situated on the left bank of the Thames, and connected with Windsor by a bridge. It is situated in the hundred of Stoke, in the county of Buckingham. The chief object of attraction is the well-endowed college, the most celebrated for the classical scholars it has produced of any institution in the kingdom. It was founded by Henry VI. in 1440, and the foundation scholars, chosen for their proficiency, are transferred to King’s College, Cambridge, of which they are admitted to fellowships as vacancies arise. The buildings are in the Gothic style, well adapted for the accommodation of the provost, masters, and scholars; but those of the latter not on the foundation are boarded and lodged at houses in the town. The number of scholars is about 300. The town depends on the college, has no market, but is supplied from that of Windsor adjoining. The population amounted in 1801 to 2026, in 1811 to 2279, in 1821 to 2475, and 1831 to 3232.
