ENS, among metaphysicians, denotes entity, being, or existence. This the schoolmen call ens reale and ens positivum, to distinguish it from their ens rationis, which is only an imaginary tiling, or exists but in the imagination.

Ens, a river in the Austrian dominions, which falls into the Danube. It is chiefly remarkable because it is the boundary line between two large provinces of that empire. These are distinguished by the names of the Upper and Lower Ens. The province of the Lower Ens is nearly in the centre of the monarchy. It is bounded on the north by Bohemia and Moravia, on the east by Hungary, on the south by Sleyermark, and on the west by the Upper Ens. It extends over 7251 square miles, and is divided into four circles, besides one consisting of the city of Vienna and its suburbs. The names of those circles are, the Upper and the Lower Vienna Forests, and the Upper and the Lower Manhartsberg. By the last census this province contained fifty-two towns, 239 market-towns, 4296 villages, 153,168 dwelling-houses, and 1,280,000 inhabitants, the proportion of males to females being about 46 to 58.

The face of the country is generally mountainous, although the warm valley of the Danube and some others contain land equal to any of Europe in productive power, and spots whose picturesque beauty is excelled by few in any country. There are a great number of smaller streams which empty themselves into the Danube, the banks of all which are ferule and pleasant. The mountain ranges are a part of the None Alps, running for the most part perpendicular to the river, and varying in height from 4400 to 7383 feet. The soil varies greatly, and as a whole, including the mountain districts, cannot be considered as fertile. The surface of the province contains 4,640,640 English acres, and the rivers, lakes, roads, rocks, and waste lands, with the site of the cities, towns, and villages, occupy about 500,000 acres. The rest of the land is appro-pnated in the following manner: 1,900,000 acres are under the plough; 112,230 are in vineyards, yielding about 31,000,000 gallons annually; 550,000 are in meadows; 382,000 in upland pastures; and 1,228,000 are woods and forests. Although agriculture is not worse conducted than in Germany generally, the product of corn is unequal to the demand for it; and it is calculated that wheat and rye scarcely yield more than five times the seed. Ιhe breeds of cattle are by no means_good, and neither sheep, oxen, nor cows are abundant. Poultry and river-fish are plentiful, as are also game both of the feathered and four-footed kinds. Wine and fruits are copiously produced, and much of both, after supplying the capital, is sent to the other provinces. The want of wood for fuel is complained of, and said to be constantly increasing, although of late years improvements have been introduced in the management of the woods, roads made to many places that were before inaccessible, and floats formed on many of the small rivers to augment the supply. The whole province is a manufacturing district, and furnishes cotton, linen, and woollen cloth, silk goods, iron and copper wares, gold, silver, and plated articles, glass, hats, paper, hosiery, and the various smaller articles of necessity or luxury. The chief commodities exported are wine, saffron, mustard, and wool. The imports consist of East and West India articles, silk, corn, flour, cattle, wood, and salt. The city of Vienna has good roads from it to the most distant parts of the empire, on which, as well as on the rivers, there is a very great traffic.

The province of the Upper Ens is the westernmost part of the Austrian dominions, with which have been incorporated a part of the Valley of the Inn, which, before 1779, belonged to Bavaria, and the larger portion of the duchy of Salzburg, ceded to Austria in 1816. It is bounded on the north by Bohemia, on the north-east by the province of the Lower Ens, on the south-east by Steyermark, on the south by Illyria, on the south-west by the Tyrol, and on the north-west by the kmgdora of Bavaria. It is 7630 square miles in extent. It is divided into five circles, namely, the Mühlvierthal, the Hausruck, the Traun, the Innvierthal, and the Salzach or Salzburg. It contained, by the last census, seventeen towns, 120 market-towns, 7488 villages, and 134,987 houses, inhabited by 867,000 individuals.

The southern part of the province is a mountainous district, covered with a portion of the None Alps, in which are Glockner on the frontier of the Tyrol, 12,221 feet in height; the Viehbachhorn, 11,770; and several others exceeding 10,000. Some of them are covered with perpetual snow, and have between them glaciers or fields of ice of more than sixty square miles in extent. On the north of the province the mountains which separate it [7:9:58] from Bohemia are lower, but fill almost the whole circle of Mühlvierthal. The province is well watered, having, besides the Danube, four other navigable rivers which discharge their waters into it. No country presents more lakes, and none are of greater beauty than the Traun, the Kammersee, the Mondsee, and the Hallstadtsee.

A country so mountainous has little opportunity of practising agriculture^ and, with the exception of Salzburg, the corn is not suppośed to produce more than four times the seed. The province contains 5,751,900 acres, of which 1,464,750 are under the plough, 44,840 are in gardens, 145 in vineyärds, 649,967 are meadows, 1,393,670 upland pasture, and 1,697,040 woods. The remainder is occupied with lakes, rivers, glaciers, roads, and sites of cities and towns. One of the chief productions of the province is salt, which is made from brine springs upon a very extensive scale at Halłein. In some parts are mines now worked. These produce' annually 2400 ounces of gold, 6400 ounces of silver, 886 quintals of copper, 490 quintals of lead, and 14,461 quintals of iron,, besides arsenic, vitriol, sulphur, and gypsum. The iron manufactures, and particularly that of knives, give employment to thousands of families. Thcrè arc also many mills on the various streams, for' spinning cotton, linėn, and woollen yarn. It is said that the woollen manufacture alone supports more than 25,000 families.’ In the eitiés of Lintz, Salzburg, and Steyer, there is much trańsiťtrade, both by the rivers and by the three great and excellent roads which traverse the province.

Ens, a city of Austria, in the province of the Lower Ens. It stands near the influx of that river into the Danube, and contains 380 houses, with 2951 inhabitants employed in linen vveaving and in breweries. Being on the great road to Vienna, it has upwards of twenty inns and hotels. Long. 14. 21. E. Lat. 48. 13. N.
