EXAUCTORATIO, in the Roman military discipline, differed from the missio, which was a full discharge, and took place after a soldier had served in the army twenty years; whereas the exauctoratio was only a partial discharge. The exauctorati lost their pay indeed, but still remained under their colours or vexilla, though not under the aquila or eagle, which was the standard of the legion; and hence, instead of legionarii, they were called subsignani, and were retained till they had either served their full time or had lands assigned them. The exauctratio took place after a soldier had served seventeen years.
