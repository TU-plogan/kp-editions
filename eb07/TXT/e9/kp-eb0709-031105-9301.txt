EPIMETHEUS, a son of Japetus and Clymene, one of the Oceanides, w ho inconsiderately married Pandora, by whom he had Pyrrha, the wife of Deucalion. He had the curiosity to open the box which Pandora had brought with her, and thence issued the train of evils which from that moment have never ceased to afflict the human race. Hope was the only redeeming ingredient which remained at the bottom of the box, not having had sufficient time to escape; and she it is alone who comforts men under misfortunes. Epimetheus was changed into a monkey by the gods, and sent into the island Pithecusa.
