EXCHEQUER, in British jurisprudence, an ancient court of record, in which all causes concerning the revenues and rights of the crown are heard and determined, and where the crown revenues are received. It derived this name from the cloth that covered the table of the court, which was party-coloured, or chequered. See England, Part HI.

Exchequer, in Scotland. See Scotland.
