EQUIMULTIPLES, in Arithmetic and Geometry, are numbers or quantities multiplied by one and the same number or quantity. Hence equimultiples are always in the same ratio to each other as the simple quantities before multiplication; thus, if 6 and 8 are multiplied by 4, the equimultiples 24 and 32 will be to each other as 6 to 8.
