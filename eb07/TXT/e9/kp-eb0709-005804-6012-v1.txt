ENT, Sir George, an eminent English physician, born at Sandwich, in Kent, in 1604. He was educated at Sidney College, Cambridge, and, having afterwards travelled into foreign countries, received the degree of doctor of physic at Padua. After his return he obtained great practice, was made president of the college of physicians in London, and at length received the honour of knighthood from King Charles II.
