EONIANS, in Ecclesiastical History, the followers of Eon, a wild fanatic of the province of Bretagne, in the tenth century.. He concluded, from the resemblance between cum, in the form of exorcising malignant spirits (per eum, qui venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos'), and his own name Eon, that he was the son of God, and ordained to judge the quick and dead. Eon, however, was solemnly condemned by the council at Rheims in 1148, at which Pope Eugenius III. presided, and he ended his days miserably in a prison. This insane .fanatic left behind him a number of followers and adherents, whom persecution and death could not persuade to abandon his cause, or to renounce an absurdity which, as Mosheim observes, one would think could never have gained credit in any place but bedlam.
