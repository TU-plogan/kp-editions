ENNISKILLEN, the chief town of the county of Fermanagh, in Ireland. It is well built, and beautifully situated on an island in the narrow channel which connects the upper and lower lakes of Lough Erne. Two bridges connect the island with the suburbs of the town, which are on the north-east and south-west of the lake. The linen manufacture is carried on here, but the principal support is derived from the retail trade which the town and neighbouring districts afford. Enniskillen returns one member to parliament. The population amounted in 1831 to 6116.
