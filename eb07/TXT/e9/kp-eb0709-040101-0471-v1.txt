EUMENIDES, a name given to the Furies by the ancients. They are fabled to have sprung from the blood of the wound which Coelus received from his son Saturn; but according to others they were daughters of Earth, and conceived from the blood of Saturn; whilst others again make them daughters of Acheron and Night, or of Pluto and Proserpine. They were three in number, Tisiphone, ∣Megara, and Alecto, to whom some add Nemesis. Plutarch mentions only one called Adrasta, the daughter of Jupiter and Necessity. Supposed to be the ministers of the vengeance of the gods, they were stern and inexorable, and were always employed in punishing the guilty upon earth, as well as in the infernal regions. Upon earth they inflicted the divine vengeance by means of wars, pestilence, and dissensions, and by the secret stings of conscience; in hell they punished the guilty by continual flagellation and torments. They were also called Furiae and Lrinnys. Their worship was almost universal, and people dared not to mention their names or to look upon their temples. They were honoured with sacrifices and libations; and in Achaia they had a temple, which, when entered by any one guilty of a crime, suddenly deprived him of the use of his reason, and rendered him furious. In sacrifices their votaries used branches of cedar and of alder, hawthorn, saffron, and juniper; and the victims were generally turtle doves and sheep, together with libations ot wine and honey. They were usually represented as of g f ιm and frightful aspect, with black and bloody garments, and serpents wreathed round their heads instead of hair.

’ ∙ jFVv^NlDIA, festivals in honour of the Eumenides, ^ a θ by the Athenians βιμvaι ûsai, or venerable goddesses, which were celebrated once every year, with sacrifices of pregnant ewes, offerings of cakes made by the most eminent youths, and libations of honey and wine. At Athens . none were admitted but freeborn citizens who had led a life the most virtuous and unsullied.
