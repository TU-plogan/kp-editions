EUGENE, François, commonly called Prince Eugene of Savoy, one of the greatest generals of his time (since he preceded Frederic IL, and Turenne had fallen before lie became known as a commander), was born at Paris on the 18th October 1663. His father, Eugene Maurice, count of Soissons, was grandson of the Duke of Savoy, Charles Emmanuel I.; and his mother, Olympia Mancini, was niece of Cardinal Mazarin; but the latter having been implicated in the affair of the poisonings, was forced to take refuge in Brussels in order to avoid prosecution. Originally destined for the church, Eugene evinced but little taste for theology, and occupied himself much more in reading the lives of great warriors, and the narratives of their exploits, than in studying the works of the fathers. Nevertheless he was of a feeble constitution; and as he wore a dark cloak, he was known at court hy the name of the Little Abbé. Louis XIV. refused him a company in a regiment ofcaval ry, because, according to some, he thought the young prince unfit for the profession of arms, whilst, according to others, this refusal was owing to the disgrace of his mother, and the hatred which Louvoĩs bore to her. But however this may be, Eugene was so stung by the refusal, that, from the moment of his repulse, he conceived for the king and his minister that long and fatal resentment which at length caused so many evils to France.^[1. “Quelques historiens, bons ou mauvais, se donneront peut-être la peine d’entrer dans les détails de ma jeunesse, dont je ne me 3uvιens presque plus. Ils parleront sûrement de ma mère, un peu intriguante à la vérité, chassée de la cour, exilée de Paris, et 3u P<S°nnde, je crois, de sorcellerie, par des gens qui n’étaient pas de grands sorciers. Ils diront comment je suis né en France, et mment j’en suis sorti, la rage dans le coeur contre Louis XIV., qui m’a refusé une compagnie de cavalerie, parce que, disait-il, avais une complexion trop faible; et une abbaye, parce qu’il prétendait (sur je ne sais quels mauvais propos sur mon compte, ou < u ≡ses anecdotes de galerie de Versailles) que j’étais plus fait pour le plaisir que pour l’église. Il n’y a de Huguenot chassé par la ré-ocation de l’édit de Nantes, qui lui ait conservé plus de haine. Aussi, quand Louvois, apprenant mon départ, dit, Tant mieux, il ’ rentra plus dans ce pays-ci, je jurai bien de n’y rentrer que les armes à la main; j’ai tenu ma parole.” (Fie du Prince Eugene, now αown 1° be the production of the Prince de Ligne.)] Having quitted France in disgust, he proceeded to Vienna, where the Emperor Leopold, who was allied to his family, received him kindly, and granted him permission, along with several other Frenchmen of distinction, to serve against the Turks under the banners of Austria. His first campaign ļ vas that of 1683, during which his courage appeared so ļ conspicuous that the emperor, by way of recompense, gave nm a regiment of dragoons. After several other campaigns nade with equal distinction, at the head of the same regiment, be became major-general; and it was in this capacity hat he served at the siege of Belgrade in 1688. At the ∏stιgatιon of Louvois, a decree of banishment from France ιasnow issued against all Frenchmen who should continue o serve in foreign armies. “I shall return into France in spite of him,” said Eugene, when the news were communicated to him; and he continued to pursue with the same ardour the career on which he had entered in so brilliant a manner. In his case genius was stimulated by resentment.

Leopold, considering him as not less fitted for diplomacy than for war, sent Eugene as his envoy or negotiator to the Duke of Savoy, in order, if possible, to detach that prince from his connection with France. Nor did the result disappoint the expectations of the emperor. Overcome by the pressing solicitations of his young cousin, the duke allowed himself to be drawn so precipitately into the coalition against France, that, without waiting for the succours which the court of Vienna had promised him, he imprudently gave battle to Catinat at Staf-farde, and was defeated, notwithstanding the great courage which Prince Eugene there displayed at the head of a corps of cavalry. But the auxiliary force sent by Austria having at length arrived, Eugene assumed the command, and, after obtaining some advantages, which placed the Duke of Savoy in a condition to defend himself, he returned to Vienna, where he decided the emperor to send fresh reinforcements. The imperial forces were thus put in a condition to resume the offensive; and Prince Eugene having arrived to command them in the spring of 1691, he caused the siege of Coni to be raised, took possession of Carmagnole, and gloriously terminated the struggle in which he had found himself engaged with Catinat. It was, in fact, as much by his successes, as by the ascendency which his superior mind exercised over the Duke of Savoy, that he managed to retain that prince in the coalition, from which he was oftener than once on the eve of breaking off, in order to throw himself again into the arms of France. Desirous to attach him still more to its interests, however, the court of Vienna conferred upon him the title of generalissimo of its forces; and it was in this capacity that he penetrated into Dauphine at the head of ten thousand men, having Prince Eugene as his lieutenant. The combined army took possession of Embrun and Gap; laid the whole country in ashes, by way of reprisals for the burning of the Palatinate; and was preparing to carry its ravages even into Provence and Languedoc, when the generalissimo having been seized with the small-pox, this accident saved the French provinces from further devastation. Prince Eugene led the army back into Piedmont, and it was there that he received the brevet of field-marshal. After a third campaign of little importance, the Duke of Savoy having again joined the French, and thus turned the balance against the Austrians, Prince Eugene returned to Vienna, where he was appointed to the command of the army of Hungary.

It was about this time that Louis XIV. secretly offered him the baton of a marshal of France, with the government of Champagne, which his father had held, and also a pension of two thousand pistoles. But Eugene rejected these offers with indignation, and proceeded to combat the Turks commanded by the grand signior Kara-Mustapha in person. After some able marches and skilful manoeuvres, he surprised the enemy at Zenta, on the Teisse, [7:9:394] in a camp'retrenched en tete-de-pont ; and, after an attack as vigorous as it was daring, he killed twenty thousand of them, drove ten thousand into the river, made prisoners of the remainder, and took the whole of their artillery and equipages. Never had a more complete and decisive victory been obtained by the imperial arms. But this splendid achievement, at the same time that it fixed upon Prince Eugene the eyes of all Europe, inflamed to the last degree the jealousy of his rivals, or rather enemies, of whom he had many at court, some of them not less powerful than vindictive. By means of their intrigues, these persons had caused an order to bc sent the prince, commanding him to suspend all attack; and this order had reached him an instant before the battle commenced, but without changing his determination to assault the enemy’s position; the opportunity for striking a blow was propitious, and he boldly resolved to profit by it. This act of disobedience to the orders of the sovereign was doubtless a fault, and he who dared to commit it would have been ruined without resource had he not triumphed in a manner the most complete and decisive. But was not such a fault gloriously effaced by a victory as useful as it was brilliant? So at least thought all the world, excepting the enemies of Prince Eugene, who succeeded in persuading the emperor that nothing could excuse his disobedience; and, accordingly, when the victorious general appeared before his master, under the impression no doubt that he was to be greeted with acknowledgments and felicitations, he met with a cold and severe reception. Nor did the folly and ingratitude of his enemies stop here. Next day he was placed under arrest, and ordered to deliver up his sword; and he was about to be brought before a council of war, when the inhabitants of Vienna interposed, loudly remonstrating against the injustice of such treatment. The emperor also, whether from fear or repentance, relented, and restored his command to Prince Eugene, who, however, accepted it only on the condition that he should have carte blanclιe. It is alleged that when the envoy of the emperor came to demand his sword, he replied, “There it is, still reeking with the blood of the enemy; I consent not to resume it except for the advantage of his majesty’s service.” But it is now proved that this pretended reply is spurious; for, as the Prince de Ligne well observes, “one half of the phrase would have been a gasconade, and the other a meanness,” neither of which comported with the simple and manly character of this great warrior. Prince Eugene then returned to Hungary; and, after a campaign distinguished by no remarkable event, a treaty of peace was at length concluded with the Turks at Carlowitz, on the 26th January 1699.

Having returned to Vienna, the prince applied himself to the study of the arts, and particularly of history, which had always great attractions for him. But he was not permitted long to enjoy the leisure which he seemed so desirous to improve. The war of the succession, which soon broke out, opened to him a new field of glory; and at the commencement of the year 1701, he was sent into Italy once more to oppose his old antagonist Catinat. But all the prudence of the old general failed to secure him against the bold and incessantly-renewed enterprises of his young and indefatigable rival. The latter effected, in presence of the French army, the passage of the Adige, and forced it, after sustaining several checks, to retire behind the Oglio, where a series of reverses equally unexpected and severe led to the disgrace and retirement of Catinat. The Duke of Villeroi succeeded to the command of which Catinat had been deprived, and the prince had soon reason to felicitate himself on a change which, from its first announcement, transported him with joy. The presumptuous Villeroi having ventured to attack him at

Chiari, in an inexpugnable position, Eugene repulsed all his efforts without difficulty, and inflicted a severe loss on the assailants. And this first check was only the forerunner of more signal reverses; for, in a short time, Villeroi was forced to abandon the whole of the Mantuan territory, and to take refuge in Cremona, where he seems to have considered himself as secure in the midst of his staff. But, by one of the most audacious enterprises which has ever been attempted in war, this place was surprised, and, had it not been for untoward accidents, would unquestionably have been carried. By means of a stratagem, Prince Eugene penetrated into the city during the night, at the head of a numerous body; and it was only owing to circumstances which could not possibly be foreseen or provided against, and particularly to the courage and vigilance of some French officers, that he found himself at length compelled to retire, carrying along with him Villeroi as a prisoner. But this last circumstance, so far from being an advantage to the Imperialists, proved the reverse; the Duke of Vendome replaced the captive general, and his ability soon changed the aspect of affairs. From the first moment Prince Eugene appreciated the talents of his new adversary; and, besides,.being aware of the superiority of the French army, with which the king of Spain in person had just effected a junction at the head of numerous reinforcements, he confined himself to a war of observation, without important results, though fertile in most useful lessons to students of military science. This campaign was terminated by the battle of Luzara, fought on the 1st of August 1702, in which each party claimed the victory. It was one of the most sanguinary ever delivered by Prince Eugene, whose fortune it was to command in so many battles; he there lost the flower of his army, and also his best officers, including the brave Commerci, his intimate friend and most faithful companion in arms.

Both armies having entered into winter quarters, Eugene returned to Vienna, where he was appointed president of the council of war. He then set out for Hungary in order to combat the insurgents in that country; but his means proving insufficient, he effected nothing of importance. The revolt was, however, put down by the success which General Heister obtained in another quarter. Prince Eugene accordingly proceeded to Bavaria, where, in 1704, he made his first campaign along with Marlborough. Similarity of tastes, views, and talents soon established between these two great men a friendship which is rarely to be found amongst military chiefs, and which contributed more than all other causes put together to the success which the allies obtained. The first and perhaps the most important of these successes was that of Hoch-sett or Blenheim, gained on the 13th of August 1704, where the English and imperial troops triumphed over one of the finest armies which France had as yet sent into Germany. See Marlborough.

But since Prince Eugene had quitted Italy, Vendome, who commanded the French army in that country, had obtained various successes. The Duke of Savoys who had once more deserted France and joined Austria, had suffered severe losses; and the emperor having decided to send him assistance, Piedmont thus became the principal theatre of active hostilities. Having received orders to proceed thither without delay, Eugene quitted .Marlborough with the most lively regret, though at the same time experiencing a secret satisfaction at the prospect 0 measuring himself with a rival in all respects worthy 0 him. Vendôme at first opposed great obstacles to the pı¶ n which the prince had formed for carrying succours m o Piedmont; but after a variety of marches and cou ?ĵ¶ļ marches, in which both commanders displayed sιg∏a ability, the two armies met at Cassano, where a ∏ ιur e [7:9:395] ous engagement ensued, and Prince Eugene received two severe wounds, which forced him to quit the field. This accident decided the fate of the battle, and for the time suspended the prince’s march towards Piedmont. But although prevented from effecting a junction with the Duke of Savoy, his operations failed not to prove advantageous to that prince, since the Duke de la Feuillade, then besieging Turin, was obliged to raise the siege and march to the assistance of Vendome, who, notwithstanding his victory atCassano, felt apprehensive of some new and daring enterprise on the part of his antagonist. Vendome, however, was recalled, and La Feuillade was incapable of long arresting the progress of such a commander as Eugene. After once more passing several rivers in presence of the French army, and executing one of the most skilful and daring marches he had ever performed, the latter appeared before the entrenched camp at Turin, which place the French were now besieging with an army eighty thousand strong. Prince Eugene had only thirty thousand men; but his antagonist was the Duke of Orleans, who, though full of zeal and courage, wanted sufficient experience to enable him to contend with a man justly regarded as one of the greatest warriors of his time. Besides, by a secret order of Louis XIV., who had, in fact, transferred the command to Marsin, the young prince was restricted to the execution of an ill-conceived plan, which neutralized the advantage of superior numbers, and put it in the power of the enemy to select his point of attack. With equal courage and address, Eugene profited by the misunderstanding which the exhibition of such an order could not fail to produce between the French generals; and having on the 7th September 1706 attacked the French army in its entrenchments, he gained a complete victory, which decided the fate of Italy. This brilliant achievement, the result of the most masterly combinations, and, in several respects, the prototype of the campaign of Marengo in 1800, affords one of the most remarkable examples of the difficulty of defending extensive lines even against an inferior army, massed upon one or two points. As soon as the Duke of Orleans observed the imperial army approaching, hc wished to march out of the lines with the whole French army, and to deliver battle in the open field, where he could have availed himself of his great numerical superiority (eighty thousand to thirty); but he was restrained hy Marsin, who, by this absurd interposition, sealed the fate of the French army, and lost Italy. In the heat of the battle, which almost immediately'ensued, Eugene received a wound, and was thrown from his horse into a ditch. His fall produced a belief that he was killed, and his soldiers began to lose courage; but he soon returned to the attack, and when the soldiers saw him appear in the midst of them covered with slime and blood, issuing his orders, and watching over every thing with the most admirable sang-froid, their enthusiasm was raised to the highest pitch; and from that moment the issue of the battle was certain. As a recompense for so important services, the prince received the government of the Milanese, of which he took possession with great pomp o’n the 16th April 1707.

she attempt which he made against Toulon, in the course of the same year, failed completely, because the invasion of the kingdom of Naples retarded the march of the troops which were to have been employed in it, and this delay afforded Marshal de Tcssé time to make good dispositions. Obliged to renounce his project, therefore, t e prince repaired to Vienna, where he was received with great enthusiasm both by the people and the court. “I a,n very well satisfied with you,” said the emperor, “excepting on one point only, which is, that you expose your- se too much.” This monarch immediately dispatched Eugene to Holland, and to the different courts of Germany, in order to forward the necessary preparations for the campaign of the following year, 1708.

Early in the spring of 1708 the prince proceeded to Flanders, in order to assume the command of the forces which his diplomatic ability had been mainly instrumental in assembling. This campaign was opened by the victory of Oudenardc, to which the perfect union of Marlborough and Eugene on the one hand, and the misunderstanding between Vendôme and the Duke of Burgundy on the other, seem to have equally contributed. This prince immediately abandoned the Low Countries, and remaining in observation, made no attempt whatever to raise the siege of Lille, where Bouffiers distinguished himself by a glorious defence. To the valour of the latter Eugene paid the most marked and flattering homage, at the same time loading him with all those expressions of esteem and regard with which it was then usual, in such cases, to attemper the horrors of war. Bouffiers was invited by his enemies to prepare the articles of capitulation himself, and Prince Eugene wrote to him, “1 subscribe to every thing beforehand, well persuaded that you will not insert any thing unworthy of yourself or of me.” After this important conquest, Eugene and Marlborough proceeded to the Hague, where they were received in the most flattering manner hy the public, by the states-gcneral, and, above all, by their esteemed friend the pensionary Heinsius. Negotiations were then opened for peace, but as the conditions proposed by the allies were considered by Louis XIV. as alike degrading to himself and to France, both parties made preparations for continuing the war.

The campaign of 1709 was opened in Flanders by two hostile armies, each a hundred and fifty thousand strong. That of the French was commanded by Villars, a man of considerable talents, but of little experience, and who feared to compromise himself in opposition to such great captains as Marlborough and Eugene. He accordingly remained upon the defensive, and suffered them to take Tournay without opposition; but being desirous of succouring Mons, he was followed by the allies, who attacked him at Malplaquet on the 9th of September, in a formidable position, where he had had time to entrench himself. The attack was made with equal vigour and ability; but owing to the strength of the French position, and the tenacity with which it was maintained, the victory was purchased at the cost of twenty-five thousand men killed on the field of battle, and the Dutch infantry was almost annihilated. The battle of Malplaquct was to it what the battle of Rocroi had been to the infantry of Spain; and it never afterwards recovered from the effects of that sanguinary day. Although the allie« remained masters of the field of battle, this barren advantage had been so dearly bought, that they found themselves soon afterwards out of all condition to undertake any thing. Their army accordingly went into winter-quarters, and Prince Eugene returned to Vienna, whence the emperor almost immediately dispatched him to Berlin. From the king of Prussia the prince obtained every thing which he had been instructed tp require; and having thus fulfilled his mission, he returned into Flanders, where, excepting the capture of Douay, Bethune, and Aire, the campaign of 1810 presented nothing remarkable. The emperor Joseph I. having died about this time, Prince Eugene, in concert with the empress, exerted his utmost endeavours to secure the crown to the archduke, who afterwards ascended the imperial throne under the name of Charles VI.

In the year following, 1711, the changes which had occurred in the policy, or rather thecaprice, of Queen Anne, brought about an approximation between England and [7:9:396] France, and put an end to the influence which Marlbo-∙∙ rough had hitherto possessed with that princess. When this political revolution became known, Prince Eugene immediately repaired to London, charged with a mission from the emperor, and there made strenuous efforts to reestablish the credit of his illustrious companion in arms, as well as to re-attach England to the coalition. But all arguments and persuasions, whether founded on views of interest or sentiments of honour and consistency, having proved unavailing, the emperor found himself under the necessity of making the campaign of 1712 with the aid of the Dutch alone. The defection of the English, however, did not induce Prince Eugene to abandon his favourite plan of invading France. He had long been decided to make any sacrifice to accomplish this design, the conception of which originated as much, perhaps, in resentment as in a passion for glory. He therefore resolved, at whatever cost, to penetrate into Champagne; and in order to support his operations by the possession of some important places, he began by making himself master of Quesnoy. But the Dutch having been surprised and beaten in the lines of Denain, where Prince Eugene had placed them at too great a distance to receive timely support in case of an attack, he was obliged to raise the siege of Landrecies, and to abandon the project which he had so long cherished. This was the last campaign in which Austria acted in conjunction with her allies. Abandoned first by England and then by Holland, the emperor, notwithstanding these desertions, still wished to maintain the war in Germany; but the superiority of the French army prevented Eugene from relieving either Landau or Friburg, which were successively obliged to capitulate; and seeing the empire thus laid open to the armies of France, and even the hereditary states themselves exposed to invasion, the prince counselled his master to make peace. Sensible of the prudence of this advice, the emperor immediately entrusted Eugene with full powers to negotiate a treaty; and after some interviews, in which the prince and Villars interchanged expressions of esteem and admiration, there was concluded at Rastadt, on the 6th of March 1714, a peace which had long been anxiously looked for, and of which the nations of Europe had the greatest need.

After this happy event, Prince Eugene went to enjoy at Vienna some moments of repose. The emperor continued to show him marks of the most entire confidence; and from this time adopted no resolution, either in regard to the administration of the army, or that of the interior, without consulting him. But this kind of occupation did not suit the activity of Eugene; and although he was now advanced in years, his warlike humour had lost nothing of its vivacity. Sensible of the impossibility of Austria, situated as she was, resisting France, he had done all in his power to accelerate the conclusion of peace; but, by a contrary species of reasoning, he availed himself of a petty quarrel which the Ottoman Porte had with the Venetians to determine his master to espouse the cause of the latter. The emperor, having taken this step, appointed Eugene to command the army of Hungary; and at Peterwaradin, with a force not exceeding sixty thousand men, he gained a signal victory over the Turks, who had not less than a hundred and fifty thousand men in the field. This victory made a great noise in Europe, and all the Christian powers conceived themselves bound to rejoice on account of it. The pope sent to the victorious general the consecrated rapier, which the court of Rome was accustomed to bestow upon those who had triumphed over the infidels; and this extraordinary present was put into the hands of Prince Eugene by an envoy of his holiness. But the ensuing campaign, being that of 1717, was still more remarkable, on account of the battle of Belgrade. After having remained under the walls of that city, in a situation th e most difficult imaginable; after having resisted, during a month, the efforts of a numerous garrison, as well as those of a hundred and fifty thousand Turks, with an army of only forty thousand men; and after having lost nearly th e half of his troops by dysentery, and the fire of the Ottoman artillery, which plunged its shot even into his own tent; Prince Eugene gained one of the most complete victories of which there is any record or tradition, and soon afterwards forced Belgrade itself to capitulate. The attack which he ordered against forces six times more numerous than his own was really an act of despair. He had himself been seized with the cruel malady which was destroying his army, and all was consternation in the Austrian camp; yet at the very moment when he was believed to be on the eve of capitulating, he succeeded, by his constancy and daring courage, in obtaining a most decisive victory. The prince was wounded in the heat of the action, this being the thirteenth time that he had been hit upon the field of battle. On his return to Vienna he received numerous testimonies ofgratitude, and,amongst others, a sword valued at eighty thousand florins, which was presented to him by the emperor. In the following year, 1718, after some fruitless negotiations with a view to the conclusion of peace, he again took the field; but the treaty of Passarowitz put an end to hostilities, at the moment when the prince had well-founded hopes of obtaining still more important successes than those which had illustrated the last campaign, and when he even flattered himself with reaching Constantinople, and dictating a peace on the shores of the Bosphorus. On his return to Vienna he was, as usual, received with every mark of esteem and admiration.

As the government of the Low Countries, formerly conferred upon Eugene, had now for some reason been bestowed on a sister of the emperor, the prince was appointed vicar-general of Italy, with a pension of three hundred thousand florins. From this time he occupied himself much more than he had ever done with the affairs of government; and Charles VI. habitually consulted him in all affairs of importance. He accompanied this monarch in several journeys, particularly to Prague, where Frederick I. of Prussia met the emperor by appointment, and testified the greatest admiration of the veteran warrior, by whom the latter was attended; and his influence seemed to be in all respects commensurate with his fame. During the ten years of peace which ensued, Eugene occupied himself with the arts and with literature, to which he had hitherto been able to devote little of his time. But the contest which arose out of the succession of Augustus II. to the throne of Poland having afforded Austria a pretext for attacking France, war was resolved on, contrary to the advice of Prince Eugene, whose last campaigns had taught him to dread the efforts of that power. Yet, although he had in the council declared his opinion in favour of peace, he was appointed to command the army destined to act upon the Rhine. This army, from the commencement, had very superior forces opposed to it; and if it could not prevent the capture of Philipsburg after a long siege, it at least prevented the enemy from entering Bavaria. Prince Eugene, having now attained his seventy-first year, no longer possessed the vigour and activity necessary for the command of armies; he himself perceived the change which time had wrought m his powers; and as he now longed for and required repose, he applied himself to bring about a peace, which was at length concluded on the 3d of March 1733. Having returned to Vienna, his health declined more and more, an he died in that capital on the 21st April 1736, leaving an [7:9:397] immense succession to his niece the Princess Victoria of Savoy.

Of a character cold and severe, Prince Eugene had almost no other passion than that of glory. He died unmarried, and without having ever evinced the slightest partiality for any woman, excepting, perhaps, the Countess de Bathiani, who, by the attractions of her wit and vivacity, appears to have consoled the last moments of his life. Although one of the greatest warriors of his time, military science is not indebted to him for any remarkable improvement. His operations were not directed according to any positive method, nor conformable to invariable principles; it was by sudden inspirations, and an admirable rapidity of coup ďoeil, that he conducted himself on the ground according to the circumstances and the men with whom he had to deal; and upon all occasions he took the greatest pains to ascertain the character of the generals who were opposed to him. This system of tactics chiefly resembles that which we have seen displayed in the recent wars; it exhibits neither the prudence and circumspection of Turenne, nor the astonishing strategic ability of Frederick, in the difficult art of putting in motion and deploying columns and lines: it consists merely in an incessant activity and audacity, united with an admirable promptitude in perceiving and repairing faults. Despising the lives of his soldiers as much as he exposed his own, it was always by persevering efforts and great sacrifices that he obtained victory. To the Austrian armies he gave an eclat which they had never before possessed, and which, as it was reflected from his character alone, died with him; in fact, he could not sustain himself without efforts which wars so protracted and destructive rendered impossible upon the part of the people of Austria. This exhaustion, indeed, was long felt in the Austrian monarchy; and as that power has not had a single general since the time of Prince Eugene who can at all be compared with him, its armies have not subsequently been illustrated by any remarkable event, and the reputation of this general has consequently stood far above that of all other commanders in the imperial service. Prince Eugene, in truth, had a prevailing passion for war. Always on the march, in camps, or on the field of battle during more than fifty years, and under the reign of three emperors, he had scarcely passed two years together without fighting. It has been said that he loved letters and the arts; and the protection which he afforded to J. B. Rousseau has often been cited as a proof of this commendable taste. It is certain, indeed, that in his numerous expeditions, he had made an immense collection of objects interesting to science and art, as well as of valuable books and manuscripts; but it is evident that he never took time to examine them; and there is nothing to prove that he knew How to appreciate their value. He profited by war, which, m every point of view, prodigiously enriched him; and if e must be ranked with Turenne, Vendome, and Catinat n regard to personal valour, he cannot be compared with hem in point of disinterestedness and generosity. Prince Eugene was a man of the middle size, but, upon the v hole, well made; the cast of his visage was somewhat on g, his mouth moderate, and almost always open; his yes were black and animated, and his complexion such ts became a warrior. His funeral oration, composed in talian by Cardinal Passionei, was translated into French >y Madame du Boccage, 1759, in 12rπo. But the most ŋmplete work on his life is the Histoire du Prince Eugene·, Amsterdam, 1740, and Vienna, 1755, which was published anonymously, though it is now known to be the compila- , on of a Μ. de Mauvillon. It was from this production ’at.the Prince de Ligne derived the greater part of the ' rι tιng which he published in Germany in 1809, and which was twice printed the year following at Paris, under the title of Vie du Prince Eugene de Savoie, écrite par lui-meme, in one vol. 8vo. There exists in German a history of Prince Eugene, which is little' esteemed; and there was also published at Nuremberg, in 1738, a work entitled Eugenius nummis illustratus, which is of little value. But the Italian work on the Life and Campaigns of Prince Eugene, published at Naples in 1754, 8vo, is much more exact. We have also Campagnes du Prince Eugene en Hongrie, in 2 vols. 8vo; and Histoire Militaire du Prince Eugene, du Due de Marlborough, et du Prince de Nassau, 2 vols. fol. by Dumont, and continued by Rousseau, Hague, 1729. The work of Father Ferrari, entitled De Rebus Gestis Eugeηii Principis Sabaudioe, Dello Pannonico, is much more remarkable for the purity of the style than for the accuracy of the facts. (a.)
