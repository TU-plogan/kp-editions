ETRURIA, an ancient province or country of Italy, bounded on the north by Liguria, from which it was separated by the river Macra, now Magra; on the side of Cisalpine Gaul, by the lofty ridges of the Apennines; on the east by Umbria, from which it was separated by the river Tiber; and on the west by the Tuscan Sea. The country thus situated appears to have been one of the earliest seats of European civilization, and the principal source whence Rome derived her laws, customs, and superstitions.
