ERIVAN, a province of Persia, bounded on the north and west by the Mossian Hills, on the south by the Araxes, and on the east by the districts of the Karabang and Karadang. It is of considerable extent, and has a salubrious climate, though the winter is of long duration. It possesses, according to Sir R. K. Porter, by whom it was visited in 1817, every natural beauty which a fine assemblage of mountain, dale, and water can bestow. The principal towns are Erivan and Nackshivan. This province is ruled by a sardar, who differs from most others in the empire, as he pays no tribute to the king, holding his station by a military tenure, by which he is bound to furnish to the royal army in time of war a certain quota of troops. To him is entrusted the defence of the frontier within the limits of the province; so that he more resembles a prince in his authority, as well as in all his appointments, than a provincial governor. He has immense wealth both in money and in land. The province is 200 miles in length and 100 ⅛ breadth. According to a general census taken in 1814, the number of inhabitants capable of bearing arms amounted to 18,000. The annual revenue is 150,000 tomauns, or L.75,000 sterling.

Erivan, Irwan, or ľrivan, the capital of the above province, situated in an angle of a great plain at the foot of the Mossian Hills, on the banks of the river Zengui, which rises from a lake about seventy miles farther north, and falls into the Araxes about three leagues below the town. It is defended by a fortress of an elliptical form, upwards of 6000 yards in circumference. The city is of considerable extent, but, as generally happens in Persia, ruins mingle everywhere with the habitable parts of the town. The north-west side of the town is built on a precipice impending over the river, to the height of 600 feet. The fortress spreads over a great deal of ground. It is fortified in the mixed ancient and modern Asiatic manner; and has been lately strengthened by European engineers. But it is commanded on every side by hills at a distance of scarcely 6000 yards. The Zengui flows close past the north-west front, which is on the summit of a perpendicular rock seventy feet deep, forming a natural ditch. “Nothing,” says Sir R. K. Porter, “can exceed the grandeur of these bulwarks of nature, which so frequently present themselves around fortified places in those precipitous countries; their vastness, simplicity, and impregnable appearance being far beyond the powers of man to imitate.” The walls of Erivan, with their numerous towers, make a line of defence exceeding 2000 yards. Immediately beyond them a fine stone bridge crosses the river, which is almost the only object ir the town that does not appear in a state of ruin or decay Erivan has been so often the scene of devastation, plunder and massacre, that the population has dwindled to about 15,000 persons. The singular old tower described b) Chardin being struck with lightning and greatly damaged has been pulled down, and the materials appropriated to th¢ repairs of the town. The city is well supplied with wateι from the little river Q,uerk-boolak, which has its source ir the great lake, and runs thence north-east, but on approaching the city is divided into numberless little canals for the irrigation of the surrounding gardens, or for other purposes Sir R. K. Porter supposes that the Erivan was founder sixty-five years before the Christian era, by Ervandus, onr of the Armenian kings. In 1635 it was taken from thr Turks by the Persians, and its position changed to its pre sent site. It was besieged in 1724 by the pasha of Diar bekir, who in four successive attempts to storm it los about 24,000 men. It afterwards capitulated, after a brav∣ defence. It was taken by Nadir Shah in 1748, and ha since remained in possession of the Persians. In 18081 was blockaded for six months by the Russians, who, u attempting to storm, were repulsed with great slaughter and lost half their army in its retreat to Tiflis. It vva taken by them in 1829, and given up to Persia by th subsequent treaty of peace. Long. 44. 35. E. Lat. 4L 9. 30. N.
