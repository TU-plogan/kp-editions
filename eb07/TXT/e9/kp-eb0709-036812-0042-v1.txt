ESSENES, or Essenians, in Jewish antiquity, one of the three ancient sects amongst that people. They believed in a future state, but denied a resurrection from the dead. Their way of life was singular, inasmuch as they did not marry, but adopted the children of others, whom they bred up in the .institutions of their sect, and, despising riches, had all things in common, never changing their clothes till these were entirely worn out. When initiated, they were strictly bound not to communicate the mysteries of their sect to others; and if any of their members were found guilty of enormous crimes, they were expelled. Pliny tells us that they dwelt on the western side of Lake Asphaltites; that they were"¾ solitary kind of men, living without women or money, and feeding upon the fruit of the palm-tree; and that they were constantly recruited by new-comers, whom ill fortune had made weary of the world. The reason why we find no mention made of them in the New Testament may be their recluse and retired way of life, no less than their great simplicity and honesty, in consequence of which they did not lie open to censure or reproof.
