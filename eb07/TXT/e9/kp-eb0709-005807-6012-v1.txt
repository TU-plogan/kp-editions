ENTHYMEME, in Logic and Phetoric, an argument cönsisting only of two propositions, an antecedent, and a consequent deduced from it. The word is Greek, ι^Mμr ∖ μα, formed of the verb ιvbvμn<d⅛ω, to think, conceive, a compound of εv, and ‰μος, mind. *

The enthymeme is the most simple and elegant of all argumentations, being that which a man, in arguing closely, commonly makes, without attending at all to the form. Thus, the verse remaining of Ovid’s tragedy entitled Medea contains an enthymeme: Servare potui, perdere an possum rogas, — “I was able to save you, consequently to have destroyed you.” The beauty would have been lost had all the propositions been expressed; the mind is displeased with a rehearsal of what is nowise necessary.

Sometimes also the two propositions of an enthymeme are both included in a single-proposition, which Aristotle ealls an ’ enthymematical sentence, of which he gives this instance: Mortal, do not bear an immortal hatred. The whole enthymeme would be, Thou art mortal, let not, therefore, thy hatred be immortal.
