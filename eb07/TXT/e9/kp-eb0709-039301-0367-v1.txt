EUDOXIANS, a party or sect of heretics in the fourth century, so denominated from their leader, Eudoxius, patriarch of Antioch and Constantinople, who was a great defender of the Arian doctrine. The Eudoxĩans adhered to the errors of the Arians and Eunomians, maintaining that the Son was created out of nothing, and that he had a will distinct and different from that of the Father.
