EUTERPE, one of the Muses, daughter of Jupiter and Mnemosyne, who presided over music, and was also regarded as the inventress of the flute. She is represented as crowned with flowers, and holding a flute in her hands. Some mythologists attribute to her the invention of tragedy, which is more commonly supposed to be the production of Melpomene.
