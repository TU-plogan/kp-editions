EPITAPH (from ι~ι, upon, and raφος, sepulchre), a monumental inscription in honour or in memory of a person[7:9:318] deceased. It has been disputed whether the ancient Jews inscribed epitaphs on the monuments of the dead; but however this may be, it is certain that epitaphs of very ancient date are found among them. The Athenians, by way of epitaph, commonly put only the name of the dead, with the epithet χgnffreς, signifying good., or ⅛gωi, hero, and the word γaigt, intimating their good wishes; but the name of the deceased’s father and that of his tribe were occasionally added. The Lacedaemonians allowed epitaphs to none but those who had died in battle. The Romans inscribed their epitaphs diis manibus ; and frequently introduced the dead, by way of prosopopoeia, speaking to the living.
