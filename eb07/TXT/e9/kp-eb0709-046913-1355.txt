EYEMOUTH, a town of Berwickshire, in Scotland, situated at the embouchure of the river Eye, from which circumstance it takes its name. Eyemouth lies seven miles from Berwick. It is a place of considerable antiquity, and enjoys the distinction of being a burgh of barony. It was at an early period of some importance; first, on account of its possessing a fort of great strength, which, however, is now destroyed; and, secondly, from the circumstance of its being the first harbour in the Scottish territory reached by vessels sailing from England, or along the English coast. On this account it no doubt must have frequently become a place of refuge and shelter to vessels, whether from hostile pursuit or storms at sea. Eyemouth still derives advantages from its harbour, which is well fitted for the reception of vessels in distress; and from it is exported a great deal of country produce. The town also possesses a distillery. The population amounted in 1821 to 1165, and in 1831 to 1181.
