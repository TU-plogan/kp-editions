ETAWEH, a town and fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Agra, and capital of a district of the same name. It is situated on the eastern bank of the Jumna, many parts of which, during the dry season, are sixty feet in height. The town is built on the heights, and, as it approaches the river, is divided into separate hills by deep ravines. It was formerly the residence of a rajah, and a place of considerable consequence; and it still carries on a considerable traffic in grain, sugar, and cotton. There is also an extensive manufacture of coarse cotton cloths in the vicinity. It is now the station of the civil establishment of the district. Long. 78. 58. E. Lat. 26. 46. N. The district is situated in the Doab, or between the Ganges and the Jumna, and about the 27th degree of north latitude; and, with the rest of the Doab, it was ceded to the British by the nabob of Oude in 1801.
