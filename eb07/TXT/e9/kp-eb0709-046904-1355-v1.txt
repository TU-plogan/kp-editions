EXTRAORDINARII, amongst the Romans, was a body of men consisting of the third part of the foreign horse and a fifth of the foot, which was separated from the rest of the forces borrowed from the confederate states with great policy and caution, in order to prevent any design which they might possibly entertain against the natural forces. A more choice body of men were drawn from among the extraordinarii, under the name of ablectì.
