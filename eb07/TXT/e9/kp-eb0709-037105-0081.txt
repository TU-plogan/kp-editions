ESTATE, in Law, signifies the title or interest which a person has in lands, tenements, or other effects. A feesimple is the amplest estate the law admits of.

Estates, in a political sense, is a term used to denote either the dominions of some prince, or the general classes into which the people are divided.

In Britain, the estates are the king, lords, and commons; or rather the lords and commons, who meet the king in parliament, for the purpose of reforming abuses, and enacting good and wholesome laws.
