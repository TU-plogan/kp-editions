EXPANSION, in Physics, denotes the enlargement or increase of bulk in bodies, chiefly by means of heat. This is one of the most general effects of that subtile principle, and common to all bodies whatever, whether solid or fluid. In some few cases, indeed, bodies seem to expand as they grow cold, as water in the act of freezing; but this is found to be owing to a new arrangement of the particles, or to crystallization, and is not at all a regular and gradual expansion like that of metals, or any other solid or fluid substance by means of heat. In certain metals also, an expansion takes place when they pass from a fluid to a solid state; but this too is not to be accounted any proper effect of cold, but of the arrangement of the parts of a metal in a peculiar manner; and it is therefore to be ascribed to a kind of crystallization.
