EPILOGUE, in Oratory, the end or conclusion of a discourse, ordinarily containing a recapitulation of the principal matters before delivered.

Epilogue, in the Drama, a speech addressed to the audience after the play is over, by one of the principal actors, and usually containing some reflections on certain incidents in the play, especially those in the part of the person who speaks it, together with somewhat of pleasantry, intended to compose the passions raised in the course of the representation; a practice which is ridiculed by the Spectator, and compared to a merry jig upon the organ after a good sermon, in order to wipe away any impressions that might have been thereby produced, and to send the people away just as they came.
