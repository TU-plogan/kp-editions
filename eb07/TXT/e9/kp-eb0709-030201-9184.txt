ENTRE DUERO E MINHO, one of the provinces into which the kingdom of Portugal is divided. As its name denotes, it is bounded on the north by the river Minho, which divides it from Spain, and on the south by the river Duero. The Atlantic Ocean is its western boundary, and on the east a chain of elevated mountains separates it from the province of Tras os Montes. It has by far the most dense population of any part either of Spain or Portugal, and extends over a surface of 291 square leagues. The number of its inhabitants in 1798 amounted to 907,965.

It enjoys the best climate, the most fertile soil, and the most beautiful rivulets, not only of Portugal, but of the whole peninsula. Its vegetable productions are oranges, lemons, maize, wheat, and especially wine. The latter article is the great object of export, and forms the principal trade of the kingdom, as almost all the red wine, commonly named port, from the city whence it is shipped, is the growth of Entre Duero e Minho. Both its sea coasts and rivers abound with most excellent fish, which forms the foundation of considerable commerce. Considerable manufactures are conducted, which furnish hats, linens, sail-cloth, woollen cloths, and various kinds of silks and satins. These, though not sufficiently cheap to be sent to other parts of Europe, supply the demands of the kingdom, and a portion is exported to Brazil and the settlements on the coast of Africa. The rivers next in importance to those which bound it are the Lima, the Ca-bado, the Deste, and the Ave, all which run from east to west, and form natural defences, aided by the mountains, against any invading enemy. The city of Braga is the capital, though Oporto is in every respect the first city in the province, only that Braga, as the see of an archbishop, is usually considered as the chief place. This province lies between 41. 6. and 42. 6. north latitude.
