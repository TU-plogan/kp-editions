EXMOUTH, a town in Devonshire, 166 miles from London, part of the parish of Littleham, and part of Withycombe Rawleigh, in the hundred of East Budleigh. It is situated on the north side of the Ex, at its entrance into the sea. It has risen within a few years, from having become the resort of company for sea-bathing in summer, and in winter the residence of those suffering under pulmonary complaints. The air is salubrious, and the prospects around are beautiful. The population of Exmouth amounted in 1801 to 1909, in 1811 to 2294, and in 1821 to 2640.
