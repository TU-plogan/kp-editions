EQUITY, in a general sense, the virtue of treating other men according to reason and justice, or as we would be treated ourselves when we understand aright what is our due.

Equity, in jurisprudence, is defined to be a correction or qualification of the law, generally made in that part in which it either fails or is too severe. It likewise signifies die extension of the words of the law to cases unexpressed, yet having the same reason; so that where one thing is enacted by statute, all other things are enacted which are of the same degree.

Equity, in Mythology, sometimes confounded with Justice, a goddess amongst the Greeks and Romans, represented with a sword in the one hand and a balance in the other.
