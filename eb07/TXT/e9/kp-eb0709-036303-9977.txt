EROTIA, a festival instituted in honour of Eros, the god of love. It was celebrated by the Thespians every fifth year, with sports and games, when musicians and others contended. If any quarrels or seditions had arisen amongst the people, it was. then usual to offer sacrifices and prayers to the god that he would totally remove them.
