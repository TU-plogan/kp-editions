EPIPHANIUS, St, an ancient father of the church, born at Besanducan, a village in Palestine, about the year 332. He founded a monastery near the place of his birth, and presided over it. He was afterwards elected bishop of Salamis, when he took part with Paulinus against Meletius, and ordained in Palestine Paulinian, the brother of St Jerome, on which a contest arose between him and John bishop of Jerusalem. He afterwards called a council in the island of Cyprus, in which he procured a prohibition of the reading of Origenâ€™s writings, and made use of all his endeavours to prevail on Theophilus bishop of Alexandria to engage St Chrysostom to declare in favour of that decree; but not meeting with success, he himself proceeded to Constantinople, where he refused to have any conversation with St Chrysostom, and formed the design of entering the church of the apostles to publish his condemnation of Origen. Being informed, however, of the danger to which he would be exposed, he resolved to return to Cyprus, but died at sea in the year 403. His works were printed in Greek at Basil, 1544, in folio, and were afterwards translated into Latin, in which language they have often been reprinted. Petavius revised and corrected the Greek text with the aid of two manuscripts, and published it together with a new translation at Paris in 1622. This edition was reprinted at Cologne in 1682.
