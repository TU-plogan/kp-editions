EPAMINONDAS, son of Polymnis the Theban, born about 410 B. c., was one of those distinguished characters whose appearance forms an epoch in the history of their country. The position of Thebes was not such as to enable it to take a prominent part in the affairs of Greece; and, excepting during the short period when Epaminondas and Pelopides were at the head of the government, it seems to have been dependent either on Sparta or on Athens, according as the power of the one or the other prevailed. The earlier years of Epaminondas were spent under the direction of Lysis the Pythagorean philosopher; and, if we may credit the story told by Diodθ rus, he was the fellow-student of Philip of Macedonia. Devoted though he seems to have been to the study of philosophy, he did not neglect those lighter accomplishments which add grace to the character; and Nepos even thinks it necessary to tell us the names of the masters from whom he derived his knowledge of music and dan cing. ...

At the period when Epaminondas appeared upon the stage, the small republics of Greece were torn to pieces by intestine dissensions; at one time the party of the ∏c and noble prevailed, at another the power ofthe demθ∙ cracy was predominant. Of the latter party Athens was the main prop, whilst Sparta was the powerful friend o the former. It does not appear that Epaminondas in h ιs earlier years took any prominent part in support of either faction, being probably disgusted by the intrigues and remorseless cruelty which he saw practised by all parties 1,1 [7:9:303] -the pursuit of whatever object they had in view. He was present indeed at the battle of Mantinea (385 b. c.), fought between the Arcadians and Spartans; and it was mainly through his efforts that it was decided in favour of the latter, on the very same ground which was destined a few years afterwards (362 b. c.) to witness his own death, and the defeat of his allies.

During the whole period of his political life his friendship with Pelopidas was uninterrupted, and, according to Plutarch, nothing reflected greater glory on both, than that they never allowed a feeling of rivalry to interfere with their exertions for their common country. Yet no two individuals could possibly be more dissimilar in character, as Pelopidas loved all the pomp and splendour of power, whilst Epaminondas was better pleased to remain in poverty and retirement. The nobles, mistrusting their own strength, received a Spartan garrison (382 b. c.) into their citadel, and Pelopidas and the chiefs’of the popular party were banished; but Epaminondas, who was supposed to be more engaged in the speculations of philosophy than in the active affairs of life, was allowed to remain. Three years afterwards a conspiracy was formed to recover the independence of Thebes; but though his friend Pelopidas was at its head, Epaminondas refused to join in the attempt, wisely judging that the bloodshed and rapine which would inevitably follow any violent change in the government must more than counterbalance the good anticipated from the success of the popular party. The conspirators succeeded without his assistance, yet prudently adopted the moderate counsels which he recommended. The Spartans made an attempt to recover their power, but, being defeated by Pelopidas, were induced to listen to terms of accommodation. A general diet of all the states of Greece was summoned at Sparta, in order that peace might be established on just and sound principles. Epaminondas was the deputy appointed by Thebes, and the able manner in which he maintained the interests of his country did not disappoint the expectations of his fellovv-citizens. He refused to emancipate the cities of Boeotia from the control of Thebes, unless Sparta was prepared to act the same part towards those subject to her in Laconia. Negotiations were broken off, as neither party showed a disposition to yield, and orders were sent to Cleombrotus the Spartan general, then in Phocis, to commence hostilities against the Thebans. It was now that dpaminondas, by the consent of all, was appointed to the chief command, and the measures which he took to protect the country from the incursions of Cleombrotus were so complete that they compelled the Spartan general to ∙etιre from Chaeronea, where he had taken up his position. Cleombrotus descended from the mountains to the sea shore, and passing along the difficult and rugged coast at he foot of Mount Helicon, reached without interruption he plains of Leuctra, at no great distance from Thebes. Here he found the troops of the Thebans posted on the leι ghts around; and in the council of war which was held required all the ability of Epaminondas to persuade the ’mcers that the fate of their country ought to be staked on he chances of a general engagement. In this, however, ıe succeeded, and immediately drew out his men in order >f battle.

The result of his arrangements was a complete victory, gained in July 371 b. c. To his friends who congratulated llm he answered, “that his chief pleasure arose from his ’arenţs being alive to enjoy his triumph.” Two years af- ’O 0∏ s ' 3att * e ^ ιe entered the Peloponnesus at the head of jθOO men, carrying terror and desolation to the very ’. a es of Lacedaemon, which had not for five or six centu-aell ΛθΤ t ^ 1e sm °k e °f a n enemy’s camp. He was corned, however, to retire, by the able generalship of Agesilaus, though not until he had devastated the whole country around. On his return home he was brought to trial, along with Pelopidas and the other generals, tor having retained his command four months beyond the time specified by law. He recommended the other generals to plead as their excuse his superior orders, and then boldly said to the assembly, “I acknowledge that the law condemns me to death; all I ask is, that the sentence passed on me may be couched in these words: Epaminondas was punished for having conquered the Spartans at Leuctra, for having besieged Lacedaemon, and rebuilt Messene.” The boldness of this answer was of course applauded, and Epaminondas acquitted; yet his enemies had sufficient influence with the people to exclude him from all honourable employment. Some time afterwards he redeemed his character by a successful campaign against Alexander, the tyrant of Pherae, in Thessaly, and by delivering his friend Pelopidas from the hands of that unprincipled despot. A war broke out between the Tegeates in Arcadia, who had implored the assistance of the Thebans, and the Mantineans, who were supported by Lacedemon. The two armies met near Mantinea, the modern village oĩ Paleopoli, when Epaminondas employing a manoeuvre similar to that which had succeeded at Leuctra, gained a complete victory, but was wounded by a javelin, the iron point of which remained in his body. Before he expired, he inquired for the generals Deiphantus and Jollidas, and being told they were dead, he*added, “Then persuade the Thebans to make peace.” In fact, from this moment, Thebes, to use the expression of an ancient writer, was a javelin deprived of its iron point, and ceased to be formidable. Epaminondas died on the 4th July 362 b. c. one of the most perfect models that Greece presents of a great captain, a true patriot, and a philosophic sage.

His life was written by Plutarch, but it has been unfortunately lost; there are, however, many details of it contained in the lives of Agesilaus and Pelopidas, and also in his moral works. But it is to Xenophon that we are indebted for the chief facts. The life of Epaminondas by Cornelius Nepos has been evidently mutilated. The reader may also consult Diodorus Siculus, x. xvi. xv.; Pausanias, Polybius, Aelian, and Valerius Maximus. A long and uninteresting life has been published by De la Tour, Paris 1739, 12mo; by Meismer, in German, !2mo, Prague, 1798; and in the Mémoires de l , Acad. des Inscript, et Pelles Lettres, vol. xiv. p. 113.
