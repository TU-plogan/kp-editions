EYE, in Anatomy. See Anatomy and Optics. Eye, a borough town of the county of Suffolk, ninety miles from London, in the hundred of Hartismere. It is situated in a level country, and nearly surrounded with a small stream. There is a good market place, but the streets are neither wide nor well built. The greater portion of the town belonged to the late Marquis Cornwallis, but since his death has been sold to Sir Edward Kerrison. There was formerly some trade in spinning worsted, and in making inferior bone-lace; but these have been destroyed by the introduction of machinery. Two members were returned to the House of Commons, but since 1832 it sends only one. There was formerly a Benedictine monastery, the chapel of which, a fine building, is now the parish church. The market is held on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1734, in 1811 to 1893, in 1821 to 1882, and in 1831 to 2313.
