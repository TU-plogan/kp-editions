EXARCH, in Antiquity, an appellation given by the emperors of the East to certain officers sent into Italy, in quality of vicars, or rather prefects, to defend that part of Italy which yet remained under their obedience, particularly the city of Ravenna, against the Lombards, who had made themselves masters of nearly all the rest of the country.

The residence of the exarch was at Ravenna, which city, together with that of Rome, was all that remained to the emperors. The first exarch was the patrician Boetius, famous for his treatise De Consolatione Philosophice, who was appointed in 568 by the younger Justin. The exarchs subsisted about 185 years, and ended with Eutychius, under whose exarchate the city of Ravenna was taken by the Lombard king Astulphus, or Astolphus.

The emperor Frederick created Heraclius, archbishop of Lyons, a descendant of the illustrious house of Montbois-sier, exarch of the whole kingdom of Burgundy; à dignity till that time unknown except in Italy, particularly in the city of Ravenna.

Homer, Philo, and other ancient authors, give the name exarchus to the choragus or master of the singers in the ancient choruses; the word αf%ω or uςχομaι signifying equally to begin and to commend.

EXARCH of a Diocese was, anciently, the same with primate. This dignity was inferior to the patriarchal, yet greater than the metropolitan.

Exarch also denotes an officer, still subsisting in the Greek church, being a kind of deputy or legate a latere of the patriarch, whose office it is to visit the provinces allotted him, in order to inform himself of the lives and manners of the clergy, and to take cognizance of ecclesiastical causes, the manner of celebrating divine service, the administration of the sacraments, particularly confession, the observance of the* canons, monastic discipline, affairs of marriages and divorces, and, above all, the revenues which the patriarch receives from several churches, with the collection of the same. The exarch, after having greatly enriched himself in his post, frequently rises to the patriarchate itself.

Exarch is also used, in the ecclesiastical antiquities of the Eastern church, for a general or superior over several monasteries, as an archimandrite, who is exempted by the patriarch of Constantinople from the jurisdiction of the bishops, in the same manner as are the generals of the Roman Catholic monastic orders.
