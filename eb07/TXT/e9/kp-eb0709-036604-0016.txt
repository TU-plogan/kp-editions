ERZERUM, the capital of one of the most considerable pashaliks in Armenia, of the same name, which is ruled by a pasha of three tails. It is surrounded on all sides by mountains, the highest peaks of which are covered with snow; and it lies in a valley beneath. The streets are in general paved, and the houses are built of stone, with rafters of wood and terraces. On the tops of these the grass grows, and they afford pasture for sheep; so that when seen from a distance they appear to form part of the plain in front of the town, which is about twenty miles in circumference, and is embellished with upwards of sixty villages. Towards the south the town is protected by a citadel, mounting twenty pieces of cannon of different calibres. It is surrounded by a double wall of stone, and has four gates covered with plates of iron. On the eastern face this work assumes a modern appearance, having regular embrasures; but, from its want of solidity, it is equally defenceless with any other part of the castle. In the eastern part of the city is an old brick tower, the loftiest building in the place, with a clock on the summit which strikes the hours with tolerable regularity. It contains forty-five mosques and two churches. Two of the most ancient of the mosques are beautifully ornamented with bricks and coloured tiles, which lofty domes, together with the glittering minarets of others, give a delusive appearance of splendour to the city when seen from a little distance, which totally vanishes on a nearer view. There are, besides, a Greek church and a large Arminian chapel; and at some distance from the city are three celebrated monasteries. The bazars are extensive, and well supplied with provisions, excepting fruit, which is brought by the Georgians from the province of Akiska, a distance of three or four days’ journey. It has manufactures of considerable importance, and carries on an extensive trade in copper, and in articles from Persia, and from the countries to the north-west of Hindustan. In winter the cold is intense; it commences in August, and snow lies on the ground from October to

March. The air is however pure, the water good, and the inhabitants in general healthy. The town was visited by the plague in 1807, which carried off a great number of the inhabitants. The population amounts, according to some, to 100,000 or 130,000, and consists of Turks, Greeks, Persians, and Armenians. Sir R. K. Porter’s estimate is only 6000 Christians and 50,000 Mahommedans. It is two hundred and fifty miles north-north-east of Aleppo Long. 40. 57. E. Lat. 39. 57. N. .
