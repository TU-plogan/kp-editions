EORIA, in Mythology, a feast celebrated by the Athenians in honour of Erigonus, who, by way of punishment for their not avenging the death of his father Icarus, induced the gods to inflict on their daughters the curse of loving men who returned not their passion. The feast was instituted by the order of Apollo.
