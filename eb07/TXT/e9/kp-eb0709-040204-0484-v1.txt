EUPHORION, a son of Polymnestus of Chalcis, a town of Euboea, born 274 b. c. at the time when the Romans conquered Pyrrhus. He studied under the philosophers Lacydes and Prytanis, and composed many works both in prose and verse. He was appointed by Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, to superintend the library he was collecting at Antioch, which he was anxious should rival that at Alexandria; and here Euphorion resided till his death. Only a few fragments of his works have been preserved; but from the opinions expressed by ancient writers we find that the erudite character of his allusions rendered him so obscure that he was difficult to be understood, and that he was constantly in search of rare and obsolete expressions. Yet he was much admired in the time of Cicero; and in the reign of Augustus his works still continued to be favourites. Cornelius Gallus translated some of his poems; but it was the Emperor Tiberius who carried his admiration beyond all bounds. He imitated his style, as well as that of Rhiarius and Parthenius, and placed their books and busts in all the public libraries. See an account of his life and character by Meinecke, prefixed to an edition of his fragments; De Euphorionis Chalcidensis Vita et Scriptis, &c. Gedani, 1823; also Clinton’s Pasti Hellenici, vol. ii. p. 511; Heyne, De Euphorione, ct Excurs. iii. ad Virg. Eclog. vi. 64, and Excurs. v. ad Aen. ii. See also Ephemer. Liter. Halens. 1824.
