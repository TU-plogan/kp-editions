EUNAPIUS, a native of Sardis, in Lydia, a celebrated sophist, physician, and historian, who flourished in the fourth century, under the emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian. He wrote the lives of the philosophers and sophists, in which he frequently shows himself a bitter enemy to the Christians; and also a history of the Caesars, which he brought down from the reign of Claudius, where Herodian ended, to that of Arcadius and Honorius. The history is lost; but its substance has been preserved in Zosimus, who is supposed to have done little more than copy it.
