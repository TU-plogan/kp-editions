EUROCLYDON, (from Eugoç, the east wind, and κλoδωv, a wave), is a species of wind, of which we have an account only in the Acts of the Apostles (xxvii. 14), and concerning the nature of which critics have been much divided. Bochart, Grotius, Bentley, and others, substitute another reading, supported by the Alexandrian Manuscript, and the Vulgate, namely, Eugaκuλωv or Euro-aquilo ; but Mr Bryant defends the common reading, and considers the Euroclydon as an east wind which causes a deep sea or vast inundation. He maintains, in opposition to the reasoning of Bentley, who supposes that the mariners in the ship, the voyage of which is recited in this passage, were Romans, that they were Greeks of Alexandria, and that the ship was an Alexandrian ship employed in carrying corn to Italy; and, therefore, that the mariners had a name in their own language for the particular typhonico stormy wind here mentioned. He also shows from the passage itself, that the tempestuous wind called Εuroclp don beat upon the island of Crete; and hence, as this is a relative expression, referring to the situation of the person using it, who was at that time to the windward or south of it, the wind blew upon shore, and must have come from the south or south-east, which, he adds, is fully warranted by the point where the ship was, and the direction it ran in afterwards, which was towards the north and north-west.
