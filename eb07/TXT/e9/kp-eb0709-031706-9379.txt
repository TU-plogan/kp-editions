EPISTLE, the same as letter; but it is now chiefly used in speaking of ancient writings, as the epistles of St Paul, of Cicero, of Pliny, and so on.

Ερistlεs and Gospels, in the liturgy of the Church of England, are portions of Scripture selected from the writings of the evangelists and apostles, and appointed to be read, in the communion service, on Sundays and holidays. They are believed to have been selected by St Jerome, and by him put into the lectionary.

The epistles and gospels are placed in an admirable order and method, and bear a special relation to the several days on which they are read. The year is distinguished into two parts; the first being designed to commemorate Christ’s sojourn upon earth, and the other to instruct us to live after his example. The former includes the whole time from Advent to Trinity Sunday; the latter all the Sundays from Trinity to Advent.
