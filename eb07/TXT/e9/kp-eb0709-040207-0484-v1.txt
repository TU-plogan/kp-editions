EURE, a department of the north-east of. France, formed out of the ancient Norman Bexin, the district o Saint André, Neuburg, a part of Perche, and of Ouche, Auge, Lienvin, and Roumois, all parts of the former country of Normandy. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Lower Seine, on the east by those o Oise and Seine-Oise, on the south by Eure-Loire an Orne, and on the west by Calvados. The extent is 24» square miles, or, according to the Almanach Roy α k^'~^ hectares, of which 371,136 are arable land, 108,0 [7:9:403] woods, 11,931 vineyards, 18,537 meadows, 2726 gardens, 47 581 uncultivated land, and the rcmaindcr roads, rivers, and the sites of towns. It is divided into five arrondissements, thirty-six cantons, and 843 communes, inhabited by 421,480 persons. It is generally a level country, but a few hills are to be seen on the borders of the Seine, the Rille, and the Eure, though none of them are more than three hundred feet above the level of the sea. The soil generally consists of vegetable matter, mingled with clay and sometimes marl, resting on a bed of chalk or stone. The cultivation is tolerably conducted; so that, with the natural fertility of the soil, the department, though rather densely peopled, produces more corn than the population requires. The chief kind of corn is wheat, the growth of which occupies a larger space than rye, oats, and barley together. Flax is largely cultivated, and, from its length, fineness, and colour, is highly esteemed. The seed of this plant is drawn cither from Flanders or from Riga. Some hemp is also produced. The horses of the department, of the pure Norman breed, have always been celebrated, and, though they had nearly lost their high character, have .of late been more carefully bred and much improved. The breed of cows is remarkably good; and the calves are much in request in the neighbouring departments. Sheep have been neglected, but have recently increased; and those on the coast, known as Moutons clu Pré Sale, are highly valued for their excellent meat. Of late years attempts have been made to improve the wool by a mixture of merinos. Fruit is very abundant, especially apples, from which much cider is made. The wine is but of moderate quality, and will rarely bear to be kept longer than three years. There are no mines but of iron, which yield annually 400 tons.

This department is a manufacturing part of France; and cotton, linen, and woollen cloths of every kind, are fabricated. There are large establishments for making copper ware of all kinds, the various descriptions of paper, nails, pins, and needles, glass for windows, and glass bottles, and ∣ jewellery and trinkets. These employments occupy the larger portion of the inhabitants. Such goods form the trade; in addition to which, fire-wood, timber, cattle, honey, wax, and corn, are furnished to the districts surrounding the department.
