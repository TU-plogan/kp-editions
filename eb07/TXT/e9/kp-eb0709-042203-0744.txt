EUSTATIA, St, one of the Leeward Islands, in the West Indies. It is a high rock, rising from the waves in the form of a pyramid, gradually tapering to the top. It 13 twenty-nine miles in circumference at the base, and, notwithstanding the singular conformation of the island, the climate is healthy, and the soil, which is cultivated to the very summit, most prolific. It is, however, like other islands in this region of the globe, subject to the desolating visitation of thunder-storms and hurricanes. The latter are most to be dreaded during the months of August and September, and they have been frequently so severe as to lay waste the island and scatter the shipping. There is only one landing-place, and that, though difficult of access, is strongly fortifie , [7:9:423]indeed the whole island has been rendered nearly impregnable when properly garrisoned. Sugar, cotton, and maize arÂ¢ here produced; but the vegetable production most cultivatec is tobacco. Small as this island is, it is said to support nearly twenty thousand inhabitants, who, besides their agricultura avocations, rear hogs, kids, rabbits, and all kinds of poultry, with which they arc enabled to serve their neighbours after having supplied themselves. This island was settled by the Dutch as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century; but in 1665 it was taken by the British, who ir their turn were ejected by the French. In 1781 it yielded to Admiral Rodney; from the English it was again wrested by the French, and after repeatedly changing masters according to the varying fortunes of war, it was finally transferred to the Dutch government at the peace of 1814. St Eustatia lies fifteen miles south of Saba, and eight miles north-west of St Christophers. Long. 63. 5. W. Lat. 17. 31. N.
