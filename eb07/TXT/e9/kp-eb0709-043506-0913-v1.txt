EXAMINATION, an exact and careful search or inquiry, in order to discover the truth or falsehood of a thing.

Self-EχAMiNATi0N is a point much insisted on by divines, and particularly the ancient fathers, by way of preparation for repentance. St Ignatius reduces it to five points, a returning thanks to God for his benefits; a begging of grace and light, to know and distinguish our sins; a running over all our actions, occupations, thoughts, and words, in order to learn what has been offensive to God; a begging of pardon, and conceiving a sincere sorrow for having displeased him; and making a firm resolution not to offend him any more, and taking the necessary precautions to preserve ourselves from sin.
