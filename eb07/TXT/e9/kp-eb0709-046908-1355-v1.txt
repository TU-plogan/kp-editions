EXTREME is applied to the last and outermost part of any thing, or that which finishes and terminates it on one side.

Extremes, in Logic, denote two terms of a syllogism, the predicate and subject. They are called extremes, from their relation to another term, which is a medium or mean between them. The predicate, as being likewise contained in the first proposition, is called the majus extremum 0r greater extreme; and the subject, as being put in the second or minor proposition, is called the minus extremum or lesser extreme. Thus, in the syllogism, “Man is an animal; Peter is a man; therefore Peter is an animal ;” ie word animal is the greater extreme, Peter the less extreme, and man the mediuirf.

Extreme and mean Proportion, in Geometry, is when a lne is so divided, that the whole line is to the greater se gment as that segment is to the other; or, as it is expressed by Euclid, when the line is so divided that the rectangle under the whole line, and the lesser segment, is equal to the square of the greater segment.
