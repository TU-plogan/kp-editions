EVATES, a branch or division of the Druids, or ancient Celtic philosophers. Strabo divides the British and Gaelic philosophers into three sects; Bards, Evates, and Druids. He adds that the Bards were the poets and musicians, the Evates the priests and naturalists, and the Druids were moralists as well as naturalists. But Marcellus and Hornius mention only two sects, the Bards and Druids.
