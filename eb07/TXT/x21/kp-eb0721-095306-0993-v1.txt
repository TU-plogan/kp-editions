XATIVA, a government of Spain, in the kingdom of Valencia, extending from the river Alcia to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. It is now more commonly called St Felipe, its ancient name having been changed by law since the expulsion of the Moors. The capital of the partido of the same name was founded by the Romans, and called by them Setabis. It is situated on the declivity of a calcareous mountain, overlooking a plain not very fruitful, though watered by the river Albayda, one of the tributary streams of the Xucar. The city is surrounded with ancient walls, partly of Roman and partly of Moorish construction, on which are thirty towers. It has also double ditches, and a strong citadel; but all have alike fallen into decay. It is supplied with water by two ancient aqueducts. Before the recent changes, this city contained four parish churches, thirteen monasteries, nine chapels, and eight poor-houses or hospitals. The inhabitants are estimated at 14,000 souls, some of whom are employed in making linen and silk goods, and some writing paper. Near to it are twenty-two warm medicinal springs of various curative power. This place gave birth to a celebrated painter named Ribero, but better known by the assumed name of Spannoletto.
