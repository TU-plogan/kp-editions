XENOCRATES, a celebrated ancient Grecian philosopher, was born at Chalcedon in the ninety-fifth Olympiad. At first he attached himself to Aeschines, but afterwards became a disciple of Plato, who took much pains in cultivating his genius, which was naturally heavy. His temper was gloomy, his aspect severe, and his manners little tinctured with urbanity. These material defects his master took great pains to correct, frequently advising him to sacrifice to the Graces; and the pupil was patient of instruction, and knew how to value the kindness of his preceptor. As long as Plato lived, Xenocrates was one of his most esteemed disciples; after his death he closely adhered to his doctrine; and in the second year of the 110th Olympiad, he took the chair in the academy, as the successor of Speusippus. Xenocrates was celebrated among the Athenians, not only for his wisdom, but likewise for his virtues. So eminent was his reputation for integrity, that when he was called upon to give evidence in a judicial transaction, in which an oath was usually required, the judges unanimously agreed that his simple asseveration should be taken, as a public testimony to his merit. Even Philip of Macedon found it impossible to corrupt him. So abstemious was he with respect to food, that his provision was frequently spoiled before it was consumed. His chastity was invincible. Phryne, a celebrated Athenian courtezan, attempted without success to seduce him. Of his humanity the following pathetic incident is a sufficient proof. A sparrow, which was pursued by a hawk, flew into his bosom; he afforded it protection till its enemy was out of sight, and then let it go, saying that he would never betray a suppliant. He was fond of retirement, and was seldom seen in the city. He was discreet in the use of his time, and carefully allotted a certain portion of each day to its proper business. One of these he employed in silent meditation. He was an admirer of the mathematical sciences; and was so fully convinced of their utility, that when a young man, who was unacquainted with geometry and astronomy, desired admission into the academy, he refused his request, saying that he was not yet possessed of the handles of philosophy. In fine, Xenocrates was eminent both for the purity of his [7:21:954] morals and for his acquaintance with science, and supported the credit of the Platonic school by his lectures, his writings, and his conduct. He lived to the first year of the 116th Olympiad, or the eighty-second of his age, when he lost his life by accidentally falling, in the dark, into a reservoir of water.
