X, or x, is the twenty third letter of our alphabet, and a double consonant. It was not used by the Hebrews or ancient Greeks; for as it is a compound letter, the ancients, who used great simplicity in their writings, expressed this letter by its component letters c s . Neither have the Italians this letter, but express it by ss . X scarcely begins any word in our language but such as are of Greek origin; and is in few others but what are of Latin derivation, as perplex, reflexion, defluxion, &c. We often express this sound by single letters, as cks, in backs, necks; by ks, in books, breaks; by cc in access, accident; by ct, in action, unction, &c. The English and French pronounce it like cs or ks; the Spaniards like c before a, viz. Alexandro, as it were Alecandro. In numerals it expresses 10, whence in old Roman manuscripts it is used for denarius; and as such seems to be made of two V’s placed one over the other. When a dash is added over it, thus, x̄, it signifies 10,000.
