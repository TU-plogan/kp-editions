XIMENA, a city of Spain, in the province of Andalusia, about twenty-five miles from the British fortress of Gibraltar. It is utterly inaccessible for any kind of wheelcarriages. It was once a place of importance, as it gave the title of king to Abou Melic, the son of the emperor of Fez. In more ancient times, it was a Roman station, as is proved by the walls of the castle, and by numerous inscriptions which have been found in its vicinity. The town lies under the shelter of a rocky ledge, which is detached from the mass of the lofty mountains, and is crowned with the ruined towers of an ancient castle, which forms a picturesque view from the surrounding country. Ximena is nearly a mile in length, and principally consists of two long narrow streets, one extending from north to south, and the other leading up to the castle: the alleys between them are in steps up the steep side of the impending hill, and can only be reached on foot. The old castle, of Roman foundation, but of Moorish superstructure, is accessible only on the side of the town, and in former days must have been impregnable. This citadel is 400 yards in length, and varies in breadth from fifty to eighty yards. It is surrounded by a turreted wall, except where the scarped rock has rendered it unnecessary. It has been provided with vaulted tanks and magazines, but from neglect they are in a dilapidated state. It was exposed to great injury in 1811, when it was partially blown up by General Ballasteros, who abandoned it on the approach of the French, to seek a more sure protection under the guns of Gibraltar. The town at the present day is poor, containing about 8000 inhabitants, who are chiefly occupied in agriculture; but many are employed in the seductive but hazardous trade of smuggling tobacco and other goods from Gibraltar into the interior of Spain. The river Sogarganta runs at the foot of the place, and has on its left bank the ruins of a vast building, erected sixty years ago for the purpose of casting cannon-balls for the siege of the British fortress.
