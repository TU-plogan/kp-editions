MONACO, a province of Sardinia, but formerly an independent principality, now reduced to the condition of a mediatized state, to the prince of which his rents are preserved. It extends over fifty-five square miles, and contains two cities, with about 6000 inhabitants. The district is sheltered from cold winds, which makes the climate like that of the tropics; and the productions of the soil are similar, fruit being abundant, but corn deficient,' and flesh rather more so. It was seized by France in 1792, and added to one of her departments; but, by the congress of Vienna in 1815, it was transferred to Sardinia. The chief place, of the same name, is situated on a tongue of land running into the sea. The walls and gates are dilapidated. It contains 1250 inhabitants, employed in petty trade. Long. 7. 23. E. Lat. 43. 44. N.
