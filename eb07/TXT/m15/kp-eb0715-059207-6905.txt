MUNICH, a city, the capital of the kingdom of Bavaria, as well as of the circle of the Iser, in which, on the banks of the river of that name, it is situated. It is in longitude 12. 28. 25. east, and in latitude 48. 8. 20. north. It is situated on a plain nearly surrounded by the river, and is enclosed with walls, although they afford but a slight military defence. The streets are wide, and the houses well built, whilst the public edifices are some of them of a degree of magnificence rather surpassing the extent and wealth of the kingdom. The private dwellings are for the most part large, there being (in 1825) in the city and suburbs 57,623 inhabitants, occupying 3664 houses. In this the military, amounting with their families to 4667, are not included. The royal palace is a magnificent pile, extending to 550 feet in length, with beautiful Doric gates and pillars. The interior, besides elegant suites of apartments, contains a beautiful chapel, in which is an altar said to have belonged to Mary Queen of Scotland during her imprisonment, the antiquarium, and the Schatzkammer or treasury of the crown jewels. The picture-gallery is a noble building, well calculated for exhibiting to advantage the finest collection of works of art in Germany. It has been formed out of the galleries of Manheim, of Dusseldorf, and of Deux Ponts, with additions purchased by the late king in Italy, Vienna, and Paris. The royal library is a valuable assemblage of books, but particularly rich in numerous curious manuscripts. The antique gallery, erected by the present king when crown prince, is a most elegant edifice. It is in front 225 feet, and has a peristyle of twenty-two Ionic pillars; it is built of marble, and contains an excellent collection of ancient and modern statuary. The elegance of the exterior of this building, called the glypthothek, is very imposing. There are several other objects of curiosity which render Munich a city worth visiting. The English garden, with a rapid stream conducted through it, is well arranged, and forms a delightful promenade. The patronage of the fine arts is extensively exercised, and the societies for the encouragement of them, as well as of the useful arts, are extensive and liberal. The observatory is furnished with the best optical instruments, all fabricated by native workmen. The telescopes, whose lenses were ground by Fraunhofer, are of great celebrity, and have rarely been equalled. The manufactures, though numerous, are upon a small scale; the most remarkable being those of philosophical instruments, jewellery, gold and silver articles, musical instru ments, watches, and some smaller articles. The lithographic art is carried on with more skill and success at Munich than in any other place. The churches are numerous, handsome, and well attended by a population apparently more devout than is commonly the case in Germany. The Protestants are not more than one tenth of the inhabitants. Though the city is 1900 feet above the level of the sea, and consequently cold in winter, it is generally considered as healthy.
