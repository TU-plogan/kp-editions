MULL, an island of the Hebrides, the third in size, belonging to Argyleshire, and separated from the mainland by the narrow gut of sea called the Sound of Mull. It is situated in longitude 5. 18. west, and latitude 56. 27. north. Its figure is very irregular, being deeply indented by arms of the sea. Its extreme length is about thirty miles, and its greatest breadth twenty-five. The superficial area is estimated at 425 square miles. The climate is humid, and heavy falls of rain are frequent from the west, being probably caused by the high hills which form the mountainous tract in the district of Torosay; and, on the whole, this island is considered as the most boisterous of all the Hebrides. Winter, however, is much milder than on the mainland; less snow falls, and the frost is of short continuance. There are on the island several lakes, from which the brooks mostly descend. The island is for the most part rugged and mountainous, rising to upwards of 2000 feet in height; and almost every part of its shore is rocky and precipitous, exhibiting scenery which awes by its natural “rudeness, as well as deep recesses and shrubby ravines, which delight the mind with their fairy beauty. Benmore, situated near the head of Loch-na-Keal, is the highest mountain, and is elevated 3097 feet above the level of the sea; it commands a view of nearly all the Hebrides, and its ascent is neither very difficult nor tedious. Bientalindh, the highest hill next to this, is 2294 feet, and also commands an extensive prospect. The island is, with slender exceptions, an entire mass of trap-rock. Limestone is found in the southern cliffs; but on the north-west side, near Inch Kenneth, a green sandstone appears; indeed Inch Kenneth is formed of it. The red granite of Mull is of admirable quality. Ou the northern shore of the Ross, in particular, it is distributed in such a manner, and in masses so large and free from fissures, that it would be easy to extract from it columns of twenty, thirty, forty, and even fifty feet or upwards.

Coal has been wrought in several parts of the island, but without a successful result. There are many caves in the island, but those on the western coast, in the district of Gribon, are the most remarkable. They are called Mackinnon’s Cave and the Ladder Cave. The soil of Mull is both deep and fertile. The island is very bare of trees, although at one time it was celebrated for its woods. The uncommon moisture and ready drainage of the island are conducive to the production of verdure in places which might otherwise be covered with useless bog and heath. The land is therefore well fitted for grazing; and the proprietors and tenants having turned their attention to that object, have materially improved the breed of black cattle, and considerably increased their number. The Tweeddale breed of sheep has been substituted for the ancient Highland one. A few of the Cheviot race are also to be found in the low farms, but the boisterous climate has prevented their general adoption. The breed of horses is peculiar to the island, and they have been long noted for hardiness. They are now greatly reduced, in consequence of the allotment of farms, the introduction of green crops, and improvements in farming. A few are still exported to the Irish market. Mull, in consequence of the action of the sea, is not very productive of kelp, yet about 600 tons are manufactured annually. The inhabitants are naturally [7:15:591]indolent: they follow no branch of industry; rearing cattle, agriculture, fishing, and making kelp, being their only employments.

The antiquities of Mull are uninteresting. There are a few Danish remains, and ruins of some of the ancient strongholds. The most striking of these is Castle Duart, placed at the entrance of the Sound of Mull. At Balphe-trish is the famous ringing stone. Mull is divided into the three parochial districts of Kilfini c hen, Kilninian, and Torosay, which also comprehends several of the adjacent islets within its pastoral cure. There are several villages in the island, but the only one of note is Tobermory, situated near the head of the Sound. It was built in 1789, by the. Board of Trustees for the^ Encouragement of the Fisheries, and comprises an upper and lower town, the former consisting of very dingy streets; the latter is built in the form of a crescent, and contains the custom-house, an inn, a post office, and from fifty to sixty slated houses. The town has remained almost stationary since it was built, partly in consequence of the peculiar habits of the people, and partly owing to the unfavourable position of the town, and its distance from the fishinggrounds. The number of boats employed at this station in the year ending the 5th of April 1836 was 642, yielding employment, in fishing, gutting, and packing, to 4552 persons. The number of cod, and of ling or hake, brought into this port during that year, amounted to 43,090; of these, 1338 hundredweights were cured; as also 705 barrels of white herrings. The number of men and boats employed do not belong to Tobermory, but come from all quarters at the fishing season. In 1831 the inhabited houses in the island were 1817, and the families 2031. The families employed in agriculture were 1297; in trades, 284; not included in either of these classes, 450. The total number of males was 5265, and that of females 5273, making in all 10,538. The actual population of Tobermory amounts to about 1500.
