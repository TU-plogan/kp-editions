MIDDLEWICH, a town of the county of Chester, in the hundred of Northwich, 166 miles from London. It is situated between the rivers Whecloch and Dane, which unite below the town and fall into the Wever; and it has also a canal communication with the Mersey at Runcorn. It has celebrated brine springs of great strength, from which abundance of culinary salt is made, and conveyed with facility to Liverpool. Of late years a branch of the cotton [7:15:62] manufacture has been established here. The market is held on Tuesday. The population of the town amounted in 1801 to 1190, in 1811 to 1232, in 1821 to 1212, and in 1831 to 1325; but the whole parish, at the last census, contained 4782 inhabitants.
