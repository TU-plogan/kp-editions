MOLINOSISTS, a sect amongst the Roman Catholics who adhere to the doctrine of Molinos. These are the same with those otherwise called Quietests, whose chief principle is, that men ought to annihilate themselves in order to be united to God, and afterwards remain in quietness of mind, without being troubled for what shall happen to the body. Molinos, the author of these opinions, was a Spanish priest, and was born in the year 1627. His sixtyeight propositions were examined in 1687, by the pope and the inquisitors, who decreed that his doctrine was false and pernicious, and that his books should be burned. He was obliged to recant his errors publicly in the Dominican church, and was condemned to perpetual imprisonment. He was then sixty years of age, and had been spreading his doctrine twenty-two years before this time. He died in prison in 1692.
