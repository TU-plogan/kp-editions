MONSEIGNEUR, in the plural Messeigneurs, a title of honour and respect used by the French in writing to persons of superior rank or quality.

Dukes, peers, archbishops, bishops, and presidents Ã  mortier, were complimented with the title of Monseigneur. In the petitions presented to the sovereign courts, they used the term Messeigneurs. Monseigneur, absolutely used, was a title applied to the dauphin of France. This custom was unknown till the time of Louis XIV. before which the dauphin was styled Monsieur le Dauphin.
