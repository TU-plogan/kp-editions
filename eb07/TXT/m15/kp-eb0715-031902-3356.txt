MOHAWK, a large branch of the Hudson, or North River, of the state of New York, in North America. It rises in the north-east part of Oneyda county, about twenty miles north of Rome, to which place it runs in nearly a south direction, and then turns eastward towards the Hudson, which it enters by several mouths between Troy and Waterford, after a course of about one hundred and thirty-five miles. The stream of the Mohawk is unequal, having many breaks and rapids, and two considerable falls. With the aid of canals, however, it is rendered navigable from Schenectady to Rome; but it chiefly serves the purposes of navigation by supplying water to the canals in its immediate vicinity. It is remarkably well adapted for supplying water-power for all manufacturing purposes. The land upon its borders is rich, and fitted for all agricultural purposes. The banks of this river were originally peopled by the Mohawks, an Indian tribe remarkable for courage and ferocity.
