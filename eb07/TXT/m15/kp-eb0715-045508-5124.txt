MOPSUS, in fabulous history, a celebrated prophet during the Trojan war, the son of Manto and Apollo. He was consulted by Amphimachus, king of Colophon, who wished to know what success would attend his arms in a war which he was going to undertake; and he predicted the greatest calamities; but Calchas, who had been a soothsayer of the Greeks during the Trojan war, promised the greatest successes. Amphimachus followed the opinion of Calchas; but the prediction of Mopsus was fully verified. This had such an effect upon Calchas, that he died soon afterwards. His death is attributed by some to another mortification of the same nature.
