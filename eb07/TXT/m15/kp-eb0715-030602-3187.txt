MITHRAS, or Mithra, a god of Persia and Chaldaea, supposed to be the Sun, and whose worship was introduced at Rome. He is generally represented as a young man, whose head is covered with a turban after the manner of the Persians; and he supports his knee upon a bull lying on the ground, one of the horns of which he holds in one hand, whilst with the other he plunges a dagger in his neck.
