MUSES, certain fabulous deities amongst the Pagans, who were supposed to preside over the arts and sciences. The Muses were originally mere singers and musicians in the service of Osiris, or the great Egyptian Bacchus, under the instruction and guidance of his son Horus; but in succeeding times they were denominated the “daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne.” Sir Isaac Newton tells us, that the singing women of Osiris were celebrated in Thrace by the name of the Muses; and that the daughters of Pierius, a Thracian, who imitated them, were celebrated by the same name. Diodorus Siculus informs us, that Aleman of Messene, a lyric poet who flourished in the 27th Olympiad, or 670 years before Christ, makes them the daughters of Uranus and Terra. It has been asserted by some ancient writers, that at first they were only three in number; but Homer, Hesiod, and other profound mythologists, admit of nine. In his hymn to Apollo, Homer says, “By turns the nine delight to sing ;” and Hesiod, in his Theogony, names them all. They arc said to preside severally over some art or science, as music, poetry, dancing, astronomy. By certain authors they are called virgins, because the virtues of education appear unalterable; they are called Muses, from a Greek word which signifies to explain mysteries, because they have taught things the most curious and important to be known, but which are above the comprehension - of vulgar minds. Each of their names [7:15:603]is said to include some particular allegory. Clio, for instance, was so called, because those who are praised in verse acquire immortal fame; Euterpe, on account of the pleasure accruing to those who hear learned poetry; Thalia implies for ever flourishing; Melpomene indicates that her melody insinuates itself into the inmost recesses of the soul; Terpsichore marks the pleasure which those receive who are versed in the liberal arts; Erato seems to signify that the learned command the esteem and friendship of all mankind; Polyhymnia intimates that many poets are become immortal by the number of hymns which they have addressed to the gods; Urania means that those whom she instructs elevate their contemplations and celebrity to the heavens and the stars; and, lastly, the exquisite voice of Calliope has acquired her that appellation, as the inventress and guardian of eloquence and rhetoric. Concerning the Muses, the ancients had numberless ingenious and fanciful ideas, on which it would be useless to expatiate. It seems as if the first poets, enchanted with the beauties of nature, were occasionally led to invoke the nymphs of the woods, hills, and fountains; and that, yielding to the prevailing taste for allegory, they gave to these, names relative to the influence which they might be supposed to have over the productions of the mind. At first three Muses only were admitted; but in proportion as improvement was made in the art of versification, its characters and effects were personified, the number of the Muses increased, and the names they now received referred to the charms of poetry, its celestial origin, the beauty of its language, the pleasure and gaiety it inspires, the song and dance which add to it new charms, and the glory with which it is crowned.
