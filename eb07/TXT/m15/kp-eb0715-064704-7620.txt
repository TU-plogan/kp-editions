MUSKET, or Musquet, properly a fire-arm bome on the shoulder, used in war, and discharged by the application of a lighted match. Muskets were anciently borne in the field by the infantry, and were used in England so lately as the beginning of the civil wars. They are not now used; fusees or firelocks having taken their place and name.
