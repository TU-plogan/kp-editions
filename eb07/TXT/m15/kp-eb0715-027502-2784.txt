MINIMS, a religious order in the church of Rome, founded by St Francis de Paulo, towards the close of the fifteenth century. Their habit is a coarse black woollen stuff, with a woollen girdle of the same colour, tied in five knots. They are not permitted to quit their habit and girdle by day or by night. Formerly they went barefooted, but they are now allowed the use of shoes.
