MORS, Death, one of the infernal deities, born of Night without a father, and worshipped by the ancients with great solemnity. Death was not represented as an actually existing power, but as an imaginary being; and Euripides, in one of his tragedies, introduces this deity upon the stage. The moderns represent death as a skeleton armed with a scythe and a scimitar.
