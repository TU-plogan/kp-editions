MYIAGRUS Deus, in the heathen mythology, a name sometimes given to Jupiter, and sometimes to Hercules, on occasion of sacrifices being offered to them for driving away the vast numbers of flies which infested the victims on certain public occasions. The word is usually spelt Myαgrus ; but this must be an error, as the word does not express the “fly-destroyer,” but the “mouse-destroyer,” and it is sufficiently testified by the ancients, that flies were the only creatures against whom this deity was invoked. Pliny calls this deity Myiodes, and tells us that the flies which used to pester the Olympic rites went away in clouds on the sacrificing of a bull to this god. We find in Athenaeus, also, that this sacrificing to the god of flies at the Olympic games was a constant custom. Some authors distinguish these two deities, and tell us that the latter, or Myiodes, used to visit the nations in vengeance with a vast multitude of flies, and that, upon paying him the due honours of a sacrifice, they all went away again; and this seems to agree with what Pliny mentions in several places. At the time of the Olympic games, Jupiter was worshipped under the name of Apomyos or Myiagrus Deus, and supplicated to effect the destruction of these troublesome creatures. This happened only once in many years, when the sacrifices were performed there; but the Élians worshipped him continually under this name, deprecating the vengeance of heaven, which usually sent, towards the latter end of summer (as they expressed it) an army of flies and other insects, which infested the whole country with sickness and pestilence.
