MURTEN, usually by the French called Morat, is a city of Switzerland, in the canton of Friburg, situated on a lake of the same name, in a very fertile district. It contains 1500 inhabitants, who, from their position on the great road between Basil and Berne, have a little trade. It is celebrated for the defeat of the army of Charles the Bold, duke of Brunswick, by the Swiss, in the year 1476, after the long and unavailing siege of the place by that prince. The bones of the slain in that combat were long preserved in a house built for the purpose, but it was destroyed by some French invaders in 1798. A new memorial of the event has been constructed, consisting of a fine obelisk, with the simple inscription, “Victoriam xxn Jun. mcccclxxvi. patrum concordia partam novo signat lapide respublica Friburgensis mdcccxxii.”
