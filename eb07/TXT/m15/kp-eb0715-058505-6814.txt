MOXA, or Mugwort of China, is a soft lanuginous substance, prepared in Japan from the young leaves of a species of artemisia, by beating them together when thoroughly dried, and rubbing them between the hands till only the fine fibres are left. The down upon the leaves of mullein, cotton, hemp, &c. answers the same purpose.

In the eastern countries it is used by burning it on the skin. A little cone of the moxa is laid upon the part, previously moistened, and set on fire at the top; it burns down with a temperate glowing heat, and produces a darkcoloured spot, the exulceration of which is promoted by applying a little garlic; and the ulcer is left to discharge, or is soon healed, according to the intention in using the moxa.
