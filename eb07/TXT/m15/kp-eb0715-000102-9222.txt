MEYWAR, a very extensive district of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude, and occasionally named Chitore and Odeypoor. The general surface is hilly, but not mountainous, although it abounds in naturally strong positions. The productions of this territory are wheat, rice, sugar, barley, and other grains; besides which it has a good breed of camels and horses. The principal manufactures are matchlocks, swords, and cotton cloth. The principal towns are Odeypoor, Shapoorah, and Bilarah. The district is at present possessed by numerous petty rajpoot chiefs, who live in perpetual hostility with each other.
