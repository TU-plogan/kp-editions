MILFORD, a town of North America, in Sussex county, in the Delaware state, is situated at the source of a small river, fifteen miles from Delaware Bay, and 150 southward of Philadelphia. This town, which contains about eighty houses, has been built, excepting one house, since the revolution. It is laid out with much taste, and is by no means disagreeable. The inhabitants are Episcopalians, Quakers, and Methodists.

Milford Haven, a township of Pembrokeshire, in South Wales, in the parish of Harbrandstone, 257 miles from London. The town is of recent origin, having been created by the excellence of the haven, or rather bay, which, both in regard to extent and security, is perhaps one of the best in the south of the island. It has several creeks and bays, is calculated to receive a thousand sail of vessels, and is well fortified. It was the first place which commenced the southern whale-fishery; and many ships of war have been built there, as well as smaller vessels. It is the principal point of communication between the south of England and of Ireland, by vessels daily departing for Waterford. The nearest town to the Haven is Habers-ton.
