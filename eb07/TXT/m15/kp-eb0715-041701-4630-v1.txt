MONMOUTH, James Duke of, son of Charles II. by Mrs Lucy Walters, was born at Rotterdam in 1649. Upon the Restoration, he was called over to England, where the king received him with all imaginable joy, and created him Earl of Orkney, which was changed into that of Monmouth; and he took his seat in the House of Peers in the ensuing session of parliament. He married Anne, the heiress of Francis earl of Buccleuch; and hence it came to pass that he had also the title of Buccleuch, and took the surname of Scott, according to the custom of Scotland. In 1668 his father made him captain of his life-guard of horse; and in 1672 he attended the French king in the Netherlands, and gave proofs of bravery and conduct. In 1673 the king of France appointed him lieutenant-general of the army with which he appeared before Maestricht; and he behaved with great gallantry in the attack of that place, being the first who entered it in the assault. He returned to England, and havingbeen received withall possible respect, wasappointed chancellor of the university of Cambridge. After this he wenttoassist the Prince of Orange to raise the siege of Mons, and contributed not a little towards the success of the enterprise. He again returned to England, and was sent, in quality of general, to quell an insurrection in Scotland, which he effected; but soon afterwards he fell into disgrace; for, being a Protestant, he was deluded into ambitious schemes, upon the hopes of the exclusion of the Duke of York. He conspired against his father and the duke; and when the latter came to the throne by the title of James II. he openly appeared in arms, encouraged by the discontent that prevailed; but coming to a decisive battle before he had sufficient force to oppose the royal army, he was defeated, made prisoner, tried for high treason, condemned, and beheaded, in 1685, at the age of thirty-six.

Monmouth, the capital of the county of the same name, 132 miles from London. It is situated at the junction of the river Munnow with the Wye, and there are bridges over both streams. It is indifferently well built, has a townhall in the market-place, built on pillars, which form a handsome colonnade, ornamented with a statue of King Henry V., who was born in this town. At the extremity of the town is the county gaol and court-house, commodiously arranged, and the former well regulated. It is incorporated, and governed by a mayor, recorder, two bailiffs, and fifteen common councilmen. It has long returned one member to the House of Commons, and continues to do so under the recent law. As the river Wye is navigable from Chepstow, some trade arises from that communication. The country around, but especially on the banks of the Wye, is highly picturesque and beautiful. Near it are several objects of antiquity, which are much visited. The population amounted in 1801 to 3345, in 1811 to 3503, in 1821 to 4164, and in 1831 to 4916.
