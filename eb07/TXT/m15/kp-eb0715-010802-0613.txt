MIMI, Mimes, in the ancient comedy, were buffoons or mimics, who entertained the people by taking off certain characters, and using such gestures as suited the persons or subjects they represented. There were upon the Roman stage female performers of this kind, called mimae. The word is derived from μιμεομαι, I imitate. Some of the mimi acted their parts to the sound of the tibia, and were called mirnauli. Mimi were also a kind of farces or ludicrous comedies, generally performed by one person. They had no acts, nor any exordium.

The mimi were introduced upon the Roman stage long after comedy and tragedy had arrived at their full perfection. The actor wore no mask, but smeared his face with soot, was dressed in lamb-skin, wore garlands of ivy, carried a basket of flowers and herbs in honour of Bacchus, and diverted the audience with apish tricks and ridiculous dances. This was the state of the mimi soon after their first introduction; but they underwent many alterations, which it would occupy too much room to relate, and which are not of sufficient importance to justify a detailed account.
