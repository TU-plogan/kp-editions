MITTAU, a city of the province of Courland, in European Russia, and the capital of a circle of the same name. It is in a marshy situation, at the junction of the river Drive with the Aa. It was once fortified, but the walls have gone to decay. The ancient palace of the dukes of Courland has been repaired for an imperial residence, but never so occupied. It contains seven churches, and, including the suburbs, 740 houses, with 12,420 inhabitants. There is here a college, with nine professors, and a library of 16,000 volumes. It has little trade except at a great fair, which continues four weeks. Long. 23. 20. E. Lat. 56. 45. N.
