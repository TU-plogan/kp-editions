MYRTUS, in Ancient Geography, a small island near Carystus,in Euboea, which gave name to the MarcMyrtoum. Strabo extends this sea between Crete, Argia, and Attica. Pausanias, making it commence at Euboea, joins it at Helena, a desert island, with the Aegean Sea; but Ptolemy carries it to the coast of Caria; and Pliny says that the Cyclades and Sporades are bounded on the west by the Myrtoan coast of Attica.
