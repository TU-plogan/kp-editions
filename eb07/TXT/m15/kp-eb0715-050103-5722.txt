MORISON, Robert, physician and professor of botany at Oxford, was born at Aberdeen in 1620. "He was bred at the university of that place, where he taught philosophy for some time; but having a strong inclination to botany, he made great progress in that science. The civil wars obliged him to leave his country, but he did not take this step until he had first signalized his zeal for the interest of the king, and his courage, in a battle which was fought between the inhabitants of Aberdeenand the Presbyterian troops,on the bridge of Aberdeen, in which he received a dangerous woundon the head. As soon as he was cured, he proceeded into France; and having settled at Paris, applied assiduously to the study of botany and anatomy. He was introduced to the Duke of Orleans, who committed to him the direction of the royal gardens at Blois. This office he exercised till the death of that prince, and afterwards came over to England in the year 1660. Charles II., to whom the Duke of Orleans had presented him at Blois, sent for him to London, and gave him the title of his physician, and that of royal professor of botany, with a pension of L.200 per annum. The Praeludium Botanicum, which he published in 1669, procured him so much reputation, that the university of Oxford offered him the professorship of botany, which he accepted, and acquitted himself with great ability in the discharge of his duty. He died at London in 1683, aged sixty-three. He published a second and third part of his History of Plants, in two volumes folio, under the title of Plantarum Historia Oxomensis Universalis. The first part of this excellent work has not been printed, and it is not known what has become of it.
