MUHLHAUSEN, a city of France, in the department of the Upper Rhine, and the arrondissement of Aldkirch. It stands on an island formed by the river Ill, which empties itself into the Rhine. It is the most considerable manufacturing place of the industrious department in which it stands, and is situated in a district of peculiar fertility. It contains 940 houses, and 10,100 inhabitants, who produce vast quantities of cotton goods of all kinds, and whose printed calicoes, both for design and colouring, far excel those of any other part of France. It produces also some valuable chemical preparations. It formed part of the Swiss confederacy till it was united to France in 1798. It is the birthplace of the celebrated mathematician Lambert.
