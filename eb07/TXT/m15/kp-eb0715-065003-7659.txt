MUTUAL, a relative term, denoting something that is reciprocal between two or more persons. Thus we say, mutual assistance, mutual aversion. There are mutual or reciprocal duties, offices, and the like, between superiors and inferiors, as the king and his subjects, the master and his servants, &c. Vaugelas makes a distinction between mutual and reciprocal ; mutual, according to him, being understood of what is between two only; and reciprocal, of what is between more than two. But this distinction is little regarded in common usage.
