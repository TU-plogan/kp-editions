MURDER, or Murtiier, the act of killing another with violence and injustice. The word comes from the Saxon morth, death, or, according to some persons, a violent death; and hence the barbarous Latin murdrum and modrum. Murderers, or Murdering Pieces, in a ship, are certain small pieces of ordnance, either of brass or iron, which have chambers put in at their breeches. They are used at the bulk-heads of the forecastle, half-deck, or steerage, in order to clear the deck upon the shipâ€™s being boarded by an enemy.
