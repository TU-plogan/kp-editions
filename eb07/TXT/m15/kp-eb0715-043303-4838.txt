MONTGOMERY, a borough and market-town, the capital of the county of that name, in North Wales, 169 miles from London. It is situated on an elevation on the right bank of the Severn. In ancient times it was fortified, and had a castle, the remains of which show it to have been an extensive pile of building, though but a small portion of it is now entire. It is an ancient corporation, and sends one member to parliament, in conjunction with five other towns, viz. Llanidloes, Welshpool, Machynllaeth, Newtown, and Llanfyllin. There is a market on Tuesday, and six annual fairs are held. The population amounted in 1801 to 972, in 1811 to 932, in 1821 to 1062, and in 1831 to 1188.
