MISSION, in Theology, denotes a power or commission to preach the gospel. Jesus Christ gave his disciples their mission in these words, “Go and teach all nations.’’ The Catholics reproach the Protestants with this, that their ministers have no mission, as not being authorized in the exercise of their ministry, either by an uninterrupted succession from the apostles, or by miracles, or by an extraordinary proof of a vocation. But many amongst us deny that any other mission is necessary for the ministry than the talents necessary to discharge it.

Mission is also used for an establishment of people zealous for the glory of God and the salvation of souls, and who go and preach the gospel in remote countries and among infidels. See Religious Missions.
