MONTREAL, a city of Lower Canada, the first in size and commercial importance, and the second in rank, in that district. The island and signiory, on the south side of which the city stands, is about thirty miles in length by from five to ten in breadth, and contains 197 square miles. It is situated on the St Lawrence, at the head of ship navigation, 180 miles above Quebec, and 200 below Lake Ontario. On the north a small stream divides it from the Isle of Jesus, which is also a signiory, and about twenty miles long; and from Isle Bizare, which is four miles in length. Montreal is situated close to the river, upon a belt ofland about two miles in breadth, and at the back of which is the Royal Mountain. The bank of the river upon which it is built has a gradual elevation of from twenty to thirty feet, sloping again at the back of the town, where there is a canal to carry off'any accumulated water. Including the suburbs, it is much more extensive and somewhat more populous than Quebec, but it wants the sublime scenery which characterizes that city. The whole of the lower town has a gloomy and uncomfortable appearance, the streets being narrow and incommodious. It consists of one principal street for shops and trade, which runs parallel to the river, with others which cross it at right angles, and also intersect another street running parallel to it, and dividing the old from the more modern town. This part of Montreal contains several spacious public buildings, with a number of fashionable dwelling-houses, built of stone; and the villas in the neighbourhood have an imposing appearance. It has a respectable esplanade called the Champ de Mars, where the troops are reviewed. To the east extends the Quebec suburb, and to the north and west the suburbs of St Antoine, St Lawrence, and St Recollet. Amongst the public buildings, the first which requires to be mentioned is the new Catholic cathedral, said to be the most splendid temple in America, not excepting that of Mexico, which, however, is nearly equal to it. The foundation-stone was laid in 1824, and it was opened for public worship in 1829. This magnificent structure is thus described by Mr M i Gregor in his work on British America. “It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Its length is 255 feet, breadth 234, and the height of the walls 112 feet. The style of architecture is taken from the rich Gothic of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It has six massive high towers; between these, along the roof, is a promenade twenty-five feet wide, elevated 112 feet above the ground. It has one superior altar, and six of less grandeur. It has five public and three private entrances; and from 10,000 to 12,000 people, which it will accommodate, may disperse in five or six minutes. The eastern window, behind the altar, is thirty-three feet broad and seventy high; the other windows are ten feet by thirty-six feet. It is surrounded by a fine terrace. The chime of bells, clocks, altars, and all the interior arrangements, correspond with the magnificence of the exterior. From 7000 to 8000 persons frequently congregate within this edifice.” There are several other Catholic churches besides the cathedral; one of these, large, but plain in appearance, was built in· the suburbs, upon the arrival of a bishop from France, after the termination of the late war, and for whom a palace was built near it. The bells of the Catholic churches are kept constantly ringing, which is a great annoyance, especially to strangers. The whole island of Montreal is comprised in one signiory, and is claimed by the seminary of St Sulpice, which consists of twenty members and four assistants. They discharge the whole parochial duties for the Roman Catholic population of the town and suburbs; and they, maintain, in whole or in part, a college, at which 204 young men are educated in the classics and sciences. They also educate, at various schools which they have established, more than 1300 scholars, besides making extensive distributions in charity. In addition to these various duties, the whole management of the farms, and other temporal concerns, is carried on by the members. The revenues of the seminary may be taken at an average of L.8277 currency a year, equal to L.6700 sterling. In exacting the lods et ventes due to them on the transference of land, they are very liberal, and usually compound for these fines. The improvement of Montreal has been much retarded by sig-norial and feudal exactions. The feelings of the Protestants have been much mortified in being compelled to submit to demands for the support of institutions contrary to their principles; whilst no attention was paid by the British government to the establishment of scholastic institutions for the benefit of the Protestant community. The adjustment, therefore, of the claims of the seminary of St Sulpice is the most important subject in which the inhabitants are interested. The principal English church is a handsome and spacious edifice. The Scotch kirk is a plain unadorned building, but the Methodists have a very fine chapel. The court-house, prison, and governmenthouse, are substantial buildings, but without any pretensions to architectural beauty. There are three nunneries in the city, belonging to which are some beautiful islets, as well as lands on the largest of these islands. There is an English university, where the various branches of a polite and learned education are taught. There is a natural history society, which has been of great use in illustrating the natural history and unfolding the vast resources of America. There are also a mechanics’ institution, a general hospital, and a well-conducted news-room; and twelve newspapers, as well as some other periodicals, are published in Montreal. It enjoys considerable trade, and possesses several manufactures. There is a cast-iron foundery; and machinery for steam engines, stoves, and the like, is made in the town. There are likewise distilleries, breweries, and other manufactures of necessary articles; and also several ship-building establishments. A bank was established in 1817, and there is now a branch of it at Quebec. There is likewise a committee of trade, which regulates various commercial matters and charges. There are no wharfs at Montreal, and the ships and steamers lie quietly in pretty deep water, close to the clayey and generally filthy bank in front of the city. From its position, Montreal will always [7:15:438] constitute one of the greatest commercial emporiums of America; and it must increase in magnitude and importance, along with the rapid improvement and increasing population of the upper and surrounding countries. The trade is not suspended in winter, as at Quebec. During that season, thousands of sledges come in from all directions laden with agricultural produce, frozen carcasses of beef and pork, firewood, and other articles. In return these traffickers receive manufactured goods of all kinds, the warehouses and markets being always well supplied. In summer vast rafts of timber pass Montreal for Quebec; and boats of a rude construction bring down the productions of the upper country. This was the headquarters of the fur trade before the North-west and Hudson Companies joined their interests; and there is still a warehouse there. More than three fourths of the population are French; the rest are Britons and Americans. The population in 1825 amounted to 22,357, and in 1831 to 27,297; at present (1837) it is nearly 37,000. The city of Montreal is represented in the provincial legislature by four members; the county by two. The imports and exports, as well as other statistical information, are included in those of Quebec, and will be found under that article. Montreal is situated in long. 73. 25. W. and lat. 45. 30. N.
