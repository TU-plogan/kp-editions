The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Meath, with a church and parsonage upon a glebe of two acres, built in 1812. In the year 1227 the priory of St Mary, formerly known by the name of The House of God of Mullingar, was founded by Ralph de Petyt, bishop of Meath, for regular canons of the order of St Augustin. A Dominican friary was also founded here in 1237, by the family of Nugent; and some ruins of it still remain. In 1622 the friars of Multifarnham began to erect a house for friars of the order of St Francis, but it was never completed. The population of the parish in 1831 was 8869.
