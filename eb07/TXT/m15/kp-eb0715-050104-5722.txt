MORITZ, St, a small town of the canton of the Grisons, in Switzerland, in the Upper Engadin, where there are celebrated mineral springs of similar efficacy to those of Spa, Pyrmont, and Schwa√≠bach, though less visited by invalids, from the insufficiency of the means of accommodation. It is situated 6060 feet above the level of the sea, in a wild and romantic district on the side of a lake at the foot of the granite mountain of Rozatsch; and the promenades offer prospects of the most exciting nature, amongst which are the cascade of the river, the lake of Silvaplana, and the extensive woods of Arvenwald. The visitors are chiefly from Italy, but some are from Germany, and from the other parts of Switzerland, and repair to the springs from June till the end of August; but in those months, from the great elevation, and from the glaciers around, warm clothing is found necessary. The permanent inhabitants do not exceed 500 persons.
