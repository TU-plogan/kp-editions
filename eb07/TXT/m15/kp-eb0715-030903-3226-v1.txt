MOAB, in Ancient Geography, a country of Arabia Petraea, so called from Moab the son of Lot, to whose posterity this country had been allotted by divine appointment (Deut. xi. 9). It was originally occupied by the Emim, [7:15:310] a race of giants extirpated by the Moabites. Moab anciently lay to the south of Ammon, before Sihon the Amo· rite stripped both nations of a part of their territory, which was afterwards occupied by the Israelites (Numb, xxi.); and then Moab was bounded by the river Arnon to the north, the Lacus Asphaltites to the west, the brook Zared to the south, and the mountains Abarim to the east.
