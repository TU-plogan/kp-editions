MYCALE, a city and mountain of Caria, and also a promontory of Asia, opposite Samos, celebrated for a battle which was fought there between the Greeks and Persians about the year of Rome 275. The Persians, about 100,000 strong, had just returned from the unsuccessful expedition of Xerxes in Greece; and having drawn their ships to the shore, they had fortified themselves strongly, as if determined to support a siege. They suffered[7:15:651] the Greeks to disembark from their fleet without the least molestation, and were soon obliged to give way before the cool and resolute intrepidity of an inferior number of men. The Greeks obtained a complete victory, slaughtered some thousands of the enemy, burned their camp, and sailed back to Samos with an immense booty, in which were seventy chests of money.
