MURGHAUB, a village of Persia, in the province of Irak, on the road from Shiraz to Yezdikhast. Near it is a remarkable pillar called Tuckt Soliman, apparently of as great antiquity as the city of Persepolis. Fraser mentions, that the fort of Murghaub, a place of little strength, and surrounded by hills, is the chief village of this district. There is also a considerable river of the same name on the frontier of Khorassan, forming the boundary between it and Independent Tartary. It rises in the mountains of Goor, and is generally thought to join the Oxus.
