MORTARA, a province of the duchy of Piedmont, in the continental dominions of Sardinia. It extends over 378 square miles, and comprehends one city, eighty-four towns and villages, and 56,840 inhabitants. It was formerly a part of Milan, and then was denominated Lumel-lina. It is a level district, watered by the Po, the Ticino, and the Sesia, with their tributary streams, which irrigate the land abundantly, and cause it to yield much rice, which, with silk, forms the chief product. The capital is a city of the same name, and is surrounded with walls. It is situated in a most insalubrious district, much affected by miasmata, and contains only 2850 inhabitants. Long. 9. 11. E. Lat. L5. 16. N.
