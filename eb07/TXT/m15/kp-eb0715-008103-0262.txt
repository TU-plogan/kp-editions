MILLENER, or Milliner, one who sells ribands and dresses, particularly head-dresses for women, and who makes up those dresses. Of this word different etymologies have been given-It is not derived from the French, who cannot express the notion of milliner otherwise than by the circumlocution marchande or marchande des modes. Neither is it derived from the low Dutch, the great but neglected magazine of the Anglo-Saxon. For Sewel, in his English and Dutch Dictionary, published in 1708, describes millener as a “pedlar who sells ribands and other trimmings or ornaments, a French pedlar.” Littleton, in his English and Latin Dictionary, published 1677, defines millener, “a jack of all trades,” millenarius, or mille mercium venditor ; that is, “one who sells a thousand different sorts of things.” From this etymology, which seems fanciful, we must hold, that it then implied what is now termed “a haberdasher of small wares.” Before Littleton’s time, however, a somewhat nicer characteristic than seems compatible with this notion, appears to have belonged to them; for Shakspeare, in his I4enry IV. makes Hotspur, when complaining of the daintiness of a courtier, say, “he was perfumed like a milliner.” The fact seems to be, that there were milleners of several kinds; as, horse milleners, who make ornaments of coloured worsted for horses; haberdashers of small wares, the milleners of Littleton; and milleners such as those now peculiarly known by that name, whether male or female, to whom Shakspeare’s allusion seems most appropriate. Lastly, Dr Johnson, in his dictionary, derives the word from milaner, an inhabitant of Milan, whence first came people of this profession, as a Lombard is a banker.
