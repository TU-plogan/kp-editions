MOEN, or Moenhoe, an island in the Baltic Sea, part of the kingdom of Denmark. It is separated by a narrow strait on the north from Zealand, and by one still narrower on the west from Falster. It extends over ninety-five square miles, or about 61,000 acres, and contains one town and three villages, with 2500 inhabitants. The soil is generally good, producing excellent corn, especially barley and fruit, culinary vegetables, and flax in abundance. The annual surplus of corn is commonly 10,000 quarters. Agriculture and the fisheries are the chief employments of the inhabitants. The capital, Stege, is situated on a small bay, in longitude 11.3.4. E. and latitude 55.
