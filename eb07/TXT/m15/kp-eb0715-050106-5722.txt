MORLAIX, an arrondissement of the department of Finisterre, in France, extending over 605 square miles. It is divided into ten cantons and fifty-eight communes, [7:15:502]and contains 120,000 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, situated at the junction of the Jaclot and Offen, which form a haven, with a well-defended entrance. A considerable trade is carried on from this place with Spain and Portugal, to which are exported the linens well known by the names of Creas and Eretagnias ; but of late years this trade has diminished. The city contains 1500 houses, and 10,000 inhabitants. It was the birthplace of the celebrated General Moreau. Long. 3.53. 35. W. Lat. 48. 33. N.
