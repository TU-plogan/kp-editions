MINGRELIA, a large country of Asia, extending about 140 miles in length along the Black Sea, which bounds it on the west, and stretching into the interior about forty or fifty miles. It is situated on the southern side of the Caucasus, between the Caspian and the Black Sea, and is bounded on the north by Georgia, on the east by Immeritia, and on the south by the river Phasis. The country, though it possesses great natural capabilities, has greatly declined, and is now sunk in poverty and barbarism. The soil, near the Black Sea more particularly, is soft and moist, and neither wheat nor barley can be raised to any extent. It is chiefly on a small grain resembling coriander seed that the people subsist. Vines are plentiful, as is also honey; and the climate is favourable for silk. There are, however, no manufactures of any great value in the country; they consist chiefly of coarse taffeties, and an indifferent sort of handkerchiefs. A great trade is carried on in slaves, of which the number exported is about 12,000. The inhabitants are all of turbulent and predatory habits; fishing, war, and plunder, are the principal occupations of the chiefs. The females are remarkably handsome in their persons. This extensive tract of country, which long fluctuated in its obedience between the Russians and the Turks, is now under the dominion of the former. The Phasis, and its tributaries the Teghuri and Arascha, are the principal rivers. It has few towns worthy of the name. The largest is called Zalikara; Rugh and Egers are well fortified; and Rhoezia has an extensive trade. The country is well watered, and covered with extensive forests of the finest trees. The province, according to Reineggs, contains four millions of inhabitants.
