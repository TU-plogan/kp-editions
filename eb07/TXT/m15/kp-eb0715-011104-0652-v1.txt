MINDEN, one of the governments into which the Prussian province of Westphalia is divided. It has been formed out of the ancient principalities of Minden, Paderborn, and Corvey, and the smaller sovereignties of Reckenberg, Rheda, and Rittberg. It is divided into thirteen circles, extends over 2068 square miles, comprehends thirty-six cities or walled towns, seven market-towns, and 549 villages, besides many detached agricultural establishments. The houses are 47,140, and the inhabitants 362,649, of whom about four sevenths are Protestants, and the remainder chiefly Catholics, with some Jews and a few Menonites. The city of Minden is the capital of the government and of the circle. It is built on the river Weser, over which is a bridge 600 feet long. It is an important pass, and is strongly fortified, the works having of late years been much extended. It contains five Lutheran, two Catholic, and one Calvinist church, 1146 houses, and 8940 inhabitants. It contains some manufactures of woollen, linen, and iron goods, and some trade by the Weser, which connects it with Bremen. It is known as the field of battle in 1759, where the French suffered a partial defeat. Long. 8. 50. 6. E. Lat. 52. 17. 47. N.
