MOSUL, a large city of Asiatic Turkey, which, although lying almost in the very heart of the pachalik of Bagdad, forms of itself, with a small territory, not extending more than two miles on each side of the town, an independent government, under the order of a pasha of two tails. It is situated on the western bank of the Tigris, on ground so low that the river, which is nearly 100 yards wide, and flows with great rapidity, often rises to the level of the houses. The houses are built partly of brick and partly of stone; and the roofs and even the ceilings of the apartments are vaulted, owing to the scarcity and dearness of timber. It is surrounded by a wall, which has seven gates, and which is broken down in many places. The castle, which is in a decayed condition, occupies a small artificial island in the Tigris. The coffee-houses, baths, khans, and bazaars, are handsome buildings; and the latter are well supplied with provisions from Kurdistan. The black palace being now in ruins, the pasha resides in a cluster of insignificant buildings, in the dirtiest quarter of the town. The principal ornaments of Mosul are a college, the tomb of Sheikh Abdul Cassim, and the remains of a beautiful mosque, the minaret of which, seen from a distance, has a fine effect. Like all the other towns of the Turkish empire, it is in a declining state, and the greater part of the best buildings are crumbling into ruins. On the west the country is in an uncultivated state, which, along with the extensive burying ground under the walls, gives the city a gloomy aspect. A trifling commerce is carried on with Bagdad and Asia Minor, to which gall-nuts are exported, and copper from Armenia, which is floated down the Tigris on rafts; and in return Indian commodities are received, which are forwarded to Diarbekr, Orfa, Tocat, and other places. The population amounts to 35,000, consisting of Turks, Kurds, Jews, Armenians, Nestorians, and Arabs. Lat. 36. 21. N.
