MONGHIR, a large district of Hindustan, in the province of Bahar, situated between the twenty-sixth and twenty-eighth degrees of north latitude. The town and fortress of Monghir is situated on the southern bank of the Ganges. It was the residence of Sultan Sujah during his government of the Bengal province, and was strengthened by him during his rebellion against his father, Shah Jehan. The fortifications have been for many years quite neglected, and the only part which remains is a small citadel, containing an arsenal and store-rooms. It is still surrounded by a wall and deep ditch, and is a place of considerable antiquity. It was an object of contention between the kings of Bahar and Bengal in the early part of the sixteenth century. In 1762 it was the residence of Cossim Aly Khan, and was taken by the British the following year. The travelling distance from Calcutta is 300 miles. Long. 86. 38. E. Lat. 25. 23. N.
