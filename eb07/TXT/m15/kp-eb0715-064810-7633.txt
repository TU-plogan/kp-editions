MUTINY, in a military sense, is open disobedience of, and resistance to, authority. Any officer or soldier who presumes to use traitorous or disrespectful words against the sacred person of his majesty, or the royal family, is guilty of mutiny. Any officer or soldier who behaves himself with contempt or disrespect towards the general or other commander-in-chief of our forces, or speaks words tending to their hurt or dishonour, is guilty of mutiny. Any officer or soldier who begins, excites, causes, or joins in, any mutiny or sedition, in the troop, company, or regiment to which he belongs, or in any other troop or company in our service, or in any party, post, detachment, or guard, on any pretence whatsoever, is guilty of mutiny. Any officer or soldier who, being present at any mutiny or sedition, does not use his utmost endeavours to suppress the same, or, coming to the knowledge of any mutiny, or intended mutiny, does not, without delay, give information to his commanding officer, is guilty of mutiny. And any officer or soldier who strikes his superior officer, or draws, or offers to draw, or lifts up any weapon, or offers any violence against him, being in the execution of his office, on any pretence whatsoever, or disobeys any lawful command of his superior officer, is guilty of mutiny.
