MUTE, in a general sense, signifies a person who cannot speak, or has not the use of speech.

Mute, in Grammar, a letter which yields no sound without the addition of a vowel. The simple consonants are distinguished into mutes and liquids, or semi-vowels. The mutes in the Greek alphabet are nine, three of which, π, κ, τ, are termed tenues ; three, β, γ, δ, mediae ; and three, φ, χ, Ô, aspirate. The mutes of the Latin alphabet are also nine, viz. B, C, D, G, I, K, P, Q, T.
