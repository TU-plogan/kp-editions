MORGARTEN, a small village on a hill in Switzerland, on the frontier of the two cantons of Zug and Schwitz. It is of small extent and population, and only remarkable from its historical recollections. It was the field of the first battle fought by the Swiss for their independence in 1315, when they defeated the Austrians under Duke Leopold. It is situated on a small lake, which must formerly have been higher than it is at present, as the local circumstances of that battle do not exactly suit the present situation. It was also the battle-field in 1798, where the peasantry of Switzerland defeated the French invaders; and, finally, it was the spot where a division of the French army was defeated by the Austrians in 1799.
