MOBILE, a city, port of entry, and capital of Mobile county, in Alabama, one of the United States of North America. It is situated on the west side of Mobile River, at its entrance into the bay, thirty miles north of Mobile Point, which is upon the east side of the mouth of the bay, fifty-miles west by north from Pensacola, and 160 miles east from New Orleans. Although its site is dry and pleasant, in rear of it there are swampy lands and stagnant waters, and near it is a sterile country of pine woods. It possesses a considerable trade in cotton, and in this respect ranks next to New Orleans and Charleston. The value of the exports of domestic produce from Alabama in 1829 amounted to 1,679,385 dollars, and nearly the whole of this must have been shipped at Mobile. The exports have since considerably increased. This city has a regular steam-boat communication with New Orleans through Lake Ponchartrain. During most of the year steam-boats are constantly plying between this place and the towns on the river, and many vessels are continually loading at the wharfs for distant ports. In January 1836, the Mobile and Tennessee Railway Company was incorporated. This work is to extend from the city or bay of Mobile to some point on the Tennessee River, and thence north to the Tennessee line. Mobile has a bank, and issues two daily papers. The population is estimated at between 4000 and 5000. Long. 88. 21. W. Lat. 30. 40. N.

Mobile, Moveable, any thing susceptible of motion, or that is capable of being moved either by itself or by some other prior mover.

Primum Mobile, in the ancient astronomy, was a ninth heaven or sphere, imagined to exist above those of the planets and fixed stars. This was supposed to be the first mover, and to carry round all the lower spheres along with it; communicating to them a motion by which they revolved in twenty-four hours. But the diurnal revolution of the planets is now accounted for without the assistance of any such primum mobile. Perpetuum MOBILE. See Perpetual Motion.
