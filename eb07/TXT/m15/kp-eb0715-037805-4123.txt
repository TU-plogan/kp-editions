MOLUCCA ISLES. These islands were formerly understood to signify all the islands situated to the east of the Molucca passage, in longitude 126Â° east, particularly those of Gilolo; but in general the term has been restricted to the Spice Islands, namely, Amboyna, Banda, Ceram, Ternate, Tidore, and Batchian. These islands, which are famous for the production of spices, particularly nutmegs and cloves, were first, in 1510, visited by the Portuguese, who took possession of them, and whose right was contested by the Spaniards. They succeeded, however, in acquiring possession of them, but were conquered by the Dutch in 1607. These islands were taken from the Dutch by the British during the French revolutionary war, but restored at the peace.
