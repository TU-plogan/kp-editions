MISENUM, or Misenus, in Ancient Geography, a promontory, port, and town in Campania, situated to the southwest of Baiae, in the Sinus Puteolanus. Here Augustus had a fleet, called Classis Misenensis, for guarding the Mare Inferum ; as he had another at Ravenna for protecting the Mare Superum.

Upon this peninsula a villa was built by Caius Marins, with a degree of elegance which gave great offence to the most austere amongst the Romans, who thought it but ill suited to the character of so rough a soldier. Upon the same foundation Lucullus, the plunderer of the eastern world, erected an edifice, in comparison of which the former house was only a cottage; but even his magnificence was eclipsed by the splendour of the palace which the emperors raised upon the same spot. To these proud abodes of heroes and of monarchs, which have long been levelled to the ground, a few fishing huts and a lonely public house have succeeded; and men resort thither to tipple perhaps on the identical site where the voluptuous masters of the world quaffed Chian and Falernian wines.
