MOOLTAN, or Moultan, a province of Hindustan, which formerly comprehended the country on both sides of the Indus, between the 24th and 30th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by Lahore and Afghanistan, on the south by Ajmeer and Sinde, on the east by Lahore and Ajmeer, and on the west by Beloochistan. The following are the territorial subdivisions of this province, namely, first, Mooltan Proper; second, Bahawulpoor; third, Backar; fourth, Sinde; fifth, Tatta; sixth, Chalchkaun. The greatest length of this territory is 110 miles, by about 70, its greatest breadth; and it is comprehended between the Sutleje, or the Gurrah, as it is here named, the Ravey, and the Chinaub. The northern and eastern districts of this province are watered by the rivers of the Punjab, and the tract which is within the reach of the inundation is extremely fertile, but becomes gradually more sandy and barren as it approaches the desert situated between Sewee and Backar, over which, during the summer months, the hot winds usually blow. To the west of the Indus the country is still more arid and barren, and terminates in a long ridge of black rocks. Fine camels are produced in many parts of this province; and a breed of excellent horses, said to be descended from those of Nadir Shah, stolen by the natives from him whilst on his return to Persia. It is related, in the Mahommedan annals, that this province was invaded about the year 712, by a body of Arabs under the command of Mohammed Cossim, who converted many of the natives to the Mahonιmedan religion. It was invaded early in the eleventh century by the celebrated Mahmoud of Ghizni, and was afterwards subject to the monarchs of Delhi. After the overthrow of this empire by Timour, in the end of the fourteenth century, it remained an independent kingdom till the middle of the sixteenth century, and soon afterwards became subject to the Mogul dynasty, on the decline of which it fell into the hands of independent chiefs. It was in the hands of the Mahrattas a short time before the battle of Paniput, after which it was lost by them, and never subsequently recovered. At a later period it was occupied by the Sikhs. The greater part of it was long held by the nabob of Mooltan, who was obliged to pay tribute to the Afghans, Sikhs, and rulersof Sinde, by whom he is surrounded. In 1818 it was taken possession of by Runjeet Singh, under whose rule it still remains. Little is known of the internal government, but it is known to be oppressive and tyrannical, being subject, besides the extortions of the government, to those of a licentious soldiery. The population consists of Afghans, Jats, and other Hindu tribes; but the cities are occupied by people from all parts of the East. Its principal towns are Behawulpore, Adjodin, Cutch, Mooltan, and Debalpore.

Mooltan, the capital of the above province, situated four miles from the left bank of the Chinaub or Acesines, below the points where it receives the waters of the Ravey (Hydraotes) and the Jhylum (Hydrastes), and about thirty miles above its confluence with the Indus. It is enclosed by a fine wall from forty to fifty feet in height, with towers at regular distances; and has a citadel on a rising ground, with several fine tombs, two of which have very high cupolas, and are ornamented with painted and glazed tiles, which give them a magnificent appearance. There are other places of interment scattered round the town; and Elphinstone, who visited this place in his journey to Peshawer, in Afghanistan, mentions that the country immediately around the city is fertile, well cultivated, well watered from wells, and productive of wheat, millet, cotton, turnips, carrots, and indigo. Mooltan is noted for the manufacture of silks, and for a species of carpet, which, however, is much inferior to those of Persian manufacture. This is supposed to have been the city known anciently by the name of Malli; and in 1582 it is described by Abul Fazel as one of the most ancient cities of Hindustan. It was plundered by Mahmoud of Ghizni about the year 1006, and was again plundered by Timour in 1398. For many years the nabob paid a tribute annually, for protection, to the sovereign of Cabul. In 1806 it was captured and plundered by Runjeet Singh. In 1809 the nabob was obliged to pay tribute to the Ameers of Sinde; and in 1818 it was again captured by Runjeet Singh, who still retains possession of it. Long. 71. 7. E. Lat. 30. 9. N.
