MORRHINA or Murrhina Vasa, were a sort of cupsor vases made use of by the ancients. Authors are not agreed as to the substance of which they were made. Some say they were of stone; others assert that they were made of a fluid condensed by being buried under ground. All that we know concerning the matter is, that this kind of cup was known by the name of murrha, and that Heliogabalusâ€™s chamber-pot was made of it. The word is sometimes written myrrhina.
