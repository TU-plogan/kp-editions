MOUFET, Thomas, a celebrated English physician, was born at London, and practised medicine with great reputation. Towards the close of his life he retired to the country, and died about the year 1600. This physician is known by a work which was begun by Edward Wotton, and printed at London in 1634, folio, under the title of Theatrum Insectorum. A translation of it into English was published at London in 1658, folio. Martin Lister gives a very unfavourable opinion of this book. “As Moufet,” says he, “made use of Wotton, Gesner, and others, an excellent work might have been expected from him; and yet his Theatrum is full of confusion, and he has made a very bad use of the materials with which these authors have furnished him. He is ignorant of the subject of which he treats, and his manner of expression is altogether barbarous. Besides this, he is extremely arrogant, to say no worse; for though he has copied Aldrovandus in innumerable places, he never once mentions his name.” But Lay thinks that Lister, by expressing himself in this manner, has not done justice to Moufet; and he maintains that the latter has rendered an essential service to the republic of letters.
