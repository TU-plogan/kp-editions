MONTEGULIANO, a parliamentary city of the island of Sicily, in the kingdom of Naples, and province of Mazzara. It was the Lryx of the ancients, where formerly stood the temple dedicated to Venus, the most sensual of all the heathen establishments, of which no trace now remains. The city contains 8172 inhabitants, who produce some excellent wine.
