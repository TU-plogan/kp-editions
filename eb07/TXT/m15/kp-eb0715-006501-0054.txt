MILAZZO, a parliamentary city of the island of Sicily, in the kingdom of Naples, on the sea-shore, near the termination of Cape Blanco. It is fortified, and though the situation is rather unhealthy, it contains a population of 8000 persons, who are chiefly occupied in the tunny fishery, and in the export of wine and oil.
