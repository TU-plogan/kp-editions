MYSIA, a country of Asia Minor, generally divided into Major and Minor. Mysia Minor was bounded on the north and west by the Propontis and Bithynia, and on the southern and eastern borders by Phrygia. Mysia Major had Aeolia on the south, the Aegean Sea on the west, and Phrygia on the north and east. Its chief cities were Cyzicum and Lampsacus. The inhabitants were once very warlike; but they greatly degenerated, and the words My sorum ultimus were emphatically used to signify a person of no merit. The ancients generally hired them to attend their funerals as mourners, because they were naturally melancholy and inclined to shed tears. They were once governed by monarchs. They are supposed to be descended from the Mysians of Europe, a nation who inhabited that part of Thrace which was situated between Mount Haemus and the Danube.
