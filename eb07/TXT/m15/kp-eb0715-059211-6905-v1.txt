MUNITION, the provisions with which a place is furnished for defence, or that which follows a camp for its subsistence.

Munition Ships are those which have stores on board in order to supply a fleet of men-of-war at sea. In an engagement, all the munition ships and victuallers attending the fleet take their station in the rear of the others; they do not engage in the fight, but attend to such directions only as are sent to them by the admiral.
