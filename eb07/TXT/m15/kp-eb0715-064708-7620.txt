MUSSELBURGH, a royal burgh, barony of regality, and sea-port town, of Scotland, in the county of Edinburgh, distant six miles south-east from Edinburgh. It is the capital of the parish of Inveresk, and is situated at the mouth of the river Esk, which divides it into two portions; that part on the right side being properly called Musselburgh, whilst the other is called Fisherrow. Musselburgh consists of one long street, called the High Street; the centre part of which is very spacious, and has, like most of the old burghs, a building placed there, containing the town-house, jail, and other offices connected with the conducting of the business of the burgh. This is an old erection, but it has of late been partly renewed, and much improved in appearance. The houses in the High Street, as well as in the bye-streets and lanes,are well built; and perhaps in no town in Scotland of the same size are there so many comfortable self-contained houses. The connection with Fisherrow is maintained by two stone and two wooden bridges. The uppermost bridge consists of three arches. It is of great antiquity, and was built by the Romans, most probably at the time when they had their station at Inveresk Mount. It was formerly a pass of some moment; and, in addition to being narrow and high, it was defended by a gate placed in the centre. This interesting old bridge is now only used by foot passengers. Further down the river, on the line of the main road, a handsome and commodious bridge has been erected, after a design by Rennie. Fisherrow, formerly the site of a Roman town, consists of one long main street, a back street next the sea, and a variety of small streets that branch from them. A handsome row of houses has lately been built on the road from the main street to the new bridge over the Esk. There is also on the bank of the river a neat row of houses, with a promenade in front tastefully planted. The harbour is small, but has been lately improved by the construction of a good stone pier. It is principally used for the importation of timber, the shipping of coals, and the accommodation of fishing-boats. Small vessels are occasionally built at the port. Close to Musselburgh are the small villages of Newbigging and Inveresk, which, from their continuity, may be said to form part of that town. Inveresk is noted as being a station of the Romans. In the years 1565 and 1783, remains of the ancient buildings were discovered, which clearly pointed out the spot where the praetorium had been reared. At the west end of the village, and on a prominent part of the Mount, stands the parish church, built upwards of thirty years ago, to replace one of very old date, supposed to have been erected out of the ruins of the Roman fort.

There is an extensive piece of ground belonging to Musselburgh, stretching between Pinkie and the sea, called the Links, which is much frequented for playing the game of golf. It is also used as a race-ground for the Edinburgh races. To aid this object, an excellent stand has been erected at the western extremity of the course. The chief business of the town is the tanning of leather and preparing of skins. There are various small manufactories for yarns, haircloth, shawls, and hats; also for working fishing-nets on the loom, and making bricks, tiles, and coarse earthen-ware. Besides these, there are several breweries, and a number of [7:15:648]flour-mills. Market-gardening is carried on as a trade, with the view of supplying Edinburgh. Musselburgh has long possessed an excellent grammar-school, and two English schools, one of them in Fisherrow, all under the patronage of the magistrates. A variety of boarding-schools for young ladies, and some private schools for the elementary branches, have for many years been established. The inhabitants support three public libraries, all of which contain an excellent selection of books. In addition to the established church at Inveresk, a new established church has been commenced this year (1837), in Bridge Street, to be called the North Esk Church. Besides these, there are meetinghouses of the Relief, Independent, United Associate, and Baptist bodies; as also an Episcopal chapel.

At the east end of Musselburgh formerly stood the celebrated chapel of Loretto, of which only one cell now remains, covered by an artificial mount, in a garden still called by the ancient name. It must have been a place of considerable size, as the jail of the town was built from its ruins. This town is of very ancient foundation. King Malcolm Canmore granted Little Inveresk to the abbey of Dunfermline, which was afterwards confirmed by King David I. who added Great Inveresk to the gift. This latter gift included the burgh and port of Musselburgh. It was by that wealthy body erected into a burgh of regality. At the Reformation the whole of the property belonging to the abbey was erected into a lordship, and granted to Lord Thirlstane, whose heir, Lord Lauderdale, confirmed the charter already granted by the abbey. This charter was again confirmed by Charles II. in 1671, and under this last confirmation the property of the burgh is now held. From the same charter it also derives its title as a royal burgh. The burgh formerly possessed extensive property,but thegreater part of it was sold or feued many years ago. What now remains was valued in the year 1833 at L.35,000. The debts in the same year were estimated at L.I2,123. The yearly income is about L.2000, and the expenditure is under that sum. The revenues drawn from Fisherrow port average between L.250 and L.300. The burgh is governed by a provost, three bailies, a treasurer, and seven councillors, some of them being returned by Fisherrow. The population in 1831 was 8961, of whom 4257 were males, and 4704 females. Musselburgh, Fisherrow, Portobello, Leith, and Newhaven, return a member to parliament.
