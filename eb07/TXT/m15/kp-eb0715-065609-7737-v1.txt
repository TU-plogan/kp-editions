MYSOL Isle. This island is situated in the Eastern Seas, about the second degree of south latitude, midway between the large islands of Ceram and Papua. It is fifty miles in length by fifteen in breadth, and is inhabited on the sea coast chiefly by Mahommedans, and in the interior by the natives. On the east coast is a harbour, formed by a small island, on which fresh water may be procured in abundance without risk, as the harbour is landlocked. The island is frequented by birds of paradise in great flocks at certain seasons of the year, when they are caught with bird-lime, and afterwards dried with the feathers on as they are seen in Europe. The black loory, a very scarce bird, may also be purchased here. The trade is inconsiderable, consisting chiefly of biche de mer, ambergris, pearls, and stones; the imports are coarse piece goods, cutlery, beads, iron in bars, china ware, looking-glasses, and bràss-wire.
