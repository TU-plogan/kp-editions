MILETUS, in Ancient Geography, a town of Crete, mentioned by Homer, but the situation of which has not been ascertained. It is said to have been the mother town of Miletus in Caria, whither a colony was led by Sarpedon, brother of Minos.

Miletus, in Ancient Geography, a celebrated town of Asia Minor, situated on the confines of Ionia and Caria. It was the capital city of Ionia, famous both for the arts of war and peace, and situated about ten stadia south of the mouth of the river Maeander, near to the sea coast. It was founded by a Cretan colony under Miletus the companion of Bacchus, or by Neleus the son of Codrus, or by Sarpedon a son of Jupiter. It has been successively called Lelegeis, Pithyusa, and Anactoria. The inhabitants, called Milesii, were very powerful, and long maintained an obstinate war against the kings of Lydia. They early applied themselves to navigation, and planted no less than eighty colonies, or, according to Seneca, three hundred and eighty, in different parts of the world. This was the only town which made head against Alexander, and which was with much difficulty taken. It gave birth to Thales, one of the seven wise men, and the first who applied himself to the study of physical science. It was also the country of Anaximander, the scholar and successor of Thales, the inventor of the gnomon, and the first who published a geographical map; of Anaximenes, the scholar and successor of Anaximander; and also of other illustrious men. It was noted for its excellent wool, and was also celebrated for a temple and oracle of Apollo Didymaeus. It is called by the Turks Melas, and not far distant from it flows the river Maeander. St Paul proceeding from Corinth to Jerusalem passed by Miletus, and as he went by sea, and could not take Ephesus in his way, he caused the bishops and priests of the church of Ephesus to come to Miletus, which was about twelve leagues distant.
