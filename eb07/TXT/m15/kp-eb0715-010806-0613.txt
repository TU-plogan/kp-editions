MINAGNGHINIM, an instrument of music amongst the Hebrews. It was a square table of wood, fitted with a handle; and over this table was stretched an iron chain, or hempen cord, passing through balls of wood or brass, which struck against the table when the instrument was shaken, and occasioned a clear sound, that might be heard at a great distance.
