MINERVA, or Pallas, in Pagan worship, the goddess of science and of wisdom, who sprung completely armed from Jupiter’s brain. She disputed with Neptune the honour of giving a name to the city of Athens, upon which it was agreed, that whosoever produced tvhat was most useful to mankind should have the advantage. In consequence of this compact, Neptune, with a stroke of his trident, formed a horse; and Minerva caused an olive to spring from the ground. The latter was judged the most useful, from its being the symbol of peace. Minerva changed Arachne into a spider, for pretending to excel her in making tapestry. She fought the giants; favoured Cadmus, Ulysses, and other heroes; refused to marry Vulcan, choosing rather to live in a state of celibacy; deprived Tiresias of sight; turned Medusa’s locks into snakes; and performed several other exploits. Minerva is usually represented by the poets, painters, and sculptors, as completely armed; with a composed but agreeable countenance, bearing a golden breastplate, a spear in the right hand, and an aegis or shield in the left, upon which is represented Medusa’s head encircled with snakes; whilst her helmet was usually entwined with olives. She had several temples both in Greece and in Italy. The usual victim offered to her was a white heifer, never yoked; and the animals sacred to her were the cock, the owl, and the basilisk.
