MOUNT EDGECUMBE, a prodigiously high peak, at the entrance of Cook’s Strait, in New Zealand, on the west side. Its height is supposed not to be much inferior to that of the Peak of Teneriffe.

Mount Sorrel, a town of the county of Leicester, in the hundred of West Goscote, 105 miles from London, on the great north-west road by Manchester to Scotland. It stands in two parishes, Barrow and Rothley, on a rugged hill overlooking the river Soar. It had a castle of great strength, which was destroyed by the country people in 1217, on account of the depredations committed by the garrison. The population amounted in 1801 to 1233, in 1811 to 1502, in 1821 to 1422, and in Í831 to 1602.

Mounts of Piety, certain funds or establishments in Italy, where money is lent out on some small security. There were also mounts of piety in England, raised by contribution, for the benefit of people ruined by the extortions of the Jews.
