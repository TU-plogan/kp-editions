MOZAMBIQUE, or Mos ambique, a portion of the east ern coast of Africa, of which the limits are not very well defined, and about which little is known. It is sometimes called a kingdom, and was doubtless once entitled to that designation; but it is now a Portuguese colony. It takes its name from the capital, which is built on an island, the principal of three islands forming a part of the territory. The roadstead is good, and the pier commodious, but the situation is by no means either healthy or convenient. This city is said to have been once very handsome, but no recent traveller ascribes to it this characteristic. Although it derives its importance from being the emporium of the gold, ivory, and slaves brought down the Tambeze, it lies about three hundred miles from the mouth of that river, and the trade is in a great measure transferred to Quilli-mane. The principal inhabitants have their houses at Me-suril, on the continent, at the extremity of the peninsula of Caboceiro. There is a fort, of strength sufficient to defend it against pirates, but not against the attack of a regular force. The government-house still retains vestiges of its former splendour when in possession of the viceroys. Like the custom-house, and almost all the other public structures, it is spacious, and built of stone, but is fast falling into decay. The trade in slaves, once most extensive, has considerably declined since the British obtained possession of Madagascar and the Cape, into which colonies they prohibit their importation. In 1818 the number exported was estimated at above eight thousand, but no recent authorities inform us how much it has decreased. The other chief branches of commerce are gold and ivory. The governor, and even his negro attendants, are richly loaded with golden ornaments; and household utensils, made of that precious metal, are used in his establishment. The dominion of the Portuguese scarcely extends beyond the peninsula of Caboceiro; and they are with difficulty able, by alliance with the chiefs of Quintangon√® and Sereime, to make head against the Makooa, a populous and warlike tribe, occupying a great extent of the coast. According to the narrative of Captain Owen, the population amounts to about 6000.
