MUTTON, the common name of the flesh of a sheep after the animal has been killed. Mutton has been commonly preferred to the flesh of all quadrupeds; and, indeed, besides being more perfect, it has the advantage of being more generally suited to different climates, whereas beef, for instance, requires a very nice intermediate state, which it seems to attain chiefly in England; for although Scotland supplies what are reckoned the best cattle, it is in the rich English pastures that they are brought to perfection. But the sheep can be brought almost to the same perfection in this northern region as in the southern countries.
