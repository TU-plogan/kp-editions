MUSSULMAN, or Moslemin, a title by which the Mahommedans distinguish themselves, and which signifies, in the Turkish language, true believer, or orthodox. In Arabic the word is written Moslem, Moslemin, 0 r Mosulman. The appellation was first given to the Saracens, as is observed by Leunclavius. There are two kinds of Mussulmans, very averse to each other; the one called Soσnites, and the other Sheeites. The Soonites follow the interpretation of the Koran given by Omar; the Sheeites are the followers of Ali. According to some authors, the word Mussulman signifies “saved,” that is, predestinated; and hence the Mahommedans give themselves the appellation, as believing they are all predestinated to salvation. Martinius is more particular as to the origin of the name, which he derives from the Arabic Musalxm, “saved,” or “snatched out of danger.” The Mahommedans, he observes, established their religion by fire and sword, massacred all those who would not embrace it, and granted life to all who did, .calling them Mussulmans, as much as to say, erepti e periculo ; and hence the word, in course of time, became the distinguishing title of all those of that sect who have affixed to it the signification of “true believers.·”
