MONOPOLI, a city of the province of Bari, in the kingdom of Naples, on the spot where formerly stood the Roman city of Egnatia. It is situated on the sea-shore, between three hills, and has a small harbour, whence extensive fisheries are carried on. It suffers much at times from a scarcity of water, as there are neither brooks nor springs, the only supply being from rain. It is the seat of a bishop, and, besides the cathedral, contains fourteen churches, nine of which appertain to as many convents and monasteries. It contains 15,500 inhabitants.
