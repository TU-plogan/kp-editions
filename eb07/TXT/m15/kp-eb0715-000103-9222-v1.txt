MEYRINGEN, a town of Switzerland, which, on account of its natural beauties, is visited by most persons who, to gratify their taste for picturesque scenery, visit that country. It is situated in the vale of Hosli, in the upper part of the canton of Berne. It stands on a mountain 1950 feet above the level of the sea, and is surrounded by the snow-covered pinnacles of the neighbouring hills. The town, though so high, is situated in a rich and well-cultivated valley, into which there are some of the most lofty and copious waterfalls from the surrounding heights. The most remarkable of these cascades is the Reichenbach, which forms seven successive falls, the first of which is the largest, being 300 feet in height; it falls into a basin, into which the sun rarely penetrates, and, when seen from below, exhibits, about noon, in fine weather, some surprising rainbows. The town itself contains only 650 inhabitants; but there are two large hotels generally well filled with strangers during the summer months. The whole valley and parish contain 4490 souls, whose chief occupation consists in making butter and cheese, their cows being nearly 4000 in number.
