MUTIUS, Caius, surnamed Codrus, and afterwards Scaevola, was one of the illustrious Roman family of the Mutii, and rendered his name famous in the war between Porsenna king of Tuscany and the Romans. That prince having resolved to restore the family of Tarquin the Proud, went to besiege Rome in the year 507 before Christ; but Mutius determined to sacrifice himself for the safety of his country, and boldly entering the enemy’s camp, killed Porsenna’s secretary, whom he took for Porsenna himself. Being seized and brought before Porsenna, he told the king boldly, that three hundred young men like himself had sworn to murder him; “but since this hand has missed thee,” continued he, “it must be punished ;” then putting his right hand on the burning coals, he let it burn with such constancy as astonished the beholders. The king, amazed at the intrepidity of the young Roman, ordered that he should have his freedom and return to Rome, and soon afterwards concluded a peace with the Romans. From this action Mutius obtained the surname of Scaevola, or lefthanded, which was enjoyed by his family.

Muτιus Scaevola, Q. surnamed the Augur, was an excellent civilian, and instructed Cicero in the laws. He was made praetor in Asia, and afterwards became consul, when he performed important services for the republic. He must not be confounded with Quintus Mutius Scaevola, another excellent civilian, who was praetor in Asia, tribune of the people, and at length consul, 95 before Christ. He governed Asia with such prudence and equity, that his example was proposed to the governors who were sent into the provinces. Cicero says of him, that he was the most eloquent orator of all the civilians, and the most able civilian of all the orators. He was assassinated in the temple of Vesta during the wars of Marius and Sylla, eighty-two years before Christ.
