MOMUS, in fabulous history, was the god of raillery, or the jester of the celestial assembly, who ridiculed both gods and men. Being chosen by Vulcan, Neptune, and Minerva, to give his judgment concerning their works, hc blamed them all; Neptune for not making his bull with horns before his eyes, in order that he might give a surer blow; Minerva for building a house which could not be removed in case of bad neighbours; and Vulcan for making a man without a window in his breast, that his treacheries might be seen. For the freedom of his reflections upon the gods, Momus was expelled from heaven. He is generally represented as raising a mask from his face, and holding a small figure in his hand.
