MONTPELLIER, an arrondissement of the department of the HÃ©rault, in France, 838 square miles in extent. It comprehends 14 cantons, which are divided into 117 communes, and contains 103,500 inhabitants. The capital, which gives its name to the arrondissement, is in a fine district, is surrounded with walls, and stands on the declivity of a hill between the river Mardanson and the Lez. The higher part of the city consists of narrow and crooked streets, with very few good buildings; but the lower part or suburb has good, well-built, regular streets. The city has some beautiful promenades around it; and from an elevated public walk near it, called the Place du Peyron, there is one of the finest prospects in Europe. The city contains a university of great celebrity, with a library of42,000 volumes, a museum, and observatory. It contains 8000 houses, with 3500 inhabitants, of whom about 6000 are Protestants, who, besides cloths of cotton and wool, produce many chemical preparations, particularly cream of tartar, vitriol, aquafortis, ether, glauber salts, sugar of lead, spirit of salt, and much perfumery. The trade is facilitated by a canal, which connects the city with the Mediterranean. Long. 3. 47. E. Lat. 43. 36. N.
