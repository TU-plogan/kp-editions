MOHILEW, a province of the European Russian empire. It is situated in N. lat. from 51. 58. tó 55. 13., and in E. long, from 28. 47. to 32. 53., and is bounded on the north by Witepsk, on the north-east by Smolensk, on the southeast and south by Tschernigow, and on the west by Minsk. It contains 45,008 square worsts, or 17,978 square miles. It is divided into twelve circles, and contains 1,084,600 inhabitants, who live in twelve cities, fifty-five towns, and so great a number of small villages and farms, that they have not been accurately ascertained. There is a subdivision into a kind of Greek parishes, each surrounding the 310 churches of that religion. Mohilew is one of the districts which was taken from Poland in the year 1772, and, with Witepsk, formed one province under the name of White Russia; but, in 1802, a division was made into two provinces, the one called that of Witepsk, and the other that of Mohilew. The people of this province, from being a mixture of Russians and Poles, have formed for themselves a peculiar dialect, compounded of the language of these two races, with an intermixture of Latin, Moldavian, and German. The greater part of the inhabitants adhere to the orthodox Greek church, but many are of the united Greek religion; and there are many Catholics, who have an archbishop, and several churches and monasteries. There are also 40,000 Jews, who have synagogues in most of the towns. The province is generally a level plain, intersected by numerous streams; and the soil, though for the most part sandy, is moderately fertile. More corn is grown than the consumption requires in almost every year, and, after a deficient harvest in Poland and Germany, large supplies are furnished to these countries. The woods are extensive, and yield large stores of timber of every description required either for fuel or for the construction of houses or ships. The chief productions, besides corn and wood, are black cattle, sheep; wool, hemp and flax, and their seed; honey, wax, bacon and bristles, with tallow and hides. These are conveyed both to the Baltic and to the Black Sea by means of the navigable rivers. Some iron is found, which is used for making scythes and other agricultural implements; but the mines do not yield a quantity sufficient for the demand.

Mohilew, a city, the capital of the Russian province of that name, and of the circle in which it stands. It is situated on the river Dnieper, 564 miles from St Petersburg. It is surrounded with walls, and has broad, well-paved streets, one square, sixteen churches, four monasteries, 2100 houses, and 16,900 inhabitants. From its situation on a great river, it is the chief place where the commercial transactions of the province centre, and whence goods are transmitted to Riga, Königsberg, Memel, and Dantzig. Long. 48. 4. 30. E. Lat. 53. 54. N.

Mohilew, a circle of the Russian province of Podolia, which extends in N. lat. from 48. 14. to 49. 5., and in E. long, from 27. 45. to 28.19. The river Dniester flows upon the southern side, and conveys the water of the smaller streams to the Black Sea. The circle produces excellent wheat and other corn, with tobacco, hemp, and flax, in abundance. The capital, a city of the same name, is situated[7:15:320] on the Dniester, 1106 miles from St Petersburg. It contains several Greek and Catholic churches, 1176 houses, and 7200 inhabitants. Long. 35. 41. E. Lat. 48. 25. N.
