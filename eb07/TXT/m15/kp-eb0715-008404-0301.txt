MILO, T. Annius, a native of Lanuvium, who attempted to obtain the consulship at Rome by means of intrigue and seditious tumults. Clodius the tribune opposed his views; yet Milo would have succeeded but for an event which has given a collateral celebrity to his name. As he was going into the country, attended by his wife and a numerous retinue of gladiators and servants, he met on the Appian road his enemy Clodius, who was returning to Rome with three of his friends and some domestics completely armed. A quarrel arose between the servants; Milo supported his attendants, and the dispute became general; Clodius received many severe wounds, and was obliged to retire to a neighbouring cottage. Milo pursued his enemy in his retreat, and ordered his servants to despatch him. The body of the murdered tribune was carried to Rome, and exposed to public view. The enemies of Milo inveighed bitterly against the violence and barbarity with which the sacred person of a tribune had been treated. Cicero undertook the defence of Milo; but the continual clamours of the friends of Clodius, and the sight of an armed soldiery, which surrounded the judgment seat, so terrified the orator, that he forgot the greater part of [7:15:85]his arguments, and the defence he made was weak and injudicious. Milo was condemned, and banished to Massilia. Cicero soon afterwards sent his exiled friend a copy of the oration which he had prepared for his defence, in the form in which it now appears; and Milo, after having read it, exclaimed, “0 Cicero, hadst thou spoken before my accusers in these terms, Milo would not now be eating figs at Marseilles.” The friendship and cordiality of Cicero and Milo were the fruits of long intimacy and familiar intercourse. It was by the successful exertions of Milo that the orator was recalled from banishment, and restored to his friends.
