MITHRAS, Feasts of, in Antiquity, were celebrated amongst the Romans in honour of Mithras or the Sun. The most ancient instance of this amongst the Romans occurs in an inscription dated in the third consulate of Trajan, or about the year of our era 101. This is the dedication of an altar to the Sun under the name of Mithras, and inscribed Deo Soli Mithrae. But the worship of Mithras was not known in Egypt and Syria in the time of Origen, who died about the year of Christ 263; although it was common at Rome for more than a century before this time. The worship of Mithras was proscribed at Rome in the year 378, by order of Gracchus, prefect of the praetorium. According to Fr√≥ret, the feasts of Mithras were derived from Chaldaea, where they had been instituted for celebrating the entrance of the Sun into the sign Taurus.
