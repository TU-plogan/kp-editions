+====================================================================+


MORELLI, James, the celebrated librarian of St Mark, at Venice, was born in that city on the 14th of April 1745. His father, a native of Lugano, exercised the employment of proto-muratore. Morelli received the rudiments of his education under a priest named Testa, but it was in a convent of Dominicans that he acquired a taste for solid studies, and laid the foundation of his future eminence. Having assumed the clerical habit, he was in due time admitted into the priesthood, the duties of which, however, did not prevent him from devoting a considerable portion of his time to literary pursuits; and at length he became an able critic, a learned antiquary, and rendered himself familiar with the history of nations as well as that of the sciences and arts. But the subject which chiefly interested him was that of bibliography, in which he was destined to attain to great eminence and distinction. In 1774, he printed his Dissertazione Storica della publica Libreria di S. Marco. In 1785, he published his Latin version of the oration of Aristides against Leptines, the Declamation of Libanius for Socrates, and fragments of the second book of the Harmonic Elements of Aristoxenes, all from Greek manuscripts. But one of his most important publications is [7:15:500]that of the Fragments of Dion Cassius on Roman History, with new readings, which appeared in 1798, and was followed by a great variety of other publications and editions. In 1802, the Emperor Francis conferred on him the title of aulic counsellor; in 1816, he received the decoration of a knight of the iron crown; and in the beginning of May 1819, he died, at the advanced age of seventy-four. A complete list of Morelli’s numerous publications, sixty-two in all, is annexed to the account of his life in the Biographie Universelle·, to which the reader is referred, as, from their peculiar nature, any selection would not serve to give an idea of their general character. They are chiefly bibliographical, intermixed with editions of various works, some of which have already been noticed. (a.)
