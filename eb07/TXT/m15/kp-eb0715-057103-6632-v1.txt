MOSQUE, a temple or placeof religiousworship amongst the Mahommedans. All mosques are square buildings, generally constructed of stone. Before the chief gate there is a square court paved with white marble, and low galleries round it, the roof of which is supported by marble pillars. In these galleries the Turks wash themselves before they go into the mosque. In each mosque there is a great number of lamps; and between these are suspended many crystal rings, ostrich eggs, and other curiosities, which, when the lamps are lighted, make a fine show. As it is not lawful to enter the mosque with stockings or shoes on, the pavements are covered with pieces of stuff sewed together, each being wide enough to hold a row of men kneeling, sitting, or prostrate. The women are not allowed to enter the mosque, but remain in the porches without. About every mosque there are six high towers, called minarets, each of which has three little open galleries, one above another; these towers, as well as the mosques, are covered with lead, and adorned with gilding and other ornaments[7:15:572]; and from them the people are summoned to prayers by certain officers appointed for the purpose, called muezzins. Most of the mosques have a kind of hospital belonging to them, in which travellers, of whatsoever religion they may be, are entertained three days. Each mosque has also a place called tarbe, which is the burying-place of its founders; within it there is a tomb six or seven feet long, covered with green velvet or satin; at the ends are two tapers, and round it several seats for those who read the Koran and offer up prayers for the souls of the deceased.
