MYLASA, or Mylassa, in√4nc⅛n< Geography, a noble city of Caria, in Asia Minor, situated about three leagues from the Sinus Ceramicus. It was the capital of Hecatomnus, king of Caria, and father of Mausolus. Pliny, speaking of Menander king of Caria, says that the Rhodians preserved with the greatest care his portrait painted by Apelles. But it was not in honour of this Menander that a Corinthian pillar was erected at Mylasa, which still exists, and on which is to be seen the following inscription: “The people erected this pillar in honour of Menander, the son of Uliades, and grandson of Euthydemus, the benefactor of his country, and whose ancestors also rendered it great services.” Caria was taken by Mithridates, and afterwards by Labienus, whose father had been one of Caesar’s generals. Hybrias, whose eloquence and valour deservedly entitled him to a distinguished rank amongst his countrymen, in vain encouraged them to make an obstinate defence whilst it was besieged by the latter. He himself was obliged to yield to necessity, and to take refuge at Rhodes; but scarcely had the conqueror quitted the city, when Hybrias returned and restored liberty to his country; and, not content with rendering it this service, he also destroyed the power of a dangerous citizen, whose riches and talents had rendered him a necessary evil. Euthydemus, often banished, and as often recalled, but always too powerful in a state the independence of which he threatened, saw his ambition checked by the zeal and activity of Hybrias. The Romans left to Mylasa that liberty of which it rendered itself so worthy by the great efforts it made to preserve it. Pliny calls it Mylasa libera ; and Strabo informs us that it was one of the most magnificent cities of antiquity, the temples, porticos, and other public monuments of which were highly admired. This city is now called Melasso. When Pococke visited this place it was perfect and entire; but at present no traces of it remain.
