MOGADORE, or Mogodore, but by the natives called Suera or Saweera, is a considerable sea-port of Morocco, [7:15:315] in the province of Shedma. This town, which was built by Sidi Mohammed in 1760, stands upon a sandy beach forming a peninsula, the foundation of which is rocky, and is separated from the cultivated country by a range of shifting sand-hills. A chain of rocks, extending from the northern to the southern gate, defends the town from the encroachments of the sea; but at spring-tides it is nearly insulated. It consists of two parts, a citadel and an outer town. The customhouse, treasury, residence of the alcaid, and the houses of the European merchants, are situated in the former. The factory of Mogadore consists of ten or twelve mercantile houses of different nations, whose owners, from the protection granted to them by the emperor, live in complete security from the Moors, and keep them at a rigid distance. With the exception of those who belong to the body of foreign merchants, the Jews are compelled to reside in the outer town, which, however, is walled in and protected by batteries, as well as the citadel. Mogadore was built according to plans „furnished by a French engineer; and, as far as parapets, ramparts, embrasures, cavaliers, batteries, and caseinates, constitute a fortress, this is one; but these are of so flimsy and imperfect construction as to be incapable of protecting the place for any length of time against a regular force. The streets are laid out in right lines, but they are unpaved and very narrow. The houses, although lofty and regular, have a sombre aspect, from there being few windows facing the street. There is a handsome market-place surrounded with piazzas, and the public buildings have a neat appearance; but the situation is ill chosen, the immediate neigbourhood being an absolute desert. The port is formed by a curve in the land, and by an island nearly two miles in circumference, situated about a quarter of a mile from the shore; but as there is only ten or twelve feet of water at ebb-tide, large vessels lie at anchor a mile and a half west of the battery, which extends along the west side of the town. The mouth of the harbour is narrow, yet a heavy sea rolls in; but behind the island the anchorage is good. The battery, like the other defensive works of Mogadore, is much more remarkable for its beauty than its strength. The roadstead is very much exposed at certain seasons; and this port, although the only one in the empire which maintains a regular and uninterrupted commercial intercourse with Europe, is in many respects inferior to that of El Waladia. Besides, the town is invested with shifting sand-hills, which, blown about by the winds of winter, prove a great annoyance. In the neighbourhood are cultivated parts, where barley and millet are chiefly raised; and there are also fruits and esculent vegetables produced, principally pomegranates, melons, figs, pomatas, and pease as good as those of England. Notwithstanding many disadvantages, the climate of Mogadore is salubrious, and not inimical to Europeans. Considerable quantities of that leather which bears the name of the empire is prepared at this place. The population, according to Jackson, is 10,000; but other authorities estimate it as high as 30,000, which is certainly an exaggeration. Long. 9. 35. 30. W. Lat. 31. 32. 40. N.
