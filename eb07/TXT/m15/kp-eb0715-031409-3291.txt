MOFFAT, a small well-built town, and a celebrated watering-place, of Scotland, in the county of Dumfries. It is situated on a beautiful eminence near the junction of the Annan and Moffat waters, and is on all sides except the south encompassed by hills of various elevation. In the neighbourhood, especially to the north and west of the town, are sheltering plantations, which impart considerable beauty to the environs, as well as an air of comfort to the place itself. It consists principally of one main street, looking from the gentle declivity on which Moffat stands towards the south; and a fine prospect of the vale beneath is thus afforded. This street is judiciously laid out, spacious, and well calculated to form an agreeable promenade for both inhabitants and strangers. The church, which is a substantial stone edifice, was built towards the close of the last century. Besides this place of worship, the town is provided with a meeting-house for the United Associate Synod. Much of the town is new; and amongst the buildings are two good inns, various minor houses of entertainment, and many private ones in which comfortable lodgings may be obtained. The medicinal springs, which give celebrity to the place, and render it a favourite resort for invalids, are three in number; one of them is sulphureous, and the other two are chalybeate. The first is useful in cutaneous diseases, and the other two in affections of the stomach, and other complaints. The population of the town and parish was, in 1821, 2218, and in 1831, 2221.
