MOHAIR, in commerce, the hair of a particular kind of goat frequent about Angora, in Turkey, the inhabitants of which are all employed in the manufacture of carablets made of this material.

Some give the name of mohair to the camblets or stuffs made of this hair, and of which there are two kinds; the one smooth and plain, and the other watered like tabbies. The difference between the two consists only in this, that the latter kind is calendered, and the other not. There are also mohairs both plain and watered, the woof of which consists of wool, cotton, or thread.
