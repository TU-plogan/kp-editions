MUSIMON, in Natural History, the name of an animal, esteemed a species of sheep, and described by the ancients as common in Corsica, Sardinia, Barbary, and the northeastern parts of Asia. It has been doubted whether the animal described under this name is now anywhere to be found in the world, and whether it was not probably a spurious breed between two animals of different species, perhaps the sheep and goat, which, like the mule, was not able to propagate its species, and hence the production of them may have been discontinued. Buffon supposes it to be the sheep in a wild state; and it is described as such by Mr Pennant. These animals live in the mountains, and run with great swiftness amongst the rocks. Those of Kamtschatka are so strong that ten men can scarcely hold one, and the horns are so large as sometimes to weigh thirty pounds, and so capacious that young foxes often shelter themselves in the hollow of such as by accident fall off in the deserts.
