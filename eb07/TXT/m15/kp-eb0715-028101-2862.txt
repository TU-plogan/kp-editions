MINNIN, a stringed instrument of music amongst the ancient Hebrews, having three or four chords to it. There is reason to question the antiquity of this instrument, both because it requires a hair bow, which was a kind of plectrum not known to the ancients, and because it so much resembles the modern viol. Kircher took the figures of this instrument, the machu], chinnor, and psaltery, from an old book in the Vatican library.
