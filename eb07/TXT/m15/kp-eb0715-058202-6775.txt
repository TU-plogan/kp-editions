MOULINET is used, in Mechanics, to signify a roller, which being crossed with two levers, is usually applied to cranes, capstans, and other sorts of engines, to draw ropes, heave up stones, and the like.

Moulinet is also a kind of turnstile or wooden cross, which turns horizontally upon a stake fixed in the ground. It is usually placed in passages, to keep out horses, and to oblige passengers to pass one by one. These moulinets are often set near the outworks of fortified places at the sides of the barriers, through which people pass on foot.
