MORGHEN, Raphael, one of the most distinguished engravers that ever lived, was born at Naples in 1758. His father followed the profession of engraver, and from him young Morghen received his earliest instructions; but, in order more profoundly to initiate him in the art, he was afterwards placed as a pupil under the celebrated Volpato. He assisted this great master in engraving the famous pictures of Raffaelle in the Vatican, and the print which represents the miracle of Bolsena is inscribed with his name. He married the daughter of his master, and being invited to Florence to engrave the masterpieces of the Florentine gallery, he removed thither with his wife in 1782. All the works which he produced on this occasion were admirable; one in particular, the copy of Raffaelle’s Madonna della Seggiola, is considered not only as the most excellent in the collection, but as a chef-d’oeuvre of art. His reputation now became so great as to induce the artists of Florence to recommend him to the grand duke as a fit person to engrave Leonardo da Vinci’s noble composition of the Last Supper, which adorns the wall of the refectory in the Dominican Convent at Milan. This picture is not only itself dilapidated, but the drawing which was made for Morghen being unworthy of the great original, the print of our artist, although an admirable production, fails to convey a correct idea of the style and merit of Leonardo. His fame, however, soon extended over Europe; and the Institute of France, as a mark of their admiration of his talents, chose him as an associate in 1803. In 1812, Napoleon invited Morghen to Paris, and paid him the most flattering attentions. A list of this great artist’s works was published at Florence in 1810; the number comprised two hundred compositions, but subsequently to this period he produced a considerable variety of admirable prints. Amongst the most remarkable of Morghen’s productions, besides those already mentioned, may be noticed the Transfiguration, from Raffaelle; a Magdalen, from Murillo; a Head of the Saviour, from Da Vinci; the Car of Aurora, from Guido; the Hours, from Poussin; the Prize of Diana, from Domenichino; the Monument of Clement XIII. from Canova; Theseus vanquishing the Minotaur; portraits of Dante, Petrarca, Ariosto, Tasso, and a number of other eminent individuals. Some remarks on the style and general merits of this artist will be found in the article Engraving. Morghen died in 1833, at the advanced age of seventy-five.
