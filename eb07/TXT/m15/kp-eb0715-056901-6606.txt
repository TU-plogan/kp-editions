MOSELLE, a department in the north-east of France, formed out of the district of Messin, of French Luxembourg, and of a part of German Lorraine. It extends in east longitude from 5. 20. to 7. 45., and in north latitude from 48. 55. to 49. 30. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Lower Rhine and the duchy of Luxembourg, on the east by that duchy and the Bavarian circle of the Rhine, on the south by the department of the Meurthe, and on the west by that of the Meuse. It extends over 2473 square miles, or 609,000 hectares, which are apportioned in the following manner, viz. 278,920 arable, 48,490 meadows and pastures, 151,365 woods and forests, 4940 vineyards, 10,216 gardens, and the remainder consisting of the course of rivers and roads, the site of towns and villages, and utterly uncultivated land, which latter constitutes nearly one fourth of the whole department. The subsoil is generally calcareous, often covered with a heavy clay difficult to plough, but in some parts mixed with sand or stone; and its power of production varies from moderate fertility to absolute barrenness. It produces some good wheat and rye, but the corn does not equal the consumption, though the culture of potatoes has been much extended of late years. The chief river, the Moselle, which begins to be navigable at Metz, and falls into the Rhine at Coblentz, receives the waters of the smaller streams. It is a rapid river, often causing great damage by the overflowing of its banks. Besides the common grain, much flax and some hemp are grown. The vine is much cultivated, but the wine is not of a good flavour, as most of that known by the name of Moselle wine throughout Europe grows on the banks of that river after it has quitted the French territory. The hills around Metz have their sides covered with vines, but the grapes are more used for the purposes of making vinegar and brandy than wine. There are [7:15:570]some mines of iron worked, and the material is converted into heavy articles for the use of ships, and for casting cannon. Some linen and woollen cloths are made, and there are fabrics of paper, glass, and earthenware. The population amounts to 350,000 persons, who are mostly of the Catholic religion, though there are some few Calvinists, Anabaptists, and Jews, mostly in Metz. The French language is commonly spoken only in the cities. In the villages a patois called Lorraine is most prevalent; but in the eastern part a corrupted German prevails, and the inhabitants have the marks of that nation in their dress, countenances, and manners. The department sends four deputies to the legislative body. It is divided into four arrondissements, 27 cantons, and 834 communes.
