MONGOLIA, an extensive tract of country in Central Asia, to the north and north-west of Asia. This vast country is not separated from the adjacent countries by any definite line of demarcation. The limits are vague, and the whole space is traversed by the nomadic tribes which, under the name of Mongols or Tartars, have had so deep a share in all the political revolutions of Asia. The various pastoral tribes which from time immemorial have been scattered over the plains of that continent, being united under Zengis Khan, extended their ravages from sea to sea, and were at one time possessed not only of the finest regions of the continent, but a great part of Europe. In later times the conquests of Timour were achieved by the same union of these tribes. The Mongol tribes are at present split into a number of petty states, dependent on the great empires of China and Russia. They still retain their roaming and pastoral habits, but since the invention of fire-arms they are no longer formidable in war. Mongolia, as far as its limits can be defined, is bounded on the east by the country of the Mantcheous, on the west by a chain of mountains continued northwards from the Beloor, and on the south by China. The whole of this country is one vast level plain, which borders on the Altai, and other mountain chains bounding Asiatic Russia on the north. This includes a considerable portion of the great desert of Shamo or Cobi, which is composed entirely of pastorage. In this country are the heads of some of the greatest rivers which water the Russian and Chinese empires, the Hoangho, the Amour, and even the Irtisch. The great disadvantage under which it labours is a scarcity of water. The Mongols, the inhabitants of this region, are of the middlesize, being muscular and strongly built; they have broad, square, and flat faces, with low and flat noses; and small oblique black eyes, thick lips, a short chin, with very little beard, complete their physiognomy. Their habits are pastoral; and, like all the Tartars, they are addicted to intemperance. They are nominally subject to the empire of China; but their internal government is regulated by their native princes. The Kalkas, the Eluths, and the Buriats, with other nations of Asiatic Russia, derive their origin from the Mongols.
