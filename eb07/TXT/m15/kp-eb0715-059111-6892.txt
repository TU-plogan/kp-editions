MUMMIUS, Lucius, a Roman consul sent against the Achaeans, whom he conquered in the year 147 before Christ. He destroyed Corinth, Thebes, and Chalcis, by order of the senate, and obtained the surname of Achaieus, from his victories. He did not enrich himself with the spoils of the enemy, but returned home without any increase of fortune. He was so little acquainted with the value of the paintings and works of the most celebrated artists of Greece which were found in the plunder of Corinth, that he said to those who conveyed them to Rome, that if they lost or injured them they should make others in their stead.
