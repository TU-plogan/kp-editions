MOTAPA (sometimes called Moxomotapa, but improperly, as Mono is here a general name for kingdom), is dignified in the early narratives with the title of empire. Accounts disagree so much regarding the limits which ought to be assigned to Motapa, that it is impossible to derive from them a consistent result. It is uncertain whether it ever deserved the name of empire; at all events, at the present day, it appears to be but a geographical division, comprising several kingdoms independent of each other, and regarding which little or nothing is known.
