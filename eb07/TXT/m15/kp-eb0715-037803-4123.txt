MOLOSSI, a people of Epirus, who inhabited that part of the country which was called Molossia, from Molossus, a son of Pyrrhus and Andromache, the king of the country. Molossia had the Bay of Ambracia as its boundary on the south, and the country of the Perrhaebeans on the east. The dogs of this country were famous, and received the name of Molossi amongst the Romans. Dodona was the capital of the country, according to some writers; but others think that it was the chief city of Thesprotia.
