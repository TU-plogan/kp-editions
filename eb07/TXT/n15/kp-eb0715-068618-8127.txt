NAIADES, in fabulous history, certain inferior deities who presided over rivers, springs, wells, and fountains. The Naiades generally inhabited the country, and resorted to the woods or meadows near the stream over which they presided. They are represented as young and beautiful virgins, each leaning upon an urn, from which flows a stream of water. Aegle was, according to Virgil, the fairest of the Naiades. Their name appears to be derived from ναειν, to flow. They were held in great veneration amongst the ancients; and often sacrifices of goats and lambs were offered to them, with libations of wine, honey, and oil. Sometimes they received only offerings of milk, fruit, and flowers.
