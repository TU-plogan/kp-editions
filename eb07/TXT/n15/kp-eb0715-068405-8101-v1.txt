NABIS, tyrant of Sparta, reigned about 204 years before Christ, and is reported to have so far exceeded all other tyrants, that, upon comparison, he left the epithets of gracious and merciful to Dionysius and Phalaris. He is said to have contrived an instrument of torture in the form of a statue of a beautiful woman, whose rich dress concealed a number of iron spikes in her bosom and arms. When any one therefore opposed his demands, he would say, “If I have not talents enough to prevail with you, perhaps my woman Apega may persuade you.” Then appeared the statue, which Nabis, taking by the hand, led up to the person, who, being embraced by it, was thus tortured into compliance. To render his tyranny less unpopular, Nabis formed an alliance with Flaminius the Roman general, and pursued, with the most inveterate enmity, the war which he had undertaken against the Achaeans. He [7:15:685] besieged Gythium, and defeated Philopoemen in a naval engagement. But his triumph was short; the general of the Achaeans soon repaired his losses; and Nabis having been defeated in an engagement, was killed as he attempted to save his life by flight, about 194 years before the Christian era.
