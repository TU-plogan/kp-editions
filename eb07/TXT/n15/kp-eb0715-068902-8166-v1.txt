NAMUR, a province of the Netherlands. It is formed out of a large portion of the French department of the Sambre and the Meuse, of parts of the ancient duchy of Namur, of some parcels of Liège, Luxemburg, and Brabant, and of the cantons of Philipville and Couvin, ceded to the Netherlands by the peace of 1815. It extends in north latitude from 49. 47. to 50. 49. and in east longitude from 4. 15. to 5. 13. It is 1342 square miles in extent; it is formed into three circles, fifteen cantons, and 313 communes; and it contains 165,000 inhabitants. The surface is covered with hills and mountains, with many valleys between them, in which channels are formed for numerous springs. There are scarcely any extensive[7:15:690] plains; but the lower hills, not exceeding 360 feet in height, are for the most part covered with woods. , The sod in the northern division is of moderate fertility, but in the south it is stony, chalky, or slaty, being almost destitute of mould, and covered with heath or scrubby woods. Agriculture is well conducted in the arrondissement of Namur, but neglected in other parts; so that, with the help of potatoes, which are extensively cultivated, the province barely furnishes corn sufficient for its scanty population, rye and winter barley being the species of grain chiefly grown. Flax, hemp, and rape-seed are produced, but in small quantities. Fruit is abundant, especially walnuts. The vine is but partially cultivated, the whole of the vineyards not exceeding thirty acres. Mines of iron and coal are found in several parts, and worked to such an extent, that about 10,000 tons of cast and wrought iron are procured, and soon converted into utensils. There are manufactures of glass, paper, porcelain, and leather, besides many breweries and distilleries. The inhabitants are of the Walloon race, and much attached to the old customs and religion; they for the most part speak only their peculiar patois, and are almost entirely destitute of education. The two principal rivers, the Sambre and the Meuse, serve to carry off the waters of the numerous small streams, and, when united, become navigable, but only for small craft. The city of Namur is the capital, as well of the arrondissement as of the province. It is situated between two hills, in a valley, on the left bank of the Meuse, where that river is joined by the Sambre and the Bederin. It is strongly fortified, and has a powerful citadel, commanding the city, as well as the passage over the river. It is a well-built place, though with no buildings of a remarkable character. It contains 16,800 inhabitants, who are the chief manufacturers of the province. Long. 4.45. 7. E. Lat. 50.28. 3. N.
