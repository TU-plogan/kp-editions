NANGASAKI, one of the sea-ports of Japan, at the south-western extremity of the island of Ximo, and one of the largest commercial sea-ports in the island. It is the only point of the empire at which Europeans are permitted to trade; and this permission is confined to the Dutch. The island of Ximo is separated from Nangasaki only by a ditch. It has two gates, one of which, looking to the town, is shut at night upon the Dutch, and is guarded by the Japanese. The other looks to the harbour, which is three miles in length and one in breadth. The Dutch town is built lengthwise, and contains several large storehouses, which have been made fire-proof. The other houses are built of wood, clay, and tiles, with paper windows, and floor-mats of straw. The Japanese interpreters have a large house, and also the Ottonas, who are a sort of spies, and report all that they see to the governor. The Dutch company pay fifteen per cent, and private traders seventy-five per cent, on all goods imported. Nangasaki, the Japanese town, is built at the head of the harbour, and has neither walls nor fortifications. There are two towns; the inner, which contains twenty-six, and the outer, which contains sixty-one streets. These streets are neither straight nor spacious, although many merchants and artificers reside in them. The city is watered by three rivulets, descending from the neighbouring mountains. The most handsome houses are the palaces of the two resident governors, and of other princes and grandees. There are sixty-two temples built on eminences, serving for worship, and also for recreation. Long. 130. 12. E. Lat. 32. 48. N.
