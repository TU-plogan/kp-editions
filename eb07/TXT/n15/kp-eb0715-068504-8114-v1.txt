NABONASSAR, first king of the Chaldaeans or Babylonians, memorable on account of the Jewish era which bears his name, and which is generally fixed in 3257, beginning on Wednesday, February 26th, in the 3967th of the Julian period, 747 years before Christ. The Babylonians having revolted from the Medes, who had overthrown the Assyrian monarchy, founded under Nabonassar a dominion which was much increased under Nabuchadnezzar. It is probable, that this Nabonassar is the Baladan mentioned in the second of Kings (xx∙ 12), father of Merodach, who sent ambassadors to Hezekiah.
