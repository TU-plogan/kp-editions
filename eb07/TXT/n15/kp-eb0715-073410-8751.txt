NARBONNE, an arrondissement of the department of the Aude, in France, 610 square miles in extent. It is divided into six cantons, and these into seventy communes, containing 51,200 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, which is the seat of an archbishop. It is situated in a deep valley, surrounded with mountains, out of which the river Aude issues, and by a canal it is connected with the Mediterranean Sea. This canal, constructed by the Romans, divides the city into two parts. The cathedral is a fine object, with a magnificent portal leading to it. It contains 2100 houses, and 10,500 inhabitants, who make woollen cloths, and trade largely in wine, oil, honey, silk, and other productions of the soil. It was a city of much importance under the Romans; and many inscriptions of that age are still found. Long. 2. 54. E. Lat. 43. 10. N.
