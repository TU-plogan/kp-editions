NAVAN, a borough-town of Ireland, in the county of

Meath and province of Leinster, about thirty miles northwest of Dublin, situated at the junction of the Boyne and Blackwater, near the canal called the Boyne Navigation. The situation of the town, in the centre of a great corn country, produces an excellent corn market; and its abundant supply of water affords great facilities for flour-mills and trading in flour. The landed property originally belonging to the corporation is said to have amounted to about 1200 acres; but it has been from time to time encroached upon by the neighbouring proprietors, and otherwise disposed of, till it has at length dwindled down to less than 150 acres. By the census of 1831, the population of Navan amounted to 4416; males 2085, females 2331. The families employed in agriculture were 403; in trade, manufactures, and handicraft, 305; not comprised in the preceding classes, 200. The proportion of Roman Catholics to Protestants is as ten to one. There are very few Protestant dissenters in the district.
