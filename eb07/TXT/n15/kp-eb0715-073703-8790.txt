NATAL, or Natar, a Malay settlement on the southwestern coast of the island of Sumatra, several miles south of the island of Tabuyong. It carries on a pretty considerable commerce; and, besides the English, who have had a settlement here since the year 1752, it is inhabited by settlers from the countries of Achin, Rau, and Menang Kabau. The English settlement was destroyed by the French in 1760, but was soon re-established, and the possession secured by the treaty of Paris in 1763. There is a considerable demand here for manufactured goods, such as piece-goods, opium, coarse cutlery, ammunition and guns, brass-wire, and China ware; the returns for which are usually made in gold and camphor. The gold from the interior is of a very fine quality, but it is frequently adulterated. The anchorage is about two miles off the shore, in five fathoms water. It is one of the worst roads on the western coast of Sumatra, having numerous shoals in it, and often a heavy sea running. The town is governed by a native magistrate, who has considerable sway; and the influence of the British East India Company was never so predominant here as in the pepper districts to the southward, owing to the wealth and independent spirit of the people.
