NAPOLEON’S LAND, a tract of land on the southern coast of New Holland, which extends about fifty leagues, from long. 138. 58. to 140.10. E., and from lat. 35. 40. to 37. 36. S., in the course of which there is no river nor inlet. It was discovered by Captain Baudin in the year 1802. The French, who also sent a squadron of discovery to the coast of New Holland, comprehend under this title a much larger extent of coast, commencing at about 110. E. long, and stretching from 33. to 39. S. lat∙, including the whole coast from Cape Leeuwin on the west, to Wilson’s Promontory on the south. Part of this was, however, previously explored by the expedition under Captain Flinders.
