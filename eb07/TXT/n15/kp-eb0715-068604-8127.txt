NAGAMANGATAM, a large square mud fort in the south of India, and province of Mysore. It contains a square citadel in its centre, in which are two Hindu temples, and all the public granaries and store-rooms. The town is said to be 600 years old, having been erected by a prince named Jagadeva Raya, of the same family with the present Mysore rajah. It was taken by the Mahrattas in 1793; and the number of houses was reduced from 1500 to 300; but it has since rapidly recovered its population and its wealth. Long. 76. 57. E. Lat 12. 49. N.
