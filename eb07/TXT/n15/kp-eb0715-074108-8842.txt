NAUPLIUS, in fabulous history, a son of Neptune and Amymone, was king of Euboea, and the father of the famous Palamedes, who, by the artifice and resentment of Ulysses, was so unjustly sacrificed by the Greeks at the Trojan war. The death of Palamedes highly enraged Nauplius; and, to revenge the injustice of the Grecian princes, he endeavoured to debauch their wives, and ruin their characters. When the Greeks returned from the Trojan war, Nauplius was pleased to see them distressed in a storm on the coasts of Euboea; and, to render their disaster still more universal, he lighted fires on such places as were surrounded with the most dangerous rocks, that the fleet might be shipwrecked upon the coast. This had the desired effect; but Nauplius was so disappointed when he observed that Ulysses and Diomedes had escaped from the general distress, that he threw himself into the sea. According to some mytholoğists, there were two persons of this name; one a native of Argos, the son of Neptune and Amymone, who accompanied Jason to Colchis; and the other king of Euboea, who lived about the time of the Trojan war, and, according to some, was the son of Cly-tonas, [7:15:742]one of the descendants of Nauplius the Argonaut. The Argonaut was remarkable for his knowledge of naval affairs and of astronomy. He built the town of Nauplia, and sold Auge, daughter of Aleus, to King Teuthras, in order to screen her from her father’s resentment.
