NARVA, a city of the government of St Petersburg, in Russia. It is the capital of the circle of the same same, which is extensive, but it contains only 16,000 inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Narowa, is surrounded with walls, and divided into the old and the new town. It contains three Greek and two Lutheran churches, with 460 houses, and 3750 inhabitants, who have several sawmills and flatting-mills, and make many nails. It has a small harbour, from which wood, flax, and hemp are exported, about a mile below the city. The place is remarkable for the battle fought there between the Swedes and Russians in 1700, when the army of the latter, amounting to 100,000 men, was defeated by the former with only 7000.
