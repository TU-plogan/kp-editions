NANCOWRY, one of the Nicoar Islands, situated in the Bay of Bengal. It is about twenty-five miles in circumference, and has a rich soil, which, however, is but little cultivated. Between this, the island of Cornarty, and another island, is a very capacious bay, in which ships may lie in the most perfect security. The best entrance is on the east side. The western entrance is narrow, being only 100 fathoms wide, and the tide rolling through it with great force, though it is sufficiently deep to admit the largest vessels. The natural productions of this island are cocoa-nuts, papias, plantains, limes, tamarinds, betel-nut, and a species of bread fruit. Rice is unknown; but yams and other roots are cultivated; and the mangosteen tree and pine apples grow wild. The inhabitants are Mahommedans, and are a civil, quiet people. They are stout and well made, but, like all barbarous people, nowise industrious. They rear a great number of poultry, which they barter for cloth, cutlery, tobacco, and other articles. Their houses are built on piles so near the shore as frequently to admit of the tide flowing under them. The Danes had formerly a small settlement here, consisting of missionaries and a few soldiers. It existed as late as the year 1791, and was withdrawn on account of the sickness amongst the troops, and of the little advantage derived from it. The island is annually visited by from fifteen to twenty large prows, with Malays and Chinese from the coast of Malacca, in quest of edible bird-nests. Long. 93. 43. E. Lat. 7. 57. N.
