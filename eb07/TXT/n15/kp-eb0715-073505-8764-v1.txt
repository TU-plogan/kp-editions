NARO, a city of Sicily, in the province of Mazzara, about seventy-five miles from Palermo. It stands on a height at the mouth of the small river of its own name, known to the ancients as the Hypsa. Articles of commerce from this place are shipped at the mole of Girgenti, a work constructed with large blocks of marine exuviae, consisting almost wholly of petrified shells, which were brought from the ruins of the temple of Jupiter Olympius in the year 1756. There is here a presidio for criminals condemned to hard labour, who work chiefly in clearing the harbour of the deposits occasioned by the southerly winds. This place is remarkable from the peculiar properties of its granaries, which consist of large conical cisterns or reservoirs excavated in a calcareous rock, and entirely free from the effects of humidity, so that the corn can be kept twenty years without injury. No charge is made for thus housing the corn, but when it is exported the government derives some benefit. Naro contains about 10,000 inhabitants, and is esteemed a healthy place.
