NARAINGUNGE, a considerable trading town of Bengal, in the district of Dacca, pleasantly situated on the western branch of the river Brahmapootra, denominated the Luckia. It is a place of great trade and industry; its principal commodities being grain, salt, tobacco, and lime. A considerable quantity of fine muslin is also manufactured here; and a scene of activity is exhibited in this place which is very seldom seen in a community purely Hindu. During the rainy season the greater part of the country is inundated. There are still many remains of ill-constructed fortresses, which were raised in this vicinity in the seventeenth century, to protect the country against the Mughs or Arracauners, who at that time made inroads into Bengal with their war-boats, and not only pillaged whole villages, but also carried away the inhabitants and sold them for slaves. On the opposite side of the river is a noted place of Mahommedan pilgrimage called Cuddumresoul, where is shown the impression made by the prophetâ€™s foot on a stone; it is much reverenced by the pious Mahommedan's, who resort to it in great numbers from Dacca and the adjacent villages. The inhabitants amount to 15,000. The principal merchants are not natives of the town, but come from dif ferent districts, and bring their families along with them. Long. 90. 35. E. Lat. 23. 37. N.:
