NAUPACTUS, or Naupactum, in Ancient Geography, a city of Aetolia, at the mouth of the Evenus. The word is derived from vαuς and πηγwμι i because it was there that the Heraclidae built the first ship which carried them to Peloponnesus. It originally belonged to the Locri Ozolae, and afterwards fell into thehands of the Athenians, by whom it was given to the Messenians, who had been driven from Peloponnesus by the Lacedaemonians. After the battle of Aegospotamos, it became the property of the Lacedaemonians; but it was restored to the Locri. Philip of Macedonia afterwards took it, and gave it to the Aetolians; and from this circumstance it has generally been called one of the chief cities of their country. Long. 22. 20. E. Lat. 38. 0. N. On the shore there was a temple of Neptune, and near it a cave filled with offerings, and dedicated to Venus, where widows resorted to request new husbands of the goddess. (Pausanias, lib. x. p. 898.)
