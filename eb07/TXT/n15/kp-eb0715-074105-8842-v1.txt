NAUMACHIA, in Antiquity, a public show or spectacle amongst the ancient Romans, representing a sea-fight. These mock fights are supposed to have originated at the time of the first Punic war, when the Romans first instructed their men in the knowledge of naval affairs; but afterwards they were intended to entertain the populace, as well as to improve the seamen. They were often, like other shows, exhibited at the expense of individuals, who thus sought to increase their popularity.

In these spectacles they sometimes strove to excel each other in swiftness, and sometimes engaged in a warlike manner. The naumachia of Claudius, indeed, was a most savage diversion, where the combatants used to destroy each other to amuse a tyrant and a cruel mob. As they passed before him, they used this melancholy greeting, “Ave, Imperator, morituri te salutant.” The emperor replied, “Avete vos.” This they understood as an answer of kindness, and a grant of their lives; but they soon discovered that it proceeded from wanton cruelty and barbarous insensibility. In the time of the Emperor Domitian, the number of vessels engaged would have nearly formed two regular fleets for a real fight, and the channel of water was equal in magnitude to a natural river. The Emperor Heliogabalus is reported to have filled the channel where the vessels were to ride with wine instead of water. Tritons and sea-monsters were frequently exhibited during the engagement. Suetonius and Dion Cassius inform us, that at one of the sea-fights of Domitian there fell a violent shower of rain; the emperor, however, continued till the end of the engagement, often changing his clothes; nor would he suffer any one to depart, and as the rain continued to fall for several hours, many were seized with distempers, and some even died. (Sueton. cap. 4; Dio. lib. Ixvii.) Naumachiae were also places fitted up for these shows, being a sort of circi or amphitheatres, with seats and porticoes. There were several of them at Rome, namely, three built by Augustus, one by Claudius, another by Domitian, and another by Nero, which served for the reverse of his medals. Claudius used the Lake Fucinus as a naumachia.
