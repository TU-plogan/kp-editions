NAVAL means something relating to a ship (navis). Naval Camp, in Antiquity, a fortification, consisting of a ditch and parapet on the land side, or of a wall built in the form of a semicircle, and extended from one point of the sea to another. This was sometimes defended with towers, and beautified with gates, through which the ancients issued forth to attack their enemies. Towards the sea, or within it, they fixed great pales of wood, like those in their artificial harbours; and before these the vessels of burden were placed, in such order that they might serve instead of a wall, and give protection to those within. In this manner Nicias is reported by Thucydides to have encamped himself; but it seems only to have been practised when the enemy was thought superior in strength, and raised great apprehensions of danger. When their fortifications were considered strong enough to defend them against the assaults of enemies, it was frequent to drag their ships to shore, which the Greeks called ενωκκειν, and the Romans subducere. Around the ships the soldiers disposed their tents, as appears everywhere in Homer. But this seems to have been practised only in winter, when the enemy’s fleet was laid up and could not assault them; or in long sieges, and when they were in no danger from their enemies by sea, as in the Trojan war, where the defenders of Troy never once attempted to encounter the Grecians in a sea-fight.

Naval Crown, amongst the ancient Romans, a crown adorned with figures of prows of ships, and conferred on persons who, in naval engagements, had first boarded an enemy’s vessel.

Naval Tactics, the warlike operations of fleets. See Tactics, Naval.
