NAPOLI DI ROMANIA, a city of the Morea. It is situated near the upper end of the fine gulf of Napoli, at the distance of seven leagues from the north-west end of the island of Pezza, or Spezzia. The gulf is irregularly formed, and has in it several islands. It was at one period the seat of the Greek government, having been taken from the Turks in December 1822.

It is a place well situated both for defence and for commerce; it has an excellent and secure harbour, and has been sometimes described as the Gibraltar of the Archipelago; but it is not at present in the best state of defence. Before 1821, this place was the dépôt of almost the whole of the exportable produce of Greece, and it carried on a most extensive commerce in sponges, silk, oil, wax, and wines. At present it has not recovered from the effect of the war which so long desolated the country. Though the first appearance is striking, from its position at the foot of a gigantic and abrupt promontory, with impregnable castles on its summits; yet, on entering, the narrow streets, the meanly built houses, the humid air impregnated with foetid odours, and the general filthiness, are most disgusting to every new comer. This condition of the place has produced epidemic fevers, which at various periods have swept away a large portion of the population. The number of inhabitants is very fluctuating, and no very accurate statements are attainable. They have been recently estimated at from 14,000 to 20,000; but if even the smaller number be correct, it must be the most populous place of its size of any city in Europe, for the houses are so small that in every room there must be four or five persons. The manners of the people are still purely eastern, few of the females, except the very poorest, being to be seen out of their dwellings.
