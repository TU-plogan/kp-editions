NAULUM, in Roman antiquity, a piece of money put into the mouth of a person deceased, to enable him to pay Charon, the ferryman, for his passage. It required to be of the current coin of the reigning emperor; and hence from this money the time of the person’s death may be known. The sum for poor men was about a farthing, but the rich in general were very liberal to Charon, as appears from the number of coins often found in the neighbourhood of Rome upon opening the graves of great men. A similar custom prevailed amongst the Greeks. The money put into the mouth of the deceased was by them called δανακη.
