NABATENE, or Regio Nabataeorum, according to Jerome, comprehended all the country lying between the Euphrates and the Red Sea, and thus contained Arabia Deserta, with a part of Arabia Petraea. It was so called from Nabaioth, the first-born of Ismael. According to Diodorus, it was situated between Syria and Egypt.
