NANI, John Baptist, was born in 1616. His father was procurator of St Mark, and ambassador from Venice to Rome. He was educated with attention, and made considerable improvement. Urban VIII. a good judge of merit, soon perceived that of young Nani. He was admitted into the college of senators in 1641, and was shortly afterwards nominated ambassador to France, where he signalized himself by his complaisant manners. He procured considerable succours for the war of Candia against the Turks, and, after his return to Venice, became superintendent of the war-office and of finances. He was subsequently ambassador to the empire, where he rendered those [7:15:691]services to his country which, as a zealous and intelligent citizen, he was so well qualified to discharge. He was again sent to France in the year 1660, to solicit fresh succours for Candia, and on his return was appointed procurator of St Mark. He died on the 5th of November 1768, at the age of sixty-three, much regretted by his countrymen. The senate had appointed him to write the History of the Republic, which he executed to the satisfaction of the Venetians, although the work has not been admired by foreigners. This history was printed at Venice in 1662 and 1679, in two vols. 4to.
