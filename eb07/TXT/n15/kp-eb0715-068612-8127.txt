NAHN, a district of Hindustan, partly situated in the province of Delhi, on its north-eastern frontier, and partly in Serinagur. It is between the thirtieth and thirty-second degrees of north latitude, and is bounded on the east by the river Jumna. The country is in general woody and mountainous; but is interspersed in the neighbourhood of the city with low hills and extensive wastes, overgrown with wood; yet these wastes might be watered from the Jumna, and brought under cultivation. They are, however, open to the inroads of both the Sikhs and Nepaulese, who plunder the country; and hence the peasants have no encouragement to be industrious. The country is possessed by native chiefs, ever jealous of each other, and who plunder the miserable peasantry, and are in their turn plundered by other robbers more powerful than themselves. The capital, of the same name, is a place of considerable strength, being built of stone, and situated upon the summit of a lofty mountain. Long. 77. 7. E. Lat. 30. 4L N.
