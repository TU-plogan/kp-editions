BARA, the name of a festival formerly celebrated with much magnificence at Messina, and representing the assumption of the Virgin. Though used as the general denomination of this festival, bara signifies more particularly a vast machine fifty feet high, at the top of which a young girl of fourteen, representing the Virgin, stood upon the hand of an image of Jesus Christ.
