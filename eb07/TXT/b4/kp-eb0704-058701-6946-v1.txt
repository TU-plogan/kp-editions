BERLIN, the capital of the Prussian dominions, as well as of the province of Brandenburg. It is built on both sides of the navigable river Spree, which is divided in its course into several branches, over which are bridges connecting together the several parts of the city. It is divided into eight different quarters, and surrounded with a wall, but too weak to be useful for defensive purposes, and only adapted to the purposes of civic revenue. It is a beautifully built city, with broad streets, though as badly paved as in other continental places; and most of the houses are magnificent. The public buildings, such as the university, the schloss or royal palace, the opera-house, the guard-house, the mint, and the palace of Monbijoux, are quite equal to those in other capitals. The gates are very elegant, especially that leading to the park, called the Brandenburg gate, which is an exact copy of the propylaeum at Athens, and in the centre of which is again placed the chariot and horses which the French carried to Paris in 1807. The public walks, especially the Linden, are laid out with great taste; and the environs, in spite of a naturally poor soil, are cultivated so as to produce a very pleasing effect. Berlin is the chief seat of the science and learning of Prussia, and indeed of Germany. These are fostered by the university, by the valuable public libraries, and collections of the various objects of natural history and antiquities, by the several learned societies, and by the protection of the monarch and of the royal tamιly. The hospitals and other charitable institutions are very numerous and well regulated, and afford excel-ent means of furnishing instruction to medical pupils.

Berlin is an industrious manufacturing place, and produces silk, woollen, and cotton goods, of good quality. Paper, glass, porcelain, chemical preparations, musical ļ and mathematical instruments, and other commodities, forming a large mass, are also made within the city. The number of inhabitants in 1817 was 182,387, of whom 174,428 were Protestants. They have since increased, and at the end of 1826 amounted to 231,650. Long. 13. 15. 25. E. Lat. 52. 31. 30. N.

Berlin, a sort of vehicle, of the chariot kind, taking its name from the city of Berlin, in Germany; though some attribute the invention of it to the Italians, and derive the word from berlina, a name given by them to a sort of stage, on which persons are exposed to public shame. The berlin is a very convenient machine to travel in, being lighter, and less apt to be overturned, than a chariot. The body of it is hung high, on shafts, by leathern braces; and there is a kind of stirrup or footstool for the convenience of getting into it. Instead of side-windows, some have screens to let down in bad and draw up in good weather.
