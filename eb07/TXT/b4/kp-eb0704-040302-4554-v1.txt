BARONET, a dignity or degree of honour next below that of baròn, and above that of knight, with precedency of all knights excepting those of the Garter, and the only knighthood that is hereditary.

The dignity of baronet is generally conferred by patent, and forms the lowest degree of honour that is hereditary. The order was instituted by King James I. at the suggestion of Sir Robert Cotton in 1611, when two hundred baronets were created at once, being the number to which it was intended they should always be restricted; but it is now enlarged at the king’s pleasure, without limitation. Originally, the creation of this order seems to have been merely an expedient to raise money in the name of fees, which, in each case, amounted to about L.1200 sterling.

Baronets take precedence according to the dates of their patents, conformably to the terms of which, no intermediate honour between barons and baronets can be established. The title or prefix of Sir is granted them by a peculiar clause in their patents, thoug!ι they be not dubbed knights.

Baronets of Scotland, called also Baronets of Nova Scotia. This order of knights baronets was instituted by Charles I. in the year 1625, when the first person dignified with the title was Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstone, a younger son of the earl of Sutherland. The object of the institution was to encourage the plantation and settlement of Nova Scotia in North America: hence the king granted to each of them a certain portion of land in this province, which they were to hold of Sir William Alexander, afterwards earl of Stirling, with precedency to [7:4:404] them and thcir heirs-male for ever, before all knights called equites aurati, all lesser barons called lairds, and all other gentlemen, except Sir William Alexander, his majesty’s lieutenant in Nova Scotia, his heirs, their wives and children. It was further provided that the title of Sir should be prefixed to their Christian name, and Baronet added to thcir surname; and that their own and their eldest sons’ wives should enjoy the title of Lady, Madam, or Dame.

Mr Malone has given the following curious note upon this subject, in his very learned Life of Dryden, prefixed to his edition of the prose works of that writer :—“When the order of baronets was first established in 1611, King James engaged that they should not exceed two hundred. However, toλvards the close of his reign, that number being completed, and the creation of baronets being found a useful engine of government (the courtier by whose influence the title was obtained receiving usually L.1000 for the grant), it was not lightly to be parted with. A scheme, therefore, of creating Baronets of Scotland was devised, which, it was conceived, would be no infraction of the original compact, to confine the grants to a limited number; and as the English baronets were created under the great seal of England, for the reduction of Ulster in Ireland, so the Scottish baronets were created under the great seal of Scotland, for the reduction of Acadia, or Nova Scotia. The scheme, however, was not carried into execution by King James; but early in the rcign of his successor several Scottish baronets were made. From this statement it appears, that there is no more necessity for calling a baronet created under the great seal of Scotland (whether he be an Englishman or Scotchman), ο,Baronct of Nova Scotia, than there is to denominate one created under the great seal of England a Baronet of Ulster.” (Malone’s Dryden, vol. i. p. 28-9.)

Baronets of Ireland. This order was likewise instituted by King James I. in the 18th year of his reign, for the same purpose and with the same privileges within the kingdom of Ireland as had been conferred on the analogous order in England; for which also the Irish baronets paid the same fees into the treasury of Ireland.
