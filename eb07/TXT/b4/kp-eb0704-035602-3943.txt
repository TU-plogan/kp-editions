BAPTIST, John Monnoyer, a painter of flowers and fruit, was born at Lisle in 1635, and educated at Antwerp, where he perfected himself in the knowledge of his art, and in his first years was intended for a painter of history; but having soon found that his genius more strongly inclined him to the painting of flowers, he applied his talents to those subjects, and in that style became one of the greatest masters. His pictures are not so exquisitely finished as those of Van Huysum, but his composition and colouring are in a bolder style. He died in 1699, leaving a son, Anthony, who followed his fatherâ€™s profession, and had great merit.
