BELGIUM is distinguished from Belgica as a part from the whole. Caesar makes Belgium the country of the Bellovaci, and Hirtius adds the Atrebates. But as the Ambiani lay between the Bellovaci and Atrebates, they must also be added; and these three people constituted the proper and genuine Belgae, all the rest being adventitious or foreigners. Ancient Belgium included Beauvais, Amiens, and Artois. For modern Belgium see Netherlands.
