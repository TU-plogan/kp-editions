BILSON, Thomas, bishop of Winchester, in which city he was born and educated. In 1565 he was admitted perpetual fellow of New College, and in 1570 completed his degrees in arts. He was made bachelor of divinity in 1579, and doctor the year following. His first preferment was that of master of Winchester school; he was next made prebendary, and afterwards warden, of Winchester College. In 1596 he was consecrated bishop of Worcester, and about a year afterwards translated to the see of Winchester, and sworn of Queen Elizabeth’s privy council. He was one of the principal managers of the Hampton Court conference in 1604; and the English translation of the Bible in the reign of King James I. was finally corrected by this prelate, and Dr Miles Smith, bishop of Gloucester. He died in the year 1616, and was buried in Westminster abbey, near the entrance of St Edmund’s chapel, on the south side of the monument of Richard II. The several authors who have mentioned Bishop Bilson agree in giving him the character of a learned divine, an able civilian, and an upright man. His style is in general much more easy and harmonious than that of contemporary ecclesiastics. His works arc, 1. Several Latin poems and orations, in manuscript; 2. The true difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion, Oxf. 1585, 4to, Lond. 1586, 8vo; 3. The Perpetual Government of Christ’s Church, Lond. 1593, 4to, black letter; 4. The effect of certain sermons touching the full redemption of mankind by the death and blood of Christ, &c. Lond. 1599, 4to; 5. The survey of Christ’s suffering for man’s redemption, and of his descent to Hades or Hell, Lond. 1604, fol.; 6. A sermon preached before King James I. and his queen at their coronation, Lond. 1603, 8vo.
