BEIZA, or Beizath, in Hebrew antiquity, a word signifying an egg, and also a certain measure in use among the Jews. The beiza among the Persians was a gold coin, weighing forty drachmas. Hence they pretended that Philip of Macedon owed their king Darius a thousand bei-zaths or golden eggs as tribute-money; and that Alexander the Great refused to pay them, saying, the bird which laid these eggs had flown into the other world.
