BONONCINI, Giovanni Maria, of Modena, an eminent musical composer, who for some time divided the opinions of the conoscenti in this kingdom, respecting his merits as compared with Handel. An Italian opera, entitled Pharnaces, has the name of Bononcini prefixed to it; but whether the words, or only the music, be his composition, is uncertain. Bononcini is, however, the undisputed author of a work entitled ll MusicoPratico or the Practical Musician, which he published in 1673, and dedicated to the emperor Leopold.
