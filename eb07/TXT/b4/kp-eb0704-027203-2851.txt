BACCIO, or Baccius, Andrew, a celebrated physician of the sixteenth century, born at St Elpideo. He practised physic at Rome with great reputation, and was first physician to Pope Sixtus V. The most scarce and valuable of his works are the following :—1. De Thermis; 2. De Naturali Vinorum Historia, de Vinis Italiae, et de Conviviis Antiquorum; 3. De Venenis et Antidotis; 4. De Gemmis ac Lapidibus Pretiosis. Baccio, Fra. Bartolomeo, called Bαrtelerni di S. Marco, a celebrated historical and portrait painter, born at Savignano, near Florence, in 1469, was a disciple of Cosumo Roselli; but his principal knowledge of the art was derived from Leonardo da Vinci. He understood the true principles of design better than most masters of his time; and being also a considerable painter in perspective, Raphael had recourse to him, after quitting the school of Perugino, and, under his direction, studied the art of managing and uniting colours, as well as the rules of perspective. Some years after the departure of Raphael from Florence, Baccio visited Rome; and by the observations he made on the antiques and the works of Raphael, which were then the admiration of the whole world, he improved greatly, and manifested his acquired abilities by a picture of St Sebastian, which he finished at his return to Florence. This was so well designed, so naturally and beautifully coloured, and so strongly expressive of suffering and agony, that it was found necessary to remove it from the place where it had been exhibited, in the chapel of a convent, in consequence of the too powerful impression it ιad made on the imaginations of many women who beheld it. Baccio was very laborious, and made nature his perpetual study; his designs were distinguished for correctness and purity, his figures had a great deal of grace, and his colouring was admirable. He is usually accounted the inventor of the .machine called a layman by the artists, and which to this day is in general use among the gentlemen of the pallet and brush. Upon it lie placed his draperies, to observe with greater exactness their natural dependence and more elegant convolutions. Ther-3 is a capital picture of the Ascension, by Baccio, in the Florentine collection. He died in 1517.
