BEEROO, a considerable kingdom of central Africa, lying to the north of Bambarra, and west of Timbuctoo. It is very little known, having never been visited by any European. The people are Mahommedans, and its capital is Walet, a large town, enriched by being the chief emporium of the trade in salt, which is conveyed from the tracts in the great desert where it abounds, to those along the Niger, where it is entirely wanting. That city has ever been stated to be equal in magnitude to Timbuctoo.
