BARTAS, William de Salluste du, a French poet, was born in the year 1544, and died in 1590. He was employed by Henry IV. of France, in England, Denmark, and Scotland; and he commanded a troop of horse in Gascony, under the marshal de Martignan. He wrote a number of poems, the principal of which, The Week, or the Creation of the World, though it has long since fallen into oblivion, enjoyed for a considerable period a very high reputation, thirty editions of it having been printed within a few years after its appearance. It was translated into English by Joshua Sylvester, and published in 1605, in a quarto volume, which has been several times reprinted.
