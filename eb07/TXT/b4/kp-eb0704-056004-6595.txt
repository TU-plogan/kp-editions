BEMBO, Peter, a noble Venetian, secretary to Leo X., afterwards cardinal, and one of the best writers of the sixteenth century. He was a good poet, both in Italian and Latin; but he is justly censured for the licentiousness and immodesty of some of his poems. Besides these, he published A History of Venice; Letters; and a book in praise of the duke and duchess of Urbino. He died in 1547, in the seventy-second year of his age.
