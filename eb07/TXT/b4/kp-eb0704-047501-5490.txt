BEATITUDE imports the supreme good, or the highest degree of happiness human nature is susceptible of; in other words, the most perfect state of a rational being, wherein the soul has attained to the utmost excellency and dignity it is capable of. In this sense it is équivalut towhat we call “blessedness” or “sovereign felicity,” the Greeks ευδα∕μοy∕α, and the Latins summum bonum, M 1 titudo, and beatitas. Beatitude, among divines, denotes he beatific vision, or the fruition of God in a future life o all eternity. This term is also used in speaking of the θRP con t a i n θd * n Christ’s sermon on the mount.
