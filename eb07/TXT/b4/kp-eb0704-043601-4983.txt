BASTARDY is a defect of birth objected to one born out of wedlock. In relation to its trial in law, bastardy is distinguished into general and special. General bastardy is a certificate from the bishop of the diocese to the king’s justices, after inquiry made whether the party is a bastard or not, upon some question of inheritance. Bastardy special is a suit commenced in the king’s courts against a person who calls another a bastard.

Bastardy, Arms of, should be crossed with a bar, fillet, or traverse, from the right to the left.
