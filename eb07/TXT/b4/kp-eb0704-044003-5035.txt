BATH, a city in the county of Somerset, and one of the most beautiful places in this kingdom, or indeed in Europe. It stands on the river Frome, 105 miles from London. A great part of the city is but little above th e level of the stream, but the north part gradually rises in rows of streets and crescents, one above the other, to the height of near 300 feet. The whole is built of freestone raised on the spot, which gives an appearance of elegance to the houses. The warm springs are of great celebrity, and much frequented by visitors, both for health and for pleasure. They are few in number, and differ but little from each other in their medicinal properties. The temperature of the coolest is 97°, of the warmest 117° of Fahrenheit. The city is well supplied with those amusements and relaxations which are requisite for the description of society that assembles here. There is a theatre, two sets of public rooms for balls and concerts, a great number of public libraries, and beautiful promenades. Besides the cathedral, and several parish churches and chapels, there are places of worship for every denomination of Christians. The markets are well supplied with every necessary and luxury, and at a very moderate rate. The houses, whether for lodging, boarding, or both, are clean and admirably conducted; and in no place can persons enjoy so much comfort at the same expense. The police is well regulated by the corporation, and the several hospitals are well managed for the patients. The city returns two members to parliament, who are chosen by the corporation. The patronage has been commonly divided between the marquis of Bath and the marquis of Camden. The abbey church or cathedral is a fine specimen of ancient Gothic architecture. The diocese, combined with Wells, extends over the county of Somerset, and contains 388 parishes. The river Frome is navigable to Bristol; and the Thames and Severn are united by a canal, called the Kennet and Avon, which passes from Bath to Newbury. The population of Bath amounted in 1801 to 32,200, in 1811 to 34,412, and in 1821 to 36,811.

_ Knights of the Bath, a military order in England, concerning the origin of which antiquaries differ in their accounts. The earliest intimation we have of the order is in the reign of Henry IV., when we find a degree of knighthood under the express denomination of the Bath. On the day of his coronation in the tower of London, that king conferred the insignia of the order upon forty-six esquires, who had watched all the night before, and had bathed themselves. And from his time it was customary for our kings to confer this dignity on the occasion of their own coronations or those of their queens; on the birth or marriage of royal issue, and their first advancement to honours; upon the eve of intended expeditions against foreign enemies; at the installations of knights of the garter; and when some grand anniversary festivals were celebrated. The last knights of the bath so made were in 1661, at the coronation of King Charles II.; after which the order was neglected until the year 1725, when George I. was pleased to revive it, and to command a book of statutes to be framed for the government of the order. By this code the number of knights was fixed at thirty-eight, namely, the sovereign and thirty-seven knights-companions. But, in the reign of his late majesty, George IV., the statutes of the order were relaxed; and, under the denominations of companions and grand crosses, a great additional number of persons, chiefly military men, who had distinguished themselves in actual service, have been admitted within the pale of the order.

The apparel of a knight of the bath is a red surcoat, lined and edged with white, and girt with a white girdle, but without any ornament; the mantle, of the same colour and lining, is fastened about the neck with a lace of white silk, to which is attached a pair of white gloves, with tassels of silk and gold at the end; and on the left shoulder [7:4:441]it is adorned with the ensign of the order, consisting of three imperial crowns or, surrounded with the ancient motto, Tria juncta in uno, wrought upon a circle gules, with a glory or rays issuing from the centre, and under it the lace of white silk worn by the knights of the bath. Red breeches and stockings, and white hats, surmounted with plumes of white feathers, complete the knightly apparel. The chapel of Henry VII. is the chapel of the order, and every knight’s banner, with plates of his armsand style, is placed over his respective stall, in the same manner as those of the knights of the garter in St George’s chapel, Windsor; and the knights arc allowed supporters to their arms.
