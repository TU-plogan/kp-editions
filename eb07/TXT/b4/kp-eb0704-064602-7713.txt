BIRD. See Ornithology. For the method of preserving birds see Taxidermy. EiRD~Call, a little stick, cleft at one end, in which is put a leaf of some plant, wherewith to counterfeit the cry or call of several birds, and bring them to the net, or snare, or lime-twig, to be taken. A laurel leaf fitted on the bird-call counterfeits the voice of lapwings; a leek that of nightingales, &c.

Bird- Catching, the art of taking birds or wild-fowl, whether for food, for the pleasure of their song, or for their destruction as pernicious to the husbandman and horticulturist.

Song-birds, in a state of nature, fly, as the bird-catchers term it, chiefly during the month of October, and part of September and November; as the flight in March is much less considerable than that of Michaelmas. It is to be noted, also, that the several species of birds of flight do not make their appearance precisely at the same time, during the months of September, October, and November. The pippet-lark, for example, begins to fly about Michaelmas, and is succeeded by the wood-lark, linnet, goldfinch, chaffinch, greenfinch, and other kinds. These birds, during the Michaelmas and March flights, are chiefly on the wing from day-break to noon, though there is afterwards a small flight from two till night; but this is so inconsiderable that the bird-catchers usually take up their nets at noon.

It may also be observed that they always fly against the wind; and hence there is great contention amongst the bird-catchers who shall gain the leeward point. A gentle wind to the south-west produces the best sport. The bird-catcher generally carries with him five or six linnets (of which more are caught than of any other singing bird), two goldfinches, two greenfinches, one wood-lark, one redpoll, a yellow-hammer, titlark, and aberdavine or siskin, and perhaps a bullfinch; these are placed at small distances from the nets, in little cages. He is moreover provided with what are called flur-birds, which are placed within the nets, and are raised upon the flur, or gently lowered, as the wild birds are seen to approach them. The tìur is a movable perch, to which the tame bird is secured, and which, by means of a long cord, the bird-catcher can raise or depress at pleasure. The flur-birds generally consist of the linnet, the goldfinch, and the greenfinch, which are secured to the flur by what is called a brace. ^[1. A sort of bandage, formed of a slender silken string that is fastened round the bird’s body, and under the wings. ]

It having been found that there is a difference between bird and bird, from the one being more in song than the other, the bird-catchers contrive that their call-birds should moult before the usual time. They therefore, in June or July, put them into a close box under two or three folds of blankets, in which state they continue about a month. The birds frequently die under this operation; and for this reason the value of a stopped bird rises greatly. When the bird has thus prematurely moulted, he is in song whilst the wild birds are out of song, and his note is louder and more piercing than theirs; his plumage also is said to be equally improved. The black and yellow in the wings of the goldfinch, for example, become deeper and more vivid, and exhibit a beautiful gloss. In short, according to the bird-fanciers, there is as much difference between a wild and a stopped bird, as there is between a horse which is kept in body-clothes and one at grass.

WΙιen the bird-catcher has laid his nets, he disposes of his call-birds at proper intervals. Their sight and hearing infinitely excel that of the bird-catcher; and the instant that the wild birds are perceived, notice is given by one of the call-birds, which seem to anticipate with pleasure the expected capture of their fellows. The call-birds, while the wild ones are at a distance, do not sing as birds do in a chamber; they invite them by what the bird-catchers call shortjerhs, which, when the birds are good, maybe heard at a great distance. The power of this inviting call is so great, that the wild bird is stopped in its course of flight; and, if not already acquainted with the nets,^[2. A bird acquainted with the nets is by the bird-catchers termed a sharper; and this they endeavour to drive away, as they can have no sport whilst it continues near them. ] lights boldly within twenty yards of perhaps three or four bird-catchers, on a spot which otherwise it would not have taken the least notice of. Nay, it frequently happens, that if half a flock only are caught, the remaining half will immediately afterwards light in the nets and share the same fate; and should only one bird escape, that bird will suffer itself to be pulled at till it is caught, such a fascinating power have the call-birds.

Bird-catchers frequently lay considerable wagers on the jerking capacities of their call-birds. They place them opposite to each other, by an inch of candle; and the bird who jerks the oftenest before the candle is burnt out wins the wager. We have been informed that there have been instances of a bird’s giving 170 jerks in a quarter of an hour; and we have known a linnet, in such a trial, persevere in its emulation till it swooned from the perch; thus, as Pliny says of the nightingale, victa morte flnit saepe vitam, spiritu prius deficiente quam cantu.

The females of the different species are usually killed, as incapable of song, and inferior in the beauty of their plumage. They are sold for threepence or fourpence a [7:4:647]dozen. These small birds are so good, that we are surprised the luxury of the age neglects so delicate an acquisition to the table. The modern Italians are fond of small birds, which they eat under the common name of heccafico; and the extravagant price paid by a Roman tragedian for one dish of singing birds is well known.^[3. Aesop, the actor, is said to have expended a sum equal to L.800 sterling on a single dish of singing birds. ] Another particular we learned, in conversation with a London bird-catcher, was the vast price that is sometimes given even for song-birds which have not learned to whistle tunes. The greatest sum we heard of was five guineas for a chaffinch that had a particular and uncommon note, under which it was intended to train others; and we also heard of five pounds ten shillings being given for a call-bird linnet. The male birds usually fly by themselves, and in that case their flight precedes that of the female. When the titlarks are caught in the beginning of the season, it frequently happens that forty are taken and not one female among them; and probably the same would be observed with regard to other birds (as has been done with relation to the wheatear), if they were attended to. An experienced and intelligent bird-catcher informed us, that such birds as breed twice a year generally have in their first brood a majority of males, and in their second of females, which may in part account for the circumstance above mentioned. It has been observed with regard to the bullfinch, that the female answers the purpose of a call-bird as well as the male.

The nightingale is not a bird of flight, in the sense in which the bird-catchers use this term. Like the red-breast, wren, and many other singing birds, it only moves from hedge to hedge, and does not take the periodical flights in October and March. The persons who catch these birds make use of small trap-nets, without call-birds; and they are considered as inferior in dignity to other bird-catchers, who will not rank with them. The arrival of the nightingale is expected by the trappers in the neighbourhood of London during the first week of April: at the beginning, none but cocks are taken; but in a few days the hens make their appearance, generally by themselves, though sometimes a few males come along with them. The latter are distinguished from the females not only by their superior size, but by a great swelling of their vent, which commences on the first arrival of the hens. They are caught in a net-trap, the bottom of which is surrounded with an iron ring; the net itself is rather larger than a cabbage net. When the trappers hear or see them, they strew some fresh mould under the place, and bait the trap with a mealworm from the baker’s shop. Ten or a dozen nightingales have been thus caught in a day.

The common way of taking larks, of which so many are used at our’tables, is in the night, with nets called trammels. These are usually made of thirty-six yards in length, and about six yards over, with six ribs of pack-thread, which at the ends are put upon two poles of about sixteen feet long, and made lesser at each end. The net is to be drawn over the ground by two men, and every five or six steps it is made to touch the ground, otherwise it will pass over the birds without touching them, and they yill escape. When they are felt to fly up against the net, 1 r l ls clapped down, and then all are safe that are under it. The darkest nights are most proper for this sport; and the net will not only take larks, but all other birds that roost on the ground; among which are woodcocks, snipes, parh'idges, quails, and several others. In the depth of winter people sometimes take great numbers of larks by nooses of horse-hair. The method is this: Take 100 or 200 yards 01 pack-thread; fasten at every six inches a noose, made of double horse-hair; at every twenty yards the line is to be pegged down to the ground, and so left ready to take them. The time to use this is when the ground is covered with snow, and the larks are to be allured to it by some white oats scattered all the way among the nooses. They must be taken away as soon as three or four are hung, otherwise the rest will be frightened; but though the others are scared away just where the sportsman comes, they will be feeding at the other end of the line, and the sport may be thus continued for a long time. Those caught in the day are taken in clap-nets, of fifteen yards in length and two and a half in breadth; and are enticed within the reach by means of bits of looking-glass, fixed in a piece of wood, and placed in the middle of the nets, which are put in a quick whirling motion by a string which the larker commands; he also makes use of a decoy lark. These nets are used only till the 14th November; for the larks will not dare to frolic in the air, except in fine sunny weather, and of course cannot be inveigled into the snare. When the weather grows gloomy, the larker changes his engine, and makes use of a trammel-net, twenty-seven or twenty-eight feet long, and five broad, which is put on two poles, eighteen feet long, and carried by men under each arm, who pass over the fields and quarter the ground as a setting dog. When they hear or feel a lark hit the net, they drop it down, and so the birds are taken.

A singular species of bird-catching is practised on the holm of Noss, a vast rock severed from the Isle of Noss by some unknown convulsion, and only about sixteen fathoms distant. It is of the same stupendous height as the opposite precipice, with a raging sea between. An adventurous climber reaches the rock in a boat, gains the height, and fastens several stakes on the small portion of earth which is to be found on the top; corresponding stakes are also placed on the edge of· the opposite cliffs. A rope is fixed to the stakes on both sides, along which a machine, called a cradle, is contrived to slide; and, by the help of a small parallel cord fastened in like manner, the adventurer pulls himself over, and returns with his booty.

The manner of bird-catching in the Feroe Islands is also extremely hazardous. The cliffs which contain the objects of their search are often two hundred fathoms in height, and are attempted both from above and below. In the first case, the fowlers provide themselves with a rope eighty or a hundred fathoms in length. The fowler fastens one end about his’waist and between his legs, recommends himself to the protection of the Almighty, and is lowered down by six others, who place a piece of timber on the margin of the rock, to preserve the rope from wearing against the sharp edge. They have, besides, a small line fastened to the body of the adventurer, by which he gives signals that they may lower or raise him, or shift him from place to place. The last operation is attended with great danger, by the loosening of the stones, which often fall on his head, and would infallibly destroy him, were he not protected by a strong thick cap; but even that is found unequal to save him against the weight of the larger fragments of rock. The dexterity of the fowlers is amazing; they will place their feet against the front of the precipice, and dart themselves some fathoms from it, with a cool eye survey the places where the birds nestle, and again shoot into their haunts. In some places the birds lodge in deep recesses. The fowler will alight there, disengage himself from the rope, fix it to a stone, and at his leisure collect the booty, fasten it to his girdle, and resume his pendulous seat. At times he will again [7:4:648]spring from the rock, and in that attitude, with a fowling-net placed at the end of a staff, catch the old birds which are flying to and from their retreats. When he has finished his dreadful employ, he gives a signal to his friends above, who pull him up, and share the hard-earned spoils. The feathers are preserved for exportation: the flesh is partly eaten fresh, but the greater portion is dried for winter’s provision.

The fowling from below has its share of danger. The party goes on the expedition in a boat; and when it has attained the base of the precipice, one of the most daring, having fastened a rope about his waist, and furnished himself with a long pole with an iron hook at one and, either climbs, or is thrust up by his companions, who place a pole under his breech, to the first station. He, by means of the rope, brings up one of the boat’s crew; the rest are drawn up in the same manner, and each is furnished with his rope and fowling staff. They then continue their progress upwards in the same manner, till they arrive at the region of birds; and wander about the face of the cliff in search of them. They then act in pairs; one fastens himself to the end of his associate’s rope, and in places where birds have nestled beneath his footing, he permits himself to be lowered down, depending for his security on the strength of his companion, who has to haul him up again; but it sometimes happens that the person above is overpowered by the weight, and both inevitably perish. They fling the fowl into the boat, which attends their motions, and receives the booty. They often pass seven or eight days in this tremendous employ, and lodge in the crannies which they find in the face of the precipice.

In some remote parts of Russia there is practised a singular invention for taking great quantities of gelinottes, which are a species of grouse. They choose the most open places in the birch woods; and there they plant long forks in the earth, opposite to the larger trees. On these forks is laid a horizontal stick, gallows-wisc, to which are tied small bundles of ears of corn. At a short distance from this part of the contrivance is a kind of large funnel or inverted cone, made with long birch-twigs, thin and flexible, the lower extremities of which are stuck in the earth, very near to one another, but, by spreading towards the top, form there an opening of above a yard in diameter. In this opening is placed a wheel made of two circles that intersect each other, and are surrounded with straw and ears of corn. This wheel turns on an axis fastened to the side of the funnel in such a manner that there is room enough between the sticks of the cone and the circles to admit of the wheel’s turning freely about. The birds first perch upon the transverse stick near the tree; and when they have a mind to fall upon the corn tied to the wheel, they must necessarily stand upon one of the projecting parts of the circles of which it is composed. At that instant the wheel turns, and the gelinotte falls, head foremost, to the bottom of the trap, which is there so contracted that he cannot get out. By these means the fowler sometimes finds the machine half-full of gelinottes.

The following method of netting or catching wild pigeons is eagerly pursued as a diversion in different parts of Italy, particularly by the inhabitants of Cava, and is thus described by Mr Swinburne. The people “assemble in parties; and if any stranger chances to stray to their rendezvous, they give him a most cordial welcome. I am not in the least surprised,” says Mr Swinburne, “at their passionate fondness for this sport, as* I found it extremely bewitching, keeping the attention constantly alive, and the springs of the mind pleasingly agitated by expectation; the situations where the toils are spread are incomparably beautiful, the air is pure and balsamic, and every thing around breathes health and satisfaction. When the' periodical flights of stock-doves return from the northern and western parts of Europe to gain warmer regions for their winter abode, the fowler repairs to the mountain and spreads his nets across the intermediate hollows, the passes through which the birds direct their course, to avoid unnecessary elevation in their flight. These nets are hung upon a row of large trees planted for the purpose. The branches being very thick and close at top, and the pole lofty and bare, a great opening is left below for the toils, which reach to the ground, and, by means of pulleys, fall in a heap with the least effort. Sometimes they are extended upon poles that exceed the height of the trees. At a small distance is a lofty circular turret, like a column with a little capital or cap, upon which a man is stationed to watch the approach of the game. As he commands a free view over all the country, and practice has made his sight as acute as that of the lynx, he descries the birds at a wonderful distance. The doves advance with great velocity; but the alert watchman is prepared for them; and just as they approach his post, hurls a stone above them with a sling. Upon this the whole flock, whose fears have birds of prey for their great object, supposing the stone to be an enemy of that kind ready to pounce them, dart down like lightning to avoid the blow by passing under the trees; but there they rush into the jaws of death, by dashing against the net, which instantly drops, and so entangles them thatnot one of them can escape the active hands of the fowler. These birds are sometimes taken by dozens at one fall, and are accounted fine eating. The dexterity with which the slingers manage their weapon is very remarkable; they throw the stone to a great height without any violent effort, and even without whirling the sling round before they discharge the pellet. In the Pyrenncan mountains, where the same diversion is followed, the watchmen use a bow and arrow, trimmed with the feathers of a hawk.”

The methods employed for the capture of water-fowl will be found described under the word Decoy. EiRD-Lime, a viscid substance, prepared in different ways. The most common bird-lime is made from hollybark, boiled ten or twelve hours; when the green coat being separated from the other, it is covered up for a fortnight in a moist place; then pounded into a tough paste, so that no fibres of the wood are discernible, and washed in a running stream till no motes appear. It is next put up to ferment for four or five days, and skimmed as often as any thing rises to the surface. To prepare it for use, a third part of nut-oil, or thin grease, must be incorporated with it over the fire.

The juice of holly-bark is a very peculiar substance. But if trials were made, it seems probable that many other juices would be found to have the same clammy nature. The misletoc affords a juice even superior to that of the holly; and if a young shoot of the common alder be cut through there will issue a stringy juice capable of being drawn out into threads, and which will follow the knife like bird-lime or the juice of the holly. In this tree it seems to be lodged, not in the bark, but in certain vessels just within the circle of the wood. The roots of all the hyacintl also afford a tough and stringy juice of the same kind; and so does the asphodel, the narcissus, and the black bryony root, in a surprising quantity 7 .

When twigs, smeared with bird-lime, are to be pul in places subject to wet, the common bird-lime is apt to have its force soon taken away. It is necessary, therefore, to have recourse to a particular sort, which, from its property of bearing water unhurt, is called water bird-ln∣^ and is prepared thus: Take a pound of strong and goo bird-lime; wash it thoroughly in spring-water, till tιe [7:4:649]hardness is all removed; and then beat it well, that the water may be separated. When it is dry put it into an earthen pot, and add to it as much capon’s grease as will make it run. Then add two spoonfuls of strong vinegar, one spoonful of oil, and a small quantity of Venice turpentine. Let the whole boil for some minutes over a moderate fire, stirring it all the time. Whenever it is required for use it ought to be warmed again. This is the best sort of bird-lime for snipes and other birds that love wet places.

The most successful method of using the common birdlime is this: Cut down the main branch or bough of any bushy tree whose twigs are thick, straight, long, and smooth, and have neither knots nor prickles. The willow and the birch-tree afford the best of this kind. Let all the superfluous shoots be trimmed off, and the twigs all made neat and clean; they must all be well covered with the bird-lime, within four inches of the bottom; but the main bough from which they grow must not be touched with the lime. No part of the bark where the lime should come must be left bare; but it is a nice matter to lay it on properly; for if it be too thick it will give the birds a distaste, and they will not come near it; and if there be too little of it, it will not hold them when they are there. When the bush is thus prepared, it may be set up wherever birds have been observed to congregate. If it be used in summer, it may be placed in the midst of a quickset hedge, or in groves, bushes, or white thorn trees, near fields of corn, hemp, flax, and the like; and in the winter the proper places are about stacks of corn, cottages, barns, and such situations. When the lime-bush is thus planted, the sportsman must stand as near it as he can without being discovered; and if he can imitate the natural calls of different species, his chances of success will be so much the greater. When one bird is thus enticed to the bush, and hung fast, the business of the sportsman is not to run up to take it, but to be patient; for it will hang itself more fast by its struggling to get away; and its fluttering will bring more to the bush, so that several maybe taken together. The best time of the day for this sport is from sunrise to ten o’clock, and from one to sunset. Another very good method of bringing the birds together is by a stale: a bat makes a very good stale; but it must be fastened so as to be in sight at a distance. An owl is a still better stale; for this bird never goes abroad but it is followed by all the small birds in the neighbourhood. They will gather together in great numbers about it; and having no convenient place to sit on but the lime-bush, will be taken in great numbers. If a living owl or bat is not to be had, a stuffed or preserved skin will serve the purpose. Some have even used the image of an owl carved in wood, and painted in the natural colours.

Birds, in Heraldry, according to their several kinds, represent either the contemplative or active life. They are the emblems of liberty, expedition, readiness, swiftness, and the like, and are therefore more honourable bearings than fishes. Birds must be borne in cóat-armour, as is ⅛> es t fitting the propriety of their natural actions. Such as are either whole-footed, or have their feet divided, and yet have no talons, are said to be membered; but the cock, and all birds of prey with sharp and hooked beaks and talons for encounter or defence, are said to be armed. In the blazoning of birds, if their wings be not displayed, they are said to be borne close.

BiRDs∙Nests, mCommerce, the nests of a small Indian swal-θ w ) of delicate taste, and frequently mixed among soups. In the sea-coasts of China, at certain seasons of the year, there are seen vast numbers of these birds. They leave he inland country at their breeding time, come to build ln the rocks, and fashion their nests out of a matter which they find on the shore, washed thither by the waves. The nature of this substance is scarcely yet ascertained. According to Kempfer, it is molluseae or sea-worms; according to M. le Poivre, fish-spawn; according to Dalrymple, sea-weeds; and according to Linnaeus, it is the animal substance frequently found on the beach, which fishermen call blubbers or jellies. The nests are of a hemispherical figure, and of the size of a goose’s egg, and in substance much resemble ichthyocolla or isinglass. The Chinese gather these nests, and sell them to all parts of the world; they dissolve in broths, and make a kind of jelly of a very agreeable flavour.

These nests, Mr Marsden informs us, are found in great abundance in the island of Sumatra, particularly about Croe, near the south end of the island. Four miles up the river of that name is a large cave, where the birds build in vast numbers. The nests are distinguished into white and black; but of these the former are more scarce and valuable, being found in the proportion of only one to twenty-five. “The white sort,” says Mr Marsden, “sells in China at the rate of 1000 to 1500 Spanish dollars the pecul; the black is usually disposed of at Batavia for about twenty dollars the same weight, where it is chiefly converted into glue, of which it makes a very superior kind. The difference between the two has by some been supposed to be owing to the mixture of the feathers of the birds with the viscous substance of which the nests are formed; and this they deduce from the experiment of steeping the black nests for a short time in hot water, when they are said to become in a great degree white. Among the natives I have heard a few assert that they are the work of a different species of bird. It was suggested to me that the white might probably be the recent nests in which they were taken; and the black, such as have been used for a number of years successively. This opinion appearing plausible, I was particular in my inquiries as to that point, and learned what seemed much to corroborate it. When the natives prepare to take the nests, they enter the caves with torches, and forming ladders, according to the usual mode, of a single bamboo notched, they ascend and pull down the nests, which adhere in numbers together, from the side and top of the rock. They informed me that the more frequently and regularly the cave is stripped, the greater proportion of white nests they are sure to find, and that on this experience they often make a practice of beating down and destroying the old nests in larger quantities than they trouble themselves to carry away, in order that they may find white nests the next season in their room. The birds during the building time are seen in large flocks on the beach, collecting in their bills the foam which is thrown up by the surf, of which there is little doubt but they construct their nests, after it has undergone perhaps a preparation, from a commixture with their saliva, or other secretion with which nature has provided them for that purpose.”
