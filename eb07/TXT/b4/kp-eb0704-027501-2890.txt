BACKER, or Bakker, Jacob, portrait and historical painter, was born at Harlingen in 1609, but spent the greater part of his life at Amsterdam. He is mentioned as a skilful painter, particularly of portraits, which he executed with boldness, spirit, and grace. He was remarkable for an uncommon readiness of hand and freedom of pencil; while his incredible expedition in his manner of painting appeared even in a half-length portrait of a lady from Haerlem, which was begun and finished in one day, although he adorned the figure with rich drapery and several ornamental jewels. He also painted historical subjects with considerable success; and in that style there is a picture by him of Cimon and Iphigenia, which is accounted an excellent performance. He died in 1651.
