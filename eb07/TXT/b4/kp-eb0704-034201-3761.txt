BANDALEER, or Bandelier, in military affairs, a large leathern belt, thrown over the right shoulder, and hanging under the left arm. It was worn by the ancient musketeers, both for sustaining their fire-arms, and for the carriage of their musket charges, which, being put up in little wooden cases coated with leather, were hung, to the number of twelve, to each bandaleer.
