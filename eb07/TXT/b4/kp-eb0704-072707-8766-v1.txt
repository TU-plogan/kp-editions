BOeOTIA, the name of two ancient kingdoms, one of which was founded, or rather restored, by Cadmus, and named by him Boeotia, from the ox which is said to have directed him to the place where he built the capital of his new kingdom, better known afterwards by the name of Thebes. The other Boeotia was in Thessaly, and is said to have been founded by Boeotus, the son of Neptune by Arne the daughter of Aeolus king of Aeolis. According to the fable or tradition, the king sent his daughter to Metapontum, a city of Italy, where she was delivered of two sons, the elder of whom she called Aeolus, after her father, and the younger Boeotus. Aeolus possessed himself of the islands in the Tyrrhenian, now the Tuscan, Sea, and built the city of Lipara. Boeotus, the younger son, went to his grandfather, and succeeding him in his kingdom, called it after his own name, and the capital city Arne, from his mother. All that we know of these Boeotians is, that they [7:4:728] .held this settlement upwards of two centuries, and that the Thessalians expelled them from it; upon which they came and took possession of the country till then called Cadmeis, and gave it the name of Eoeotia. Diodorus and Homer tell us that these Boeotians signalized themselves in the Trojan war; and the latter adds, that five of Boeotus’s grandsons, Peneleus, Leitus, Prothoenor, Arcesilaus, and Clonius, were the chiefs who led the Boeotian troops thither. ∙
