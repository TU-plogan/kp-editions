BAUCIS, in fabulous history, an old woman who lived with Philemon her husband in a cottage in Phrygia. Jupiter and Mercury happening to travel in that country, were well received by this venerable pair after having been refused entertainment by every body else. To punish the people for their inhumanity, the two gods laid the country under water, but removed Baucis and Philemon to the top of a mountain, where they saw the deluge, and their own little hut above the waters turned into a temple. Here the grateful gods promised to confer on their entertainers whatever boon the latter might solicit; in consequence of which they expressed a desire to officiate in this temple as'priest and priestess, and also to die together; both of which requests were granted.
