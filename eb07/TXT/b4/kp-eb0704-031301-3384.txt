BALASORE, a seaport of Hindostan, in the province of Orissa. It is built along the banks of the Boorce Bel-laun river, where the stream is not navigable for vessels of greater burden than 100 tons, and these can only get over the bar at spring tides. The English, Dutch, and Portuguese formerly had factories at Balasore, which was once famed for a manufactory of fine cotton cloths. The English factory was burnt down in November 1688, when, on account of a rupture with Aurungzebe, Captain Heath attacked and plundered the town. The companyâ€™s servants were at that time carried up the country, and it does not appear that they were ever released. This town was ceded to the Mahrattas in 1751, but was given up to the

English by the Nagpoor rajah at the conclusion of the peace in 1803. The navigation of the Ganges to Calcutta being extremely dangerous, and requiring skilful pilots, it is in Balasore roads that those who undertake that service wait the arrival of vessels. It is 110 miles south-w est from Calcutta. Long. 87. 13. E. Lat. 21. 31. N.
