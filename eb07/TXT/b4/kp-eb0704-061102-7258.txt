BIAEUM, β∣aιοv, in Rhetoric, denotes a kind of counterargument, by which something alleged for the adversary is retorted against him, and made to conclude a different way: for instance, Occidisti, quia adstitisti interfecto. B∕a∕οv, Immo quia adstiti interfecto, non occidi; nam si id esset, in fugam me conjecissem. “You killed the person, because you were found standing by his body. Biaeum, Rather, I did not kill him because I was found standing by his body; because, in that case, I should have fled.”

Biaeum, in the Grecian laws, was an action brought against those who had committed rape or used violence to the person of any one.
