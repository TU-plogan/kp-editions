BERNE, one of the largest cantons of the Swiss confederation. It extends over 3690 square miles, a great part of which surface is too mountainous to be habitable. Some of the most lofty elevatiôns of the Alps are within the canton, among which are the Finsterahorn, 13,234 feet; the Jungfrau, 12,S72 feet; the Monk, 12,606 feet; the Schreckhorn, 12,560 feet; the Eiger, 12,268 feet; the 1 Wetterhorn, 11,453 feet; the Al tels, 11,430 feet; and the Doldenhorn, 11,287 feet. The summits of these mountains are covered with snow throughout the whole year. There are numerous other mountains, varying in height from 4000 to 8000 feet, free from snow during only the short space of the few hottest months of the year. There are also several internal lakes, some of them at the height of from 1200 to 1800 feet above the level of the sea. The chief river is the Aar, which receives the water from the other streams, as well as the melted snows. It is navigable, but, owing to its rapidity, the navigation is dangerous and uncertain. In the northern part of the canton the cultivation is good, and enough of corn and wine is produced to satisfy the wants of the inhabitants. The mountainous districts feed cows and sheep, and the produce of the dairies is abundant. There are some manufactures of linen, and in one district some watch-making; there is also some little pillow-lace still made, but no other manufacture. The chief imports from other countries are salt and colonial articles. The government is conducted by two councils, which are chiefly influenced by the aristocracy of the capital. The number of the inhabitants is about 330,000, of whom three fourths adhere to the reformed or Calvinistic confession; there are near 40,000 Catholics, with several Lutherans, Anabaptists, and other Christian sects, together with some Jews. The armed contingent of the canton is 5824, but the adult male population form also a militia force. It is subdivided into four bailiwicks, of which the capital forms one, the six largest towns another, the five smaller towns a third, and the ancient bailiwicks a fourth.

Berne, the capital of the canton of the same name, in Switzerland. It stands on a peninsula formed by the river Aar. It is well built, and, from being on a declivity, has a pleasing appearance, which is increased by the country houses in its vicinity being surrounded by verdant lawns. It contains about 14,000 inhabitants, including the suburbs. There are some manufactures carried on in linen and cotton, and some smaller establishments for providing articles for local and domestic use. The climate is severely cold in winter, the city being elevated near 1800 feet above the level of the sea. It is in loner. 7. 20. 25. E. lat. 46. 56. 55.

• k∙ERNER j T Berneray, or Barnera, an island within the island of Lewis, on its western side. Loch Bernera, Loch Burglow, and Loch Roag, inlets of the sea, inclose a piece of beautiful fertile land, of about twelve miles in length by four in breadth; and this is called the island of Bernera. The above arms of the sea are crowded with small islands, one of which is called Little Bernera, and indents the main-land of Lewis with long saltwater lochs. On the Great Bernera there exists a tolerably entire circle of large upright stones, similar to those of Stonehenge, and supposed to be of druidical origin. There are also two other islands of the same name; one in the Sound of Harris, about five miles in circumference, which is fertile, and contains the ruins of two chapels, severally dedicated to St Asaph and St Columbus; the other is the most southerly of the Hebrides, and is small and rocky.
