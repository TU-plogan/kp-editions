BONA, a considerable sea-port of the territory of Algiers, in the province of Constantina, called by the Arabs Bleid-el-Anet. It appears to be about a mile distant from the ancient Hippo, the ruins of which, consisting of broken walls and cisterns, cover a considerable extent of ground. It has two good harbours, though from neglect they are becoming less commodious. The French African Company once carried on a considerable trade here, exporting in one year wool, wax, hides, and grain, to the value of L.28,500. Britain, during the last war, by her naval superiority, compelled that company to give up their settlement, and obtained to herself the cession of Bona, with some other towns; but she never formed any establishment here, and the claim seems now to have become obsolete. In the vicinity of Bona are extensive coral banks, the seat of an important fishery, chiefly carried on by vessels from Naples, Genoa, and other parts of Italy, who have generally been allowed to prosecute it without molestation. In 1816, however, the Algerines, irritated by the interposition of the English against the capture of slaves, suddenly attacked a number of crews employed in this fishery, and committed a most barbarous massacre of them. This outrage, however, immediately called forth the expedition under Lord Exmouth, the triumphant issue of which prevented for a time the repetition of any similar violence. Bona is sixty-six miles north-north-east of Constantina, in long. 7. 45. E. lat. 36. 52. N.

Bona Dea, in Pagan Mythology, one of the names of Cybele. According to some, she was a Roman lady, the wife of one Faunus, and so famous for her chastity that after her death she was deified. Her sacrifices were performed only by matrons, and in so secret a manner that it was death for any man to intrude himself into the assembly. Cicero reproaches Clodius with having entered this temple disguised as a singing woman, and by his presence polluted the mysteries of the Bona Dea. What kind of mysteries these were, we learn incidentally from Juvenal, sat. vi. 313, where the horrid abominations practised in them are very significantly pointed at.

Dona Eides, in Law. When a person performs any action which he believes at the time to be just and lawful, he is said to have acted in bona fide. Bona Mobilia, the same with movable effects or goods.

EONA Notabilia are such goods as a person dying has in another diocese than that in which he dies, amounting [7:4:767]to the value of five pounds at least; in which case the will of the deceased must be proved, or administration granted, in the court of the archbishop of the province, unless, by composition or custom, any dioceses are authorized to do it, when rated at a greater sum.

Bona Vacantia, goods, such as royal-fish, shipwrecks, treasure-trove, waifs, and estrays, in which no one can claim a property.
