BASKERVILLE, Johk, an eminent artist of the eighteenth century, especially in letter-founding and in printing. He was born in 1706, at Wolverley in Worcestershire, and was heir to an estate of about L.60 a year, the whole of which income he allowed to his parents during their lives. In his early years he conceived a love for caligraphy and cutting in stone; and being brought up to no particular profession, he commenced writingmaster in Birmingham when about twenty years of age. Here the improvements made in different manufactures soon drew his attention, and he applied to the business of japanning, which he carried on for a long time with distinguished excellence and success. In 1750 he turned his attention to letter-founding, which he brought to great perfection at the cost of much labour and expense; and in a few years proceeded to printing. His first work ŵäs an edition of Virgil in royal quarto, which is now in great request. Soon after this the university of Cambridge granted him permission to print a Bible in royal folio, and editions of the Common Prayer in three sizes; a privilege for which he paid a considerable sum to the university. He afterwards printed Horace, Terence, Catullus, Lucretius, Juvenal, Sallust, and Florus, in royal quarto; Virgil in octavo; and several books in duodecimo. He likewise published some of the English classics. The best testimonies to the merit of these performances are to be found in the books themselves, which are admirable specimens of typography; and indeed Mr Baskerville is deservedly ranked among those who, in modern times, have brought the art of printing to its greatest perfection. Not having met with that encouragement which he expected from the booksellers, he set up his letter foundery for sale a [7:4:428] little before his death, which took place in July 1775. He left no issue.
