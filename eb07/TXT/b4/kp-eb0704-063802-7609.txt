BIGGAR, a town and parish of Scotland, in the county of Lanark. The town is small, but the main street, though irregular, is broad and spacious. The only building worthy of notice is the church, which was collegiate, and founded by Malcolm Lord Fleming in 1545, who liberally endowed it. In the parish are to be seen the vestiges of three Roman camps and a large tumulus. The remains of Biggar castle are situated in a bog about a quarter of a mile south of the town. It is distant from Edinburgh twenty-seven miles south-west.
