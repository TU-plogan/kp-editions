BEAD, a small globule or ball used in necklaces, and made of different materials, as pearl, steel, garnet, coral, diamond, amber, crystal, pastes, glass. The Romanists make great use of beads in rehearsing their Ave-Mαriαs and Pater-nοsters; and a similar custom obtains among the religious orders throughout the East, as well Mahommedan as heathen.

Glass beads were used by the Spaniards to barter with the natives of South America for gold; and to this day they are a favourite article of traffic with all savage nations. Sir William Beechy made considerable use of them during his visit to Behring’s Straits in 1828.

ΒΕΑΏ-Proof, a term used by our distillers to express that sort of proof of the standard strength of spirituous liquors which consists in their exhibiting, when shaken in a phial or poured into a glass, a crown of bubbles on the surface for some time thereafter. This, however, is a fallacious rule as to the degree of strength, because any thing that increases the tenacity of the spirit will give it this proof, although it be under the due strength.

Bead- Roll, among Catholics, a list of those persons for the rest of whose souls they are obliged to repeat a certain number of prayers, which they count by means of their beads.
