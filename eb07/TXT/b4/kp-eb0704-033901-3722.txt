BAMBURG, a city of the circle of Upper Maine, in the kingdom of Bavaria, which gives its name to a magistracy. It was formerly under a sovereign bishop, but secularized by the revolution in France. It stands on the Regnitz, in a beautiful situation, surrounded with vineyards and gardens. Like all the ecclesiastical cities, it abounds in religious edifices of some antiquity. The present number of churches is twenty-five, besides the cathedral and fifteen chapels. It has become a place of consideration from its trade, which is assisted by the improved navigation of the Regnitz, and by the manufactures, which have recently been much extended. These consist of linen and woollen cloths, of numerous breweries and distilleries, of leather of all kinds, and of various smaller wares. The inhabitants of the city in 1827 amounted to 20,500, chiefly Catholics. The magistracy extends over sixty-seven square miles, and contains, besides those in the city, a population of 8780 individuals. The city is in long. 11. 48. 16. E. lat. 49. 53. 31. N.
