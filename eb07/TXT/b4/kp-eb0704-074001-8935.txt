It is the capital of a district, and the residence of a governor, and contains numerous public edifices, though nowise remarkable in their structure. In the vicinity abundance of ancient ruins are to be seen, and many marble fragments with Greek inscriptions. The country around is fertile; and in the neighbourhood is an extensive forest, which supplies Constantinople with a great quantity of wood. Boli is 140

miles east of Constantinople. Long. 31. 20. E. Lat. 41. 30. N.
