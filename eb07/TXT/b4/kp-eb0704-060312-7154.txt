BETLIS, a town of Armenia, in Kurdistan, situated in a fine and highly-cultivated valley, producing fruit, grain, and honey. Here the Armenians have four churches and as many monasteries, and they enjoy more courteous treatment than usually falls to their lot in Mahommedan countries. The houses are scattered over the valley, through which runs an extremely narrow road. The castle is situated on an eminence, so steep on all sides that it is only accessible by a road winding round it. Betlis is an ancient city, founded, according to the Armenians, by Alexander the Great. The population of the town and neighbourhood is computed at 26.000 Kurds, Turks, Armenians, and Syrians. Long. 42. 31. E. Lat. 37. 45. N.
