BERGAMO, a province, or, as it is usually termed, a delegation, of the Austrian kingdom of Lombardy. It is bounded on the north by the delegation of Sondrio, on the east by those of Tyrol and Brescia, on the south by Lodi, and on the west by Milan and Como. The extent is about 1615 square miles, or 1,033,600 acres. It is divided into 18 districts, and these into 372 communes or parishes, and comprehends one city, 22 market-towns, and 333 villages, with 44,860 houses. By the last precise census in

1816 and 1817, the number of inhabitants was 307,815; but by subsequent accounts, the particulars of which have not yet been published, the population appears to have increased at a prodigious rate.

The whole northern part of the delegation, which comprehends more than half, is filled with the Alpine mountains, whose spurs extend to the capital; but the southern division forms part of the plain of Lombardy. The country is deficient in corn; but the surplus of cattle, with iron from the mines in the northern part, and the silk produced in the southern, are exchanged for what grain is required by the inhabitants. Besides those of silk, there are manufactures of woollen goods. There are some quarries of marble, and of other kinds of stone, from which many grindstones and whetstones are cut out and prepared for exportation.

, The capital of the province is the city of the same name, laid out on several elevations in an amphitheatrical form, surrounded with walls and ditches, and defended by two insignificant forts. It is the see of a bishop, and of the provincial courts of law; and comprehends, besides the cathedral, fourteen churches, four hospitals, six orphan-houses, a lombard, and several other good edifices. It contains, including the suburbs, about 40,000 inhabitants, a great proportion of whom are occupied in the various branches of the silk manufacture, and some in making cloth and iron wares. The annual fair contributes much to the trade of the city. Bergamo gave birth to Tasso the poet, who died in 1569. Long. 9. 34. 21. E. Lat. 45. 41. 15. N.
