BEATER, in manufactures, is applied to divers sorts of workmen, whose business it is to hammer or flatten certain materials, particularly metals.

Gold-B eaters are artizans, who, by beating with a hammer, on a marble, gold and silver in moulds of vellum and bullocksâ€™ guts, reduce them to thin leaves fit for gilding or silvering copper, iron, steel, wood, and other materials. Gold-beaters differ from flatteners of gold or silver; for the former bring their metal into leaves by the hammer, whereas the latter only flatten it by pressing it through a mill preparatory to beating.

There are also Tin-BEATERS employed in the lookingglass trade, whose business it is to beat tin on large blocks of marble till it be reduced to thin leaves fit to be applied with quicksilver in preparing looking-glasses.
