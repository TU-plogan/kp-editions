BAJALUKA, a city, the capital of a sandschak or province of Bosnia, in Turkey in Europe. It stands on the river Berbas, and is strongly fortified with a citadel, being the frontier garrison towards Austria. It contains 2700 houses, forty mosques, and, with the suburbs, which are chiefly occupied by Greeks, 15,000 inhabitants. It is a place of considerable traffic and manufactures. Among the latter, gunpowder is the most productive. Near it are some celebrated warm medicinal springs.
