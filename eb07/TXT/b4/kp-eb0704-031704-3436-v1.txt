BALFROOSH, a large commercial town of Persia, in the province of Mazanderan, about twelve miles distant from the southern shore of the Caspian Sea. It is built in a low, swampy, though rich country; and, from the deep and. almost impassable roads which lead to it, seems not at all favourably situated for the seat of an extensive inland trade. It is, however, purely a mercantile city, being peopled entirely by merchants, mechanics, and their dependants; and is wholly indebted for its present size and importance to its commercial prosperity. The town is of a very peculiar structure and aspect. It is placed in the midst of a forest of tall trees, by which the buildings are so separated from one another, and so concealed, that except in the bazars it has no appearance of a populous town. The streets are broad and neat, though generally unpaved; and they are kept in good order. No ruins are to be seen, as in other Persian towns; the houses are comfortable, in good repair, and roofed with tiles, and they are inclosed by substantial walls; and, according to Fraser, by whom it was visited in 1822, it had a plain and simple air of plenty, ease, and comfort, attended with a bustle and show of business which is rarely to be seen in the Persian towns. There are no public buildings of any importance. The only place.s of interest are the bazars, which extend fully a mile in length, and consist of substantially-built ranges of shops, covered with a roof of wood and tiles, and well stored with commodities. There are about ten principal caravanserais, several of which are attached to the bazar, and are let as warehouses for goods; and not less than thirty međressas or colleges, the place being as much celebrated for learning as for commerce. From a census lately taken by authority, Mr Fraser is of opinion that it contains 200,000 inhabitants. It is 20 miles west of Fehra-bad. Long. 32. 40. E. Lat. 35. 55. N.
