BERRETINI da Crotona, Pietro, historical and landscape painter, was born at Crotona in 1596, and, according to some writers, was a disciple of Andrea Commodi, though others affirm that he was the disciple of Baccio Ciarpi. He is allowed to have been of as great and enlarged a genius as most of his profession, and to have painted more agreeably than many of the artists who were his contemporaries. He went to Rome when young, and applied himself diligently to study the antiques and the works of Raphael, Buonarotti, and Polidoro, by which he improved both his taste and his hand, and distinguished himself above most artists of his time. He died in 1669. Some of his best works are in the Barberini palace at Rome, and the Palazzo Pitti at Florence.
