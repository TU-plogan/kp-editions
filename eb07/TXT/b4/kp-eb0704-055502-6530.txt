It is generally a hilly and mountainous country. The widest valley is that through which runs the river Piave, and which, with a few other much narrower ones, are tolerably fertile in rye, barley, oats, and buckwheat; while some parts yield a little wheat, much maize, and some flax and hemp. The mountains contain veins of iron, lead, copper, and vitriol; but the mines are all worked upon a very contracted scale. The inhabitants amounted in 1817 to 114,772, of whom 58,820 were males and 55,952 females.
