BLINDNESS, a privation of the sense of sight, arising from a want of the organs of vision, or an involuntary obstruction of their functions. See Blind. Total Blindness is that state in which all sight or perception even of light is wanting, as in the case of those who are said to be stone-blind.
[7:4:703]

Partial Blindness is that state in which some faint glimmering of sight is left, as is the case with those who have ripe cataracts, and who are never so blind but they can discover day from night.

Perpetual Blindness is that which remains alike under all the diversity of seasons, times, and ages.

Transient Blindness is that which in due time gives way of itself; as that of whelps, which continues for several days, sometimes nine, rarely twelve, after they are littered. The Nogais Tartars, according to Father Duban the Jesuit, who lived amongst them, are born blind, and open not their eyes till several days after birth.

Periodical Blindness is that which comes and goes by turns, according to the season of the moon, the time of day, and the like.

Diurnal Blindness is called hemeralopia. Nocturnal Blindness, called also nyctalopia, is that which ensues on the setting of the sun in persons who see perfectly in the day, but become quite blind as night approaches. (See Pliil. Trans. No. 159, p. 560; and a singular case related by Dr Samuel Pye in the Medical Observe and Inquir. vol. i. p. 111.)

Blindness in horses. See Farriery.
