BIGNON, Jerome, a French writer, was born at Paris in 1590. Under the care of his father he early acquired uncommon knowledge in philosophy, mathematics, history, civil law, and divinity; and had almost completed his studies at an age when it is usual to send children to school. At ten years of age he gave the public a specimen of his learning in a Description of the Holy Land; and two years after he published a Discourse concerning the principal antiquities and curiosities of Rome, and a summary Treatise concerning the election of popes. Henry IV. desired to see him, and appointed him page to the dauphin, who was afterwards Louis XIII. At this time he wrote a treatise on the precedency of the kings of France, which he dedicated to Henry IV., by whom he was ordered to continue his researches on the subject; but the death of that prince interrupted his design. In 1613 he published the Formuloe of Marculphus. In 1620 he was made advocate-general in the grand council, and discharged that post with such reputation, that the king nominated him some time afterwards counsellor of state, and at last advocate-general in the parliament. He resigned his offices in 1641, and the year following was appointed principal keeper of the kingâ€™s library; but he was obliged to resume his office of advocate-general, which he held till his death, which happened in 1656. He was a man of the most exemplary devotion, and had been employed in the most important affairs of state.
