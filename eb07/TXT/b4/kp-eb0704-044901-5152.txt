BATHYLLUS and PY z LADES, inventors of pantomimic entertainments on the stage. Bathyllus succeeded in representing comedy; Pylades in representing tragedy. Their art consisted in expressing the passions by gestures, attitudes, and dumb show; not, as in modern times, in machinery and the fooleries of Harlequin. They flourished at Rome, under Augustus, about a. d. 10.
