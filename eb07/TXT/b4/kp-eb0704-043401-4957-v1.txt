BASSETING, in the coal mines, denotes the rise of the vein of coal towards the surface of the earth, till it come within two or three feet of the surface itself. This is also called by the workmen cropping; and stands opposed to dipping, which is the descent of the vein to such a depth that it is rarely, if ever, followed to the end.

BASSO-relievo, or Bas-relief, a piece of sculpture, where the figures or images do not protuberate or stand out much above the plane on which they are formed. All figures or representations which are cut, stamped, or otherwise wrought, so that not the entire body, but only part of it, is raised above the plane, are said to be done in relief or relievo; and when the work is low, flat, and but little raised, it is called low relief. If a piece of sculpture, a coin, or a medal, has its figure raised so as to be well distinguished, it is called bold, and we say its relief is strong.
