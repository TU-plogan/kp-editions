BORGOO, a large kingdom in the interior of Africa, bounded on the east by the Niger, on the south by Eyeo or Yarriba, on the west by Dahomey, and on the south by Gourma. It is about thirty days’ journey in length and eleven in breadth. It has generally a level surface, though crossed by a considerable range of mountains. The soil is mostly fertile, and tolerably cultivated, producing in abundance corn, yams, plantains, and limes. The cattle are not numerous, but there is a copious supply of all the species of game that prevail in Africa. A considerable inland trade between Houssa and the coast passes through this territory. When Clapperton entered it from Ľyeo, he was warned to be on his guard, as the people were the greatest robbers and plunderers in all Africa, and he would run the risk of being stripped of every thing he possessed. He found this bad report altogether unjust, and declares, on quitting it, that the people had always behaved honestly, and never robbed him of the slightest article. They were cheerful, obliging, good-humoured, and communicative. The acts of robbery, too frequent in this country, were perpetrated by slaves of the chiefs and governors, who were natives, not of Borgoo, but of Houssa. These persons, in virtue of the service in which they are employed, think themselves entitled to pilfer whatever comes within their reach. The kingdom of Borgoo is divided into the four states of Boussa, Wawa, Kiama, and Niki, the three last of which were visited by Clapperton in his journey through interior Africa. Boussa, remarkable as the scene of the disastrous fate of Mr Park, holds the first rank, and all the others are considered as in a degree of dependence upon it.
