BELLEROPHON, in fabulous history, the son of Glaucus, king of Epirus. Happening accidentally to kill his brother, he fled to Proetus, king of Argos, who gave him a hospitable reception; but Sthenoboea, his queen, falling in love with the beautiful stranger, and finding that nothing could induce the latter to injure his benefactor, accused him to her husband of an attempt to violate her honour. Proetus, however, being unwilling to act contrary to the laws of hospitality, sent him to Iobates, king of Lysia, the father of Sthenoboea, with letters desiring him to be put to death; whence the proverb Bellerophontis literas affert, equivalent to Literae Urioe. On the receipt of these letters, the Lysian prince was celebrating a festival of nine days, which prevented Bellerophon’s destruction. In the meanwhile, however, Iobates sent him to subdue the Solymi, the Amazons, and Lysians; thinking doubtless to get rid of [7:4:554] him by exposure to the greatest dangers, without incurring the odium of direct murder: but the prudence and courage of Bellerophon disappointed this calculation, and he came off victorious. Iobates next employed him to destroy the Chimaera; when, in consideration of his innocence, Minerva, or,according toothers, Neptune, furnished him with the horse Pegasus, by the assistance of which he killed this monster. On his return, Iobates, convinced of his truth and integrity, and charmed with his heroic virtues, gave Bellerophon his daughter Philonoe in marriage, and declared him his successor in the kingdom; intelligence which drove Sthenoboea to despair and suicide. But Bellerophon grew vain of his prosperity, and resolving by the assistance of Pegasus to ascend the skies, Jupiter checked his presumption by striking him blind in his flight; on which he fell down to the earth, and wandered about till his death in contempt and misery, while Pegasus mounting into heaven, was placed by Jupiter among the constellations.
