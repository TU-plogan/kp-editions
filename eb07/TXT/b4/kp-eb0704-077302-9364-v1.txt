BONY, a kingdom in the island of Celebes, extending from the river Chinrana to the river Salenico, a length of about twenty leagues, along the western shore of the bay or gulf of Bony, which indents the northern shore of the island of Celebes to the depth of nearly 200 miles. This kingdom is of very ancient origin, and was formerly powerful and independent. On the banks of the Chinrana are numerous towns. The country produces gold, ricc, sago, cassia, tortoise-shell, pearls, &c. in which a considerable trade is carried on. In advancing farther into the gulf there are several other well-inhabited towns. Near the river Loo the inhabitants are skilful in boat-building; and farther on they have gold, abundance of sago, and also cassia and seed pearl. At the bottom of the bay the sago tree abounds; and there are here spots of foul ground on which they fish for the sca-slug or biche de mer, which they carry to Macassar, and sell to the Chinese who come thither in their junks to trade.

This, according to the accounts of travellers, is the original country of the Buggis, or Buggesses, who were formerly a very powerful people, and arc still remarkably ingenious, excelling in all kinds of curious filagree work in gold and silver; in weaving the striped and checked cotton cloths which are worn in all the Malay islands; in making matchlocks, firelocks, and all kinds of arms and accoutrements; and in building large prows and other vessels. This nation is placed at the head of all the eastern nations for courage, fidelity, and fair dealing in commerce. Their language is reckoned the root of all the various dialects and tongues which have overspread the Asiatic Archipelago. They became known to Europeans only when their empire began to decline.

The sovereigns of Bony are descended from an ancient lineage of kings, whose origin is unknown, and is believed by the Buggis to have been from heaven. In the beginning of the seventeenth century they were compelled to adopt the Mahommedan religion by the Macassars, whose enemies they were also bound to adopt. The country continued to be*ruled by its native sovereigns, and was frequently the scene of bloodshed and civil war, until it was subdued by the Dutch early in the eighteenth century. On the decline of the Dutch power in the East, the state of Bony again attained its independence, which it still retains.
