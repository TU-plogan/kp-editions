BALDWIN, archbishop of Canterbury, was born of obscure parents at Exeter, where, in the early part of his [7:4:316]life, he taught a grammar-school. After this he took orders, and was made archdeacon of Exeter; but he resigned that dignity, and became a Cistercian monk in the monastery of Ford in Devonshire, of which, in a few years, he was made abbot. In the year 1180 he was consecrated bishop of Worcester. In 1184 he was promoted to the see of Canterbury by Pope Lucius III., and by his successor Urban III. was appointed legate for that diocese. He laid the foundation of a church and monastery in honour of Thomas a Becket, at Hackington, near Canterbury, for secular priests; but being opposed by the monks of Canterbury and the pope, he was obliged to desist. In 1190 he crowned King Richard I. at Westminster, and soon after followed that prince to the Holy Land, where he died at the siege of Ptolemais or St Jean dâ€™Acre. Giraldus Cambrensis, who accompanied him in this expedition, says he was of a mild disposition, and practised great abstinence. He wrote various tracts on religious subjects, which were collected and published by Bertrand Tissier in 1662.
