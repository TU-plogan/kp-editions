BOMBUS, in Music, an artificial motion with the hands, imitating in cadence and harmony the buzzing of bees. The word is originally Greek, and signifies the buzz, boom, or noise of bees, gnats, and the like. In this sense the word is applied to describe a species of applause murmured or buzzed by ancient auditories.
