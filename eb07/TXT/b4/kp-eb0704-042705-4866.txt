BASILISK. See Reptilia, Index. Basilisk, in military affairs, a large piece of ordnance, so called from its supposed resemblance to the fabulous serpent of that name. The basilisk threw an iron ball of 200 pounds weight. It was much talked of in the time of Sultan Solyman, particularly during the wars of Hungary, but is now entirely out of use; unless, indeed, the name may still be applied to those enormous pieces of ordnance which the Turks have built into the ramparts of the castles on the Dardanelles, and which carry stone balls of from 200 to 300 pounds weight.
