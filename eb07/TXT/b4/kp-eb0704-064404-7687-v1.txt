BINGHAM, Joseph, a learned divine, born at Wakefield, in Yorkshire, in September 1668; educated at University College, Oxford; and afterwards presented by John Radcliffe, Μ. D. to the rectory of Headbournworthy, near Winchester. In this country retirement he began his laborious work entitled Origines Ecclesiastica!, or The Antiquities of the Christian Church, the first volume of which was published in 1708; and it was afterwards completed in nine volumes more. But notwithstanding his learning and merit, he had no other preferment than that of Headbournworthy till the year 1712, when he was collated to the rectory of Havant, near Portsmouth, by Sir Jonathan Trelawney, bishop of Winchester, to whom he dedicated several of his books. He died on the 17th August 1723, in the fifty-fifth year of his age.

Bingham, a market-town in the hundred of that name, of the county of Nottingham, 123 miles from London, and eight and a half from Nottingham. It is situated in the fertile valè of Belvoir, with a fine Gothic church, and a good market-place, in which a market is held on Thursday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1082, in 1811 to 1326, and in 1821 to 1574.
