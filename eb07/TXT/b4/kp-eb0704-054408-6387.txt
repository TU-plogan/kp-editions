BELIEVERS, an appellation given, towards the close of the first century, to those Christians who had been admitted into the church by baptism, and instructed in all the mysteries of religion. They were thus called in contradistinction to the catechumens, who had not been baptized, and were consequently debarred from the privileges of believers.
