BARBIERI, Giovanni Francesco, otherwise called Guercino dα Cento, an eminent historical painter, was born at Cento, a village not far from Bologna, in 1590. At first he was a disciple of Benedetto Gennari; but he afterwards studied for some time in the school of the Caracci, though he did not adopt the manner of that famous academy. He seemed to prefer the style of Caravaggio to that of Guido or Albano, imagining it impossible to imitate nature truly, without the assistance of strong lights and strong shadows; and on that principle the light was admitted into his atelier from above. His taste in design was natural, easy, and often grand, but without any extraordinary share of elevation, correctness, or elegance. Towards the decline of his life he observed that the clearer and brighter style of Guido and Albano had attracted the admiration of all Europe; and therefore he altered his manner, even against his own judgment. But he apologized for this conduct, by declaring, that formerly he had painted for fame and to please the judicious, but that now he painted to please the ignorant and enrich himself. He died in 1666. His best performance is the history of S. Petronilla, which is considered one of the ornaments of St Peter’s at Rome.

Barbieri, Paolo Antonio, da Cento, painter of still life and animals, was the brother of Guercino, and born at Cento in 1596. He chose for his subjects fruits, flowers, insects, and animals, which he painted after nature with a lively tint of colour, great tenderness of pencil, and a strong character of truth and life. He died in 1640.
