BARALIPTON, among logicians, a term denoting a syllogism of the first indirect mode of the first figure. Hence a syllogism in baralipton is when the first two propositions are universal affirmatives, the third a particular affirmative, and the middle term the subject in the first proposition, and the predicate in the second. For example, Ba. Every evil ought to be feared;

RA. Every violent passion is an evil; lip. Therefore something that ought to be feared is a violent passion.
