BALK, or Bulk, was formerly a province of Persia, but is now a dependency of the kingdom of Cabûl or Afghanistan. European geographers have but an imperfect knowledge of these countries, situated in the depths of Asia, and defended against the visits of Christian travellers by the fierce intolerance of their inhabitants. The country of Balk is bounded, according to the most accurate accounts, by the Oxus on the north, by the great mountain range of the Hindoo Coosh and Paropamisus on the south, by Badakshan on the east, and generally by sandy deserts on the west. It is supposed to be 250 miles in length from east to west, and from 100 to 120 miles in breadth from north to south. Towards the south the country abounds in hills which branch out from the Hindoo Coosh range. Here the soil is generally stony, though there are many well-watered valleys. The central portion of the country is level, fertile, and well watered from the vicinity of the hills; while towards the north, near the stream of the Oxus, it is sandy and barren. The western part of the country of Balk, which borders on the desert, partakes of its nature; but in the east there are mountainous tracts which are well watered, and occasionally fertile. The country descends very rapidly from the mountain range of Hindoo Coosh, which bounds it on the north, and towards the Oxus is of a lower level and of a much hotter climate than those parts of Afghanistan which lie to the south of these mountains. Balkis inhabited by the Usbeck Tartars, Tanjiks, and Arabs. These races have not relinquished their pastoral habits, some dwelling in tents, although the greater part now resort to the towns. In different parts of the country the soil is good; but it is chiefly occupied by wandering tribes of the Usbecks and Toorcomans, who derive their subsistence from their flocks and herds, and neglect agriculture. The Usbecks are the ruling tribe of Balk, and indeed the principal part of the population. They are generally short and stout, and have the genuine Tartar features, namely, broad foreheads, high cheek-bones, thin beards, and small eyes; yet they are a handsome race compared with the Kalmucks and other Tartar races. Their character is also superior to that of many other Asiatic tribes. They are considered sincere and honest, yet they exercise great barbarity in war, giving no quarter to their enemies, except they mean to sell them for slaves. As rigid Mahommedans, they entertain all the hatred for Christians prescribed by that intolerant creed. In the inaccessible parts of the country of Balk, amidst snowy mountains, deep pine forests, and small but fertile valleys, live a singular race, called by the Mahommedans Kauffers, or unbelievers, and persecuted by them with the most deadly enmity. Mr E1phinstone and Mr Fraser give some curious particulars of this race, who appear to have been the ancient idolaters of the country, and to have taken refuge from their Mahommedan invaders among the fastnesses of the mountains. They are considered extremely savage, but remarkably well formed and beautiful; insomuch that their country is liable to constant inroads from their Mahommedan neighbours, who carry off both men and w omen into slavery.

The chief cities are Balk, the capital; Meymoonah; And-khooee; Tansk Koorghan, the capital of Khootoom, consisting of 8000 houses; and another town, the capital of the district of Khoondooh, still larger. This province formed the ancient Bactra. In modern times it was conquered by Nadir Shah, and afterwards reduced by Ahmed Shah, the sovereign of Afghanistan. The country has since experienced many vicissitudes, and been exposed to severe calamities, from the contests for its dominion between different tribes. At present it is ruled by an independent chieftain, Killich Ally, who acknowledges only a nominal superiority to the sovereign of Afghanistan, and whose administration bears a high character for vigilance, liberality, and justice. He exempts all merchants from exactions during their journeys, and inflicts on highway robbery the severest punishments. The population of Balk is estimated at 1,000,000.

Balk, or Bulk, formerly a great city, but now an immense and melancholy mass of ruins. It is situated on the river Dehast, in a large and fertile plain. Originally it was regularly built, the streets intersecting each other at right angles; and it contained some splendid bazars [7:4:319]arcaded and vaulted, with caravanserais, and many magnificent mosques and colleges. But nothing now remains of its ancient magnificence except such buildings as were constructed of solid brick masonry, and by their strength have withstood the hand of time and the rage of war; so that this once superb capital, denominated the “Mother of Cities,” which contained a population of some hundred thousands, has now dwindled to 6000 or 7000, thinly scattered among the ruins of the city. Balk was taken and sacked by Ghengis Khan: it was again taken and destroyed by Tamerlane, who carried the inhabitants without the walls, and massacred them in great numbers; so that a pestilence was created, which raged with great violence, and gave a character of insalubrity to the place. The ruin of Balk was completed by Nadir Shah; and it has never since recovered any degree of consequence. This city is supposed to be the Bactra of the Greeks, and is of high antiquity. Long. 65. 16.
