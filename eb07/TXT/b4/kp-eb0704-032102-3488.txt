BALLENSTEDT, a city in the duchy of Anhalt-Bernburg. It is situated in the Hartz Forest, in a most picturesque district, selected for a seat of the sovereign, whose castle is accommodated with the usual appendages of courtly residences. The city, besides the court, contains about 2800 inhabitants, who are very industrious in linen manufactures, and in gardening.
