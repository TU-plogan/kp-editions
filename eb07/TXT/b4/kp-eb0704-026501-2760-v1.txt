BAAL, the same as Bel or Belus, an idol of the Chaldeans and Phoenicians or Canaanites. The word Baal, m the Punic language as well as in the Hebrew, signifies “lord” or “master,” and doubtless meant the supreme Deity, the Lord and Master of the universe. Some learned men think that the Baal of the Phoenicians was the Saturn of the Greeks; others are of opinion that Baal was the Phoenician or Tyrian Hercules, a god of great antiquity in Phoenicia.

Baal-berith, the god of the Shechemites. Bochart conjectures that Berith is the same as Beroe, the daughter of Venus and Adonis, who was given in marriage to Bacchus; and that she gave her name to the city of Berith ι∏ Phoenicia, of which she became afterwards the patron goddess.

Baal-peor, Baal-phegor, or Beel-phegor, an idol of the Moabites and Midianites. We are told that “Israel jomed himself to Baal-peor,” and that Solomon erected an altar to this idol upon the Mount of Olives. Selden conjectures that Baal-peor is the same with Pluto; which e grounds upon these words of the Psalmist, “They join-de 1θ mse ^ ves unt0 Baal-peor, and ate the offerings of the Baal-zebüb, Beel-zebub, or Belzebub, the idol or god of the Ekronites. In Scripture he is called the Prince of Devils. His name is usually rendered the “Lord of Flies,” which, some think, was a mock appellation bestowed on him by the Jews. But Scaliger derives the name of this deity from Baalim-zebahim, which signifies the “Lord of Sacrifices ;” the plural number (Baalim) being here, as in many other instances, used with a singular effect.
