BINACLE, a wooden case or box, which contains the compasses, log-glasses, watch-glasses, and lights to show the compass at night. As this is called bittacle in all the sea-books, even by mariners, it appears evidently to be derived from the French term habitacle, a small habitation, which is now used for the same purpose by the seamen of that nation.
