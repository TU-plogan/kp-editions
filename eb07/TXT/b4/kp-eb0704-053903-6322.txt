BEGLERBEG, or Beglierbey, the head of one of the principal governments of the Turkish empire, and next in dignity to the grand vizier. To every beglierbey the grand signior gives three ensigns or staves, trimmed with a horsetail, to distinguish them from those pashas who have but two, and from simple beys, or sangiac beys, who have but one.
