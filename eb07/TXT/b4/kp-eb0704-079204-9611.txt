BOORHANPOOR, a city of Hindostan, ana the ancient capital of the Khandesh province in the Mahratta territories, situated on the north-west bank of the Tuptee. This was formerly a large city, and when it was in a flourishing condition it extended about ten miles, as is evident from the heaps of ruins that are now scattered about in every direction. Boorhanpoor is the head-quarters of a singular sect of Mahommedans, and the residence of their high-priest. This city was at an early period conquered by the Mahrattas, and has ever since been in a gradual state of decay. During the war with Scindia in 1803 it was taken possession of by Colonel Stevensonâ€™s army without opposition, but restored at the conclusion of the peace in the December following. The travelling distance from Oojein is 154 miles, from Nagpoor 256, from Poonah 288, from Bombay 340, from Agra 508, and from Calcutta by Nagpoor 978. Long. 76. 18. E. Lat. 21. 19. N.
