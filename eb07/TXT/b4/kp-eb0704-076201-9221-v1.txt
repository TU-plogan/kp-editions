BOLSW’ERT, or Bolsuerd, Scheltius a, an excellent engraver. The time of his birth and death, and the name of the master he studied under, are equally unknown. Bolswert worked entirely with the graver, and never called in the assistance of the point. Among the variety of engravings by this artist, the few following may be here mentioned: 1. The Brazen Serpent, a large plate, lengthwise, from Rubens; 2. Abraham offering his son Isaac, a large plate, nearly square, from Theodore Rombout; 3. The Education of the Virgin by Saint Anne, a middling-sized upright plate, from Rubens; 4. The Marriage of the Virgin, a middling-sized upright plate, from the same painter; 5. The Feast of Herod, a large plate lengthwise, from the same; 6. The Miraculous Draught of Fishes, a large print lengthwise, on three plates, from the same; 7. Christ crowned with Thorns, from Vandyck, an admirable print; 8. A Crucifixion, from Vandyck, also admirable; 9. The god Pan playing upon his Flute, from Jordaens; 10. Mercury and Argus, a large plate lengthwise; 11. A drunken Silenus supported by a Satyr, from Rubens; 12. a Chase of Lions; 13. A variety of Landscapes.
