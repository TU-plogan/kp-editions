+=====================================================================+


BASIL the Great, one of the most learned and eloquent doctors of the church, was born at Caesarea, in Cappadocia, about the year 328, and went to finish his studies [7:4:426] at Athens, where he contracted an intimate friendship with Gregory Nazianzen. He returned to his native country in 355, where he taught rhetoric for some time. He then travelled into Syria, Egypt, and Libya, for the purpose of visiting the monasteries of these countries; and finding the monastic life suited to his disposition, he resolved, upon his re; turn, to follow it, and in fact became the first monk and the original founder of monasteries in Pontus and Cappadocia. Upon the death of Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, in 370, Basil was chosen his successor; but it was with difficulty that he accepted of this dignity; and no sooner had he been raised to it than the emperor Valens began to persecute him because he refused to embrace the doctrine of the Arians. As soon as this storm had blown over, the new bishop used his utmost endeavours to bring about a re-union between the eastern and western churches, which were then much divided about some points of faith, and also in regard to Meletius and Paulinus, two bishops of Antioch; but all his efforts were ineffectual, and the dispute was not terminated until nine months after his death. Basil had a share in all the controversies of his time regarding the doctrine of the church. He died in the beginning of January 379. Several editions of his works in Greek and Latin have been published. The best is that of Father Garnier, printed in Greek and Latin, in three volumes folio. Basil’s style is pure and elegant, his expressions often reach the sublime, and his thoughts are noble and full of majesty. Erasmus ranks him among the greatest orators of antiquity.

Basil, in joinery, the sloping edge of a chisel, or of the iron of a plane for working on soft wood. The basil is usually made twelve degrees, and for hard wood eighteen. The more acute it is, the better the instrument cuts; and the more obtuse, the stronger and fitter it is for service.
