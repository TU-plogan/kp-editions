BOGOMILI, or Bogarmitae, in Ecclesiastical History, a sect of heretics which sprung up about the year 1179. They held that the use of churches, of the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, and of all prayer except the Lord’s prayer, ought to be abolished; that the baptism of Catholics is imperfect; that the persons of the Trinity are unequal; and that they oftentimes made themselves visible to persons of this sect. They said that devils dwelt in the churches, and that Satan had resided in the temple of Solomon from the destruction of Jerusalem to their own time.
