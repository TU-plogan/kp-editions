BACCHIC, something relating to the ceremonies of Bacchus. The celebrated intaglio called Michael Angelo’s ring, is a representation of a Baechic feast.

Bαc(!iiic Song is sometimes used for a chanson a boire, or composition calculated to inspire jollity; but in a more proper sense it is limited to a dithyrambic ode or hymn.
