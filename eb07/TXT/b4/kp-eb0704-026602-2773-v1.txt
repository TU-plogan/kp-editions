BABINGTON, Gervase, bishop of Worcester, was born, according to Fuller, in Nottinghamshire; but in what year is uncertain. He was sent to Trinity College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow; and, in 1578, he was incorporated master of arts at Oxford. He appears, however, to have made Cambridge the place of his residence, where he became an eminent preacher; and, having taken the degree of doctor of divinity, he was made domestic chaplain to Henry earl of Pembroke. In this station he is supposed to have assisted the countess in her translation of the Psalms. In 1588 he was installed prebend of Hereford, and in 1591 consecrated bishop of Landaff. In 1564 he was translated to the see of Exeter, and thence to Worcester in 1597. About this time, or soon after, he was made queen’s counsel for the marches of Wales. He was a considerable benefactor to the library belonging to the cathedral of Worcester, where he was buried in May 1610, without a monument. The several historians who have mentioned this prelate agree in giving him the character of a learned and pious man. His works, consisting of notes upon the five books of Moses, an exposition of the creed, &c. were printed both in folio and quarto in 1615, and again in folio in 1637.
