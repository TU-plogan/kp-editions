BONFADIO, James, a celebrated Italian writer, was born about the commencement of the sixteenth century, at Gazano near Salo, in the diocese of Brescia. He was secretary to cardinal Merinos, archbishop of Bari, and after his death to cardinal Ghinucci. He afterwards read public lectures on Aristotle’s politics, and on rhetoric, and was appointed professor of philosophy and historiographer to the republic of Genpa. He applied himself to compose the annals of that state, and soon completed five books, which were to have been followed by several others. But having spoken too freely of some noble families, this created him enemies, who, havingresolvedto ruin the historian, accused him of an unnatural crime; and, as witnesses were found to convict him, he was condemned to the flames; but the sentence appears to have been commuted, as an act of special grace, into beheading. This was in the year 1550. Authors have varied in their opinions as to Bonfadio’s alleged guilt of the crime for which he suffered; some affirming that he was arrested and condemned on a false pretext, and that he died innocent; while others, including Tiraboschi, maintain that the accusation was but too well founded, and that his addiction to the infamous crime charged against him was the real cause which led to his destruction. His works are, 1. Annaliiιm Genuensium αb anno 1528, Recuperatoe Libertatis usque ad annum 1550, libri quinque, Pavia, 1586, 4to; and, 2. Lettere Famigliαri di Jacopo Bonfadio, con altri suoi Conιponimenti inprοsα cd in verso, with a life of the author by Mazzuchelli, Brescia, 1746, 8vo.
