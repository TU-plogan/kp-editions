BAHAMAS, or Lucayas, a chain of islands of great extent, stretching from off the northern coast of St Domingo, to that of East Florida, and situated between the 21st and 28th degrees of north latitude, and the 7lst and 81st of west longitude. They have never been regularly surveyed, nor their numbers ascertained with any degree of certainty; but they are estimated at above 500. Of these the principal are, Acklin’s Island, Andros Island, Atwood’s Key, Great Bahama, Berry Island, Biminis, Caicos, Castle Island, Crooked Island, Ľleuthera, Exumas, French Keys, Hog Island, Hog Key, Harbour Island, Heneagus, Little Island, Long Island, Long Key, Maya-guana, New Providence, Ragged Island, Rose Island, Royal Island, Rum Key, Russell Island, St Salvador, Turk’s Islands, Watling’s Island.

St Salvador, one of the islands composing this chain, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his memorable voyage. At that period the Bahamas were inhabited by a mild and peaceable race of Indians, who, seduced by the arts of the Spaniards, were afterwards consigned to perpetual bondage in the mines of St Domingo, or sent to act as divers in the pearl fisheries of Cumana. From this period the islands continued devoid of inhabitants until 1629, when New Providence was settled by the English, and held till 1641, at which time the Spaniards expelled them, but made no attempts to settle there themselves. It was again colonized by England in 1666, and again ravaged by the French and Spaniards in 1703; after which it became a rendezvous for pirates till 1718, when these were extirpated, a regular colonial administration established, and the seat of government fixed in this island. In 1781 the Bahamas were surrendered to the Spaniards; but at the conclusion of the war they were once more annexed to the British empire, to which they have ever since belonged. At the close of the American war many of the British royalists sought refuge in these islands, and colonized the principal of them, from which period we may date their gradual though slow cultivation and improvement.

Many of the Bahamas are situated on the Great Bahama Bank, others upon the Little Bahama Bank, and some [7:4:283] out of soundings in the Atlantic Ocean. The greater part of them consist merely of bleak and barren rocks, others are entirely covered with wood; and in general they are very flat, presenting the appearance of sand-banks. In the islands which have been cultivated, the soil is thin, and generally light or sandy, but interspersed with partial spots of rich mould. Though destitute of running streams, they have a number of springs; and by digging wells in the ∙ rocks down to the level of the sea, fresh water is obtained. The productions of the soil comprehend all the varieties of a tropical climate. Provisions, such as Guinea and Indian corn, yams, sweet potatoes, plantains, cassava, &c., and fruits, such as oranges, lemons, limes, pine apples, cocoa nuts, &c. are produced in abundance; and so also are different species of timber and dye-woods, such as mahogany, fustic, lignum vitae, pines, cedars, and the like. There are no sugar plantations, but a little cotton and coffee is raised. Oxen, shcep, horses, poultry, and a great variety of live stock, are reared. The shores and creeks of all the Bahamas abound in turtle and excellent fish of different sorts. There are many varieties of birds; and wild hogs, guanas, &c. are found in the w oods. The climate is in general dry and salubrious, and the hurricanes are not violent.

New Providence is about twenty-five miles long by nine miles broad, and is situated between long. 77. 10. and 77. 38. W. and lat. 25. 3. and 25. 20. N. It differs littlc in soil and productions from the rest of the Bahamas, except that it is considerably in advance in point of cultivation. Nassau, the capital town, the centre of trade, and the seat of government, is situated on the north coast of the island. The houses are built of a stone found in the island, and are remarkably good; the public buildings in particular, such as the government-house, custom-house, courts of justice, &c. are very handsome. New barracks have been lately erected in a situation not very beautiful it is true, but much more healthful than the former. There are several churches, public schools, and charitable institutions in this town, which are well supported. The three other regular ports of entry are the Turk’s Islands, Great Exuma, and the Caicos; but their trade is very trifling, and they arc still far behind New Providence in cultivation and improvement.

The Bahamas are of more importance to Britain by commanding the Gulf of Florida than from their trade and commerce. The exports consist chiefly of cotton, dyewoods, mahogany, turtle, fruits, and coffee. The salt trade, which was at one time considerable, is now in a great measure abandoned; and the imports consist principally of articles of clothing, provisions, and prepared wood. A great proportion of the inhabitants gain a livelihood by picking up the fragments of wrecks, so frequent in this labyrinth of shoals and rocks, sometimes to the number of 200 vessels annually, and also in giving assistance to those who are in danger, in which precarious trade a vast number of vessels are employed. The population of the Bahamas, according to the returns made to parliament in 1829, consists oí—whites, exclusive of white troops, 4152; free blacks and coloured, exclusive of black troops, 2791; slaves, 9297.
