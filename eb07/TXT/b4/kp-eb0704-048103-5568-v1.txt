BEAUSOBRE, Isaac de, a learned Protestant writer, of French origin, was born at Niort in 1659. He was forced into Holland to avoid the execution of a sentence, which condemned him to make the amende honorable for having broken the royal signet, which was put upon the door of a church of the reformers to prevent the public profession of their religion. He went to Berlin in 1694, and was made chaplain to the king of Prussia, and counsellor of the royal consistory. He died in 1738, aged seventy-nine, after having published several works, among which may be mentioned, 1. Défense de la Doctrine des Réformés. 2. A Translation of the New Testament, with Notes, jointly with Μ. Lenfant; much esteemed by the reformed. 3. Dissertation sur les Adamites de Bohème; a curious work. 4. Histoire Critique de Manichée et du Manichéisme, 2 tom. 4to. This is a very learned and valuable work; discussing, as Mr Gibbon observes, “many deep questions of Pagan and Christian theology, and forming a rich treasury of facts and opinions.” 5. Several dissertations in the Bibliothèque Britannique. Μ. de Beausobre had strong sense with profound erudition, and was one of the best writers among the reformed; he also preached as he wrote, with spirit and ability.
