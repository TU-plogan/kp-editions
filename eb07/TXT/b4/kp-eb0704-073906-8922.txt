BOLE, an opake, earthy mineral, occurring in solid amorphous masses, of a yellow, red, or brownish colour. It yields to the nail, and cuts easily, but has a conchoidal fracture, with a shining streak, and adheres to the tongue. Its specific gravity is between 1∙60 and 2∙00, and when thrown into water it emits a crackling noise, and falls to pieces. It occurs in wackč and basalt at Striegau in Silesia, at Habichtswald in Hessia, near Sienna in Tuscany, and among the cliffs of the Giant’s Causeway, Ireland.
