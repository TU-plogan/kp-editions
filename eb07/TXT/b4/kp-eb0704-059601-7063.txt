BEROEA, in Ancient Geography, a city of Macedonia, to the south of Edessa or Aegae, and south-east of Cyrtus. The people are commended in Scripture for their reception of the Gospel. There was another Beroea in Syria, called also Eeroe, and by the inhabitants BeroÃ«a. It is supposed to be identical with the modern Aleppo, which appears to have been so called from Chalep, the name given to Beroea by Nicetas, Nicephorus, and Zonaras.
