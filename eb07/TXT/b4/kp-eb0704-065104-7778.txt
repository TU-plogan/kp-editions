BISCAY, a province of the north of Spain. It is bounded on the north by the sea, on the east by Guipuscoa, on the south by Alava, and on the west by Burgos; and it extends over 1272 square miles. By the last authentic census the population was found to amount to 112,371; but it is said to have increased in the thirty years that have since elapsed, in spite of the suffering during the war from 1808 to 1814. The province of Biscay enjoyed a degree of freedom not extended to the other parts of Spain, and its inhabitants seem to be inspired with more of the spirit of industry and adventure than is common in that country. The Biscayans are evidently of a distinct race, as both their features, manners, and language demonstrate; and are probably of Celtic origin. Biscay is a very mountainous district, the air is pure, and both the winters and summers are temperate. The agriculture is confined to a few fertile spots, and is mostly conducted by small proprietors, who have little or no assistance in their work from cattle, but dig instead of ploughing the soil; yet the province yields corn sufficient, with the aid of chestnuts, to supply its inhabitants. The fisheries do, however, largely contribute to their sustenance. The chief manufacturing industry is applied to iron, which is made of an excellent quality, and converted into the various objects of agricultural and domestic use. The rural inhabitants live much more in lone and scattered houses than in villages or hamlets, and it contains but few towns. The capital is Bilboa.
