BOORO, an island in the Eastern Seas, situated between the third and fourth degrees of south latitude, and the 126th and 127th of east longitude. It may be estimated at seventy-five miles in length by thirty-eight in average breadth. The island is of an oval shape. The Dutch had a small fortress in the bay of Cajelli, which was destroyed in 1689, since which period they have only had an inclosure of palisadoes, the island not being very profitable to them, as it yielded no spiceries. The island is fruitful, producing large quantities of rice, sago, oranges, lemons, citrons, cocoa-nuts, bananas, and pine-apples; also the cajeput tree, from the leaves of which the cajeput oil is procured. Fine timber grows on this island, and many kinds of beautiful wood, fit for inlaying; besides black and white ebony, and the palm and the teak trees. Ships may be supplied here with rice, cattle, and other refreshments; and the woods abound with wild boars, goats, and deer, and, among the latter, the babirusa, or true hog-deer, as its name implies. The inhabitants of Booro consist of two races besides the Dutch settlers; first, the aborigines or Alfoncse, who live in the interior of the island among inaccessible mountains, and of whom little is known; and secondly, of the Moors or Mahommedans, who inhabit the northern coast, and acknowledge the authority of the Dutch. The southern coast is now deserted, having been much infested by the Papuas from New Guinea. The Chinese trade here for cabinet woods and different species of dye-woods.
