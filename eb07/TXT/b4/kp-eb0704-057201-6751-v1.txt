BENNET, Henry, earl of Arlington, was born of an ancient family in Middlesex. In the beginning of the civil war he was appointed under-secretary to George Lord Digby, secretary of state; he afterwards entered himself as a volunteer for the royal cause, and did his majesty good service, especially at Andover, in Hampshire, where he received several wounds. He left not the king when success abandoned his standards, but attended to his interest in foreign parts. He was made secretary to the duke of York, received the honour of knighthood from Charles II. at Bruges in 1658, and was sent as envoy to the court of Spain. His majesty, upon his return to England, called him home, made him keeper of his privy purse, and principal secretary of state. He had always a peculiar hatred of the lord chancellor Hyde, who, on the other hand, considered him a concealed Papist. In 1670 he was of the council distinguished by the title of the Cabal, and one of those who advised the shutting up of the exchequer. In 1672 he was made earl of Arlington and viscount Thetford, and soon after knight of the garter. In 1673 he was appointed one of the three plenipotentiaries from the court of Great Britain to Cologne, to mediate a peace between the emperor and the king of France. The house of commons this year drew up articles of impeachment against him. In 1674 he was made chamberlain of his majesty’s household, in recompense of his long and faith, ful service, and particularly for having filled the office] of principal secretary of state during the space of twelve years, to his majesty’s great satisfaction. But afterwards his interest began to decline, while that of the earl of Danby increased; for upon his return from his unsuccessful journey to Holland in 1675, his credit had so much sunk that several persons at court diverted the king with mimicking his person and behaviour; yet he held his office of chamberlain till the day of his death, which took place in 1685. His Letters to Sir William Temple were published after his death.

Bennet, Dr Thomas, an eminent divine, born at Salisbury on the 7th of May 1673, and educated at St John’s College, Cambridge. In 1700 he was made rector of St James’s in Colchester; he afterwards became lecturer of St Olave’s, Southwark, and morning-preacher at St Lawrence, Jewry; and at last he was presented to the vicarage of St Giles’s, Cripplegate, worth L.500 a year. While he held this station, he engaged in several expensive lawsuits in defence of the rights of the church, to which he recovered L.150 a year. He wrote, ļ. An Answer to the Dissenter’s Plea for Separation; 2. A Confutation of Popery; 3. A Discourse of Schism; 4. An Answer to a book entitled Thomas against Bennet; 5. A Confutation of Quakerism; 6. A brief History of the joint Use of preconceived Forms of Prayer; 7. An Answer to Dr Clarke’s Scripture doctrine of the Trinity; 8. A Paraphrase, with Annotations on the Book of Common Prayer; 9. A Hebrew Grammar; and other pieces. He died on the 9th October 1728, in the fifty-sixth year of his age.
