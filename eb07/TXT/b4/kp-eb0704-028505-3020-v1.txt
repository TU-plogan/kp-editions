BAILH, David, painter of perspective views and portraits, was the son of Peter Bailii, an artist of some note, and was born at Leyden in 1584. From his father he learned to draw and design; but he was afterwards placed under the care of Adrian Verburg, and continued with him for some time; and when he quitted that master, he studied to much greater advantage with Cornelius Vandervoort, an excellent portrait painter, and with him he spent about six years. As Vandervoort possessed many capital paintings of some great masters, Bailii, for his own improvement, copied them with critical care and observation; and particularly copied one perspective view of the inside of a church, originally painted by Stenwyck, which he finished with such accuracy, that even Stenwyck himself could scarcely determine which was the original or which the copy, when both were placed before him. He travelled through several parts of Italy to see the works of the celebrated masters of that country, and resided a few years at Rome; and abroad, as well as in his own country, the correctness of his drawing, and the delicate [7:4:286] handling of his pictures, procured him employment, admirers, and friends. In the latter part of his life he discontinued painting, and only drew portraits on vellum with a pen, which he heightened with black lead, and thus gave them wonderful force and roundness. He died in 1638.
