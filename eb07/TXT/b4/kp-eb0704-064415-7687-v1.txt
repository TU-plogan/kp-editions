BIQUADRATIC Equation, in Algebra, an equation raised to the fourth power, or where the unknown quantity of one of the terms has four dimensions. Γhus a? 4 + <zar 5 + Zw 2 + cτ + if=0 is a biquadratic equation. See Algebra. . f Biquadratic Parabola, in Geometry, a curve line o the third order, having two infinite legs tending the same way.

Biquadratic Power of any number, is the fourth power [7:4:645] or squared square of that number. Thus 16 is the biquadratic power of 2; for 2 × 2=4, and 4 × 4 = 16.

Biquadratic Root of any number is the square root of the square root of that number. Thus the biquadratic root of 81 is 3; for the square root of 81 is 9, and the square root of 9 is 3.
