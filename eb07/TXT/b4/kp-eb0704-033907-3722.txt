BANBURY, a market and borough-town of the hundred of Banbury, in the county of Oxford, seventy-five miles from London. The corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, high steward, and six burgesses, who returned a member to the House of Commons, in the election of whom the Earls of Guildford long had the patronage. It has some, but not considerable manufactures, and depends chiefly on the numerous villages around it, which send their agricultural productions to the market every Thursday. The inhabitants in 1801 amounted to 2755, in 1811 to 2841, and in 1821 to 3396.
