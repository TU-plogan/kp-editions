BOMBAY. This island, which is the seat of government for the western part of India, is situated in lat. 18. 56. N. and long. 72. 56. E. Its length from north to south is six and a half miles, and its breadth, near the fort, is about a mile. It is separated from the mainland by an arm of the sea, and it forms, in conjunction with the adjacent islands of Colabah, Salsette, Butcher’s Island, Elephants, [7:4:763] and Caranjah, a large, commodious, and well-sheltered harbour. The north side of the harbour is partly formed by the island of Colabah, which is separated from Bombay by a small creek, fordable at low water, and is about two and a half miles long. Near its southern extremity stands the light-house, a building of a circular form, rising from the sea to the height of 150 feet, and showing its light at the distance of twenty-one miles. The island of Salsctte, which is about twenty miles long and fifteen broad, is separated from Bombay by a narrow arm of the sea. Over this strait a causeway was constructed in 1805, which, by improving the communication with the mainland, is of infinite service to the surrounding country, with the produce of which Bombay is supplied; but it is said to have had a prejudicial effect on the harbour. Butcher’s Island is nearly opposite to Bombay Castle, at the distance of three miles; and about two miles from this, and still fronting the fort, is the inconsiderable but celebrated island of Elephanta. The two small islands of Henery and Kenery lie at the entrance of the harbour.

The town of Bombay is nearly a mile in length, from tlιe Apollo Gate to that of the Bazar, and about a quarter of a mile broad in the widest part, from the custom-house across the Green to Church Gate, which is nearly in the centre between the Apollo and the Bazar Gates. There are likewise two gates towards the sea, having commodious wharfs and cranes built out from each, with a landing-place for passengers. Between these gates is Bombay Castle, a regular quadrangle, built of hard and durable stone, and having the advantage, in one of the bastions, of a large reservoir of water. The fortifications are numerous, and they have been improved in proportion as the place has risen into greater importance from its increasing trade. They have lately received a considerable accession of strength from Dunganee Hill, which commanded the town, having been included within the fort; and towards the sea they are extremely strong, the harbour being completely commanded by ranges of batteries placed one above another. But on the land side its means of resistance are not so formidable; nor is this of much moment, as an enemy, once landed, would find no difficulty in possessing himself of the place. A bombardment would in a few hours lay the town in ashes; and were the houses, which are lofty and made of combustible materials, once on fire, the troops could no longer preserve their station on the ramparts. Indeed it is probable that the destruction of the magazines would be the consequence of the conflagration of the adjacent buildings.

In the centre of the town is a large open space called the Green, around which are many large, well-built, and handsome houses. Here is also the church, which has an extremely neat and light appearance; and on the left of the Church Gate is the government-house, which is a showy edifice, but liable to the inconvenience of having the largest apartments in both floors a passage-room to the others. On the right of the Church Gate is the Bazar, which is crowded and populous. Here the native merchants reside; and at the entrance to the street stands the theatre, which is a handsome building. In the year 1803 this part of the town was greatly injured by a destructive fire, which destroyed nearly three fourths of the Bazar, together with the barracks, custom-house, and many other public buildings, besides property of immense value belonging to native merchants. The flames spread with such rapidity that the magazine was endangered; and, in order to preserve the town from total destruction, many houses in the neighbourhood of the castle were battered down with artillery. Since this period the town has been rebuilt on an improved plan, at the expense of the company.

Bombay is the only principal settlement in India where the rise of the tides is sufficient to admit the construction of docks on a great scale. The highest spring tides rise to the height of seventeen feet, and the height of the ordinary tides is fourteen feet. In consequence of these natural advantages, the dry dock of Bombay has scarcely its equal for size and convenience; having three divisions, with a pair of strong gates to each, so that it is capable of receiving three ships of the line at a time. Near this dock is a convenient place to heave down several ships at once; and this operation is well executed, and with great expedition, by the Persees, who are generally accounted excellent ship-carpenters. Here is a rope-walk, equal to any in England, with the single exception of the king’s yard at Portsmouth, where cables and all sorts of lesser cordage are manufactured. It has also a covering to protect the workmen from the heat or inclemency of the weather. The dock-yard is large and well contrived, having ample supplies of naval stores deposited in the warehouses, together with large quantities of timber, for repairing and building ships, and forges for all kinds of smith’s work. With these advantages, Bombay claims a distinguished rank as a naval arsenal; while, within these few years, many merchant ships of from 600 to 1300 tons, partly for the country trade and partly for the service of the company, have been built in its docks, and, in beauty of construction, good workmanship, and durability, are superior to any other class of merchant ships in the world. Bombay is the only port in any of the British possessions out of Europe at which a ship of the line was ever built; and it deserves to be recorded that the Minden, a seventy-four gun ship, was launched from its dockyards in 1810. It has also added several frigates to the British navy. All these vessels are built of Malabar teak, which is esteemed superior to any in India. The teak forests, from which supplies of wood are derived, lie along the western side of the Ghaut Mountains, and other con-tinguous ridges to the north and east of Basseen; the numerous streams which descend from them affording water-carriage for the timber. The docks belong to the company, and the king’s ships pay a monthly rent for repairs. They are entirely occupied by Persees, who are esteemed remarkably skilful and assiduous. Bombay, thus possessing, in the skill of its workmen, the excellence of its timber, and the superiority of its docks, all that is necessary for a naval arsenal, may be considered as a station of the first importance to the British power in India.

From its position, Bombay commands an extensive commerce with the countries situated in the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, and with the western coast of India. It also carries on a valuable trade with the eastern parts of India, the islands in the-Eastern Ocean, and with China. Of the trade with China the staple commodity is cottonwool. The other articles consist of sandal-wood and pepper, the produce of Malabar and other adjacent countries; gums, drugs, and pearls, from Arabia, Abyssinia, and Persia; elephants’ teeth, cornelians, and other produce of Cambay; sharks’ fins, birds’ nests, and other articles from the Maldive and Laccadive islands. The ships generally arrive at Canton in June or July, and lie there until December or January. In 1808 the quantity of cotton brought to Bombay for re-exportation amounted to 85,000 bales, of 375 pounds each, which were partly procured from the country on the Nerbuddah, and from Gujerat and Cutch. The quantity, however, is not usually so large; and in this trade Bombay has been lately rivalled by the competition of the merchants of Bengal and Madras, who, having adopted a different method of cleaning their cotton, have sold it to greater advantage in the market[7:4:764] of Canton than the merchants of Bombay; and unless the latter adopt the same method of preparing their commodity, it is probable that this lucrative branch of trade will decline. It is about fifty or sixty years since the cotton trade from Bombay to China was first established. At that period a great scarcity of provisions having occurred in China, the cultivation of cotton was restricted by an edict of the government, and grain was ordered to be raised in its stead. Hence a great demand arose in the Chinese market for cotton, which has continued ever since to increase. But the general inattention of the Bombay merchants to the quality of the commodity, and the many frauds which have been practised upon the Chinese, have induced them to resume the cultivation of cotton, for the purpose of having within themselves the necessary supply of this useful article. On this account the demand from China may be rather considered as precarious. In stowing and packing the cotton, great dexterity is displayed. It is pressed down by means of a screw, worked by a capstan, to each bar of which there arc thirty men, amounting on the whole to 240 to each screw. Hemp is packed in the same manner, but it requires to be carefully laid in the press, its fibres being liable to be broken if they are bent.

Bombay carries on a considerable trade with Europe, and with different parts of America. The imports from Europe are principally articles for the use of the natives and Europeans, consisting mostly of the finer articles of European manufacture, the produce of other countries for re-exportation, piece goods, and treasure.

Bombay is estimated to contain 220,000 inhabitants, of whom nearly three fourths are Hindoos. The other fourth is composed of persons from almost every Asiatic nation. The number of Persees is estimated at 8000; there is nearly the same number of Mahometans, and there are 4000 Jews. The Portuguese are also to be found in considerable numbers. The Persees rank next to the Europeans, and carry on, many of them, extensive commercial transactions. They are the brokers and factors of Europeans, and have a concern in most of the foreign speculations of European mercantile houses. They are a rich, industrious, and active body of men, who contribute greatly to the prosperity of the settlement, and are treated by the government with much favour and ιn-dulgence[7:4:765]. For the protection which they enjoy they are exceedingly grateful, and openly express their conviction that they could not obtain the same advantages in any other part of the East. They are the descendants of the ancient Persians who fled from the persecution of Shah Abbas in the sixteenth century, when he expelled the worshippers of fire from his dominions, and compelled them to seek an asylum in other countries. The Persees at Bombay appear to be quite domesticated in their new residence, in which they have purchased valuable properties. Besides the Persees,-many considerable Portuguese, American, and Hindoo merchants reside at Bombay, who have acquired valuable property, and have the reputation of great integrity. There are likewise some Bonah merchants, or Mahommedan Jews, who carry on a great trade with Gujerat, and other places to the northward. All these different classes of inhabitants live happily together, and enjoy great prosperity under the mild and equitable rule of the British government.

The company’s naval force at Bombay in 1827 consisted of twenty fighting vessels, besides armed boats, adviceboats, and other craft; and to man this navy a regular establishment of officers and seamen is maintained. The western coast of India, from the shores of the Persian Gulf to Goa, is infested by swarms of pirates, who are distinguished, particularly those in the northerly tracts, by courage, address, and habits of extreme ferocity. It is to protect the country trade against the depredations of these banditti, who have haunted those seas since the time of Alexander the Great, that the company finds it necessary to maintain this naval force. Out of 104 marine covenanted servants of the company, Bombay employs ninety-three.

The annual expense of the Bombay army is, for king’s troops L.161,317; native troops L.1,050,646; local corps, garrisons, &c. L.827,535; total L.2,039,498. In 1827 the civil servants of the company on the Bombay establishment amounted to 128; the judicial, ecclesiastical, &c. to 109; and their pay and allowances to L.376,995, being an increase since 1817 of L.190,796.

The island of Bombay scarcely produces any articles of food; these have to be imported from various parts of India, and are consequently much dearer here than in the other presidencies. Considerable quantities of rice and other grain are annually imported. The prices are continually fluctuating, from the state of the market, which is under the superintendence of the police. Potatoes, which, though recently introduced, are now produced in the greatest abundance in this quarter of India, are brought to the Bombay market from Gujerat, which also supplies cheese, but of a kind hard and ill flavoured. The only vegetable Bombay is celebrated for is the onion, which is esteemed excellent. All other vegetables are scarce and dear.

The bazar mutton, when well fed, is thought to be as good as the English. Kid is always good; and there is abundance of poultry, which is not good, however, unless when fed on purpose. The fish are excellent, but those of a large size are not plentiful. The prawns are uncommonly fine; and though the island is too small to furnish great abundance of game, the red-legged partridge is not uncommon, and snipes are sometimes seen. The frogs here are large, and are sometimes eaten by the Chinese and Portuguese.

On the 1st January 1827 a supreme court of judicature was established in Bombay, by a regulation of the governorin council. It consists of a chief justice, and of three or more puisne judges, appointed by the king; and its jurisdiction extends over all the territories subordinate to the presidency of Bombay. In 1828 a collision of jurisdiction took place between this court and the government of the presidency. One of the judges, Mr Justice Grant, having issued a writ of habeas corpus to produce in court the body of a native of high rank, confined against his will by an uncle, the governor and council interfered, and opposed the execution of the writ, on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction except over British subjects or the servants of the company; and an appeal having been made to the privy council, it was decided that the supreme court had no authority to issue a writ of habeas corpus, except in the case of persons either residing within the island of Bombay, in which it has a general jurisdiction, or of those who are personally subject to its civil and criminal jurisdiction.

The same passion for country-houses prevails at Bombay as at Madras. These houses are generally comfortable and elegant; and if they have not the splendid Grecian porticoes of Calcutta and Madras, they seem to be better adapted to the climate, and have the advantage of the most beautiful and picturesque views; the island of Bombay being broken by several beautiful hills, cither covered with cocoa-nut tree groves, or villas of the inhabitants. The only English church in Bombay is in the fort. There are numbers of Portuguese and Arminian churches both within and without the walls, and there are also three or four synagogues, with many temples and mosques.

Bombay, from its situation, might be supposed to be healthy; but this is said not to be the case, the liver complaint being more fatal and frequent here than in any part of India. A land breeze sets in every evening, which is described as being peculiarly noxious, and is frequently followed by fever, and by loss of the use of the limbs. This breeze is stated by Lord Valentia to have been chillingly cold at the time he visited Bombay; but he attributes its deleterious effects not merely to this cause, but to the noxious vapours with which it is tainted in its passage over the rank vegetation that springs up in the marshy parts of the bay immediately after the rains. Moderate living affords the best security for health; the extremes of intemperance and over abstemiousness being equally injurious.

Bombay was first settled by the Portuguese, to whom it was ceded in 1530; having been before dependent on one of the native chiefs. In 1661 it was ceded by the crown of Portugal in full sovereignty to Charles IL, by the treaty of marriage concluded with that power when he espoused the infanta. In order to take advantage of this acquisition, and to make it a profitable dependence on the crown, a fleet was dispatched under the command of the Earl of Marlborough in 1662, to receive formal possession of the island and its dependencies. Some doubts arising, however, as to the construction of the treaty, the viceroy refused to surrender the island, on which the Earl of Marlborough returned to Europe, after having left the troops, amounting to 500 men, in the island, where most of them died. In 1664 a treaty was concluded by this nobleman’s successor with the viceroy of Goa, in which the former renounced all pretensions to the dependencies of Bombay, and accepted of the cession of the island alone, which the English accordingly received in 1665, the troops who had survived the ravages of disease only mustering 119 rank and file.

It was soon discovered that the revenues of the island were not equal to the expense of retaining it, and that the East India Company were much injured by a contraband trade carried on by persons in the king’s service. In consequence of these and other reasons, the sovereignty of the island was, in 1668, transferred to the East India Company. The company’s servants made every exertion to place this new acquisition in a respectable state [7:4:766] of defence, and to encourage settlers; and, in 1673, the island of Bombay, from being almost a desert, had become the centre of the company’s trade, protected by fortifications with 100 pieces of cannon mounted, and a suitable garrison. In 1676 letters-patent were obtained from the king to establish a mint at Bombay, at which they were empowered to coin rupees and other smaller pieces. At this period Bombay continued to be of very little importance, which partly proceeded from the vigorous government of Aurengzebe, and the rising power of the Mahrattas. These two powers contended for the possession of the island of Kcnery, which was seized on by the troops of both, the Bombay government not daring to oppose either party, but trembling for its own safety amid these formidable contentions. Bombay was soon afterwards, in consequence of the capture of Bantam by the Dutch, constituted an independent English settlement, and the seat of the English power in the East Indies.

In 1678, the company, finding it necessary to retrench the expenses of the establishment, proceeded to reduce the salaries and to lower the rank of their military officers, which produced general discontent, and finally, a serious revolt, which threatened the most alarming consequences to the company’s affairs. This insurrection was headed by Captain Richard Reigwin, commander of the garrison, who seized the governor, and such members of the council as still adhered to him; and having assembled the troops and militia, annulled the authority of the company by proclamation, requiring the inhabitants to renounce obedience to their authority, and to take the oaths of allegiance to the king. The whole inhabitants and all the troops immediately complied with the terms of this proclamation; and all the exertions of the governor of Surat to persuade the revolters to return to their duty were in vain. The mutiny was at length quelled by the prudence of Sir Thomas Grantham, who arrived from Surat with a commission from the king, and had a conference with Reigwin, in the course of which the latter agreed to deliver up the fort, on condition of receiving a free pardon for himself and his associates.

Since this period, the settlement of the English East India Company at Bombay has been frequently in a very precarious condition, sometimes from the unhealthiness of the climate, and at other times from the jealousy of the native powers. But, after the power of the company became more firmly rooted in India, it has continued gradually increasing in wealth and consequence, and may now be accounted ’ one of the most important and durable possessions of the British in India.

The government of Bombay and its dependencies is by law vested in a governor and three counsellors, who are placed under the control of the supreme government of Bengal, and are in all cases to obey such orders as they may receive, provided they have no different instructions in their possession from the court of directors, of which they are bound to send immediate notice to the Bengal government. The court of directors appoint the governor and members of the council, and likewise the commander in chief of the forces, who is not officially a member of the council, but may receive such an appointment from the directors, and in that case he takes precedence of all the other members.

It is difficult to fix with precision the extent of the territories included within the presidency of Bombay, as some districts belonging to the native powers are intermingled with them. On a general estimate, however, they may be calculated to comprehend 10,000 square miles, and to contain a population exceeding altogether two millions and a half, which maybe supposed to consist of one Mahommedan to fifteen Hindoos. Of the Persees no exact estimate has ever been made. The travelling distance from Bombay to Calcutta is 1300 miles; to Delhi 965; to Hyderabad 480; to Madras 770; to Poonah 98; to Serĩngapatam 620; and to Surat 177 miles.
