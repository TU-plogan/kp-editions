BIBIENA, Ferdinand Galli, a painter and architect, was born at Bologna in 1657, and surnamed Bibiena from a territory of that name in Tuscany, in which his father was born. He acquired such reputation by his skill in architecture, that he was invited to court by the Duke of Parma, and made his first painter and architect. Bibiena afterwards went to the emperorâ€™s court, where he had the same honours and advantages conferred on him. He wrote two books of architecture; and died at Bologna, at about eighty years of age.
