BASINGSTOKE, a market and borough-town of the hundred of Basing, in the county of Hants, forty-five miles from London, on the road to Exeter by Salisbury. The canal from hence to the river Wye and the Thames has contributed to increase the trade of the town. In 871 a sanguinary battle was fought here between the Danes and Saxons. The market is held on Wednesday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2589, in 1811 to 2656, and in 1821 to 3165.
