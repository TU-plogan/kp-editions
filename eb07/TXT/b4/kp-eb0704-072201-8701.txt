BOATING, a kind of punishment in use among the ancient Persians for capital offenders. The manner of boating was this: The person condemned to it being laid on his back in a boat, with his hands stretched out, and tied fast on each side of it, another boat was put over him, his head being left out through a space fitted to admit it. In this posture he was fed until the worms bred in the excrements he voided, ate out his bowels, and so caused his death, which usually occurred in about twenty days, the criminal lying all the while in most excruciating torments.
