BARCELONA, a city of Spain, the capital of the province of Catalonia. It is situated on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, between the mouths of the river Besos and the Llobregat, about one mile from each, on a plain of great fertility, covered with gardens and country houses. The city is but imperfectly fortified; but it is defended by the fortress of Montjuic, which commands every part of it. The buildings are irregular, and most of the streets narrow; but some of the plazas or squares, especially that of the Pallacio and the Born, are very respectable. It contains a Gothic cathedral of majestic appearance, 92 other churches, 37 monasteries, 7 hospitals, and about 11,000 houses; and, including the suburb Barcelonetta, about 140,000 inhabitants. There are here various institutions for the education of medical practitioners, one for mathematical tuition, and one for navigation. It was a place of considerable manufactures, but the loss of the South American colonies has injured that kind of industry, and lessened the tonnage of ships that have entered and left the port. The vessels that cleared out in 1816 were 1231, and in 1826, 1009. There is here a naval arsenal, a light-house, a foundery for cannon, and extensive barracks. Long. 2. 5. 55. E. Lat. 48. 23. 8. N.

The Spaniards, who are proud of the antiquity of their cities, ascribe the founding of Barcelona to the Carthaginians under Hamilcar, and the name to Borcino, a general of that nation. It was the theatre of hostilities, both during the government of the Moors in Spain, and in the wars subsequent to that period. During the War of the Succession it adhered to the house of Austria; and, at the close of it, was reluctantly reconciled to the dynasty of the Bourbons. At the commencement of Buonaparteâ€™s attempt to seize on the government of Spain, the French troops obtained possession of the fortress, which commands the city; and thus, during the continuance of that war it was held in most unwilling subjection to the enemies of the cause which its inhabitants most zealously espoused.
