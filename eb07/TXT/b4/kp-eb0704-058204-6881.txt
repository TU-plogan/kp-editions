BERGAMO Γ, a species of citron, produced at first casually by an Italian’s grafting a citron on the stock of a bergamot pear-tree, whence the fruit produced by this union participated both of the citron-tree and the peartree. The fruit has a fine taste and smell, and its essential oil is in high esteem as a perfume. The essence of bergamot is also called essentia de cedro. It is extracted from the yellow rind of the fruit by first cutting it į n small pieces, then immediately squeezing out the oil into a glass vessel.

Bergamot is also the denomination of a coarse tapestry, manufactured with flocks of silk, wool, cotton, hemp, ox, cow, or goats’ hair, and supposed to have been invented by the people of Bergamo, in Italy.
