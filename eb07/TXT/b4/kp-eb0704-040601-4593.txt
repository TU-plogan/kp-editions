BARRAMAHAL, a district in the south of Hindostan, situated between the twelfth and fourteenth degrees of north latitude. This district was annexed by Hyder to the dominions of Mysore; and in 1792 it was ceded to the British government by the treaty of Seringapatam. At the time it was ceded it was in a miserable state; but it soon recovered under the superintendence of a just and moderate government; and in the course of five years its revenues were more than doubled. This district was not subdued by the Mahommedans until about the middle of the eighteenth century; and hence the population consists chiefly of Hindoos, who outnumber the Mahommedans in the proportion of nineteen to one.
