BECTASSE, an order or sect of religionists among the Turks, so called from their founder Bectash, preacher to Sultan Amurath. The habit of the Bectasse is white; and on their heads they wear white caps of several pieces, with turbans of wool twisted ropewise. They observe constantly the hour of prayer, which they perform in their own assemblies, and make frequent declarations of the unity of God.
