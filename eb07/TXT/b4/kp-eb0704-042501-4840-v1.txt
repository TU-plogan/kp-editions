BASEL, one of the cantons of Switzerland, extending over 266 square miles. It is bounded on the northwest by France, on the north by the Rhine, which separates it from Baden, on the east by the canton of Aargau, and on the south and west by those of Solothurn and Berne. It is a well-cultivated district, flat in the centre, and surrounded by hills, none higher than about 3500 feet. The climate is mild, being protected from severe cold by the range of the Jura Mountains. It is productive in corn, and yields abundant fruits and good wine. The Rhine is the chief river, and affords a large quantity of fish. The inhabitants are about 50,000, industriously employed in agriculture and various manufactures. The government is a kind of democracy, in which each citizen has the right of voting in his particular guild; and by the guilds both the legislative and executive powers are chosen. The armed contingent is 915 men; but a ŗnilitia exists of all adult males. The established religion is the Protestant of the Calvinistic profession. The canton is divided into six circles. The language is German, but of a very barbarous description. The capital is a city of the same name, on the banks of the Rhine, over which is a bridge 600 feet long. It contains 12 churches, including the ancient cathedral, an orphan-house, and several hospitals, about 2250 houses, and 16,500 inhabitants, who find occupation in making various silk, cotton, woollen, iron, paper, and other goods. There is a university, but on the decline, with several professors, and only about 40 students. Long. 7. 41. 22. E. Lat. 47Γ33. 34. N.
