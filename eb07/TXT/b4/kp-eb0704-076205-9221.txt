BOLTON, or Boulton, Edmund, an ingenious English antiquarian, who lived in the beginning of the seventeenth century. His most considerable work is that entitled Nero Caesar, or Monarchie Depraved, dedicated to the Duke of Buckingham, lord high admiral, printed at London 1624, folio, and adorned with several curious and valuable medals. It is divided into fifty-five chapters, in some of which are introduced curious remarks and observations. In the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth chapters the author gives an account of the revolt in Britain against the Romans, under the conduct of Boadicea, which he introduces with a recapitulation of the affairs in Britain, from the entrance of the Romans into this island under Julius Caesar, until the revolt in the reign of Nero. In chapter thirty-six he treats of the East India trade in Nero’s time, which was then carried on by the river Nile, and from thence by caravans over land to the Red Sea, and by it to the Indian Ocean; the ready coin carried yearly from Rome upon this account amounting, according to Pliny’s computation, to above L.300,000 sterling, and the usual returns in December and January yielding in clear gain a hundred for one. Besides, this he wrote, 1. An English translation of Lucius Florus s Roman History; 2. Hypercritica, or a rule of judgment for reading or writing our histories; 3. The Elements of Armories; and some other works. The time of his death is unknown.
