BARDAS, the brother of the empress Theodora, and uncle of the famous Photius, is said to have had no good Quality besides that of loving the sciences and polite literature, which he established in the eastern empire; for otherwise he was treacherous, cruel, and ambitious. In the year 856 he assassinated Theoctistes, general of the emperor Michael’s forces, and obtained his post. At length he caused the disgrace of the empress Theodora; and St Ignatius, patriarch of Constantinople, reproaching him for his vices, he had the prelate deposed, in 858, in order to make room for Photius. Bardas was assassinated by Basilius the Macedonian in 866.
