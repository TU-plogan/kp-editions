BERAR, a large province of Hindostan, in the Deccan, situated between the 19th and 21st degrees of north latitude. Its boundaries to the north are the provinces of Khandesh and Allahabad; to the south Aurungabad and the Godavery; to the east the province of Gundwana; and to the west Khandesh and Aurungabad. Its limits are not very accurately defined; but including the small province of Nandere, which properly belongs to it, its length may be estimated at 230 miles, and its average breadth at 120. This province is centrally situated, being nearly at an equal distance from the bay of Bengal and the western coast of India. Berar Proper is an elevated table land, surrounded by a chain of mountains, with here and there a small peak visible above the rest of the country, and with deep breaks and ravines leading into the valley; indeed the whole country is hilly and abounds in strongholds. The surface of the hills in many parts is covered with loose stones and low jungle; and but little cultivation is seen.' A great part of this province was subject to the inroads of bands of freebooters, known by the names of Naicks and Bheels, with whom it was found expedient to compound, and to protect the people from their rapacity by the payment of a regular tax. The incursions of the Pindarees also desolated many parts of the province. The grain mostly cultivated in Berar is wheat, with Indian corn, Bengal grain, peas, and vetches. The Nagpoor wheat raised in Berar is reckoned the most nutritive and productive in India, and it also yields an excellent spirit when distilled. Indian corn, along with wheat, forms the principal subsistence of the inhabitants. The largest rivers are the Tuptec; two streams, both named the Poor-na, one flowing east and the other west; the Wurda, and the Pain Gunga. The chief towns are Ellichpoor, Mulca-poor, Baulapoor, Akoat. Akolah, Nernallah, and Gawelghur, deemed impregnable by the natives until it was taken by General Wellesley. A great proportion of the inhabitants are Hindoos. Owing to the continued rapine to which it has been exposed, the country has never attained to any great prosperity, nor possessed a numerous population. All the commerce which is carried on is managed by itinerant inland carriers, who are numerous all over the Deccan. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, Berar, which had been formerly ruled by independent sovereigns, was added to the Mogul empire. On the decline of that empire it was overrun by rapacious hordes of Mahrattas; and for some time it was nearly equally divided between the Peishwa and the rajah of Nagpoor. The latter having taken part with Scindia in the year 1804, his share of the province was transferred to the Peishwa. In the wars undertaken against the Pindarees in 1817, the Peishwa, Bajee Rao, joined the combination against the British; and, being defeated and pursued, he was forced to surrender himself a prisoner. He was deposed from his throne, and since this period Bcrar has fallen under the dominion of the British.
