BISHOP, a prelate or person consecrated for the spiritual government and direction of a diocese. The word comes from the Saxon bischop, which again is derived from the Greek i r χut^M∙τrος, an overseer, inspector, or superintendent, a title given by the Athenians to those whom they sent into the provinces subject to them, to see whether every thing was kept in order. The Romans applied the same designation to those who were appointed inspectors and visitors of the bread and provision.

A bishop discharges the same relative functions as an archbishop, though of course in a lower sphere. An archbishop with bishops consecrates a bishop, a bishop with priests ordains a priest; the archbishop visits a province, the bishop a diocese; the archbishop convocates a provincial synod, the bishop a diocesan one; and the archbishop has canonical authority over all the bishops of his province, the bishop over the priests in his diocese.

The election of bishops was anciently placed in the clergy, and the people of the parish, province, or diocese; but afterwards, princes and magistrates, patriarchs and popes, usurped the power. The election was required to be within three months after the vacancy of the see; and the bishop to be chosen from among the clergy of that church. Formerly the bishop claimed a share in the election of an archbishop; but this was set aside by the popes.

In England, during the Saxon times, all ecclesiastical dignities were conferred by the king in parliament. At length, however, after several contests, especially between Archbishop Anselm and Henry I. in consequence of a grant of King John, recognised in Magna Charta, and [7:4:652] established by the 25 Edw. III. stat. 6, § 3, bishops were elected by the chapters of monks or canons, some shadow of which still remains in the present method of disposing of bishoprics; but by the 25 Henry VIII. c. 20, the right of nomination was restored to the crown.

Ordinarily, three bishops at least are required in the ceremony of consecrating a bishop; but in some cases a single one will suffice. The English succession of Protestant bishops stands on this last ground. In England, the king being certified of the death of a bishop by the dean and chapter, and his leave requested to elect another, the congé d’élire is sent to them, with a letter missive, nominating the person whom he would have chosen. The election is to be within twelve days after the receipt of it, otherwise the king by letters patent appoints whom he pleases; and the chapter, in case of refusing the person named by the king, incurs a praemunire. After election, and its being accepted by the bishop, the king grants a mandate under the great seal for confirmation, which the bishop consigns to his vicar-general, consisting mostly of a solemn citation of such as have any objections to the bishop elect, a declaration of their contumacy in not appearing, and an administration of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, of simony, and canonical obedience. Sentence being read by the vicar-general, the bishop is installed in the province of Canterbury by the archdeacon; the fact is recorded by a public notary; and the bishop is invested with full powers to exercise all spiritual jurisdictions, though he cannot sue for his temporalities till after consecration. Then follows the consecration by the archbishop or some other bishop appointed by lawful commissions, and two assistant bishops. The ceremony is much the same as in the Roman Catholic church, save that having put on the episcopal robes, the archbishop and bishops lay their hands on the new prelate’s head, and consecrate him with a certain form of words. The process of the translation of a bishop to another bishopric differs only in this, that there is no consecration. The age of a bishop is to be at least thirty years; and, by the ancient discipline, none were to be chosen but those who had passed through all the inferior orders; but in some cases of necessity this was dispensed with, and deacons, nay laymen, were raised at once to the episcopal dignity.

The form of consecrating a bishop is different in different churches. In the Greek church, the bishop elect being by the assistant bishops presented for consecration, and the instrument of election put in his hand, after several prayers, the first of which is called diaconicum, he demands consecration, and makes profession of his faith, after which he receives a benediction. He is then interrogated as to his belief of the Trinity; to which he answers by a long profession of faith, and receives a second benediction. Lastly, he is asked what he thinks of the incarnation; to which he answers in a third profession of faith, which is followed by a third benediction; after which the consecrator gives him the pastoral staff. He is then led up to the altar, where, after certain prayers, and three crosses on his head, he receives the pallium, if he be an archbishop or patriarch; then the kiss of peace from his consecrator and two assistants; and sitting down, reads, prays, and gives the communion to his consecrator and others.

In the Roman Catholic church, the bishop elect being presented by the elder assistant to the consecrator, takes the oath; he is then examined as to his faith; and after several prayers, the New Testament is drawn over his head, and he receives the chrism or unction on his head. 1 he pastoral staff, ring, and gospel, are then given him, and after communion the mitre is put on his head; each ceremony being accompanied with suitable prayers. The consecration ends with Te Deum. These last-mentioned ceremonies are laid aside in the consecration of English bishops. Nevertheless, the book of consecration set forth in the time of Edward VI. and confirmed by act of parliament, in which some of them are enjoined, is declared to be the standard for this purpose by the thirty-sixth article.

The function of a bishop in England may be considered as twofold, namely, what belongs to his order, and what belongs to his jurisdiction. To the episcopal order belong the ceremonies of dedication, confirmation, and ordination; to the episcopal jurisdiction, by the statute law, belong the licensing of physicians, chirurgeons, and schoolmasters, the uniting of small parishes (though this last privilege is now peculiar to the Bishop of Norwich), assisting the civil magistrate in the execution of statutes relating to ecclesiastical matters, and compelling the payment of tenths and subsidies due from the clergy. By the common law, the bishop is to certify the judges touching legitimate and illegitimate births and marriages; and by that and the ecclesiastical law, he is to take care of the probate of wills and granting administrations, to collate to benefices, grant institutions on the presentation of other patrons, command induction, order the collecting and preserving the profits of vacant benefices for the use of the successors, defend the liberties of the church, and visit his diocese once in three years. To the bishop also belong suspension, deprivation, deposition, degradation, and excommunication.

All bishops of England are peers of the realm, except the Bishop of Sodor and Man, and, as such, sit and vote in the House of Lords. They are barons in a threefold manner; feudal, in regard to the temporalities annexed to their bishoprics; by writ, as being summoned by writ to parliament; and, lastly, by patent and creation. Accordingly, they have the precedence of all other barons, vote as barons and bishops, and claim all the privileges enjoyed by the temporal lords; excepting that they cannot be tried by their peers, because, in cases of blood, they themselves cannot pass upon the trial, for they are prohibited by the canons of the church from being judges of life and death. They have the title of Lords and Right Reverend Fathers in God. Besides two archbishops, there are twenty-four bishops in England, exclusive of the Bishop of Sodor and Man, who has no scat in the House of Peers. The Bishops of London, Durham, and Winchester, take precedence of other bishops, who arc to rank after them according to their seniority of consecration. There is also a bishop in our settlement of Nova Scotia, and recently one in Barbadocs. In Ireland there are four archbishops and eighteen bishops. eIn Scotland, before the Presbyterian establishment, there were two archbishoprics and twelve bishoprics.

Bishop’s Court, an ecclesiastical court, held in the cathedral of each diocese, the judge in which is the bishops chancellor, who decides according to the civil and canon law; and if the diocese be large, he has his commissaries in remote parts, who hold what are called consistory courts for matters limited to them by their commission.

Bishop’s Castle, a market and borough-town in the hundred of Purslow and county of Salop, 160 miles from London. It is on the river Clun, which runs to the Severn. Being on the main road between England and Wales, it has some trade, especially at its market, which is held every Friday. It returns two members to the House of Commons, who are chosen by the burgesses resident and non-resident, and supposed to be influenced by Lord Powis. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to lθm, in 1811 to 1313, and in 1821 to 1616. .

Bishop’s Stortford, a market-town of the hundred o [7:4:653] Braughing, in the county of Hertford, thirty miles from London. It is situated on the banks of a canal joining the river Lea, and by that means brought into water communication with the metropolis, to which it sends much malt, corn, and other goods. The market is held on Thursday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2305, in 1811 to 2630, and in 1821 to 3358.

Bishop’s Waltham, a market-town in the same hundred, and county of Southampton, sixty-eight miles from London. Near it was formerly a forest of the same name, which has been brought into cultivation. The market is held on Friday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1773, in 1811 to 1830, and in 1821 to 2126.

Bishop’s Wearmouth, a large parish adjoining to the town of Sunderland, in the county of Durham, 272 miles from London. It stands on the Wear, and has several manufactories of different kinds. There is a magnificent iron bridge of one arch, 236 feet in length. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 6126, in 1811 to 7002, and in 1821 to 11,542.
