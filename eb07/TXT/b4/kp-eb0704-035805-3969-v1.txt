BARAHAT, a town of northern Hindostan, situated among the mountains of Serinagur. This town was almost destroyed by an earthquake in 1803; and from the houses having been built of large stones with slated roofs, the calamity was greatly aggravated. From its central position it maintains a free communication with all parts of the hills, and those who make the pilgrimage to Gangautri generally halt here, and lay in a stock of provisions for their journey. There is near this village a curious trident, the pedestal of copper, the shaft of brass about twelve feet, and the forks about six feet, in length. There is no tradition to show the origin of this curious relic of antiquity. Long. 78. 22. E. Lat. 30. 48. N.
