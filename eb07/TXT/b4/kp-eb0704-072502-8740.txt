BOCCALINI, Trajan, a celebrated satirical writer, born at Loretto in 1556, who obtained the admiration of all Italy by his refined and delicate criticisms. Sovereign princes themselves did not escape the lash of his satire. The cardinals Borghese and Gaétan having declared themselves his protectors, he published his Bagguagli di Parnasso, and La Segretaria d’Apollo, which is the continuation of the former. These two works were received by the public with uncommon applause. He there feigns, that Apollo,holding his court at Parnassus, heard the complaints of the whole world, and did justice according as the cases required. He at length printed his Pietra del Paragone, in which he attacks the court and government of Spain, setting forth their designs against the liberty of Italy, and inveighing particularly against them for the tyranny they exercised in the. kingdom of Naples. The Spaniards complained of him in form, and were determined at any rate to be revenged. Boccalini became frightened, and retired to Venice; but he was there assassinated in a very extraordinary manner. Lodging with one of his friends, the latter happened, on one occasion, to get up early of a morning, leaving Boccalini in bed. A minute after, some armed men entered his chamber, and gave him so many blows with bags full of sand, that they left him for dead; so that his friend, returning in a short time, found him speechless. Great search was made at Venice for the authors of this murder; but although they were never discovered, it was universally believed that they had been employed by the court of Spain, which he had lashed with great severity. This story, however, is questioned by Mazzuchelli in his Scrittori dĹtalia. The works which Boccalini has left are, 1. Iłagguagli di Parnasso, in two centuries, Venice, 1612 and 1613, 4to; 2. Pietra del Paragone Politico Cosmopoli (Amsterdam) 1615, 4to; 3. Commentar, sopra Cornelio Tacito, Geneva, 1669, and Amsterdam 1677, 4to; 4. La Segretaria d’Apollo, Amsterdam, 1653, 24to.
