BASSANI, Giovanni Battista, maestro di cappella of the cathedral church of Bologna about the middle of the last century, was a very voluminous composer of having given to the world no fewer than thirty-one different works. He is equally celebrated as a composer [7:4:433] for the church and for concerts; and was besides a celebrated performer on the violin, having, it is said, taught Corelli on that instrument. His compositions consist of ' masses, psalms, motets with instrumental parts, and sonatas for violins. His fifth opera, in particular, containing twelve sonatas for two violins and a bass, is most esteemed; being written in a style wonderfully grave and pathetic, and abounding with evidences of great learning and fine invention. The first and third operas of Corelli are apparently formed after the model of this work. Bassani was one of the first who composed motets for a single voice, with accompaniments of violins; a practice which is liable to objection, as it assimilates church-music too nearly to that of the chamber; and of his sol-motets it must be confessed that they differ in style but little from opera airs and cantatas. Two of them, namely, the eighth and thirteenth, were printed in London by Pearson, with the title of Harmonia Festiva.
