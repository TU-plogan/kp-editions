BONDOU, a kingdom of Western Africa, between the upper courses of the Senegal and Gambia, bordering on Bambouk, Foota Torra, Tenda, Dentila, and other small kingdoms. The country is elevated, and the mountains are generally unproductive, and covered with stunted wood. The intervening valleys, however, are fertile, and finely clothed with the baobab, the tamarind, and other valuable fruit trees. They are traversed by beds of torrents, which flow rapidly during the rains, but are empty in the dry season. Cultivation, though it extends over only a comparatively small proportion of the whole surface, is carried on with considerable activity. The products consist of four species of grain, rice, cotton, indigo, and fruits. The workmen in the different parts display considerable dexterity, though they employ very rude and defective tools. The people consist chiefly of Foulahs, though the country is much frequented by Mandingoes and Serawoollies for purposes of trade. The exports consist of provisions and cotton cloth manufactured in the country, in exchange for salt and slaves. The caravans, bringing this last commodity from the interior to the coast, pass usually through Bondou.

The religion and laws of this country are Mahommeđan, though the precepts of that faith are not observed with the same rigour as in more northern countries. There are schools, however, in every town, where the Koran and the reading and writing of Arabic are taught; but the scholar stands in a very humble situation, being considered the servant of the teacher, for whom he is obliged to perform the most menial offices. The king is nearly absolute, and commands a disposable force of from 500 to 600 horse, and 2000 to 3000 infantry. These are much employed in predatory expeditions into the neighbouring countries, chiefly for the purpose of collecting slaves. His revenues are derived from a tenth part of the produce of the land, and of the salt imported, as also from duties on goods passing through his territories, with numerous presents expected or extorted. Mr Park experienced to his cost the rapacity of the reigning prince, being obliged to give up even the coat which he wore. He was introduced to the king s twelve wives, who had never before seen a European, and thought that the white skin had been produced by his having been bathed in milk by his mother, who had also artificially pinched up his nose into its unnatural elevation. The royal residence was then at Fatteconda; but when Major Gray visited Bondou, it had been removed to Boolibani, a small town of 1500 or 1800 inhabitants. It is surrounded with a strong clay wall; but the streets are narrow and irregular, and the habitations cannot rank above huts. The palaces of the king and his sons consist merely of inclosures about an acre in extent, containing a number of cottages, somewhat larger, but not more commodious, than those of his subjects. Near Boolibani are the ruins of another town nearly as large, which was entirely destroyed in a late war with Kaarta; and Major Gray saw the bones of the slain lying unburied and spread over its site.
