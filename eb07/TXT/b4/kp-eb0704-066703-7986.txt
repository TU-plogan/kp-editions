BLADEN, Martin, a translator and dramatic author, was originally an officer in the army, and bore the commission of lieutenant-colonel in Queen Anne’s reign, under John duke of Marlborough, to whom he dedicated a translation of Caesar’s Commentaries. In 1714 he was made one of the lords commissioners of trade and plantations; and in 1717 he was named envoy extraordinary to the court of Spain, but declined the appointment, rather choosing to keep the post he already had, which was worth L.1000 a year, and which he never parted with till his death, in May 1746. He was also many years member of parliament for the town of Portsmouth. He wrote [7:4:668] two dramatic pieces, both of which were printed in the year 1705, without the author’s consent. The names of these are, 1. Orpheus and Eurydice, a masque; 2. Solon, a tragi-comedy.
