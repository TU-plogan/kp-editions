BAROCCI, Frederic, a celebrated painter, was born at Urbino, where the genius of Raphael inspired him. In his early youth he travelled to Rome, where he painted several things in fresco. He then returned to Urbino, and giving himself up to intense study, acquired a great name in painting. His genius particularly led him to religious subjects. At his leisure hours, he etched from his own designs a few prints, which are highly finished, and executed with great softness and delicacy. The Salutation is his capital performance in that way; of which, however, we seldom meet with any impressions but those taken from the retouched plate, which are very harsh. He died at Urbino in 1612, aged 84.
