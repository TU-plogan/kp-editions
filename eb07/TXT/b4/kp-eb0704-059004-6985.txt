BERNIER, Nicholas, an eminent musician and composer, was born at Mante on the Seine, in the year 1664. Owing to his merit in his profession he was appointed conductor of the music in the chapel of St Stephen, and afterwards in that of the king. The regent duke of Orleans admired his works, and patronized their author. Bernier died at Paris in 1734. His five books of cantatas and songs for one and two voices, the words of which were written by Rousseau and Fuselier, have procured him great reputation. There are, besides, of his composition, Les Nuits de Sceaux, and many motets, which musicians still consider masterly productions.

Bernier, Prancis, surnamed the Mogul on account of his travels and residence in that country, was born at Angers in France. After he had taken his degree of doctor of physic at Montpellier, he left his country in 1654, and visited Egypt, the Holy Land, and the kingdom of the Mogul, where he became physician to the sovereign, attended him in his journeys, and remained twelve years. Upon his return to France, he published the history of the countries he had visited, and spent the remainder of his life in composing various other works, particularly an abridgment of the philosophy of Gassendi, in 8 vols. 12mo.
