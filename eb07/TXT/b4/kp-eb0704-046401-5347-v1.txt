BAY, an arm of the sea, shooting up into the land, and terminating in a nook. It is a kind of lesser gulf, larger than a creek, and wider within than at its entrance.

Bλυ Colour denotes a sort of red inclining to chesnut. The term is chiefly used in speaking of horses.

Bay Window, a window which projects, either in.the form of a semicircle or otherwise, forming a space similar in shape to a bay: hence its name.
