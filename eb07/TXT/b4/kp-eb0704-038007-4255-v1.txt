BARI, a maritime province of the kingdom of Naples, bounded on the north by the Adriatic Sea, on the east and south-east by Otranto, on the south-west by Basilicata, and on the west by Capitanata. It extends over 1740 square miles, and contains a population of 324,600 persons. The capital, from which the province derives its name, is situated on a tongue of land on the Mediterranean Sea, and is well fortified with a strong citadel. It is ill built and somewhat filthy, and contains a cathedral, several churches, and other public buildings. In 1817 a lyceum was founded here, and there is also a college for the nobility. The inhabitants are about 20,000, including the suburbs. There are considerable manufactures of cotton goods, and much trade in soap, oil, almonds, potash, and cotton wool, the last of which is cultivated to a great extent near it. Long. 16. 52. E. Lat. 4L 15. N.
