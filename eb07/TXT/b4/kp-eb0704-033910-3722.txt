BANCOOK, a sea-port of the kingdom of Siam, situated on the east side of Siam river. It is properly the seaport of Siam, few ships ascending higher up the river; and it is distant from it forty-two miles. In the reign of Louis XIV. this place was ceded to the French, who here erected[7:4:340] a fortress, which they retained for several years. They were afterwards expelled from the country about 1690, and have never since recovered their influence in it.
