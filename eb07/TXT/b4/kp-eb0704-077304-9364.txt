BOODROOM, or Baudrun, a small town of Asia Minor, in Caramania, situated at the bottom of a deep bay. It is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient Halicarnassus, and the vicinity abounds with many relics of antiquity. The houses are irregularly built along the shore, and are interspersed, as is usual in Asiatic cities, with gardens, burying grounds, and cultivated fields; and throughout the streets, and in different parts of the bazar, are scattered fragments of columns and mutilated sculptures. The castle stands on a broad square rock, which projects into the bay, and has a small harbour on the western side, which, though it has fallen into decay, is still convenient and safe, and is frequented by Turkish cruisers. This castle is adorned with the most exquisite sculptures in different parts of the walls, and is said to have been built by the knights of Rhodes in 1402. All access to the interior is forbidden to Europeans; but, according to the information obtained, the decorations within are fully equal to those on the outside. There arc still some traces of the ancient walls, and above the town are the remains of a theatre, about 280 feet in diameter, which appears to have had thirty-six rows of marble seats. Near the harbour is the palace, with some small mosques. The inhabitants consist chiefly of Greeks and Turks, who display the most violent antipathy to each other. Long. 27. 20. E. Lat. 37. N.
