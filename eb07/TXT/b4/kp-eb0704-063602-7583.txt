BIDEFORD, or Biddeford, a market-town and seaport of the hundred of Shebbear, in the county of Devon, 202 miles from London. The town is on the river Tawe, which runs into the Bristol Channel at Barnstaple Bay. Itis built partly on the bank of the river, and partly on the declivity of a very steep hill. It is accessible to ships of considerable burden, several of which are employed in the Newfoundland fishery. It is a corporate town, and an- â€™ ciently returned two members to parliament, but in the reign of Edward I. was excused from doing so on the plea of poverty. It has a very good market on Tuesday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2987, in 1811 to 3244, and in 1821 to 4053.
