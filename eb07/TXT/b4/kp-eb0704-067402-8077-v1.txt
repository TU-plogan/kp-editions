BLANCARDS, a name given to certain linen cloths, so called from the thread used in weaving them being half blanched or bleached before it is used.

BLANCHE-Ferme, or Blank farm, means a farm, the rent of which is paid in silver, not in cattle. In ancient times the crown rents were often reserved to be paid in libris albis, called blanch firmes; in which case the buyer was holden dealbare firmam, that is, his base money, or coin below the standard, was melted down in the exchequer, and reduced to the fineness of standard silver, or, instead of this, he paid the king twelve pence in the pound by way of addition.

Blanch- Holding, in Law, ĵs a tenure by which the vassal is only bound to pay an elusory yearly duty to his superior merely as an acknowledgment of his right.
