BELFAST, a sea-port town of Ireland, in the county of Antrim, situated at the efflux of the river Lagan into Carrickfergus Bay, which is a spacious estuary, containing a superficial area of twenty-four square miles. Although at present conspicuous for commercial and political importance, it is generally supposed to be of very modern origin; and this is so far correct, that there is no town in the kingdom which has advanced to eminence with equal rapidity, or which has been so little distinguished in the ancient, and so much in the modern history of Ireland. At present Belfast must certainly rank as the third town in Ireland for the extent of its commerce, as well as for the wealth of its inhabitants. It is well built, chiefly of brick; and the streets are broad, straight, and well paved and lighted. It has various public buildings deserving notice; among which are two episcopalian churches, both very elegant structures, six churches for Presbyterians, two for ieceders, one for Evangelicals, one for Covenanters, one for Quakers, three for Methodists, and two for Roman Catholics, who are in number about 4000. The other public buildings are, a linen-hall; an exchange, near which is a good assembly-room; a theatre, commercial buildings, and barracks for 800 men. A house of correction was built in 1817. The charitable institutions are, two hospitals, a house of industry for the blind, and one for the abolition of mendicity, established in 1809. The Belfast incorporated charitable society has a poor-house and infirmary, and a large and commodious building in which aged poor are maintained, as also poor children, who are clothed and educated. The funds for the support of these institutions are derived from bequests and annual contributions. Besides these, there is a public dispensary, a school of industry for the blind, and a number of charity schools. There are also several commercial institutions, such as insurance omees, banks, &c.; and among the literary institutions ma y be mentioned the seminary called the New College, which was founded in 1810 on an extensive scale, and contains endowments for professors in natural philosophy, i ‚àèoral philosophy, logic and belles lettres, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and mathematics, and also schools for the more elementary branches of education. The funds were derived in the first instance from liberal private contributions; but subsequently aid was obtained from government. This town is conveniently situated for commerce. The river Lagan, in entering Carrickfergus Bay, forms, as already stated, a spacious estuary, in which there is safe anchorage. The trade of the port is also connected with the extensive lake called Lough Neagh, by means of a canal which is navigable for lighters. Great part of the productions of the neighbouring counties is here consumed or shipped, Belfast being considered the chief emporium of the north of Ireland for every article both of foreign and domestic produce; and in some branches of manufacture it is considered equal, if not superior, both to Cork and Dublin. A considerable trade is carried on with the West Indies, America, and other parts of the world. The chief exports are linen and cotton manufactures, butter, beef, pork, grain, and oatmeal. The vessels belonging to the port amount to 201, and their tonnage to 23,193. Two convenient docks have been constructed for repairing them; and vessels drawing thirteen feet of water can approach the wharfs at flood tide. The trade of this place has rapidly improved, as is shown by the amount of the custom-house duties, which in 1800 were only L.62,668, but in the course of. sixteen years increased to L.349,417; and their amount has since been progressively advancing. Belfast has manufactories of flax-spinning, cotton, and linen, though cotton seems to be gaining the ascendency over linen. There are also manufactories of glass, vitriol, and pottery, and of cast-iron and paper. Two bridges are built over the river, one at the east end of the town, an old bridge 2500 feet long, and consisting of twenty-one arches; and another built in 1814, about half a mile up the river, on the south of the town, which connects the counties of Antrim and Down. Belfast sends one member to the imperial parliament. The government of the town is vested by charter in the Marquis of Donegal, who is lord of the castle, in the constable of the castle, the sovereign or mayor, and twelve burgesses. The population of Belfast amounted in 1758 to 8549, in 1782 to 13,105, and in 1798 to 18,320. By the population return of 1821 it was 45,000, and by that of 1831, 53,287. It is eighty Irish miles north of Dublin. Long. 5. 54. W. Lat. 54. 35. N.
