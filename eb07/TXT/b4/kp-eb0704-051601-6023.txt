BEDELL, Dr William, a learned prelate, born in Essex in 1570. He went as chaplain with Sir Henry Wotton, the English ambassador to the republic of Venice, in 1604, and continuing eight years in that city, contracted an intimate acquaintance with the celebrated Father Paul. Of him Bedell learned enough of Italian to be able to translate the English Common Prayer Book into that language; and in return drew up an English grammar for Father Paul, who declared that he had learned more from Bedell in all parts of divinity than from any other person. He was accordingly much concerned when Bedell left Venice, and at his departure presented him with his picture, the manuscript of his History of the Council of Trent, and his History of the Interdict and Inquisition, with other literary donations. In 1629, he obtained the bishopric of Kilmore and Ardagh in Ireland, and, finding these dioceses in great disorder, applied himself vigorously to the reform of abuses. He was no persecutor of Papists, but laboured with great success to convert the better sort of the popish clergy. He procured an Irish translation of the Common Prayer Book, which he caused to be read in his cathedral every Sunday; and the New Testament having been translated by Archbishop Daniel, he caused a version of the Old Testament to be made, which was afterwards printed at the expense of the Honourable Robert Boyle. In 1624, he published a controversial book against the Roman Catholics, which he dedicated to Charles prince of Wales, and assisted the archbishop of Spolatro in finishing his famous work Be Republica Ecclesiastica. When the rebellion broke out in Ireland in October 1641, the bishop did not at first experience its violence, as the rebels had conceived a great veneration for him, and<declared he should be the last Englishman they would drive out of Ireland. His was the only house in the county of Cavan that remained inviolate, and it was filled with the people who had fled to him for shelter. About the middle of December, however, the rebels, pursuant to orders received from their council of state at Kilkenny, required him to dismiss the people who were with him; but he peremptorily refused to do so, declaring he would share the same fate with his guests.. Upon this they seized the bishop himself, his two sons, and Mr Clogy, who had married his daughter-in-law, and carried them prisoners to the castle of Cloughbough ter, surrounded by a deep fosse, where all except the bishop were put in irons; but this severity was soon discontinued, and, after a confinement of about three weeks, the bishop, his two sons, and Mr Clogy, were exchanged for some of the principal rebels. The bishop, however, died soon after, on the 7th of February 1642; his death having been occasioned by his late imprisonment, and the weight of sorrows which preyed on his mind. The Irish paid him unusual honours at his burial, for the chiefs of the rebels collected their forces, and, thus attended, accompanied his remains to the church-yard.
