BATTAS, a fertile and populous country in the island of Sumatra, which is divided into many small districts. It ιs bounded on the north by that of Acheen, and on the south by the district of Race. It extends along the western coast, from the river Singkel to that of Tabuyong; in-and to that of Ayer Bangis, and across the island, which is narrow in that part, to the eastern coast; but it is, neverthe-θss,more or less encroached on by the Malayan and Achene establishments. The country is comparatively level, e ×cept about the bay of Tapanooly, where the land is high and wooded. The Singkel river, which bounds it, and is the largest on the west coast of Sumatra, has its rise in the mountains, about thirty miles from the sea. The Battas country produces gold, benzoin, cassia, camphor, and other articles, which the natives of the sea-coasts exchange for iron, steel, brass-wire, and salt. These articles again are exchanged with the natives of the interior, and, for the convenience of this trade, fairs are established. The country is extremely populous, especially in the central parts. The natives seem to be rude and uncivilized in their manners, and have adopted many barbarous customs. In particular, polygamy is common, the men being allowed to marry as many wives as they can afford to maintain; and the husband has the power of selling his wives and children. The women appear generally to be in a very degraded state, little above slavery. They are employed in domestic duties, and, besides, work in the rice plantations; whilst the men, except when they are engaged in war, lead an inactive life, passing the day in playing the flute, and in other idle amusements. They are greatly addicted to gaming; and when they lose more than they are able to pay, their persons are seized, and they are reduced to slavery. But the most extraordinary trait of barbarity among the Battas is the practice of cannibalism. This was long disbelieved; but it is now well authenticated, being confirmed by the concurring accounts of different travellers, and placed beyond a doubt by the authority of Sir Stamford Raffles, who was at pains to collect information respecting the customs of this singular people. The feast on human flesh, in which the Battas indulge, is as much, however, to gratify revenge as to satisfy hunger; and it is accordingly the bodies of their enemies, either taken or killed in war, that they devour, or offenders condemned for great crimes, especially adultery. The offended party gratifies his malignity by feasting on the body of the person by whom he has been injured. The Battas country is ruled by numerous petty chieftains. But the sultan of Menancabau, though he is not acknowledged as sovereign, is regarded with a sort of superstitious veneration throughout the whole country. The Battas are in their persons rather inferior in stature to the Malays, and are of fairer complexions. The different tribes are almost constantly at war with each other. Their arms are matchlock guns, spears, and swords; the former purchased from Menancabau traders, and the latter made by themselves, as also their gun powder. The religion of the country is Mahommedanism ∣ and the language is probably the most ancient in Sumatra, and is said to be the root of the various dialects which have overspread the island.
