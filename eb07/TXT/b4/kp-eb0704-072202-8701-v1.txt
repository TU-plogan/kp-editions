BOATSWAIN, the officer who has the boats, sails, rigging, colours, anchors, and cables, committed to his charge. It is also the duty of this officer to summon the crew to their duty; to assist with his mates in the necessary business of the ship; and to relieve the watch when it expires. He ought frequently to examine the condition of the masts, sails, and rigging, and remove whatever may be judged unfit for service, or supply whatever is deficient; and he is ordered by his instructions to perform this duty with as little noise as possible.

Boatswain 1 s Mate has the peculiar command of the long-boat, for the setting forth of anchors, weighing or fetching home an anchor, warping, towing, or mooring; and he is bound to give an account of his store.
