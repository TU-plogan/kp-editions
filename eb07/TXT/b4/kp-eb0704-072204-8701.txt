BOBBING, among fishermen, a particular manner of catching eels, different from sniggling. Bobbing for eels is thus performed. Some large lobs are scoured well, and a twisted silk thread run through them from end to end with a needle, so many being taken that they may warp about a board a dozen times at least; then they are tied fast with the two ends of the silk thread, that they may hang in somany hanks; which being done, they are all fastened to a strong cord, and about a handful and a half above the worms a plummet three quarters of a pound weight is fixed, and the cord made fast to a strong pole. This apparatus is thrown into muddy water; the eels tug lustily at the bait; and when they have swallowed it sufficiently, the rope is drawn gently to the top, and the eels are brought ashore.
