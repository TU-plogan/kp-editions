BAKER, Sir Richard, author of the Chronicle of th e Kings of England, was born at Sessinghurst, in Kent, about the year 1568. After going through the usual course of academical learning at Hart Hall, in Oxford, he travelled into foreign parts; and upon his return home was created master of arts, and soon after, in 1603, received from King James I. the honour of knighthood. In 1620 he was made high sheriff of Oxfordshire: but having engaged to pay some debts of his wife’s family, he was reduced to poverty, and obliged to betake himself for shelter to the Fleet prison, where he composed several books; amongst which are, Meditations and Disquisitions on the Lord’s Prayer; Meditations, &c. on several of the Psalms of David; Meditations and Prayers upon the Seven Days of the Weck; Cato Variegatus, or Cato’s Moral Distichs varied, &c. Mr Granger observes, that his Chronicle of the Kings of England was ever more esteemed by readers of a lower class than by such as had a critical knowledge of history, ln the reign of the British Solomon, the language was considered polite; and it long maintained its reputation, especially amongst country gentlemen. But the author seems to have been sometimes more studious to please than to inform, and with that view to have sacrificed even chronology itself to method. In 1658, Edward Philips, nephew to Milton, published a third edition of this work, with the addition of the reign of Charles I. It has several times been reprinted since, and by successive additions brought as far down as the reign of George I. Sir Richard also translated several works from the French and Italian; and died very poor, in the Fleet prison, on the 18th of February 1645.

Baker, Thomas, an eminent mathematician, was born at Ilton in Somersetshire about the year 1625, and entered at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1640, after which lie became vicar of Bishop’s-Nymmet, in Devonshire, where lie wrote The Geometrical Key, or the Gate of Equations unlocked; published at London in 4to in 1684. He died at Bishop’s Nymmet on the 5th of June 1690.

Baker, Thomas, a very ingenious and learned antiquary, descended from a family ancient, well esteemed, and distinguished by its loyalty and affection for the crown, was born at Crook in 1656. He was educated at the free school at Durham, and thence removed to St John’s College, Cambridge, in 1674. He proceeded A. B. in 1677, A. Μ. in 1681, was elected fellow in March 1680, ordained deacon by Bishop Compton of London in December 1685, and priest by Bishop Barlow of Lincoln the following year. Dr Watson, tutor of the college, who had been nominated, but not yet consecrated, bishop of St David s, offered to take him for his chaplain; but this he declined, probably in the prospect of a like offer from Lord Crew, bishop of Durham, which he soon after accepted. His lordship collated him to the rectory of Long-Ncwton in his diocese, in June 1687; and, as Dr Grey was informed by some of the bishop’s family, the prelate further intended to give him that of Sedgefield, worth L.600 or L.7θθ a year, with a golden prebend, had he not incurred bis lordship’s displeasure and left his family for refusing to read King James II.’s declaration for liberty of conscience. The bishop, who disgraced him for this refusal, and was excepted out of King William’s pardon, took the oaths to that king, and kept his bishopric till his death. Mr Baker resigned Long-Newton on the 1st of August 1690, refusing to take the oaths; and retired to his fellowship at St John s, in which he was protected till the 20th of January 1716-1/, when, with one and twenty others, he was dispossessed of it· After the passing of the Registering Actin 1723, he was [7:4:293]desired to register his annuity of L.40, which the last act required before it was amended and explained. Though this annuity, left him by his father for his fortune, with L.20 per annum out of his collieries by his elder brother, from the day of his death in August 1699, and during the remaining part of the lease, which expired at Whitsuntide 1722, was now his whole subsistence, he could not be prevailed on to secure himself against the act. He retained a lively resentment of his deprivations; and wrote himself in all his books, as well as in those which he gave to the college library, socius ejectus, and in some rector ejectus. He continued to reside in the college as commoner-master till his death, which happened on the 2d of July 1740, in consequence of a paralytic stroke. In the afternoon of the 29th June, being alone in his chamber, he was struck with a slight apoplectic fit; but this abating a little, he recovered his senses, and knew all those about him, who were his nephew Burton, and Drs Bedford and Heberden. He seemed perfectly satisfied and resigned; and when Dr Bedford desired him to take some medicine then ordered, he declined it, saying he would only take his usual sustenance, which his bed-maker knew the times and quantities of giving. He was thankful for the affection and care his friends showed him; but, hoping the time of his dissolution was at hand, he would by no means endeavour to retard it. His disorder increased, and the third day after he was seized with the disorder he died. Having been appointed one of the executors of his elder brother’s will, by which a large sum was bequeathed to pious uses, he prevailed on the other two executors, who were his younger brother Francis and the Hon. Charles Montagu, to lay out L.1310 of the money upon an estate to be settled upon St John’s College for six exhibitioners. He likewise gave to the college L.100 for the consideration of L.6 a year, then only legal interest, during his life; and to the library several choice books, both printed and in manuscript, with medals and coins; besides what he left to it by his will, which were “all such books, printed and manuscript, as he had, and were wanting there.” All that Mr Baker printed was, lsŕ, Reflections on Learning, showing the insufficiency thereof in its several particulars, in order to evince the usefulness and necessity of Revelation, Lond. 1709-10, which went through many editions; and, 2d, The preface to Bishop Fisher’s Funeral Sermon for Margaret countess of Richmond and Derby, 1708; both without his name. The latter piece is a sufficient specimen of the editor’s skill in antiquities to make us regret that he did not live to publish his History of St John’s College, from the foundation of old St John’s House to the present time; with some occasional and incidental accounts of the affairs of the university, and of such private colleges as held communication or intercourse with the old house or college; collected principally from manuscripts, and carried on through a succession of masters to the end of Bishop Gunning’s mastership, 1670. His manuscript collections relative to the history and antiquities of the university of Cambridge, amounting to forty-nine volumes in folio and three in quarto, are divided between the British Museum and the public library at Camnudge the former possesses twenty-three volumes, the atter sixteen in folio and three in quarto. Dr Knight styles him “the greatest master of the antiquities of this °uι university;” and Hearne says, “Optandum est ut sua quoque collectanea de antiquitatibus Cantabrigiensibus juris faciat publici Cl. Bakerus, quippe qui cruditione summa judicioque acri et subacto polleat.” Mr Baker intend- c ,. something like an Athenoe Cantabrigienses, on the plan 0 the Athene Oxomenses. aker, Henry, an ingenious and diligent naturalist, was 0rn in Fleet-street, London, either near the end of the seventeen th, or very early in the beginning of the eighteenth century. His father’s profession is not known, but his mother was in her time a midwife of great practice. He was brought up under an eminent bookseller, who preceded the elder Dodsley, to the business of a bookseller; in which, however, he appears not to have engaged at all after his apprenticeship, or, if he did, it was soon relinquished by him; for although it was in his power to have drawn away all his master’s best customers, he would not set up against him. Mr Baker being of a philosophical turn of mind, and having diligentlyattended to the methods which might be practicable and useful in the cure of stammering, especially in teaching deaf and dumb persons to speak, made this the employment of his life. In the prosecution of so valuable and difficult an undertaking he was very successful, and several of his pupils have borne testimony to the ability and good effect of his instructions. He married Sophia, youngest daughter of the famous Daniel Defoe, who brought him two sons, both of whom he survived. On the 29th of January 1740 Mr Baker was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and on the 12th of March following, the same honour was conferred upon him by the Royal Society. In 1744 Sir Godfrey Copley’s gold medal was bestowed upon him, for having, by his microscopical experiments on the crystallizations and configuration of saline particles, produced the most extraordinary discovery during that year. Having led a very useful and honourable life, he died at his apartments in the Strand on the 25th of November 1774, being then above seventy years of age. His wife had been dead some time before; and he only left one grandson, William Baker, who was born the 17th of February 1763, and to whom, onhisliving to the age of twenty-one, he bequeathed the bulk of his fortune, which he had acquired by his profession of teaching deaf and dumb persons to speak. His furniture, printed books (but not manuscripts), curiosities, and collections of every sort, he directed to be sold, which was accordingly done. His fine collection of native and foreign fossils, petrifactions, shells, corals, vegetables, ores, &c. with some antiquities, and other curiosities, were sold by auction the 13th of March 1775 and the nine following days. He was buried, as he desired, in an unexpensive manner, in the church-yard of St Mary-le-strand; within which church, on the south wall, he ordered a small tablet to be erected to his memory. An inscription for it, he said, would probably be found among his papers; if not, he hoped some learned friend would write one agreeable to truth. This friendly office, however, remains as yet to be performed. Mr Baker was a constant and useful attendant at the meetings of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and in both was frequently chosen one of the council. He was peculiarly attentive to all new improvements in natural science, and very solicitous for the prosecution of them. Several of his communications are printed in the Philosophical Transactions; and besides the papers written by himself, he was the means, by his extensive correspondence, of conveying to the society the intelligence and observations of other inquisitive and philosophical men, both at home and abroad. The Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, is under singular obligations to this worthy naturalist. As he was one of the earliest members of the society, so he contributed in no small degree to its rise and establishment. At its first institution he officiated for some time gratis as secretary. He was many years chairman of the committee of accounts, and he took an active part in the general deliberations of the society. He drew up a short account of the original of this society, and of the concern he himself had in forming it; which was read before the society of antiquaries, and would be a pleasing present to [7:4:294]the public. Mr Baker was a poetical writer in the early part of his life. His Invocation of Health got abroad without his knowledge; but was reprinted by himself in his Original Poems, serious and humorous, 8vo, 1725 and 1726. Among these poems are some tales as witty and as loose as Prior’s. He was the author likewise of The Universe, a poem intended to restrain the pride of man; which has been several times reprinted. His account of the water polype, which was originally published in the Philosophical Transactions, was afterwards enlarged into a separate treatise, and has gone through several editions. But his principal publications are, The Microscope made Easy, and Employment for the Microscope. The first of these, which was originally published in 1742 or 1743, has gone through six editions. The second edition of the other, which, to say the least of it, is equally pleasing and instructive, appeared in 1764. These treatises, especially the latter, contain the most curious and important of the observations and experiments which Mr Baker either laid before the Royal Society or published separately. It has been said of Mr Baker, that “he was a philosopher in little things.” But if it was intended by this language to lessen his reputation, there is no propriety in the stricture. He was an intelligent, upright, and benevolent man, much respected by those who knew him best; his friends were the friends of science and virtue; and it will always be remembered by his contemporaries, that no one was more ready than him to assist those of whom he had acquaintance, in their various researches and endeavours for the advancement of knowledge and the benefit of society.

Baker, David Erskine, son of the former, was a young man of genius and learning. Having been adopted by an uncle, who was a silk-throwster in Spitalfields, young Baker succeeded him in the business, but wanted the prudence and attention which are necessary to secure prosperity in trade. Like his father, he was both a philosopher and a poet, and wrote several occasional poems in the periodical collections, some of which were much admired at the time; but so violent was his turn for dramatic performance, that he repeatedly engaged with the lowest strolling companies, in spite of every effort of his father to reclaim him. The public were indebted to him for The Companion to the Play-house, in two volumes, 1764, 12mo; a work which, though imperfect, had considerable merit, and showed that he possessed a very extensive knowledge of our dramatic authors, and which has since, under the title of “Biographia Dramatica,” been considerably improved.

Baker, a person whose occupation or business it is to bake bread. The learned are in great doubt about the time when baking first became a particular profession, and bakers were introduced. It is, however, generally agreed that they had their rise in the East, and passed from Greece to Italy after the war with Pyrrhus, about the year of Rome 583. Till that time every housewife was her own baker; for the word pistor, which we find in Roman authors before this period, signified, as’ Varro 1 justly observes, a person who ground or pounded the grain in a mill or mortar to prepare it for baking. According to Athenaeus, the Cappadocians were the most approved bakers; after them the Lydians; and then the Phoenicians. To the foreign bakers brought into Rome were added a number of freedmen, who were incorporated into a body, or, as they termed it, a college; from which neither they nor their children were ever allowed to withdraw. They held their effects in common, and could not dispose of any part of them. Every bakehouse had a patronus intrusted with the superintendence of it; and these patroni again elected one of their number every year, who had superintendence over all the rest, and the care of the college. Out of the body of the bakers one was every now and then admitted among the senators; and to preserve honour and honesty in the college, they were expressly prohibited all alliance with comedians and gladiators. Every one had his own shop or bakehouse, and they were distributed into fourteen regions or wards of the city. They were excused from guardianships and other offices which might divert them from their employment. By British statutes bakers are declared not to be handicraftsmen. No man for using the mysteries or sciences of baking, brewing, surgery, or writing, shall be interpreted a handicraftsman. The bakers were a brotherhood in England before the year 1155, in the reign of King Henry IL, although the white bakers were not incorporated till 1407, by King Edward III., and the brown bakers not till 1621, in King James I.’s time. The French had anciently a great baker, grand panetier de France, who had the superintendence of all the bakers of Paris.
