BOOTY, whatever is taken from an enemy in time of war. Amongst the Greeks, the booty was the common property of the army, of which the general only claimed a larger share. According to the military discipline of the Romans, spoils taken from the enemy belonged to the republic, particular persons having no right to them. The generals who piqued themselves on their probity carried it wholly to the public treasury. Amongst the Jews the booty was divided equally between the army and the people, although under the kings a different kind of distribution obtained. Amongst the Mahommedans two thirds of the spoils are allowed to the army, and the remaining third to God, to Mahommed and his relations, and to the orphans, the poor, and the pilgrims.
