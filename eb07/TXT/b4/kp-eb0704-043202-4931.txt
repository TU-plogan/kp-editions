BASS, the lowest of the four parts of music. The term is derived either from the Greek word βαg∣ς, a foundation, or from the Italian adjective basso, signifying low. Of all the parts it is the most important, as upon it the chords proper to constitute a particular harmony are determined; and hence the maxim among musicians, that when the bass is properly formed the harmony can scarcely be bad.

Basses are of different kinds. Thorough-Bass is the harmony made by the bass-viols or theorbos, continuing to play both while the voices sing and the other instruments perform their parts, and also filling up the intervals when any of the other parts stop. Counter-Bass is a second or double bass, where there are several in the same concert.

Bass- Viol, a musical instrument, of a similar form with that of a violin, but much larger. It is struck with a bow as the violin is; it has the same number of strings; and it has eight stops, which are subdivided into semistops. Its sound is grave, and has a much nobler effect in a concert than that of the violin.

Bass, Isle of, a rock, about a mile in circumference, situated on the coast of East Lothian, near the entrance of the Frith of Forth, and at a short distance from the town of North Berwick. It is steep and inaccessible on all sides, except to the south-west; and even there it is with some difficulty that a single person can ascend. In ancient times it belonged to a family of the name of Lauder; and although long solicited by royalty, it was not acquired till 1671, when Charles II. purchased it. Its insulated situation and inaccessible nature soon suggested the idea of a state prison, which was accordingly erected in the reign of Charles, or in that of his brother James, together with some trifling fortifications. It was here that some of the Covenanters were confined, who had been found in arms against their king. At the revolution a party of King James’s adherents got possession of the rock, which having a fountain sufficient to supply water on its su∏> mit, with pasturage for the maintenance of a few sheep and a small rabbit-warren, they were enabled to retain and carried on their piratical operations by means of a boat, which they hoisted upon the rock, out of the reach of attack, and let down at pleasure. This party captured a great many vessels, and held out for King James long after the whole of Great Britain had submitted. Their boat, however, was at last seized or lost, upon which they were obliged to surrender for want of provisions. After this the island was dismantled of its fortifications. It i s now the property of Sir Hew Dalrymple Hamilton of North Berwick. There is a cavern which runs quite through the rock, and is accessible at low water, affording refuge for a multitude of wild pigeons. The sea-fowl which resort to this spot during the breeding season nearly cover its sides and a large portion of its surface. Of these the gannet or solan goose is the principal; with puffins, cormorants, and kittywakes. The island is farmed at a considerable rent by a poulterer in Edinburgh, who derives his returns from the young of the solan geese, which are still brought to market, and the eggs of the other birds. The rock consists of greenstone and trap tuff. Long. 2. 15. W. Lat. 56. 3. N.

Bass’s Straits, the channel which separates New Holland from Van Diemen’s Land. It is nearly fifty leagues in length from east to west, and about the same breadth from north to south. The navigation of this strait is rendered dangerous in some parts by several groups of islands, mostly barren and unproductive, which are scattered through it. Van Diemen’s Land was supposed by all the earlier navigators to form a part of New Holland; until Mr Bass, a surgeon of a man-of-war, thought that there were indications of a channel. This conjecture was found to be correct; and the channel has since received his name.
