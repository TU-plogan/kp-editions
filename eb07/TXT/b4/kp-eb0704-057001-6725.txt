BENGUELA, a considerable country on the western coast of Africa, between Congo and Angola. Being occupied by the Portuguese, to the exclusion of all other European nations, the knowledge of it is withheld from the latter with the most jealous care. The general observations made upon the coast of Angola will in a great measure apply to it. The air is said to be unwholesome and the water bad, while the natives are extremely rude and uncivilized. The mountains contain mines of copper, which is extracted only in very small quantities. The Portuguese have formed the port of St Philipe de Benguela on the Bahia das Vallas or Coneâ€™s Bay, and have [7:4:571]made it the centre of their trade upon this coast, which is carried on chiefly with the view of procuring slaves. The articles almost exclusively in demand among the natives are coral and beads, which are not only used as ornaments, but circulate as money. The few ships also which now pass to and from the East Indies touch here for refreshment. Long. 13. 30. E. Lat. 12. 28. S.
