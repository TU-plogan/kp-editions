BARLOW, William, bishop of Chichester, descended of an ancient family in Wales, was born in the county of Essex. In his youth he favoured the Reformation, and travelled into Germany to be instructed by Luther and other preachers of the new doctrine. How long he continued a Protestant is uncertain; but from his letter to king Henry VIII. quoted bclow, it appears that he wrote several books against the church of Rome. However, he was a regular canon in the Augustine monastery of St Osith in the county of Essex, and studied some time at Oxford with the brothers of that order, where he took the degree of doctor in divinity. He was then made prior of the convent at Bisham in Berkshire, and afterwards succeeded to the several priories of Blackmore, Typtree, Lega, Bromhole, and Haverford-West. On the dissolution of abbeys, he not only resigned with a good grace, but persuaded several other abbots to follow his example. King Henry was so pleased with his ready obedience on this occasion, that he sent him in 1535 on an embassy to Scotland, in the same year made him bishop of St Asaph, in two months after translated him to the see of St Davids, and in 1547 to that of Bath and Wells. During this time he was, or pretended to be, a stanch Papist; but when Edward VI. came to the crown, he again became a Protestant; and for that reason, on Queen Mary’s accession, was deprived of his bishopric, and sent prisoner to the Fleet, where he continued for some time. At length he found means to escape, and immediately joined the other English Protestants in Germany. When Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne, our prelate was raised to the see of Chichester, and soon after made first prebendary of the collegiate church of Westminster. He died in 1568, and was buried in the cathedral of Chichester. He had five daughters, each of whom married a bishop. He wrote, 1. The Buryal of the Masse; 2. The Climbing up °f -^ r y~ ers and lieligious Persons, portred with Figures; 3. Christian Homilies; 4. A book upon Cosmography > ð· ^ >e Godly and Pious Institution of a Christian Man, commonly called the Bishop’s Booh; and several other works. He [7:4:381]is said to have translated the Apocrypha as far as the Book of Wisdom.

Barlow, William, a mathematician and divine, the son of the bishop of Chichester, was born in Pembrokeshire, whilst his father was bishop of St David’s. In 1560 he was entered a commoner of Balliol College, in Oxford; and in 1564 took a degree in arts, after which he left the university and went to sea, but in what capacity is uncertain: however, he acquired considerable knowledge in the art of navigation. About the year 1573 he entered into orders, and became prebendary of Winchester, and rector of Easton, near that city. In 1588 he was made prebendary of Lichfield, which he exchanged for the place of treasurer of that church. Some years after he was made chaplain to Prince Henry, the son of King James I., and, in 1614, archdeacon of Salisbury. He was the first writer on the nature and properties of the magnet. Barlow died in the year 1625, and was buried in the church at Easton. His works arc, 1. The Navigator s Supply, containing many things of principal importance belonging to navigation, and use of diverse instruments framed chiefly for that purpose. London, 1597, 4to. 2. Magnetical Advertisements, or diverse pertinent observations and approved experiments concerning the nature and properties of the loadstone. London, 1616, 4to. 3. A Brief Discovery of the Idle Animadversions of Mark Ridley, Μ. D., upon a Treatise entitled Magnetical Advertisements. London, 1618, 4to.

Barlow, Thomas, born in 1607, was appointed fellow of Queen’s College, Oxford, in 1633, and two years after chosen reader of metaphysics to the university. He was keeper of the Bodleian library, and in 1657 was chosen provost of Queen’s College. After the restoration of King Charles II. he was nominated one of the commissioners for restoring the members unjustly expelled in 1648. He wrote at that time The Case of Toleration in Matters of Religion, to Mr R. Boyle. In 1675 he was made bishop of Lincoln. After the popish plot he published several tracts against the Roman Catholic religion, in which he showed an uncommon extent of learning, and skill in polemical divinity. Nevertheless, when the duke of York was proclaimed king, he took all opportunities of expressing his affection towards him; but after the Revolution he as readily voted that the king had abdicated his kingdom, and was very rigorous in excluding from their benefices such of the clergy as refused the oaths.

Mr Granger observes that “this learned prelate, whom nature designed for a scholar, and who acted in conformity with the bent of nature, was perhaps as great a master of the learned languages, and of the works of the celebrated authors who have written in those languages, as any man in his age. The greatest part of his writings, of which Mr Wood has given us a catalogue, are against popery; and his conduct for some time, like that of other Calvinists, appeared to be in direct opposition to the church of Rome. But after James ascended the throne, he seemed to approach much nearer to popery than he had ever done before. He sent the king an address of thanks for his declaration in favour of liberty of conscience, and is said to have written reasons for reading that declaration. His compliances were much the same after the Revolution. His moderation, to call it by the softest name, was very great; indeed, so great as to bring the firmness of his character into question. But casuistry reconciles seeming contradictions. He was, abstracted roirι 1 j this laxity of principles, a very great and worthy man. He died at Buckden, in Huntingdonshire, on the , -h of October 1691, in the 85th year of his age.

1 ∖√ l ° w, F rαιlc ι s > an English painter, was born in Lineonshire. On his coming to London he was placed with one Shephard, a limner; but his genius led him chiefly to the drawing of birds, fishes, and other animals. There are six books of animals from his drawings; and he painted some ceilings with birds for noblemen and gentlemen in the country. His etchings are numerous, but his illustration of Aesop is his greatest work. He died in 1702. There is something pleasing in the composition and manner of this master, though neither is excellent. His drawing too is very indifferent, nor does he characterize any animal justly. His birds in general are better than his beasts.

Barlow, Joel, an American literary and political character of considerable note, was born in the year 1756, in the village of Reading, state of Connecticut, and appears to have been the youngest of ten children. His father died when he was yet a boy; but his friends, attentive to his instruction, employed his portion of the paternal inheritance for his education, at the College of Newhaven, in his native state. Here he commenced his studies in 1774. In the course of the prescribed exercises of composition he discovered a taste for poetry, and two productions crept into public view, one entitled The Prospect of Peace; the other An Blegy on the Death of Mr Hosmer, member of the American congress. It appears that Mr Barlow was destined for the clerical profession; and that his friends solicited and obtained for him the appointment of chaplain to a militia company of Massachusetts, the functions of which he performed till the event of peace. One of his panegyrists has observed, in reference to his subsequent change of profession, that, “amongst the Presbyterians of New England, the priesthood is nothing else than a species of civil ordination. He who receives it may pass to another employment; and it is common enough to see young men preach the gospel in order to have time to prepare themselves for another profession.” This explanation, however, is hardly reconcilable with the spirit of the New England theologians, who even now require from the candidate for holy orders a solemn declaration, that he is moved to this calling by a certain species of inspiration or divine impulse, and not by any carnal or interested motive.

In 1781, while he followed the army in quality of chaplain, he contracted a marriage with Miss Baldwin of Newhaven; and it was during this period of his life that he planned the edifice of his future fame in his poem destined to celebrate the discovery and prospects of America. It was also during this period that the patriarchs of Connecticut proposed to adopt a new metrical translation of the psalms, which excited to emulation all the poetical genius of the state. The version of Barlow carried the prize, and is to this day sung in the churches of New England.

At the conclusion of peace between the United States and Great Britain, he abandoned the ecclesiastical life, and settled at the village of Hartford, where, two years afterwards, he published the poem alluded to, entitled The Vision of Columbus, which he afterwards gave to the world in a more expanded and imposing form.

After quitting the service of the church, he appears for some time to have practised law; but in 1788 he likewise abandoned that profession to become the agent of a mercantile company, who had purchased some millions of acres of land situated on or near the river Ohio, which they proposed to sell to foreigners at an enhanced price. For this purpose Mr Barlow was sent to Europe; and it is said that he was fortunate in the execution of this commission.

Having during this period become deeply interested by the events of the French revolution, he published, in the yeará 1791 and 1792, the following political pieces:—
[7:4:382]

1. Advice to the Privileged Orders. 2. The Conspiracy of Kings. 3. Letter to the National Convention of France. 4. The Royal Recollections. Towards the end of the year 1792, he, being then in London, was appointed by the Constitutional Society of London one of a deputation to present an address to the National Convention of France; a circumstance which attracted the notice of the British Parliament, it having been stated by a member that the Convention had received an address by means of two fellows calling themselves the representatives of Great Britain, viz. Frost and Barlow.

In 1793 Barlow, from motives of curiosity, accompanied the four commissioners of the National Convention who were sent to Mont Blanc to organize that department; and this excursion gave rise to another production, entitled A Letter to die People of Piedmont. About this time, also, he translated Volney’s well-known work, entitled Ruins of Empires.

Objects of a commercial nature at length drew him to Hamburg, and afterwards to the coast of Africa, where he received the commission of consul-general of the United States, with instructions to enter into and conclude treaties with the Barbary powers for the purpose of procuring the ransom of the American citizens who were detained as slaves in those countries. The execution of this commission was prompt and fortunate; and, after residing for some time in Paris, to which he returned from Barbary, he, in 1805, proceeded to America, and purchased a neat habitation in the territory of Columbia, the seat of the general government, to which he gave the name of Kahrarna. Here he formed an acquaintance with certain considerable members of Congress, to whom he greatly recommended himself by the publication of a short sketch of a plan of national education, and an address to the citizens of Washington upon occasion of one of the anniversaries of American independence. He now also published the superb quarto edition of his national poem, to which he finally gave the name of The Columbian.

Soon after his return from Europe, he was admitted to the confidence of the first magistrate of the United States; and, in 1811, he received the valued appointment of minister-plenipotentiary to the court of France. This nomination met with powerful opposition in the senate, and passed only by a small majority.

He sailed for his destination on board of the Constitution frigate, disembarked at Cherbourg in September 1812, and proceeded to the French capital, where he was received, in the emperor’s absence, by the minister of foreign affairs, who “was instructed to say the most flattering things relative to his appointment.” The great object of his mission was to obtain compensation for the American property confiscated in virtue of the Berlin and Milan decrees. This arrangement was to be regulated in a manner the least onerous to the French treasury. American ships and cargoes were, at the same time, to be freed from unjust detention, and a new commercial treaty to be formed on principles of national justice and reciprocity.

In pursuit of this object he followed the Emperor Napoleon to Wilna in the memorable winter of 1812; but this diplomatic journey was without advantage, and the failure was the more mortifying, as it was undertaken without the advice or instructions of the American government. Mr Barlow was returning to Paris, when he was seized with a violent inflammatory disease, of which he died on the 26th of December, in the fifty-eighth year of his age. His nephew, a midshipman on board of the Constitution frigate, whom he took from his studies to accompany him in this journey, and a secretary of the French Legation in the United States, were witnesses of his last moments, and saw him interred at the place where he closed his eyes, an obscure village of Poland.
