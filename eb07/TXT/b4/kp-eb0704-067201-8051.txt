BLAIR-ATHOLE, or Blair in Athole, a village and parish in the county of Perth and district of A thole. containing a population of about 3000, and distant eighteen miles from Dunkeld, thirty-three from Perth, and seventy-six from Edinburgh. The village has almost completely decayed out; but the parish is nevertheless remarkable for its interesting localities, striking scenery, and mineral products, particularly marble, which is found in considerable abundance, and of almost every variety of colour, though somewhat coarsely grained, in the valley of the Tilt. One of the most conspicuous objects to the eye of the tourist is Blair Castle, a seat belonging to the Duke of Atholl, and formerly a baronial fortress, though now despoiled of its battlements and other castellated honours. It was occupied by the Marquis of Montrose in 1644; stormed by a party under the command of one of Cromwell’s officers in 1653; and gallantly defended by Sir Andrew Agnew, in 1746, when besieged by a portion of the Highland army, until he was relieved by the Hessians under the Earl of Crawford. The falls of Bruar, celebrated by Burns, are two miles to the westward,—and the pass of Killickrankie, famous for the battle which was there fought in 1689, between the Highlanders under Viscount Dundee, and King William’s troops under General Mackay, is about an equal distance to the eastward, of Blair Castle. The old church of Blair, now in ruins, is said to contain the ashes of Dundee, who fell early in the action, and for whose memory the few lingering remnants of the ancient race of Highlanders still cherish a sort of traditional veneration; for the “bloody Clavers” of the southern and western counties appeared in a totally different light to the men who shared his loyalty, and willingly drew their swords in the cause around the expiring effort of which he shed the momentary and meteoric brilliancy of a bootless victory.
