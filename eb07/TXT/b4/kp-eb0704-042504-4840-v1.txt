BASHEE Isles, a cluster of small islands in the Chinese Sea, due north of Luzon, the largest of the Philippines. They are five in number, with four rocky islets. They were visited by Dampier the English navigator in 1687, and named by him Orange, Monmouth, Grafton, Goats, and Bashee Island. These islands possess a fertile soil, and produce abundance of potatoes and yams; as also sugar-canes, pine-apples, bananas, and plantains. Orange Island is twenty-two miles long by six broad. Grafton Island is about thirteen milcs in circumference, and has good anchorage on the western side, with abundance of very fine water close to the beach. The inhabitants are described by Dampier as short and squat in stature, and of a dark copper colour. Iron was formerly a favourite article of exchange with them, but the use of money is now also understood. These islands were visited by Dampier, and were afterwards seen by Byron and Wallis. The Spaniards took possession of them in 1783, being tempted by the gold which is washed down by the mountain torrents, and manufactured by the inhabitants into a thick wire, which they wear as an ornament. The Spanish governor resides at Grafton Island, with about 100 soldiers. These islands are situated between the 20th and 21st degrees of N. lat.
