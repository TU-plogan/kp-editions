BARBAROSSA, Aruch and Hayraddin, two famous corsairs, the sons of a potter in the Isle of Lesbos, who, turning pirates, carried on their depredations with such success and conduct, that they soon became possessed of twelve galleys besides smaller vessels. Of this fleet Aruch, the elder brother, called Barbarossa from the redness of his beard, was admiral, and Hayraddin the second in command. They called themselves the “friends of the sea,” and the li enemies of all who sailed upon it;” and their names became terrible from the straits of the Dardanelles to those of Gibraltar. But with this power they wanted an establishment. The opportunity of settling themselves, however, presented itself in 1516, in consequence of an inconsiderate application made to them by Euteni, king of Algiers, for assistance against the Spaniards. Aruch, leaving his brother to command the fleet, carried 5000 men to Algiers, where he was received as a deliverer; and secretly murdering the prince he had come to aid, caused himself to be proclaimed king in his stead. To this usurpation he added the conquest of Tremecen, when his exploits and piracies induced the Emperor Charles V. to furnish the marquis de Gomarez, governor of Oran, with troops to put him down; which was accordingly done, as he was defeated and killed near Tremecen. His brother Hayraddin, known also by the name of Barbarossa, assumed the sceptre at Algiers with the same abilities, and with better fortune; for the Spaniards being too much employed in Europe to give him any disturbance, he regulated the interior police of his kingdom with great prudence, carried on his naval operations with vigour, and extended his conquests on the continent of Africa. He put his dominions under the protection of the Grand Signior, Suleiman the Magnificent, and obtained the command of the Turkish fleet. With so powerful a protector he acquired the kingdom of Tunis, in a manner similar to that by which his brother obtained Algiers.
