BALNAVES, Henry, a Scottish protestant, born in the shire of Fife in the reign of James V., and educated at the university of St Andrews. He went afterwards to France in order to finish his studies, and returning to Scotland, was admitted into the family of the earl of Arran, who at that time governed the kingdom; but, in the year 1542, the earl dismissed him for having embraced the protestant religion. In 1564 he joined (says Mackenzie) the murderers of Cardinal Beaton; for which he was declared a traitor, and excommunicated. Whilst that party were besieged in the castle of St Andrews, they sent Balnaves to England, who returned with a considerable supply of money and provisions; but being at last obliged to surrender to the French, he was sent with the rest of the garrison a prisoner to France. During his confinement at Rouen he wrote the work entitled Confession of Faith; but it was not published till 1584, five years after his death. He returned to Scotland about the year 1559, and having joined the Congregation, was appointed one of the commissioners to treat with the duke of Norfolk on the part of Queen Elizabeth. In 1563 he was made one of the Lords of Session, and appointed by the General Assembly, with other learned men, to revise the Booh of Discipline. Knox, his contemporary and fellow-labourer, gives him the character of a very learned and pious man. Balnaves died at Edinburgh in the year 1579.
