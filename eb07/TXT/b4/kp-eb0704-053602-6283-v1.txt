BEECH-Mast, the fruit of the beech-tree, said to be good for fattening hogs, deer, and other animals. It has sometimes proved a useful substitute for bread. Chios is said to have endured a memorable siege by means of it.

Beech- Oil, an oil drawn by expression from the mast of the beech-tree, after it has been shelled and pounded. This oil is very common in Picardy, and is used there and in other parts of France instead of butter; but most of those who take a great deal of it complain of pains and a heaviness in the stomach.
