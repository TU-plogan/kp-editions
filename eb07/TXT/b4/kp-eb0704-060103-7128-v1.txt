BESSICA, in Ancient Geography, a district of Thrace, towards Mount Haemus, to the south of the Hebrus. It was inhabited by a fierce and barbarous people, noted for their robberies. Their chief city, Uscudama, is now known by the name of Adrianople. They lived under their own kings till the consulate of Μ. Licinius Lucullus and C. Cassius Varus, when the consul Lucullus invaded their country, and, having gained a great victory over them, took their metropolis, and subjected the whole nation to the power of Rome.
