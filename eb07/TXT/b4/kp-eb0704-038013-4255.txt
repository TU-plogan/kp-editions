BARLETTA, a city in the province of Bari, in the kingdom of Naples. It is the seat of an archbishop, and was formerly fortified, but its defences are now in a dilapidated condition. It contains 17,950 inhabitants, who export much salt, made by evaporation in a large lagoon, and also considerable quantities of oil, wine, and almonds. The harbour is shallow, and all the water of the springs of rather a saline quality.
