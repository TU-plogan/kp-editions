BENTIVOGLIO, Guido, cardinal, born at Ferrara in the year 1579. He went to study at Padua, where lie made considerable proficiency in what is sometimes called polite literature. Upon his leaving the university, he went to reside at Rome, where he became universally esteemed. He was sent as nuneio, first to Flanders, and then to France; and in both employments he acted in such a manner as to give great satisfaction to Paul V., who made him a cardinal a little before his own death, which happened on the 28th of January 1621. Bentivoglio was at this time in France, where Louis XIII. and all the French court congratulated him on his new dignity; and when he returned to Rome, his Most Christian Majesty intrusted him with the management of the French affairs at that court. Pope Urban VIII. had a high regard for him on account of his fidelity, disinterestedness, and consummate knowledge of business; he was beloved by the people, and esteemed by the eardinals; and his qualities were such, that he had a fair prospect of being raised to the pontificate on the death of Urban, which happened on the 29th of July 1644. But having gone to the conclave during the time of the greatest heat at Rome, it affected his health to such a degree that he could not sleep for eleven nights afterwards; and this want of rest threw him into a fever, of which he died on the 7th of September 1644, in the sixty-fifth year of his age. He has left several works, the most remarkable of which are, A History of the Civil Wars of Flanders; An Account of Flanders; with Letters and Memoirs.
