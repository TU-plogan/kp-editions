BIGGLESWADE, a market-town of the hundred of Biggleswade, in the county of Bedford, forty-five miles from London, and five from Bedford. It is on the river Ivel, which is navigable to Lynn by the Ouse. The land near it is remarkably prolific, and is let at a higher rent than in any other part of England. It is chiefly cultivated as gardens, and yields abundant crops of culinary vegetables, and a large supply of seeds for the London seedsmen. The market is held on Wednesday, and is much frequented. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1790, in 1811 to 1895, and in 1821 to 2778; including the two hamlets of Holme and Stratton, which form part of the parish.
