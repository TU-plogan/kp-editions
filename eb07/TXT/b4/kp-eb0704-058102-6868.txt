BERCHTESGADEN, or Berchtolsgaden, a small town, most beautifully situated on the eastern confines of Bavaria, to which kingdom it was united in 1809. It has been long celebrated for its extensive mines of rock-salt, which were commenced working in the year 1628, and are the source whence all Bavaria is supplied with that necessary article of life. As the salt occurs in an impure state, it is most easily obtained by dissolving it in its natural depository. Fresh water is brought in from the upper part of the mine, which, after acting a certain time upon the salt-rock, becomes brine, and in that state is run off in pipes, either to the evaporating houses or to a reservoir in the vicinity; whence, by the aid of two celebrated water column engines, constructed by Reichenbach of Munich, it is raised 1500 feet, and thereafter conducted to Traunstein and Rosenheim, about forty miles farther into the country. The town contains two large churches, and some good houses. Its inhabitants, amounting to about 1000, are principally employed in the mines and the manufacture of salt. Some few also are engaged in making toys and small articles from the stag and chamois horns. Its vicinity comprehends the most picturesque portion of Bavaria; the snow caped peaks of the Watzman towering over it to the height of 7000 feet, while the Königsee at its foot, one of the wildest lakes among the Alps, is not exceeded by any either in beauty or sublimity. The small red trout of the Königsee, called by the common people schwartzreitic, are highly prized; and no portion of the Alpine range is better supplied with game, particularly the stag, the chamois, and the steinbok or ibex, an animal elsewhere almost extinct.
