BILMA, a town situated in the heart of the African desert, being the capital of the wandering tribe called the Tibboos. The place is mean and poor, surrounded with a mud wall. In its vicinity are a number of lakes, the waters of which, on evaporation by the heat of the sun, yield a quantity of very pure and fine salt.' The largest of these lakes is at Agram, situated aboutfour miles to the westward. This salt is the object of a very extensive and important trade, which consists in conveying the commodity to the countries in Central Africa. The Tibboos, however, an unwarlike race, are unable to secure to themselves the enjoyment of these natural treasures, but have the chagrin of seeing the Tuaricks, their neighbours, come and load their camels with this valuable article, which they then convey to the countries in the south. Near Bilma is a small circular spot, in which several springs bubble up, and maintain a brilliant verdure; but immediately to the south begins the most dreary part of the African desert, over which the caravans travel for fifteen days without discovering the slightest trace of vegetable life. *
