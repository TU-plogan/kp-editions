BEEDER, a province of Hindostan, in the Deccan, situated principally between the 16th and 18th degrees of N. lat. It is bounded on the north by Aurungabad and Berar, on the south by the province of Hyderabad, o the cast by Hyderabad and Gundwana, and on the west by Aurungabad and Bejapoor. This country is comprehended in the dominions subject to the Nizam, and is governed by his officers. It is of an uneven and hilly surface, but not mountainous, and is watered by many sma ' rivers, which flow into the larger streams of the Beema, Krishna, and Godavery. The country is in general pio-ductive, and was flourishing and populous under the old Hindoo government; but it is now thinly inhabited, compared[7:4:537] with the British provinces. Although this province has long been ruled by princes of the Mahommedan persuasion, the Hindoos form the great bulk of the population, exceeding the Mahommedans in the proportion of ten to one. The largest rivers are the Godavery and Manjera, and the chief towns Beeder, Calberga, Nundere, and Calliany. After the Mahommedan conquest this province was the seat of a dynasty of Deccan sovereigns, who began to reign in a. d. 1347. Along with the other Deccan provinces, the country fell under the Mogul dominion towards the conclusion of the seventeenth century, during the reign of Aurungzebe, from whose successors it was separated in 1717 by Nizam ul Muluck, and has ever since remained in the possession of his posterity.

Beeder, the capital of the above province, is situated in an open plain, except on the east side, where the ground rises to the height of about 100 yards. This place is fortified with a stone wall about six miles in circumference, a dry ditch, and many round towers. The town is much decayed, but the remains of many old buildings are still visible. Before the Mahommedan invasion it was the seat of a Hindoo sovereignty. The travelling distance from Hyderabad is 78 miles, from Delhi 857, from Madras 430, and from Calcutta 980 miles.
