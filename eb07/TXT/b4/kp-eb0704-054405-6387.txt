BELIAL, ⅛jr>⅛, a Hebrew word, which signifies a wicked worthless man, one who is resolved to endure no subjection. Thus the inhabitants of Gibeah, who abused the Levite’s wife, have the name of Belial given them; and Hophni and Phineas, the sons of the high priest Eli, are likewise called sons of Belial, on account of the crimes they had committed, and the unbecoming manner in which they bad behaved themselves in the temple of the Lord. Sometimes the name Belial is used to denote the devil. Thus St Paul says, “What concord hath Christ with Belial? From which it appears that, in the apostle’s time, the Jews, by this epithet, commonly understood the devil. Milton also speaks of “the sons of Belial,” meaning thereby the children of the devil.
