BAREILLY, a large and populous city of Hindostan, in the province of Delhi, and capital of the district of Bareilly, and of Rohilcund generally. It is situated at the confluence of the Jooah and Sunkra, and formed the capital of a Rohilla chief, who was slain at the battle of Cutterah, and who lies interred there. The travelling distance from Delhi is 142 miles; from Calcutta by Moorshedabad 910; from Lucknow 156 miles. Long. 70. 21. E. Lat. 28. 22. N. The district of Bareilly is bounded by the Ganges on the west, and is well watered by many other smaller rivers. The chief towns are Bareilly, Bissoneta, Anop-sheher, Moradabad, Rampoor, and Budayon. In summer, notwithstanding its northern latitude, the heat is intense; but in winter water sometimes freezes in the tents. After the cruel devastation of Rohilcund in 1774 by Sujah ud Dowlah, aided by the British troops, the country became a complete waste. In 1802 it was ceded to the British, and under their protection it was improved, and began to recover from the state of desolation into which it had fallen. The natives are a tall, handsome race of people, and white, compared with the more southern inhabitants of India. Rohilcund, Furruckabad, and the upper part of the country between the Jumna and the Ganges, abound with a warlike race of Mahommedans, the relics of that disorderly banditti of Pindarees or Patans who were crushed by the British armies in 1817. They are disaffected to the British because they have been forced to remain at peace, and to abandon their lawless habits of rapine for those of industry. TheMahommedan inhabitants of this district approach nearer to an equality of numbers with the Hindoos than in any other part of Hindostan, though even here they are still inferior.
