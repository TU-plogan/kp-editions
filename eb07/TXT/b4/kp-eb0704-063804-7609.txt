BIGHORN River, a river of North America, which is said to rise in the Rocky Mountains, near the Yellow Stone River and the sources of the Platte, and then to find its way through the eastern range of the Rocky Mountains. Taking a northerly direction, it falls into the Yellow Stone River in about the 47th degree of north latitude. In its long course it receives two considerable rivers, one from the west and the other from the south, called Little Bighorn river; and being unobstructed by falls, it is navigable to a great distance in canoes through a fine, rich, open country, well supplied with timber. There are no permanent settlers near it; but the whole country which it waters is occasionally visited by roving bands of Indian hunters.
