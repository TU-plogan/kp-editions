BEERALSTON, a borough-town in the parish of Beer-feris and hundred of Roborough, in the county of Devon, 215 miles from London, and near the navigable river Tamar. It returns two members to parliament, who are chosen by the holders of ancient burgages, the majority of which are the property of the earl of Beverley. As there are few houses, the elections of magistrates as well as of members are held under a large tree.
