BLOWING, in a general sense, denotes an agitation of the air, whether performed with a pair of bellows, the mouth, a tube, or the like.

Blowing, among gardeners, denotes the action of flowers, in opening and displaying their leaves. In this sense, blowing is the same with flowering or blossoming.

The regular blowing season is in the spring, although [7:4:717] some plants have other extraordinary times and manners of blowing, as the Glastonbury thorn. Different flowers, also, as the tulip, close every evening, and blow again in the morning. Annual plants blow sooner or later according as their seeds are put in the ground; and hence the curious in gardening sow some every month in summer, to have a constant succession of flowers. The blowing of roses may be retarded by shearing off the buds as they are put forth.

Blowing of Glass, one of the methods of forming the various kinds of work in the glass manufacture. It is performed by dipping the point of an iron blow-pipe in the melted glass, and blowing through it with the mouth, according to the dimensions of the glass to be blown. See Glass. Blowing of Tin denotes the melting its ore, after being first burnt to destroy the mundic.
