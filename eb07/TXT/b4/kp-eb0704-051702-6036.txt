BEDNORE, a town of Hindostan, in the territories of the rajah of Mysore. This was once a place of great importance, containing, it is said, 20,000 houses, besides huts. It was taken and plundered by Hyder in 1763, who changed its name to Hydernagur, and at that time it was estimated at eight miles in circumference. It was again taken in 1786, and given up to be plundered, by a British detachment, which was attacked in its turn, and destroyed or made prisoners, by Tippoo’s troops. At Tippoo’s death it contained 1500 houses, besides huts. Long. 75. 6. E. Lat. 13. 48. N.

The district of Bednore is situated on the summit of that range of hills, the Western Ghauts, which overlooks the provinces of Cinara and Malabar. In consequence of its elevation above the sea, and the steepness of the mountain chain, which rises like a wall to the height of 4000 or 5000 feet, the clouds of the western monsoon are here intercepted, and are precipitated on the ground below in deluges of rain, which continue for nine months in the year, and are extremely favourable to vegetation. Its products are pepper, betel-nut, cardamums, and sandal wood. Cattle of small size are also bred in the district, and exported to the sea-coast. The imports are salt, rice, cocoa nuts, oil, turmeric, and cotton cloths.
