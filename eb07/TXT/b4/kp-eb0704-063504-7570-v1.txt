BIDDING, or Offering, denotes the raising the price of an article or commodity at a sale or auction. The French call this enchérir; and it answers to what was called licitari by the Romans, who used to bid by holding up the hand or finger.

Bidding is also used for proclaiming or notifying; in which sense we meet with “bidding of the banns,” the same with what is otherwise called “asking.”

Bidding Prayer. It was one part of the office of the deacons in the primitive Christian church to act as monitors and directors of the people in the exercise of their public devotions in the church; to which end they made use of certain known forms of words, to give notice when each part of the service began. This was called by the Greeks xηξυrτnν, and by the Latins praedicare, which therefore does not ordinarily signify to “preach,” as some mistake it, but to perform the office of crier (%^υξ, or preecd) in the assembly; and hence Synesius and others call the deacons iiΡοxηξυ×iς, the “holy criers” of the church, appointed to bid or exhort the congregation to pray and join in the several parts of the service of the church. Agreeably to this ancient practice is the form “Let us pray,” repeated before several of the prayers in the English liturgy, and used as a sort of proem in the simpler invocations of the Presbyterian church.
