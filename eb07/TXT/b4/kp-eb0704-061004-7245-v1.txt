BHADRINATH, a town and celebrated temple in Hindostan, in the province of Serinaghur, situated on the west bank of the Alcanunda river, in the middle of a valley nearly four miles in length and one in breadth. The town is small, containing only twenty or thirty huts, in which reside the Brahmins and the attendants on the temple, which is considered a place of high sanctity. The building, however, by no means corresponds to its great celebrity. It is about forty or fifty feet in height, built in the foιm of a cone, with a small cupola, on the top of which is a gilt ball and spire. I he image is of the human form, of black stone, and about three feet in height. It is called Bhadruathj the Lord of Purity, and is resorted to by pil grims from all parts of India. The concourse of persons is said to be 50,000 annually, all of whom make their offerings at the shrine; besides which it is said to possess 700 villages. The temple has been shattered by anearth-^ quake, which has left it in a ruinous condition. This place is situated among mountains elevated 22,000 feet above the level of the sea, and in May 1808 the road to it was still encumbered by masses of snow. Long. 79 38. E. Lat. 30. 43. N. "
