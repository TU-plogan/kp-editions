BOND, John, a commentator on Horace and Persius, was born in Somersetshire in the year 1550, and educated at Winchester school. In 1569 he was entered a student of the university of Oxford, probably in the New College, of which he became either one of the clerks or chaplains. He took his degree as bachelor of arts in 1573, and that of master in 1579; soon after which he was appointed by his college, master of the free school at Taunton in Somersetshire. In this situation he continued many years with considerable reputation; but being at length weary of the laborious occupation of teacher, he commenced physician, and, it is said, became eminent in that capacity. He died in the year 1612, possessed of several lands and tenements in his neighbourhood; but whether acquired by the practice of physic or otherwise, does not appear. He wrote, 1. Commentarii in Poemata Q. Horatii, London, 1606, 8vo; and, 2. Commentarii in sex Satyras Persii, London, 1614, 8vo. Hisshort marginal annotations upon Horace and Persius are generally feeble, and without erudition; notwithstanding which his edition of the former poet has often been reprinted. Saxius describes him as minorum gentium philologus.
