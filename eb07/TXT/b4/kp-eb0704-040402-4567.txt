BARONIUS, Caesar, a pious and learned cardinal, was born at Sore in 1538. He studied at Rome, and put himself under the discipline of Philip de Neri. In 1593 he was made general of the congregation of the Oratory by the resignation of the founder Philip de Neri. Pope Clement VIII. made him his confessor, and raised him to the rank of cardinal in 1596. He was afterwards made librarian to the Vatican, and died in 1605, at the age of sixty-eight. He wrote several works, the principal of which is his Annales Ecclesiastici from a. d. 1 to 1198, in 12 vols. folio; a work which has been abridged by several persons, particularly by Henry Spondaeus, Bzovius, and Ludovico Aurelio.
