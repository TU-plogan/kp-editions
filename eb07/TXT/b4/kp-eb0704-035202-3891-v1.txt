BANTAM, a town of Java, capital of a district of the same name, at the north-western extremity of the island, situated on the Bay of Bantam, near the mouth of a river which falls into the bay. It was once a large, rich, and flourishing city, but now exhibits nothing except ruins, the memorials of its departed greatness. It is about 61 miles west from Batavia, and is situated on a low, swampy beach, surrounded by jungle, and intersected with stagnant streams, so that its climate is even more unhealthy than that of Batavia. The king formerly resided in a kind of palace built in the European style, within an old ruinous fort, containing 80 pieces of cannon; and contiguous to it was the Dutch fort. All these fortifications, both European and native, the Dutch fort as well as the sultan’s fort, are levelled with the ground; and the few European habitations which have not been pulled down are falling fast into decay, and totally deserted. The court of the sultan, who resided here, had dwindled into insignificance, and the high-sounding title was merely retained. After Batavia surrendered to the British arms in 1812, this kingdom was in a state of great distraction; wherefore the British government of Batavia interfered in favour of the rightful heir, and restored him to the throne. Since that period the sultan, from apathy, and labouring under disease, has wholly resigned the government of Bantam, and voluntarily retired on a pension assigned him by the British, who took into their own hands the management of the country. In former times Bantam was a free port, open to the commerce of all nations. In 1683 the trade was monopolized by the Dutch, who erected Fort Spielwyk, to shut out all other merchants. This odious policy excited great discontents among the people, who were always the bitter enemies of the Dutch; but they were unable to shake off the yoke of their oppressors, who, about the year 1742, had succeeded in completely establishing their authority. The Bay of Bantam was formerly a commodious retreat for vessels; but it is now so choked up with daily accessions of new earth washed down from the mountains, as well as by coral shoals extending a considerable way to the eastward, that it is inaccessible to vessels of any considerable burden. Prior to the Dutch conquest, Bantam was a powerful state, the sovereign of which extended his conquests in the neighbouring islands of Borneo and Sumatra. The trade in pepper is the most considerable carried on here. Long, of the town of Bantam, 106. 3. E. Lat. 6. 4. S.
