BLACKWALL, Anthony, A.Μ. a learned author,who, after completing his academical education at Emanuel College, Cambridge, was appointed head-master of the free school at Derby, and lecturer of All-Hallows there. He first distinguished himself in the literary world by an edition of Theognis, printed at London in 1706, and was afterwards chosen head-master of the free school at Market-Bosworth in Leicestershire. The grammar, by means of which he initiated the youth under his care into Latin, was of his own composition, and so happily fitted for the purpose, that he was prevailed on to make it public, although his modesty would not permit him to prefix his name to it, because he would not be thought to prescribe to other instructors of youth. It is entitled A New Lahn Grammar; being a short, clear, and easy Introduction ο; Young Scholars to the Knowledge of the· Lahn Tongue; containing an exact Account of the two first Parts of Grammar.

the beauties of the great writers of antiquity, to the understanding and imitation even of common capacities. But his most celebrated work was, The Sacred Classics defended and illustrated; or, An Essay humbly offered towards preserving the Purity, Propriety, and True Eloquence of the Writers of the New Testament, in two vols. Mr Blackwall had the happiness to educate many excellent scholars in his seminaries at Derby and Bosworth; and amongst others the celebrated Richard Dawes, author of the Miscellanea Critica. A gentleman who had been his scholar, being patron of the church of Clapham in Surrey, presented him to that living as a mark of his gratitude and esteem. This happening late in life, and Blackwall having occasion to wait upon the bishop of the diocese, he was somewhat pertly questioned by a young chaplain as to the extent of his learning. “Boy,” replied the indignant veteran, “I have forgot more than ever you knew.” He died at Market-Bosworth, on the 8th of April 1730.
