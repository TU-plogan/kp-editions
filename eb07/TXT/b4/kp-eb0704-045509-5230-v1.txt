BAUDIUS, Dominic, professor of history in the university of Leyden, was born at Lisle on the 8th of August 1561. He began his studies at Aix-la-Chapelle, and continued them at Leyden, whence he removed to Geneva, where he studied divinity. After residing there some time he returned to Ghent, and afterwards to Leyden, where he applied himself to the study of the civil law, and was admitted doctor of law in June 1585. Soon after his admission he accompanied the ambassadors from the states to England, and during his residence in this country became acquainted with several persons of distinction, particularly the famous Sir Philip Sidney. He was admitted advocate at the Hague in January 1587; but getting soon tired of the bar, he went to travel in France, where he remained ten years. He was much esteemed in that kingdom, and gained many friends there. Achilles de Harlai, first president of the parliament of Paris, got him admitted advocate of the parliament of Paris in the year 1592. In 1602 he went to England with Christopher de Harlai, the president’s son, who was sent ambassador to the court of London by Henry the Great. But having, in the course of the same year, been named professor of eloquence at Leyden, Baudius went and settled in that university, where he read lectures on history after the death of Merula, and was also permitted to do the same on the civil law. In 1611 the states conferred upon him the office of historiographer in conjunction with Meursius; and in consequence of this appointment he wrote The History of the Truce. Baudius was a good prose writer, as appears from his letters, many of which were published after his death; and he was also a respectable Latin poet. The first edition of his poems was printed in the year 1587; but he published separately a book of iambics in 1591, dedicated to Cardinal Bourbon. Some of his poems, in the edition of 1607, he dedicated to the king of England, others to the prince of Wales, and went over to England to present them. He died at Leyden in 1613.
