BALDINGER (Ernest Godfrey), a German physician of considerable eminence, and the author of a great number of medical publications. He was born near Erfurth, 13th May 1738, and was originally destined for the church; but having acquired a strong predilection for medicine, his father yielded to his wishes, and allowed him to embrace that profession; and he prosecuted his studies with this view both at Erfurth and at Jena. In 1761 he was intrusted with the superintendence of the military hospitals connected with the Prussian encampment near dorgau; and he there gave public lectures with great applause. Having acquired considerable experience in army practice by his assiduous attention to the duties of his office, he published in 1762 a dissertation on the diseases of soldiers, which met with so favourable a reception from the public, that he enlarged the plan of his work, and republished it under the title of Treatise on the Diseases that prevail in Armies, Langensalz, 1774, 8vo. It has since gone through another edition. In 1763 he was appointed professor of medicine at Göttingen, where he enjoyed considerable reputation. The Landgrave of Hesse Cassel, Frederick IL, invited him to take up his abode at Cassel, conferring upon him the title of first physician to his court, and director-general of all his medical establishments. He was afterwards professor of the theory of medicine at Jena; and in 1785 was promoted to a professorship at Marpurg, where he died of apoplexy on the 2d of January 1804.

His writings are exceedingly numerous; many of them are scattered in various collections and journals; and, besides these, no less than eighty-four distinct treatises are mentioned as having proceeded from his pen. He had collected an extensive library, consisting of 16,000 volumes, of which a catalogue was published after his death. His funeral oration was pronounced by Professor Creut-zer. He was well versed in botany, and has published several works on that branch of natural history, of which the following are the principal: Catalogus Dissertationum quce Medicamentorum Historiam, facta, et vires exponunt. Altemburgi, 1768, 4to. On the Study of Botany, and the Method of learning it, in German. Jena, 1770, 4to. He was for many years the editor of a periodical work entitled Magazine for Physicians, 12mo, Cleves, which afterwards changed its name to the New Magazine, in 8vo, from 1779 to 1799. But the principal work of this kind which he conducted was his Sylloge Opusculorum Selectorum Argumenti Medico-Practici, being a collection of detached essays and dissertations, which extended to six vols. 8vo. Göttingen, 1766-1782.

His Litteratura Universae Materice Medicce, &c. Marpurg, 1793, 8vo, is a work of great labour, but little discrimination. He edited Baerner’s Lives of Physicians, in German. The only other work of his deserving notice, is the Historia Mercurii et Mercurialium Medica. Göttingen, 2 tom. 8vo, 1783 and 1785.
