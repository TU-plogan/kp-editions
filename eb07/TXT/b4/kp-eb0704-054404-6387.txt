BELGRADE, a famous town and fortress of European Turkey, in Servia, situated near the conflux of the Save and Danube. It is divided into four parts. First, the fortress, which stands on a steep eminence in the centre, and commands the Danube. It is inclosed with high walls, and possesses strong towers and a triple ditch, and is provided with mines and bomb-proof casemates. The principal mosque and the residence of the pasha of Scrvia are situated in this part of the town. Secondly, the water-side division, lying near to the junction of the two rivers, on the north side, likewise well defended by walls and ditches. Thirdly, the Rascian town (so called from its inhabitants), towards the west, and in the direction of the Save. And, fourthly, the Palanka, which encircles the fortress on the south and east. This important town has sustained many sieges, and repeatedly passed from the hands of the Austrians to those of the Turks. It was taken by Solyman the Turkish emperor in 1522, and retaken by the Austrians in 1688, but again lost in 1690. It remained in the hands of the Turks until 1717, when it was surrendered to Prince Eugene. The imperialists retained it until 1739, when the Turks invested and reduced it. Austria again took it in 1789, but it was restored at the peace of 1791. And, lastly, in the year 1806, the Servian insurgents succeeded in carrying it. The strength and importance of this place may be inferred from the above details. It is in many parts well built, and contains fourteen mosques. The inhabitants are about 20,000 in number, being for the most part composed of the families of Turkish Janissaries. Long. 20. 10. E. Lat. 44.43. N.
