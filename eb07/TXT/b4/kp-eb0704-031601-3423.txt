BALE, John, bishop of Ossory, in Ireland, was bornât Cove, near Dunwich, in Suffolk, in the year 1495. At twelve years of age he was entered in the monastery of Carmelites at Norwich, and thence sent some years afterwards to Jesus College in Oxford. He was educated a Roman Catholic, but afterwards converted to the Protestant religion by Thomas Lord Wentworth. On the death of Lord Cromwell, the favourite of Henry VIII. who protected him from the persecutions of the Romish clergy, he was obliged to fly into the Low Countries, where he continued eight years. Soon after the accession of Edward VI. he was recalled; and being first presented to the living of Bishop’s Stocke in Hampshire, in 1552, he was nominated to the see of Ossory. During his residence in Ireland he was remarkably assiduous in propagating the Protestant doctrines; but to very little purpose, it would seem, and frequently at the hazard of his life. On the accession of Queen Mary the tide of opposition became so powerful that, to avoid assassination, he embarked for Holland; but he was very unfortunate in his attempt to escape, being first taken by a Dutch man-of-war, and robbed by the captain of all his effects, then forced by stress of weather into St Ives in Cornwall, where he was arrested on suspicion of treason. Having obtained his release, however, after a few days’ confinement, the ship anchored in Dover road, where he was again seized on a false accusation, but soon liberated. On his arrival in Holland he was kept prisoner for three weeks, but at length obtained his liberty on paying L.30. From Holland he travelled to Basil in Switzerland, where he continued till Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne. After his return to England he was in 1560 made prebendary of Canterbury; and died in November 1563, at Canterbury, in the sixty-eighth year of his age. He was the author of many works, the most noted of which is his collection of British Biography, entitled Illustrium Majoris Britannice Scriptorum Catalogus, a Japheto sanctissimi Noae filio ad An. Bom. 1557. This work was first published in 4to in 1549, and afterwards with various additions in folio in 1559. Ames and Herbert have given the following list of his other works :—1.
