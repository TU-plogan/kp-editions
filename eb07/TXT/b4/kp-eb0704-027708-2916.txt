BADEN, a grand duchy. See Germany. Baden, or Baden-Baden, a town in the grand duchy of Baden, celebrated for its medicinal springs, which rise from twenty-six wells of the warmth of from 110° to 118° of Fahrenheit. This is a place of great resort for company in the summer, as well on account of the baths as for the picturesque scenery of the vicinity. The city contains about 3000 resident inhabitants; but the numbers visiting it in the appropriate season very far exceed the regular population. There arc bathing-houses and promenades, conversation and gaming rooms, libraries, and all the other appendages of a fashionable watering place. It is about four miles from the Rhine, in the Black Forest, near an ancient castle with some curious subterranean apartments.

Baden, a city in the canton of Aargau, in Switzerland, which gives its name to a circle around it containing 54 townships, with 42 parish churches, 850 houses, and about 5950 inhabitants. The city is on the river Limmat, and near it are several warm springs of great medicinal celebrity, which induces crowds of visitors to repair to them in the appropriate season. It contains about 1650 resident inhabitants, who depend chiefly upon the annual visitors.

Baden, a small city in the Austrian province of the Lower Ens, in the circle of Wiener Wald. It is about twelve miles from Vienna, and is the most fashionable summer resort of the inhabitants of that capital. The situation is highly romantic, and the prospects in its vicinity are picturesque and beautiful. There are many warm baths, which are visited for the restoration of health by a great number of patients. Accommodations and amusements are here as amply furnished to the visitors as at the other German Spas. It suffered much by a fire in 1812, but has since been very elegantly rebuilt. The archduke Charles has a residence at this place; and the imperial family are frequently to be seen here in a plain domestic style. The resident inhabitants are about 2300, but the occasional visitors commonly exceed that number. It stands on the rapid river Schwachat, whose water-falls add to the beauties of the walks.
