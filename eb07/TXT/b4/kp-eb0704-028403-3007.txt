BAHREIN, a cluster of islands on the south-west side of the Persian Gulf, near the Arabian shore, the principal of which is named Bahrein. This island, which is about fifteen miles from the coast, is one of the finest in the gulf, and is covered with villages and date gardens. The town and fort of Medina, which contains about 800 or 900 houses, carries on a considerable trade with Bussora and other ports in the gulf. Here is a harbour admitting vessels of 200 tons, which trade to Bushire, and with a fair wind make the voyage in fourteen hours. This island has always been famous for the pearl fishery carried on in its neighbourhood. The oyster banks produce the finest pearls in the world. They are found in a small muscle attached to the bottom by a thin fibre of great length, which is cut by the diver. These pearls are of two sorts, white and yellow; and are sent to India, and through Bussora and Bagdad into Asia. The fishery is farmed out by the different chiefs on the coast, who draw a large revenue from this source. These islands once belonged to the Portuguese. They afterwards fell under the dominion of an Arabian chief, from whom they were seized by the Persians. They were afterwards taken possession of by the Wahabees.
