BLENHEIM, a village of Germany, in the kingdom of Bavaria, situated in long. 2. 30. E. lat. 48. 40. N. This village is remarkable for the defeat of the French and Bavarians in 1704, by the English and their confederates under Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough. See Britain. Blenheim House, a princely mansion erected for the Duke of Marlborough at Woodstock, near Oxford, as a testimony of national gratitude, and, with the manor of Woodstock, settled on the duke and his heirs, in consideration of the eminent services performed by him, and more especially of the decisive victory he had gained at Blenheim over the French forces under Marshal Tallard. The sum of L.500,000 was voted by parliament for the purchase of the manor of Woodstock, and the erection of this edifice, which has generally been considered a very heavy monument of public gratitude.
