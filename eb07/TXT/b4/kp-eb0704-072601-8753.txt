BOCHIUS, or Bocqui, John, a Latin poet, born at Brussels in 1555. He travelled into Italy, Germany, Poland, and Muscovy, and at his return became secretary to the duke of Parma. He died on the 13th of January 1609. The critics in the Netherlands set so great a value on his poetry, that they gave him the name of the Belgic Virgil. He wrote, 1. De Belgii Principatu; 2. Parodia Heroica Psalmorum DaviAicoum; 3. Observationes Phy sicce, Ethicae, Politicce, et Historicae, in Psalmos; 4. Vita Davidis; 5. Orationes; 6. Poemata.
