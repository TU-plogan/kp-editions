BARNSLEY, or Black Barnsley, a town in the parish of Åžilkstone, of the wapentake of Staincross, in the Vest Riding of Yorkshire, 171 miles from London. It was iormerly a place of considerable manufacture in iron, but it has of late years become extensively engaged in making linen and other cloth. The trade has been greatly increased in consequence of the extension of canal navigation, which connects the town with Wakefield and the other canals and navigable rivers which unite at that place. There is a large market every Wednesday for cattle and corn. The inhabitants in 1801 amounted to 3606, in 1811 to 5464, and in 1821 to 8284.
