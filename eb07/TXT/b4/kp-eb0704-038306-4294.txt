BARNSTAPLE, a market and borough-town and seaport of the hundred of Braunton, in the county of Devon, 194 miles from London and 36 miles from Exeter. It stands on the river Tawe, in a fertile district, and was formerly a great manufacturing place, but of late years has declined in that branch of industry. The market, which is large, is held on Friday. Barnstaple returns two members to parliament, chosen by the freemen, who are very numerous, and scattered about in such various places as to render the expenses of a contested election very heavy; and it is said to be accompanied with much bribery. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3748, in 1811 to 4298, and in 1821 to 5079.

B∕∖RO, or Baron, Peter, professor of divinity in the university of Cambridge in the sixteenth century, was born at Estampes, in France, and educated in the university of Bourges, where he was admitted a licentiate in the law; but being of the Protestant religion, he was obliged to leave his native country in order to avoid persecution, and, withdrawing into England, was kindly entertained by Lord Burleigh. He afterwards settled at Cambridge, and, by the recommendation of his noble patron, was in 1574 chosen Lady Margaret’s professor there. For some years he enjoyed quietly his professorship; but a restless faction was at last raised against him, by his opposing the doctrine of absolute predestination; and this rendered his situation so uncomfortable, that he chose to leave the university and settle in London. He wrote, In Jonam Prophetam Praelectiones xxxix.; De Praestantia et Dignitate Divinae Legis; and other pieces. He died in London about the year 1600.
