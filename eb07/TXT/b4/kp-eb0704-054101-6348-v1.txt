BEKES, a circle in the Austrian kingdom of Hungary. It extends over 1330 square miles, or 852,350 acres, and contains four towns, sixteen villages, and seventy-one feudal estates, with 94,600 inhabitants, chiefly Lutherans and Calvinists; there being only about 12,000 Catholics and 7100 Greeks. The soil is marshy and the climate moist, but rich and productive, especially in horned cattle. The manufactures are such as peasantry require, and are prepared by themselves. The chief place, which bears the same name, is at the junction of the White with the Black Koros. It contains a Catholic, Greek, and Reformed church, with 1600 houses and 12,500 inhabitants.
