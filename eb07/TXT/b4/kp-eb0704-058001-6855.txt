BERCHEM, or Berghem, Nicholas, a painter, was a native of Haerlem, and born in 1624. He received instructions from several very eminent masters; and it was no small addition to their fame that Berchem was their scholar. The pictures of cattle and figures by this master are held in high estimation; and he has been singularly happy in having many of them finely engraved by John Visscher, an eminent artist in his own line. The distinguishing characters of the pictures of Berchem are, the breadth and just distribution of the lights, the grandeur of his masses of shadow, natural ease and simplicity in the attitudes of his figures, the just gradation of his distances, the brilliancy and transparency of his colouring, the correctness[7:4:581] and true perspective of his design, and the elegance of his composition.
