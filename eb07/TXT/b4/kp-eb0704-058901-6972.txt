BERNARDINE, St, was born at Massa, in Tuscany, in 1380. In 1404 he entered into a Franciscan monastery near Sienna, where he became an eminent preacher, and was afterwards sent to Jerusalem as commissary of the Holy Land. On his return to Italy he visited several cities, where he preached with such applause that Ferrara, Sienna, and Urbino, applied to Pope Eugenius IV. to appoint him their bishop; but Bernardine refused the honour, accepting only the office of vicar-general of the Friars of the Observance for all Italy. He repaired and founded above three hundred monasteries in that country, died in 1444, and was canonized by Pope Nicholas in 1450. His works were published at Venice in 1591, in 4 vols. 4to.
