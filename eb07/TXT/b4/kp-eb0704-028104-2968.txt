BAGNARA, a city of the province of Calabria Ulteriore, in the kingdom of Naples, on the Tyrrhenian Sea. It suffered by the earthquake in 1783, when, out of 4938 persons, 3324 perished. The injury has been in a great measure repaired, and it now contains a population of 4000 individuals, who carry on a considerable trade in silk, oil, and wine, and in the fishery.
