BELON, Peter, of Le Mans, the capital of Le Maine, a province of France, flourished about the middle of the sixteenth century. He published several works in Latin and in French, â€™including a book of travels, or observations of many singularities and memorable things found in Greece, Asia, Judaea, Egypt, and other foreign countries. He was murdered near Paris, by one of his enemies, in 1564.
