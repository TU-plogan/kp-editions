BLUBBER denotes the fat of whales and other large sea-animals, of which train-oil is made. It is properly the adeps of the animal, and lies immediately under the skin, and over the muscular flesh. In the porpoise it is firm and full of fibres, and invests the body about an inch thick. In the whale its thickness is ordinarily six inches, but about the under lip it is found two or three feet thick. The whole quantity yielded by one of these animals ordinarily amounts to forty or fifty, sometimes to eighty or more, hundredweights.
