BEAN. The ancients made use of beans in gathering the votes of the people, and for the election of magistrates. A white bean signified “absolution,” and a black one “condemnation.” Beans had a mysterious use in the lemuralia ραrentalia, where the master of the family, after wash- ιn g> was to throw black beans over his head, still repeating the words, “I redeem myself and family by these beans.” Ovid gives a lively description in verse of the whole ceremony. Abstinence from beans was enjoined by Pythagoras, one of whose symbols is κυάμων aπiγι<Aaι, abstincre a fabis. The Egyptian priests held it a crime to look at beans, judging the very sight unclean; and among the Romans the flamen dialis was not permitted even to mention the name. The precept of Pythagoras has been variously interpreted. Some understand it of forbearing to meddle in trials and verdicts; others, resting on the equivoque of the word κύαμος, which signifies equally a bean and a human testicle, explain it by abstinence from venery. Clemens Alexandrinus grounds the prohibition against beans on their alleged quality of rendering women barren; and this is confirmed by Theophrastus, who asserts that some other plants have the same property. Cicero suggests another reason for this abstinence, namely, that beans are great enemies to tranquillity of mind. Hence Amphiaraus is said to have abstained from beans, even before Pythagoras, that he might enjoy a clearer divination by dreams.

EEAN-Cod, a small fishing vessel, or pilot-boat, common on the sea-coasts and in the rivers of Portugal. It is extremely sharp forward, having its stem bent inward above into a great curve, and plated on the fore-side with iron, into which a number of bolts are driven, to fortify it, and resist the stroke of another vessel, which may fall athwart-hause. It is commonly navigated with a large lateen sail, which extends over the whole length of the deck; and it is accordingly well fitted to ply to windward.

EEAM-Elour, called by the Romans lomentum, was in some repute amongst ladies in ancient times as a cosmetic.

EEAN-Ely, in Natural History, the name given by authors to a very beautiful fly, of a pale purple colour, frequently found on bean-flowers.
