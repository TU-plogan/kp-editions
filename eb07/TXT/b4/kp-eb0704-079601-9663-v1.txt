BOOTON, an island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the south-eastern extremity of Celebes, about the 5th degree of south latitude. It is estimated at eighty-five miles in length by twenty miles in average breadth. It is separated from the island of Pangansane by a narrow strait; and is productive, yielding rice, maize, yams, and a variety of tropical fruits. The inhabitants are of a short stature, and tawny complexion. They speak the Malay language, and are Mahommedans. The Dutch had formerly a settlement here, in the bay of Booton.
