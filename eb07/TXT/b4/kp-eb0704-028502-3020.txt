BAIKAL, a great lake of Siberia, in the government of Irkutsk, 366 miles in length from south-west to northeast, and from twenty to fifty-three miles in breadth. This vast reservoir is, according to accurate observations, about 1715 feet above the level of the sea. It is fed by several large rivers, namely, the Upper Angara, Selinga, Bargazin, and others; while the only visible outlet is by the Lower Angara, which is incapable of carrying off any thing like the quantity of water which is received. The Åµater is excellent and extremely clear, so that the bottom can be seen at the depth of eight fathoms. The depth of the lake varies from twenty-two to ninety fathoms. It yields abundance of fish, and there is a profitable fishery of seals on its shores during the whole summer. The climate is extremely severe; the waters of this great inland sea are frozen over about the beginning of January, and the ice does not break up till May. This lake facilitates the Russian trade with China, and also between Irkutsk and Dauria. It is navigated by the Russians in summer, and in winter they travel across it on the ice. Several hot springs and mineral waters are seen on the margin, and naphtha is sometimes found floating on the surface. It lies between the 52d and 55th degrees of north latitude.
