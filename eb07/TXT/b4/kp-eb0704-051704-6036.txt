BEDRIACUM, in Ancient Geography, a village of Italy, situated, according to Tacitus, between Verona and Cremona, but nearer the latter than the former. From the account given by that historian, Cluverius conjectures that the ancient Bedriacum stood in the place where the city of Caneto now stands. This village was remarkable for the defeat of the emperor Galba by Otho, and afterwards of Otho by Vitellius.
