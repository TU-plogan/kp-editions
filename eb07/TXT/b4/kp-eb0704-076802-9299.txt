BONET, or Bonnet, Theophilus, an eminent physician, born at Geneva on the 5th of March 1620. He took his degree in physic in 1643, after having studied with distinction in the schools of his own country, and in the most celebrated foreign universities; and then applied himself to the practice of his profession, in which he acquired great reputation. But being seized with deafness, he found it necessary to retire from business; which gave him leisure to collect all the observations he had made during a practice of forty years. But his principal title to distinction is rather as a medical writer than a practitioner, and as haying in some measure created pathological anatomy, which Morgagni afterwards illustrated. His works are, 1. Mercurius Compitaliliu s , Geneva, 1682, folio; 2. Zodiacus MedicoGallicus, without date; 3. Medicina Septentrionalis Collatitia, Geneva, 1684 and 1686, 2 vols. folio; 4. Poly antlies, sive Thesaurus MedicoPracticus, Geneva, 1690, 1691, 1693, 3 vols. folio; 5.
