BEATIFICATION, an act by which the pope declares a person beatified or blessed after his death. It is the first step towards canonization, or raising any one to the honour and dignity of a saint. No person can be beatified till half a century after his or her death. All certificates or attestations of virtues and miracles, the necessary qualifications for saintship, are examined by the congregation of rites; and this examination often continues for several years, after which his holiness decrees the beatification. The corpse and relics of the future saint are henceforth exposed to the veneration of all good Christians; his images are crowned with rays, and a particular office is set apart for him, but his body and relics are not carried in procession. Indulgences and remission of sins are likewise granted on the day of his beatification, which, though not so pompous as that of canonization, is however very splendid.
