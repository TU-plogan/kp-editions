BARBERINO, Francis, one of the best poets of his age, was born at Barberino, in Tuscany, in the year 1264. As his mother was of Florence, he settled in that city, where his profession of the law, but especially the beauty of his poetry, raised him a very considerable character. The greater part of his works are lost; but that which is entitled Documenti J Amore, being a moral poem calculated to instruct those in their duty who have a regard for glory, virtue, and eternity, has had a better fate. It was published at Rome in quarto in 1640, by Frederic Ubaldini, who prefixed a life of the author; and as the poem contains many words which had grown obsolete, he added a glossary to explain them, which illustrates the sense by the authority of contemporary poets. Barberino died in 1348.
