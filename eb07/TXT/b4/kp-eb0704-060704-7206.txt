BEVERLEY, a market and borough-town in the east riding of the county of York, 182 miles from London, on the river Hull. It has a considerable trade in malt and corn at its markets, which are held on Wednesday and Saturday. It has two churches; that of St John, or the Minster, founded by King Athelstane, being of a collegiate kind, and a fine building. It returns two members to the House of Commons, who are chosen by a numerous body of resident and non-resident freemen, from which cause much money is usually expended at the elections. The number of inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 6100, in 1811 to 6235, and in 1821 to 7503.

Beverley, John of, in Latin Joannes Beverlacius, archbishop of York in the eighth century, was descended of a noble family at Harpham, in Northumberland, and was justly esteemed one of the best scholars of his time. He "' as first a monk, and afterwards abbot of the monastery Â°f St Hilda; when his merit recommended him to the favour of Alfred, king of Northumberland, who, in the year 685, advanced him to the see of Hagustald or Hexham, and, in 687, translated him to the archbishopric of York. 1his prelate was tutor to the famous Bede, and lived in the strictest friendship with Acca and other Anglo-Saxon doctors, several of whom he engaged to write comments on the Holy Scriptures. In 704 he founded a college at Beverley for secular priests; and after he had governed the see of York thirty-four years, being wearied with the tumults and confusions which then prevailed in the church, he divested himself of his episcopal character, and retired to Beverley, where he died four years after, on the 7th of May 721. Bede and other monkish writers ascribe several miracles to him. This prelate wrote some pieces, which are mentioned by Bale and Pitts, namely, 1. Pro Luce exponenda; 2. Homiliae in Evangelica; 3. Epistolae ad Hildam Abbatissam; Epistolae ad Herebaldum, Ande-num, et Bertinum.
