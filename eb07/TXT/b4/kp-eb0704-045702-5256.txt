BAUR, John William, an eminent Flemish painter, born at Strasburg, was a disciple of Brendel. He spent some time at Rome, where his studies were wholly devoted to architecture and landscapes, which prevented his studying the antique. He painted small figures in distemper on vellum, and etched with great spirit. His largest works are in the historical line. He died at Vienna in 1640.
