BARK, in the anatomy of plants, the exterior part of trees, corresponding to the skin of an animal. See Anatomy, Vegetable. Bark, or Jesuiís Barh, is a name given by way of eminence to the quinquina, or cinchona. See Cinchona. Bark, in Navigation, a general name given to small ships; it is, however, peculiarly appropriated by seamen to those which carry three masts without a mizen topsail. Our northern mariners who are trained in the coaltrade apply this distinction to a broad-sterneđ ship which carries no ornamental figure on the stern or prow.
