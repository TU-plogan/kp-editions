BEGHERME, an extensive country in the interior of Africa, to the south of the Lake Tchad, and the southeast of Bornou. It has never been reached by any European; but the country appears to be fertile, and the nation warlike. The latter, engaged in almost continual contests with Bornou, have a well-trained light cavalry, in which both the riders and horses are completely cased in mail; but though the former display great skill in horsemanship, and in the performance of rapid manoeuvres, they exhibit no courage when attacked in close combat. Hence the Bornou spearmen, with a few Arab musketeers, are accustomed to put to flight large hosts of Begherme cavalry. The sultan of Bornou has thus been enabled repeatedly to overrun the country; but the Beghermis then retreat beyond a large river which falls into the Tchad, where they are received by a friendly nation, and, as soon as the Bornou army has retired, return, and take possession of their territory. The Beghermis individually are strong and muscular men; and their slaves in Bornou distinguish themselves as skilful and powerful wrestlers. The general state of population and society in this country is nearly the same as that which will be described as existing in Bornou.
