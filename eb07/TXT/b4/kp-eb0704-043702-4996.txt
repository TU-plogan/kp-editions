BASTINADO, or Bastinade, the punishment of beating or drubbing a criminal with a stick. The word is formed from the French baston, a stick, staff, or eudgel. The bastinade was a punishment used among the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Jews, and still obtains among the l urks. The Romans called it fastigatio, fustium admonitio, fustibus ccedi; which differed from the flagellatio in being done with a stick instead of a rod or seourge. Fustigation was a lighter punishment, and inflicted on freemen; flagellation a severer, and reserved for slaves. It was also called tympanum, because the patient here was beat with sticks like a drum. The punishment of the bastinado is much in use in the East at this day; and it is c∣ιiefly administered on the soles of the feet, which are sometimes beaten almost to a jelly.
