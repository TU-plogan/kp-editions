BAYLY, Lewis, author of a well-known book entitled The Practice of Piety. He was born at Caermarthen in Wales, educated at Oxford, appointed minister of Evesham in Worcestershire about 1611, made chaplain to King James, and promoted to the see of Bangor in 1616. His book is dedicated to the high and mighty prince, Charles prince of Wales; and the author tells his highness, “that he had endeavoured to extract out of the chaos of endless controversies the old practice of true piety, which flourished before these controversies were hatched.” The design was good; and the reception this book has met with may be known from the number of editions it has gone through, that in 8vo, 1734, being the fifty-ninth. This prelate died in 1632.
