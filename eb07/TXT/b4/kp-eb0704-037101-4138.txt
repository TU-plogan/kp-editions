BARBUDA, one of the Caribbee islands, is 21 miles in length by about 12 in breadth, presenting a very flat surface, covered to a great extent with forests of small trees, in which excellent deer abound. Many varieties of very fine shell and other fish are found on the coast, which is [7:4:372] also frequented by large flocks of water-game.. The part of the island cultivated is fertile, but there is no sugar raised, nor are there any plantations of importance, the labour consisting principally in raising provisions, building droghens, and rearing cattle, with which some of the neighbouring islands are supplied. Barbuda possesses no towns, but negro hamlets are scattered over its surface, and a church has lately been erected. The climate is salubrious, and invalids resort thither from other parts of the West Indies. This island is the entire property of the Codrington family. It is situated 12 leagues to the north-east of Antigua, and 24 to the north-north-east of St Christophers, and contains a population of about 1000 inhabitants. Long. 61. 46. W. Lat 17. 36. N.
