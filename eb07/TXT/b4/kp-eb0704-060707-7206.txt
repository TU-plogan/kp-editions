BEVIN, Elway, a musician eminently skilled in the knowledge of practical composition, who flourished towards the end of Queen Elizabethâ€™s reign. He was of Welsh extraction, and had been educated under Tallis, upon whose recommendation he was in 1589 sworn in gentleman extraordinary of the chapel; but from this situation he was expelled in 1637, it being discovered that he adhered to the Romish communion. He was also organist of Bristol cathedral, but forfeited that employment at the same time with his place in the chapel. He composed several services, and a few anthems.
