BIBERACH, a bailiwick in the circle of the Danube, in the kingdom of Wirtemburg. It extends over 140 square miles, comprehends one city, three market-towns, and eighty-four villages, with 25,940 inhabitants. It is a rich productive district, well watered by the rivers Riess, Um-lach, and Iller. The city which gives name to the bailiwick stands on the Riess, is surrounded with walls, is well built, contains four churches and other public buildings, and 4960 inhabitants, of whom 3190 are Protestants, and 1770 Catholics. Biberach and its vicinity were the scenes of sanguinary but indecisive combats between the French and Austrian armies, in 1796 and in 1800; although, on both occasions, the former claimed the victory.
