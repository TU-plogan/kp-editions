BEYAH, a river of Hindostan, which rises in the province of Lahore, near the mountains of Cashmere, and not far from the source of the Sutledge, which it afterwards joins. It pursues for the first 200 miles of its course a southerly direction, after which it turns to the west. The whole length of its course may be estimated at 350 miles. This is the fourth river of the Punjab, and is the Hyphasis of Alexander.
