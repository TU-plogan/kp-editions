BAGLANA, a large and mountainous district of Hindostan, in the Mahratta territories, province of Aurungabad, through which many fertile plains and valleys are interspersed. It is situated between the 20th and 21st degrees of N. lat.; and the natural strength of the country’s augmented by a number of strong fortresses erected on the summits of lofty mountains. This province was first conquered by the Mahometans in 1296, but they were unable to retain their conquest; and from its natural advantages, and the martial disposition of its natives, it appears never to have been entirely subdued, either by the sovereigns of the Deccan or the Moguls. Aurungzebe w ιth his powerful armies made inroads into this country; but he never obtained more than its nominal subjection, and an irregularly paid tribute. It revolted from the Delhi emperors on the first appearance of the Mahratta chief Sevajee; and it was wholly held by different Mahratta chiefs till 1818. It was partitioned among a variety of leaders, the limits of whose territories frequently fluctuated. It has no towns of any note.
