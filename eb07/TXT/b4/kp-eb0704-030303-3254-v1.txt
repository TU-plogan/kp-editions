BALADAN, the Scripture name for a king of Babylon, called by profane authors ßelesus or Pelesis i Nabonassar or Nαηybrus. Baladan was at first no more than governor of Babylon; but having entered into a confederacy with Arbaces, governor of Media, and rebelled against Sardanapalus, king of Assyria, both generals marched against him with an army of 400,000 men, and were defeated in three different battles. The Bactrians, however, deserted the king, and having gone over to Baladan and Arbaces, the rebels, thus reinforced, attacked their enemy in the night, and made themselves masters of his camp. After this misfortune, Sardanapalus retreated to Nineveh, and left the command of his army to his brother-in-law Salamenes. The conspirators attacked Salamenes, and defeated him in two great battles; after which they laid siege to Nineveh. Sardanapalus sustained the siege for three years; but the Tigris, in the third year, overflowing its banks, beat down twenty furlongs of the walls; upon which the conspirators entered the city and took possession of it, after Sardanapalus had burnt himself and all his most valuable effects upon a funeral pile erected for the purpose in his palace. Baladan was acknowledged king of Babylon, as Arbaces was of Media.
