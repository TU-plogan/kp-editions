BANFF, the capital of Banffshire, is pleasantly situated on the western bank of the river Deveron, at the point where it discharges itself into the sea. The town is of great antiquity, and its erection is traditionally ascribed to Malcolm Canmore. A charter was afterwards granted in 1165 by William the Lion (Carte of Moray). Its former charters were confirmed by Robert IL, on the 7th October 1372; and also by different succeeding monarchs, down to the time of James VI., who granted charters in 1581 and 1592, which are the latest held by the town. Banff was originally endowed with an ample patrimony, but this was lost to the burgh by the rapacity of its magistracy and the neighbouring proprietors, about the time of James VI., who granted charters to enable them to feu and sell in perpetuity.

The form of the town is irregular. The houses, with the exception of a few modern structures, are old and incommodious; some of the streets are narrow and ill paved; and no extension can be now expected, as it is hemmed in on all sides by lands held in strict entail. The great north road passes through Banff, and enters the town by a beautiful bridge across the Deveron. The accommodation for religious instruction is ample; and there is an excellent academy, besides several private and charity schools. The charitable foundations are also extensive. The shipping interest has long been on the decline, particularly since the peace with France; and all attempts to revive it, with the exception of the Banff and London Shipping Company, at present very flourishing, have failed. In 1815 a speculation in whale fishing was entered into, and a new harbour projected, principally for the accommodation of the whale vessels; but the harbour has been found useless as a place of safety. The old harbour is quite safe, although of difficult access, and only fitted for the reception of small craft. The exports are corn, cattle, pork, butter, herrings, salmon, and other fish. The imports are merchant goods, coals, iron, staves, and other articles necessary for the herring fishery. There are no manufactories of any description within the town, although the place and near neighbourhood afford many facilities for that purpose. A cast-iron foundery was, however, established in 1825, which has hitherto proved very successful. The town was lighted with gas in November 1b∙31.

The lower part of the town was inundated by the great flood in 1829, and considerable damage was done. Banff has a weekly market for provisions, a monthly corn market, and four fairs annually. By the census of 1831, the po∙ pulation of the town and parish amounted to 3711. Banff is 46 miles N. W. from Aberdeen, and 75 N. N. E. from Edinburgh. Long. 2. 32. W. Lat. 57. 40. 58. N.
