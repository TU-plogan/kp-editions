BOILING, or Ebullition, the bubbling up of any fluid. The term is most commonly applied to that bubbling which is produced by the application of fire; though that which ensues when the particles of bodies rapidly combine, such as on the mixing of an acid with an alkali, is sometimes also distinguished by the same name.

Boiling, in trade and manufactures, is a preparation given to different sorts of bodies by making them pass over the fire, chiefly in water, though sometimes in other liquors. In this sense we speak of the boiling of salt, of sugar, of copperas, and the like.

Boiling, in the culinary art, is a method of dressing meats by coction in hot water, intended to soften them, and dispose them for easier digestion.

Boiling is also a method of trying or essaying the goodness or badness of a colour or dye. The stuff is to be boiled in water with certain drugs, different according to the kind or quality of the colour, to try whether or not it will discharge, and give a tincture to the water.

Boiling to Death (caldariis decoquere), in the middle ages, a kind of punishment inflicted on thieves, false coiners, and some other criminals.
