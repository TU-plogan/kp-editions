BOOKING, a town in the hundred of Hinckford, in the county of Essex, 40 miles from London. It is celebrated for the manufacture of a particular description of baize, which found a ready vent in the markets of Spain; but of late years the trade has declined, from the superior advantages enjoyed by the rival fabrics in the north of England. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2680, in 1811 to 2544, and in 1821 to 2786.

BOCK-Land, in the Saxon time, is what we now call freehold lands, held by the better sort of persons by charter or deed in writing; by which name it was distinguished from folk-land or copyhold land, holden by the common people without writing.
