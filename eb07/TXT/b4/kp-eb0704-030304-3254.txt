BALAGHAUT Ceded Districts. This country, which is in the south of India, comprehends an extensive tableland, supported like a terrace by the stupendous mountain wall of the Ghauts. It is a vast extent of level plains, stretching from the Krishna to the southern extremity of the Mysore, and is named Balaghaut, or “Above the Ghauts,” in contradistinction to Payenghaut, or “Below the Ghauts.” This tract of country, which was acquired by the British in 1800, comprehends all the territory south of the Toombuddra and Krishna rivers, which are its proper boundaries, and which, owing to its elevated surface, are the only large rivers which it possesses. The country, the greater proportion of which is under dry cultivation, produces sugar, indigo, and cotton. In 1806 a census was made out of the population, which amounted to 1,917,376. After these districts were obtained from the Nizam in 1800, they were placed under the management of Colonel Munro, and since this period they have made great advances in population and prosperity. In the course of seven years the land revenues increased from 1,006,593 to 1,517,272 pagodas; and the inhabitants, from being a horde of lawless freebooters, were reclaimed to habits of civilization and submission to the laws. In the year 1808 the total amount of the revenue was 1,802,570 pagodas. In ancient times these provinces formed part of the Hindoo kingdom of Bijanagur; and many of the modern polygars claim their descent from the officers, and some from the royal family, of that kingdom. On the fall of the Mogul government it was broken into several independent states. It was conquered by Hyder between the years 1766 and 1780, but in 1800 was transferred to the British.
