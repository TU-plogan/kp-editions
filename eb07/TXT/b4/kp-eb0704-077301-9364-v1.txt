BONVINCINO, Alessandro, called Le Moretto, an historical and portrait painter, was born at Rovate in 1514. He was originally a disciple of Titian, under whose direction he studied diligently for some years; but having accidentally seen the designs of Raphael, he gave himself up entirely to the study of those masterpieces of art and genius, and soon became an excellent painter. His works were eagerly bought up, being admired for the tenderness of the penciling, the correctness and expression of the figures, the neatness of the finishing, and the rich variety of his draperies. He was also excellent in portrait, and by many was placed in competition even with Titian himself. He died in 1564.
