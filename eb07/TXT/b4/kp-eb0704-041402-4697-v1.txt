BARSANTI, Francisco, an eminent musical performer and composer, was born at Lucca about the year 1690. He studied the civil law in the university of Padua; but, after a short stay there, he chose music as a profession. Accordingly, he put himself under the tuition of some of the ablest masters in Italy; and, having attained toacon-siderable degree of proficiency in practical composition, he took a resolution to settle in England, and came thither with Geminiani, who was also a Luccese, in the year 1714. He was a good performer on the hautboy, and also on the flute: in the former capacity he found employment in the opera band, and in the latter derived considerable advantages by teaching. He published six solos for a flute with a thorough-bass, and afterwards six solos for a German flute and a bass. He also converted into sonatas, for two violins and a bass, the first six solos of Geminiani. He continued many years a performer at the opera-house; but thinking that there was a prospect of advantage for one of his profession in Scotland, he at length went thither, and may be said, with greater truth than was alleged of David Rizzio, to have improved the music of that country, by collecting and making basses to a great number of the most popular Scottish tunes. About the year 1750, Barsantι returned to England; but being advanced in years, he was glad to be taken into the opera band as a performeι on the tenor violin, and in the summer season into that ot Vauxhall. At this time he published twelve concertos for violins; and shortly after Sei Antifone, in which he endeavoured to imitate the style of Palestrina and the. old composers of motets; but from these publications so little profit resulted, that, towards the close of his life, the industry and economy of an excellent wife, whom he had married[7:4:415] in Scotland, and the studies and labours of a daughter whom he had qualified for the profession of a singer, and who afterwards became an actress at Covent Garden, were his chief support.
