BERSABE, in Ancient Geography, a town in the tribe of Simeon, and the southern boundary not only of this tribe, but of the whole land of Israel, as appears by the common expression “from Dan to Bersabe,” or, as it is ir our translation, Beersheba. It was the residence of the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac, and received from the former its name, which signifies the well or fountain of the oath. Eusebius and Jerome say that there was a citadel and large village of this name in their time. In thelower age it was called Castrum Versabini.
