BLANDFORD, a market and borough town in the hundred of Pimperne and county of Dorset, 103 miles from London. It is a clean well-built place, on the river Stour, overlooking which, at the end of the town, Ã®s the fine seat and ornamented grounds of Mr Portman. This town has frequently been destroyed by fire, but has always risen with increased beauty. The principal employment is that of making shirt-buttons, which, though a minute article, yet, being all fabricated within a narrow circle, has been the source of prosperity to the place. There is a well-supplied market on Saturday. Though a borough, it now returns no member to parliament. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2328, in 1811 to 2425, and in 1821 to 2643.
