BARNES, Joshua, professor of the Greek language at Cambridge in the beginning of the eighteenth century. He was chosen queen’s professor of Greek in 1695, a language which he wrote and spoke with the utmost facility. His first publication was a whimsical tract entitled Gerania, or a new discovery of the little sort of people called Pygmies. After this appeared his Life of Edward III., in which he introduces his hero making long and elaborate speeches. Rewrote several other books, particularly Sacred Poems; the Life of Oliver Cromwell the Tyrant; several dramatic pieces; a poetical paraphrase on the history of Esther, in Greek verse, with a Latin translation, &c. He also published editions of Euripides, Anacreon, and Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, with notes and a Latin translation. He wrote with greater case in Greek than even in English, and yet he is generally allowed not to have understood the delicacies of that language. His death took place on the 3d of August 1712, in the fifty-eighth year of his age.
