BAETYLIA, anointed stones, worshipped by the Phoenicians, by the Greeks before the time of Cecrops, and by other barbarous nations. They were commonly of a black colour, and consecrated to some god, as Saturn, Jupiter, the Sun. Some are of opinion that the true original of these idols is to be derived from the pillar of stone which Jacob erected at Bethel, and which was afterwards worshipped by the Jews. These hoetylia were the objects of much veneration among the ancient heathens. Many of their idols were in fact no other; and no sort was more common in eastern countries than that of erect oblong stones, hence termed by the Greeks τοιοviς, pillars. In some parts of Egypt they were planted on both sides of the highways. In the temple of Heliogabalus in Syria, there was one said to have fallen from heaven; and in Phrygia there was a black stone, also considered an aerolithe, which the Romans sent for, and received with much ceremony, Scipio Nasica having been at the head of the embassy.
