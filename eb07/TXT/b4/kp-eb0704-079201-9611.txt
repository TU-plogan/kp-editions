BOOM, in naval language, a long piece of timber with which the clew of the studding-sail is spread out; but sometimes the boom is used to spread or boom out the clew of the main-sail.

Boom denotes also a cable stretched across the mouth of a river or harbour, with yards, top-masts, battling, or spars of wood, lashed to it, to prevent an enemyâ€™s coming in.
