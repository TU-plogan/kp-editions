BLINDS, or Blindes, in the art of war, a sort of defence commonly made of oziers, or branches interwoven, and laid across between two rows of stakes, about the height of a man, and four or five feet asunder. They are used particularly at the heads of trenches when these extend in front towards the glacis, and serve to shelter the workmen, and to prevent their being overlooked by the enemy.
