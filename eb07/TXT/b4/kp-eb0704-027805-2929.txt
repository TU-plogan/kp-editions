BADILE, Antonio, historical and portrait painter, born at Verona in 1480, died in 1560. By great study and application he acquired a more extensive knowledge of the true principles of painting than any of his predecessors. He was confessedly a very eminent artist; but he derived greater honour from having had two such disciples as Paolo Veronese and Baptista Zelotti, than from the excellence of his own compositions.
