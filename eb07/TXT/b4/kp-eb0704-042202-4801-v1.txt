+=====================================================================+


BARTHOLINUS, Gaspard, a learned writer of the seventeenth century, was born at Malmoe, a town in the province of Schonen, which then belonged to Denmark. At three years of age he had such a quick capacity, that in fourteen days he learned to read; and in his thirteenth year he composed Greek and Latin orations, and delivered them in public. When he was about eighteen he went to the university of Copenhagen, and afterwards studied at Rostock and Wirtemberg. He next set out upon his travels, during which he neglected no opportunity of improving himself at the different universities he visited, and everywhere received marks of respect. In 1613 he was chosen professor of physic in the university of Copenhagen, and filled this office for eleven years, when, falling into a dangerous illness, he made a vow, that if it should please God to restore him, he would apply himself solely to the study of divinity. He recovered, observed his vow, and soon after obtained the professorship of divinity, with the canonry of Roschild. Hc died on the 13th of July 1630, after having written nearly fifty works on different subjects.

Bartholinus, Thomas, a celebrated physician, son of tlιe former, was born at Copenhagen in 1619. After studying some time in his native country, he went, in 1637, to Leyden, where he studied physic during three years. He then travelled into France, and resided two years at Paris and Montpellier, in order to improve himself under the distinguished physicians of those universities; after which he visited Italy, remained three years at Padua, and at length went to Basel, where he obtained the degree of doctor in philosophy. Returning to Copenhagen, he was appointed professor of the mathematics in 1647, and next year was nominated to the chair of anatomy, which suited better his genius and inclination, and which he held for thirteen years, distinguishing himself by several discoveries respecting the lacteal veins and lymphatic vessels. His close application, however, having rendered his constitution very infirm, he resigned his chair in 1661; but the king of Denmark allowed him the title of “honorary professor.” He now retired to a little estate he had at Hagested, near Copenhagen, where he hoped to spend the remainder of his days in peace and tranquillity; but his house having been burnt in 1670, his library, with all his books and manuscripts, was consumed. In consideration of this loss, the king appointed Bartholinus his physician with a handsome salary, and exempted his land from all taxes; the university of Copenhagen also chose him for their librarian; and, in 1675, the king did him the honour to give him a seat in the grand council of Denmark. He wrote, 1. Anatomia Gaspardi Bartholini Parentis, novis Observationibus primum locupletata, 8vo; 2. De Monstris in Natura et Medicina, 4to; 3. De Armillis Veterum, praesertim Danorum, Schedion, 8vα; and several other works. He died on the 4th of December 1680.
