BATE, George, an eminent physician, born at Maid’s [7:4:440]Morton, near Buckingham, in the year 1608. In 1629 he obtained a license, and for some years practised in and about Oxford; but his practice was chiefly amongst the Puritans, who at that time considered him as one of their party. In 1637 he took his degree of doctor in physic, and became very eminent in his profession; so that when King Charles kept his court at Oxford, Dr Bate was his principal physician. When the king’s affairs declined, he removed to London, where he accommodated himself so well to the times, that he became physician to the Charterhouse, fellow of the college of physicians, and afterwards principal physician to Oliver Cromwell. Upon the Restoration, he got into favour with the royal party, and was made principal physician to the king, and fellow of the Royal Society; all which preferment, it is said, was owing to a report raised on purpose by his friends, that he had given the Protector a dose which hastened his death. Dr Bate wrote in Latin an account of the civil commotions in England, and some other pieces. He died at his house in Hatton-Garden, and was buried atKingston-upon-Thames, in Surrey.

There was another George Bate, who wrote a work entitled, “The Lives, Actions, and Execution, of the prime Actors and principal Contrivers of that horrid Murther of our late pious and sacred King Charles I.”

Bate Isle, an island of Hindostan, belonging to the province of Gujerat, situated at the south-western extremity of the Gulf of Cutch. This island has a good harbour, well secured from the prevailing winds, but with a rocky anchorage. The island of Bate is a great resort of Hindoo pilgrims; and the town contains 2000 houses, chiefly inhabited by Brahmins. The island does not produce sufficient subsistence for the support of the inhabitants, who consequently import large quantities of ghee, sugar, grain, &c. About 150 vessels of different sizes belong to the port, and with these piracies were formerly carried on, until they were checked by the British. The Bate Isle pirates were the dread of all the traders on the western coasts of India. The port has been improved, but is still an insignificant place. It was nevertheless attacked without success, and with great loss, in 1803, by a British force. But, in 1807, a treaty was entered into with the chiefs of the island, by which it was agreed that a free and open commerce should be permitted to all British vessels. Long. 69. 21. E. Lat. 22. 22.
