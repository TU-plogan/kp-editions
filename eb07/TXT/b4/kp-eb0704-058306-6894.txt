BERGOO, an extensive country of interior Africa, between Darfur and Begherme. It is traversed by a large river, which appears to be the Misselad of Browne. A considerable part of the territory is described as mountainous, inhabited by warlike tribes, who sometimes swell [7:4:584]the armies of the state, sometimes make war against it. The people of Bergoo are rigid Mahommedans, but are surrounded by fierce pagan tribes, into whose territory they make frequent incursions, probably with the view of procuring slaves. They often, however, meet a formidable resistance, being encountered with poisoned arrows, and spears heated red-hot. The only grains raised in the country are dhourra and millet; but it produces a considerable quantity of natron and salgem, which are exported by the caravans to Cairo. The capital is Wara or Hara, situated on the great river which passes through Bergoo.
