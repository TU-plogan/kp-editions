Bonnet, in Fortification, a small work consisting of two faces, having only a parapet with two rows of palisades, at about ten or twelve feet distance. It is generally raised before the salient angle of the counterscarp, and has a communication with the covered way, by a trench cut through the glacis, and palisades on each side.

Bonnet a Prctre, or Priest's Bonnet, in Fortification, is an out-work, having at the head three salient and two rentrant angles. It differs from the double tenaille only in this, that its sides, instead of being parallel, are like the queue d , aronde, or swallow’s tail, that is, narrowing or converging at the gorge, and opening at the head.

Bonnet, in sea-language, denotes an addition to a sail.
