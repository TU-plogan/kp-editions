BERMUDAS, or Somers’s Islands, a cluster of small islands in the Atlantic Ocean, about four hundred innumber, but for the greater part so small and barren that they possess neither inhabitants nor name. The discovery of these islands, like that of many others of greater note, resulted from shipwreck. Juan Bermudas, a Spaniard, whose name they now bear, when on a voyage from Old Spain to Cuba with a cargo of hogs, was here wrecked about the year 1522. Henry May, an Englishman, suffered the same fate in 1593; and lastly, Sir George Somers shared the destiny of the two preceding navigators in 1609. Sir George was the first who established a settlement upon them, and, from his indefatigable labours in furtherance of this object, it is due to his memory that his name should be for ever identified with them. Sir George, however, died before he had fully accomplished his design of colonization; but a company of one hundred and twenty persons was formed in Virginia, sixty of whom, under the command of Mr Henry More, proceeded to the island. England also, during his government, sent out supplies both of provisions and men; and the work of cultivation was prosecuted with vigour and success.

An accession of inhabitants was gained during the civil wars, many having sought a refuge from the tyranny of the ruling party in this distant sanctuary; and at this time also the population was at the highest. The archives of the colony present nothing worthy of notice after the period here referred to; tradition only handing down a succession of quarrels between the governors and the people.

Of the vast number of islands composing this archipelago, not above twelve are inhabited. The names of the principal of these are St George, Hamilton, St David, Cooper, Ireland, Somerset, Nonsuch, and Long and Bird Islands. These are closely connected, and in their characteristic features so similar, that they may be considered and described as one island. The coast is of the most dangerous description, being thickly studded with rocks, which appear and disappear with the ebb and flow of the tide; and a landing is never attempted without a pilot. The extreme length of the colony, from St Catherine’s Point on St George’s, to the western extremity of Bermudas, is not more than twenty miles; but the road continues [7:4:588] round the Great Sound to the north-east point of Somerset, making the distance twenty-four miles. The greatest breadth from north to south by land is about one mile and a half, and the whole contains a superficies of 12,161 acres, of which not so much as one tenth is ever disturbed by spade or plough. The appearance of Bermudas at first sight is highly romantic, and apparently a fitting place for the scene of such a drama as the 1empest. But a closer inspection does not justify the first impression, and the prospect becomes very monotonous. Broad fields of barren rock, and tracts of evergreen cedar, are scattered over the whole island, which is also traversed by numerous sheets of salt water. There are a great number of caves, some of which pierce far into the land, and beautiful varieties of stalactites and stalagmites fret these subterranean halls. Bermudas is miserably behind in agriculture, although capable of producing all varieties of vegetables. In 1827 there was only one plough in the whole colony, the spade being in more general request. This neglect of internal resources may be ascribed to the facility with which supplies are received from America, and also to the great varieties of excellent fish with which the shores abound, withdrawing the attention of numbers of the lower orders from the cultivation of the soil. The whale is an annual visitor of the coast; the fishing of which being a lucrative employment, is another inducement to neglect the spade. The soil is very fertile in the growth of esculent plants and roots, such as potatoes, onions, cabbages, carrots, turnips, peas, French beans, &c. Pumpkins and melons also grow luxuriantly, but they are easily destroyed by the blighting winds of the climate. The citron, sour orange, lemon, and lime, grow spontaneously in great luxuriance; but the apple and the peach arrive at no perfection. The climate is well adapted for the grape, but the inhabitants appear to be bad horticulturists, and pay no attention to the cultivation of this fruit. Medicinal plants, such as castor, aloe, and jalap, grow to great perfection without culture; and coffee, indigo, cotton, and tobacco, are also spontaneous products. A great quantity of arrow-root is raised, which is considered of first-rate quality. Almost all the occupiers of land sow a small quantity of barley; but the novel manner of reaping gives it rather an unfavourable idea of the state of agriculture in that quarter. An old woman furnished with a basket and a pair of scissors cuts off the heads of the grain, leaving the stalk erect, which is afterwards converted into bonnets. Few oxen or sheep are reared in the colony, these being supplied from our North American dominions. Every species of domestic poultry excepting geese is extensively propagated. Bermudas possesses no fresh-water streams, and only a few wells, the water of which is brackish; but there are a great many tanks, which fill during the rainy season, and afford the principal supply of water. Vegetation is very rapid on these islands, there being but little variety of temperature in the different seasons. Spring may be said never to forsake them, and accordingly the fields and forests are clad with a mantle of perpetual green. The climate, however, is by no means healthy, and only a short residence is necessary to cause the germs of constitutional disease to appear. The yellow fever also visits them, and typhus has lately made its appearance. Storms of thunder and lightning are not unfrequent, and hurricanes more or (ess violent generally pay an autumnal visit. The inhabitants foretell the approach of these by the appearance of a halo round the moon which precedes them.

There are only two small towns in Bermudas, St George’s and Hamilton, each of which has a mayor and other civic officers. The former was the capital until Sir James Cockburn removed the senate and courts of justice to Hamilton, which being centrally situated, is much more convenient. There is little display of architectural taste in these places, the buildings being both disproportioned and irregularly huddled together. They are built of sandstone, veins of which are everywhere found. Limestone is also abundant. There are three signal stations, one at St George’s, another at Mount Langton, and a third at Gibb’s Hill, at each of which a small party of soldiers is stationed. A detachment of engineers and two companies of the line are stationed on Ireland Island. A dock-yard and several other public works have been lately built, for the erection of which 700 convicts were sent out. A superb mansion for the naval commissioner has also lately been erected. The church establishment at Bermudas is composed of onc archdeacon, four rectors, and a curate, exclusive of the chaplain of the dock-yard. Schoolmasters from England are in general request, and handsome emoluments are held out to them. The laws of Bermudas are enacted by the governor and council, and the house of assembly, subject to the approval and confirmation of the government at home; the constitution in this, as in other respects, being similar to that of our other colonies in the western hemisphere.

The population of Bermudas amounts to about 10,000, of which nearly the one half are slaves. The imports amount to about L.l 1,000, and the exports to L.35,000 annually. It is 1200 leagues distant from the Madeiras, 400 from Hispaniola, and 200 from Cape Hatteras in Carolina, which is the nearest land. The north point of these islands is situated in long. 63. 28.
