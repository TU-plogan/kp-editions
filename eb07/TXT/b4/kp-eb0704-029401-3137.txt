BAKEWELL, Robert, a distinguished agriculturist and improver of live stock, was born at Dishley, in Leicestershire, in 1725 or 1726, and he died there in October 1795. Though all the different kinds of domestic animals were objects of his experiments and ameliorations, his attention was more particularly devoted to the improvement of the race of sheep known by the name of the Dishley or New Leicestershire breed; and so successful was he in this line, that some of his rams were let for the season at the extraordinary sum of four hundred guineas. His life presents no incidents or claims to notice, other than what arise from the improvements alluded to; but these were such as to secure him a high rank among the benefactors of British husbandry.

Bakewell, a market-town in the county of Derby, in the High Peak on the river Wye, 152 miles from London. The market is held on Saturday. It is remarkable for excellent trout-fishing, and for a chalybeate spring frequented by invalids. The fine seat of the Duke of Devonshire, at Chatsworth, is about six miles from the town; and Haddon Hall, the ancient family residence of the Dukes of Rutland, is in the vicinity. The population in 1801 amounted to 1412; in 1811, to 1483; and in 1821, to 1782.
