BILBOA, a city, the capital of the province of Biscay, in Spain. It is situated in a very contracted valley, through which the river Ibaicabal runs, from the occasional overflowing of which the city is subject to inundations. It is an old-built place, with narrow and crooked streets, and, for [7:4:639]the most part, with large but tasteless houses. The inhabitants amount to 15,000, and are generally the most industrious of the Spaniards; and as there is no other place near it so good, it enjoys the greater part of the foreign commerce of the north of Spain. The harbour, if it can be called one, is very bad, and most of the vessels load and are discharged at Portugalete. The only fresh water is brought to the town by an aqueduct, or is saved in rainy weather. Bilboa was formerly the chief place from which merino wool was exported; but that trade has of late years been much diminished by the success of the breeders of sheep in Germany, who produce fleeces of a superior quality to the Spanish.
