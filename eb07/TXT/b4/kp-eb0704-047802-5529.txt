BEAVER. See Mammalia, Index. Beaver Shins, in commerce. Of these, merchants distinguish three sorts; the new, the dry, and the fat. The new beaver, which is also called the white or Muscovy beaver, because it is commonly kept to be sent into Muscovy, is that which the savages catch in their winter hunting. It is the best and the most proper for making fine furs, because it has lost none of its hair by shedding. The dry beaver, sometimes called the lean beaver, comes from the summer hunting, which is the time when these animals lose part of their hair. Though this sort of beaver be much inferior to the former, yet it may also be employed in furs; but it is chiefly used in the manufacture of hats. The fat beaver is that which has contracted a certain gross and oily humour, from the sweat exhaled by the bodies of the savages by whom it has been worn. Though this sort be better than the dry beaver, yet it is used only in the making of hats. When the hair has been cut off from the beaversâ€™ skins, to be used in the manufacturing of hats, those skins are still employed by several workmen: namely, by the trunk-makers, to cover trunks and boxes; by the shoemakers, to put into slippers; and by turners, to make sieves for sifting grain and seeds.
