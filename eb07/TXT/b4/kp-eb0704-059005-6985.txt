BERNIER’S Island, a small island near the mouth of Shark’s Bay, on the western coast of New Holland. The island consists of regular horizontal beds of sand and limestone, containing shells which sometimes appear at the height of 150 feet above the level of the sea. Vegetation is languid; the chief production being a species of cyprus, the long roots of which spread over the soil like net-work. Cormorants and sea eagles in small numbers are found in the island; and there are three species of lizards, one of which measures between four and five feet in length. A beautiful kangaroo is peculiar to this and two neighbouring islands, which, though timid, makes a vigorous resistance in defence of its young, few animals being more conspicuous for maternal affection. Lat. 24. 50. S.
