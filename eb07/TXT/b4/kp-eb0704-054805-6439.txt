BELLEFOREST, Francis de, a French author, born in the province of Guienne in 1530. He was only seven years of age when he lost his father; and his mother was left in poor circumstances, but she contributed all in her power to his education. He was supported for several years by the queen of Navarre, sister to Francis I. Some time after, he went to study at Bordeaux, whence he removed to Toulouse, and afterwards to Paris, where he got acquainted with several men of learning, and was honoured with the friendship of many persons of quality. He wrote,

1. A History of the Nine Charleses of France; 2. Annotations on the books of St Augustin; 3. An universal History of the World; 4. The Chronicles of Nicholas Gillet, augmented; 5. A universal Cosmography; 6. Annals, or a General History of France; and many other works. He died in 1583.
