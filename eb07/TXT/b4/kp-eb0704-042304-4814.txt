BASAN, or Bash an, in Ancient Geography , a territory beyond Jordan, mentioned in Scripture, and called by Josephus, Eusebius, and Jerome, Batancea. The whole of the country beyond Jordan, from that of the Moabites, or Arabia, as far as Mount Hermon and Lebanon, was originally divided into two kingdoms, namely, that of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Basan or Bashan; the former being to the south, and the latter to the north. Of these, however, Basan appears to have been the larger; but after the Babylonish captivity it was subdivided, one part being called Batanaea or Basan, another Trachonitis, a third Auranitis or Ituraea, and a fourth Gaulonitis. To settle the limits of each of these parts, however, is now impossible. Bashan was famous for its pastures and large breed of cattle.
