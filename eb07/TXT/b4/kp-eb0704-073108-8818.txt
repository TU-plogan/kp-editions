BOGOTA, or Santa Fe de Bogota, the capital of the republic of Colombia, in South America, is situated in the department of Cundinamarca, in west longitude 78° 30' and north latitude 4° 6', on an elevated plain or tableland, forming part of the eastern ridge of the cordillera of the Andes, which separates the extensive valley traversed by the river Magdalena from those boundless and fertile plains that are watered by the Meta, the Casanare, and the numerous other large rivers which flow to the eastward to augment the waters of the majestic Orinoco.

The plain of Bogota has been estimated at about sixty miles in length from north to south, and thirty miles [7:4:732]in breadth from east to west. It is surrounded on all sides by lofty mountains, but more especially to the eastward, where the summits of Chingaso and the Paramo de la Suma Paz are conspicuous for their, elevation. No part of this chain, however, has been found to exceed in height 14,000 feet above the level of the sea, and consequently in these latitudes it does not reach the limits of perpetual snow. The mountains which bound it in other directions are much less elevated; and over those to the westward may be seen, in the distance, the snowy summits of the more elevated mountains which constitute the central ridge of the cordillera.

Throughout its whole extent this plain exhibits evident marks, in the perfect level of its surface, the alluvial nature of the soil, and the appearance of the insulated rocks which rise up in some parts of its extent, of having formerly been the site of an extensive lake. It is traversed by the river Fιmzha or Bogota, which, collecting into one channel the numerous mountain-streams that water the valley, bends its course to the south-western extremity of the plain, and enters a narrow channel, from which it is precipitated over a perpendicular precipice of 600 feet in height, into the valley of the Magdalena, forming the magnificent fall of Tequendama. This splendid cataract is an object of wonder and admiration to all beholders. The fall forms one continued sheet of water, interrupted only a little at its upper part by a projecting ledge of rocks. So great is the diffusion of water in the surrounding atmosphere, in the form of rain or haze, that a perpetual humidity prevails; and the vegetation in the immediate vicinity exhibits an uncommon degree of vigour and luxuriance. The contrast of the vegetation at the summit, where oaks, and elms, and other trees of temperate climes are found, and that at the bottom, where the graceful palms abound, is very remarkable, and cannot be altogether accounted for solely by the difference of level. The evaporation at the fall must be very great, as the volume of water which issues from the bottom of the valley towards the Magdalena is much smaller than at the summit, where the river leaves the plain of Bogota. In various parts of the plain, from the great equality of its surface, the banks of the river are to a considerable extent inundated, and so marshy, that, especially in the rainy season, they cannot be passed without difficulty. These situations have bccome favourite habitations to great numbers of ducks and other water-fowl, which afford excellent amusement to the sportsman, and even exercise the ingenuity of the Indians. The latter have a novel mode of catching them: they enter these grounds wearing caps made of rushes, which conceal their heads, the only part of their bodies above the water; they then move slowly and with caution to the places occupied by the ducks, which,being accustomed to witness similar caps floating about, are wholly unconscious of the near approach of their insidious enemies, and allow themselves to be seized by the feet, and secured to a girdle worn by the Indian.

Could the opening at Tequendama, through which the river Bogota now escapes, be closed up by artificial means, the whole extent of the plain would be converted into one continuous lake, as appears to have been the case in former times; for the change which has been produced, and which has rendered so great an extent of soil useful to man, has without doubt been occasioned by the agency of the river, whose waters, by constant attrition during a series of ages, have eventually been able to overcome the rocky barrier opposed to their progress, and have hollowed out the deep channel through which the river now precipitates itself into the abyss beneath; and, from our knowledge of the laws which regulate the economy of nature, we may anticipate that the same causes will in time to come still more effectually drain the plain of Bogota. The traditions of the aborigines tend to confirm the view which is now taken of the ancient condition of this plain; but, ignorant of the extensive operation of those natural causes which are known to us, they ascribed the whole to supernatural agency, and have handed down a legend, setting forth, that an aged man of great power and wisdom, named Bochica, broke down, by means of his powerful arm, a passage through the rocks which inclose the valley at Tequendama, and formed the outlet by which he drained the adjacent plain; and that having accomplished this, he taught the inhabitants of the country to build cities and villages, and introduced among them those habits of industry, civilization, and religion, which were found to exist at the time when the country was discovered by Europeans.

This extensive plain is exceedingly fertile, and susceptible of the highest cultivation. It produces abundant crops of wheat, barley, and the leguminous plants cultivated in Europe. Of the former the average produce is five quarters per acre; and of all these, owing to the regular succession of the rainy and dry seasons, two crops may be obtained from the same field in one year; a practice, however, which is not usually followed with the cerealia, as these require the alternation of green crops, to prevent the fertility of the soil becoming too much exhausted. Lucerne is also cultivated to a great extent, and affords ample sustenance to numerous flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and horses, which are reared and maintained on this plain for the supply of the capital. Before the conquest of the Spaniards, the plain of Bogota maintained a numerous population , but the inhabitants who at present reside on it, and are occupied in agricultural pursuits, are few in number compared with those who are requisite to give full development to its fertility and resources. Its immediate vicinity to a populous city, where there is a ready market for all its produce, presents very powerful inducements to the establishment of industrious and intelligent agriculturists; and, doubtless, many such, from Europe and elsewhere, will ere long find their way to so inviting a situation.

The plain of Bogota, according to the observations of 1 Humboldt, has an elevation of 8694 feet above the level of the sea; and consequently, although so near the equator, it enjoys a mild and equable climate, the inhabitants experiencing a kind of perpetual spring, and the extremes of heat and cold being seldom felt. In consequence of the sun being twice perpendicular at nearly equidistant periods during the year, there are two winter or rainy seasons, and two summer or dry seasons every year, each being of about three months continuance; the rainy season commencing about the equinoxes, and continuing during the months of March, April, and May, and again during September, October, and November; and the dry seasons beginning with the solstices, and continuing during the intermediate months. Even during the winter months the rains are not continuous, but generally the mornings are cool and exceedingly agreeable, the rain usually commencing towards the afternoon. The range of the thermometer averages at this season from fifty-eight to sixty-three degrees, but sometimes descends as low as forty-seven degrees, of Fahrenheit. During the summer months, however, there is almost constantly a serene and unclouded sky, with so little dew during the night that it scarcely incommodes the inhabitants who venture out during that period. At this season the average height of the thermometer is from sixty-eight to seventy degrees in the shade. A climate so delicious is found very conducive to the enjoyment of health, and few places within the tropics present so desirable a place of residence. Here those [7:4:733] insects and venomous reptiles which occasion so much annoyance in the neighbouring districts of less elevation are altogether unknown; and the females who inhabit this plain possess a freshness of complexion unknown to those who dwell in less favoured parts of the country. Yet, with all these advantages, the period of human existence does not appear to be in general so long protracted in this country as in more rigorous climates; old age comes on at a less advanced period of life; and females, who reach maturity at an early age, exhibit the symptoms of decay at a period when women in England are in the full enjoyment of all their physical and intellectual faculties.

Owing to its great elevation, the rarefaction of the atmosphere is so considerable, that strangers, on their first arrival at Bogota, are generally affected with a degree of oppression and difficulty of breathing; but this, in most instances, gradually disappears on their becoming longer residents. Here, epidemic diseases are altogether unknown. Travellers, however, who proceed to Bogota by the Magdalena are not unfrequently attacked, on their arrival, with intermittent fevers; but there is every reason to believe that the causes which give rise to this complaint have been in operation during the period of their navigating that river.

The mountains encircling the table-land of Bogota are replete with many valuable mineral productions, which must tend greatly to augment the wealth and prosperity of its inhabitants whenever circumstances shall favour the more complete development of these and the other natural resources of the country. Coal in considerable quantities has been discovered near Guatavita, the fall of Tequendama, and other places in these mountains; but hitherto this valuable mineral has been extracted in small quantities for the use of the blacksmith alone; yet the coal, and the iron, which is also found in these mountains, seem, by their abundance, calculated to produce a powerful influence over the habits and destinies of this favoured region; though they cannot prove of much value until the formation of good roads, and the introduction of improved methods of working them, shall lay open these hidden treasures to the use of man.

Abundance of excellent salt is obtained from the mines of Zipaquira, Tauza, and Enemocon, and the saline springs at Yousa, which have hitherto supplied the inhabitants of all the mountainous parts of Colombia with this important and necessary article. The quantities, however, which have hitherto been produced have proved quite inadequate to the demand, and, in consequence of the operose and expensive mode by which it is obtained, the profits of the undertaking have been inconsiderable; the same methods having been followed, until within these few years, as were originally practised by the Indians. A proposal was made some years ago, by an English gentleman named Thomson, to place these establishments on an improved and more productive footing, and his scheme received the sanction of the government of Colombia; but, owing to some mismanagement on the part of those concerned, it would appear that the undertaking has been abandoned. The salt of these mines has been found to be precisely similar to the rock-salt of Cheshire and other parts of Europe, and it is purified by the same method. Amongst the mineral productions of the mountains surrounding Bogota might be mentioned the celebrated emerald mines of Mozo, and various others of gold, silver, and copper; but these will more properly come under consideration when treating of the productions of’Colombia.

The city of Santa Fe de Bogota was founded in 1538, by Gonzalez Ximenes de Quesada, at the base of two mountains, which are known by the names of La Guadalupe and Monteserrato. At first it consisted of only twelve houses, in honour of the twelve apostles, and contained only sixty inhabitants; but, from its favourable situation, it increased rapidly, and became a place of considerable extent; and in two years afterwards it was raised to the rank of a city, and eventually became the seat of government for the kingdom of New Grenada. Its population in 1800 consisted of 21,464, exclusive of strangers and temporary residenters; and in that year the number of births exceeded that of deaths by 247. Its population was estimated at 30,000 in 1821, when, on the union of New Grenada and Venezuela, to form the republic of Colombia, it became the capital and the seat of government. By this event it has acquired much additional importance, and so great has been the influx of natives and foreigners, that the latest accounts estimate the numbers at upwards of 40,000 souls. The rapid increase of the population has already greatly enhanced the value of houses and other property in the city and its vicinity. Nature indeed seems to have pointed out the plain of Bogota as the most eligible situation which can well be imagined for the formation of a great and opulent city, the seat of government of a powerful nation. It enjoys a genial and salubrious climate, in the midst of a fertile and abundant district; and it forms the centre from which diverge to the north and to the east the two most extensive lines of internal navigation to be found in Colombia.

Bogota is only distant about twenty-two leagues from Honda, on the Magdalena; and a good road was lately in progress between the capital and the Penon de Conejo, on the banks of that river. Steam-vessels are also constantly passing to and from Carthagena and Santa Martha, near the mouth of the Magdalena, by which means the expense of carriage and of travelling has been greatly diminished, and passengers suffer much less than heretofore from exposure to the noxious influence of the climate; the time occupied in ascending that river being shortened from about forty days to less than a fourth part of that time. The distance from the sea to the point of disembarkation is about 540 miles. To the eastward, by the Paso de la Cabulla, situated between the lofty mountains of Chingaso and the Paramo de la Suma Paz, Bogota is distant only about fifteen leagues from the Rio Negro, which is navigable to its junction with the Meta, a river affording uninterrupted communication with the Orinoco; while the latter opens up numerous channels of internal navigation, besides a free transit for vessels of considerable size, to Angostura and to the Atlantic, being a line of navigation from the point of embarkation near Bogota to the sea, of not less than 1500 miles. Fully aware of the immense importance of opening up to commerce so extensive a line of internal communication, the government of Colombia, some years ago, took measures to place it on a permanent footing, and accordingly granted to Colonel James Hamilton of the Colombian service the exclusive privilege for ten years, under certain conditions, of navigating these rivers by means of steam-vessels. This arrangement, however, was not finally acted upon, as the steam-boats did not reach the country within the specified time, by which means the privilege was forfeited, and the project suspended for a time. But on reviewing the numerous important channels of internal navigation which communicate with the Orinoco, little doubt can be entertained that this will ere long become of even more importance than that line of communication which is now established on the Magdalena. As the road from Bogota to the Rio Negro has hitherto been of less immediate importance than that to the Magdalena, we understand that little attention has as yet been paid by the authorities of the country towards rendering it available for commercial [7:4:734]purposes. Notwithstanding all the disadvantages of the bad roads which prevail throughout the whole country, Bogota continues to be the best and most expeditious line of communication between Europe and Quito, as well as the other southern provinces of the republic. ∙ ∙ ‘

On approaching Bogota from the Magdalena, the city is seen at a considerable distance, the cathedral and the convents of Guadalupe and Monteserrato being the most conspicuous objects in view. The latter are built on the summits of two mountains having an elevation of about 2500, or, according to Hamilton, 2420, feet above the city, which is built at their base. These mountains are ascended by a very steep and difficult road; but the labour of the ascent is amply repaid by the magnificent view which is presented to the eye of the spectator, of the city, its convents and gardens, and the whole extent of the plain, with its villages, its hamlets, and cultivated fields. The city itself is somewhat in the form of an amphitheatre, and occupies a larger space than might seem requisite for the number of its inhabitants. The convents, however, which are numerous, together with their extensive gardens, comprise a considerable portion of it; and the houses, on account of the earthquakes, are generally of but one story. The cathedral, which was built in 1814, after the design of a Colombian architect, possesses in its exterior very little architectural beauty: but its interior is nevertheless fitted up with considerable taste and elegance; its ornaments are rich and valuable; and the statue of the virgin, who is the patron saint, is covered with a profusion of diamonds and other precious stones. The convents, which were formerly numerous (about 33), and many of them richly endowed, have of late years fallen into decay, and been devoted to the service of government, and to other purposes very different from those for which they were originally intended. According to the latest accounts, however, there are still about nine convents and three nunneries occupied by religious persons, of which the most wealthy and prosperous are those of Santo Domingo and San Juan de Dios, to which latter there is attached an hospital for the reception of the sick and wounded. This institution seems to have fallen somewhat into decay about the period when Bogota became the seat of the republican government, for it was then described as being conducted in a very inefficient and slovenly manner; but later accounts inform us that it is now a very well regulated and useful establishment, affording accommodation to several hundred inmates, who are carefully attended by the friars, and plentifully supplied with every thing requisite; besides which, food is here daily distributed to the poor. The convent of San Francisco, although by the rule of that order possessed of comparatively little wealth, is yet of great extent, and under good management; and it contains many valuable paintings, the productions of Basquez, a native artist of considerable merit, one of which, in particular, a Madonna with an infant Jesus, has been mentioned in terms of high commendation.

The university of Bogota was founded in 1610, since which time two colleges have been endowed with large revenues for the purposes of education. The colleges are now three in number, and in them are educated nearly all the youth of these countries. The students wear caps and gowns, which, for the purposes of distinction, are white in one college and red in the other. Before the revolution, one of these colleges was appropriated solely for the education of the young nobility, and the other for the sons of the middling classes; but since that period all such distinctions have been abolished. Formerly the course of study was confined to Latin, mathematics, natural and moral philosophy, and theology; and even then the uni versity produced some men of great eminence for their attainments in the natural sciences, among whom Mutis, Caldas, and Zea, hold a distinguished place. Of late years great improvements have taken place in the course of study, which has been regulated more in unison with the advanced state of science and philosophy. Professors of eminence have been brought from Europe; and a school of mineralogy has been established under the able auspices of Dr Ribero, who, although a native of Peru, has enjoyed the advantage of being educated at the best schools in Europe. Under his direction has also been formed a national museum, which, in consequence of the zeal and activity of those connected with it, has already made great progress. There has likewise been formed in one of the colleges a public library, which was under the able direction of Dr Jose Maria Esteves, and contained 12,000 volumes. Lancasterian schools have been established in Bogota, in consequence of the judicious regulations of the government of Colombia, which has provided for the formation of such schools, not only in all the cities, but in every village and district throughout the republic. Neither has the education of the female children been neglected, as in former times; efficient means having been adopted for rescuing this interesting portion of the community from that state of moral and intellectual debasement in which they have so long been held. But still this department is too much under the guidance of the nuns and the clergy, whose limited acquirements and secluded habits render them by no means the most eligible instructors for preparing youth for the active duties of life. The revenues of the greater part of the monastic establishments, which were falling into decay in consequence of the diminished number of their inmates, or the increased intelligence of the people, have been devoted to the purposes of education; and if administered with judgment and integrity, will form a permanent fund, which may be productive of incalculable advantages in promoting the future welfare of the country and its inhabitants.

The mint is a large and handsome building, with ample accommodation for the various officers employed in the establishment. The coining machinery is of great strength and solidity, and all the departments are regulated with much precision and minuteness. This is the only mint in the kingdom of New Grenada, with the exception of that of Popayan; and we are informed by Humboldt, that from 1789 to 1795, 8,161,862 dollars were coined at Santa Fe de Bogota, and from 1788 to 1794, 6,502,542 dollars∙in Popayan. At the commencement of the present century, the following was the amount of coinage in New Grenada during four years.
[table]

After this period the coinage seems to have increased in amount, since in Santa Fe de Bogota alone no less than 3,499,489 dollars were issued in 1806 and 1807. We are not in possession of any details of the amount of coinage since the country came under the management of the republican government.

The palace where the viceroy of New Grenada formerly resided is a plain building with a flat roof, having attached to it on each side other buildings, in which are contained the public offices and the prison. The central building, which is the residence of the vice-president of the republic, is devoid of ornament, and possesses few of those conveniences that are considered essential in such [7:4:735] an establishment. The apartments, however, are spacious, and the hall of audience is about thirty-six feet in length by sixteen in breadth, and provided with sofas and a throne, covered with crimson damask; but the lamps are suspended from the beams, as it is destitute of ceiling, which gives the whole an unfinished appearance. The places in which the senate and the house of representatives assemble have little to recommend them besides their utility, being merely temporary places of accommodation; a portion of the convent of Santo Domingo having been fitted up for the former, and part of a private house for the latter. The private houses are generally good, and for the most part of only one story, the rooms communicating with each other, and likewise with an inner court or patio, in which are sometimes contained fountains and orange trees. But of late years an improved and more convenient style of building has been introduced, in consequence of the great influx of foreigners since the establishment of their independence.

The streets, as in almost all cities built by the Spaniards in South America, are formed at right angles to each other; and all those extending from east to west have a small stream of water flowing along them, a convenience which might tend greatly to increase the comfort and cleanliness of the inhabitants, under an improved system of police. Only a few of the principal streets are provided with side pavements, such as the Calle Real and the Calle de San Juan de Dios, which are the most frequented. The former, which extends from the great square or plaza to the bridge of San Francisco, contains handsome shops and arcades, which are much frequented in rainy weather. There are four public squares or plazas provided with fountains, and five handsome bridges over two small rivulets which traverse the city, enter the Funzha, and are named San Francisco and San Augustin, from passing near the two convents so named.

A public market is held every Friday in the great square, where abundant supplies of all kinds of provisions are exposed for sale, and where may be seen an assemblage of all the varied classes which inhabit this country, the Creole, the Mulatto, the Mestizo, the Indian, and the Negro. A considerable proportion of the last are slaves; but the number in this degraded condition is gradually diminishing, from the operation of those wise and beneficent laws which have been enacted by the republican government for the gradual extinction of slavery. The supplies of beef, mutton, and pork, are abundant and at moderate prices, but of an inferior quality to that usually met with in England; which is attributed to the defective method they follow in fattening their cattle for the market, and in killing and cutting them up. Poultry and game are in great abundance, and are moderate in price. Vegetables and fruit are also abundant, and in the utmost variety; the vegetable productions of the tropical, the temperate, and even cold regions, being all easily attainable, in consequence of the diversified elevation of the surrounding country. Thus we find in one place quantities of wheat, barley, and corn; in another maize, cocoa, and sugar; in a third, quantities of cabbages, carrots, potatoes, and arracachas, intermingled with tornatas, yuccas, and bananas; while apples, strawberries, peaches, pomegranates, melons, ananas, agua-cates, pine-apples, chirimoyas, zapotas, mangoes, and many other kinds of fruit, are found in equal profusion, and are moderate in price. One part of the market-place is appropriated to the sale of articles of native manufacture, which consist principally of coarse cotton and woollen fabrics.

The police of Bogota, and the lighting of the streets, are in a very neglected state, and many disagreeable and disgusting sights may in consequence be witnessed in the market-place, and most of the streets; while the office of scavenger seems to be principally intrusted to the gal-linazos, a species of small black vulture (vultur aura), which may often be seen in great numbers, and are very tame. In the vicinity of the river Funzha or Bogota, which is here an inconsiderable stream, and runs close to the city, is situated the alameda or public promenade, which is inclosed on each side by gardens, and shaded by rows of stately poplars. This forms the favourite resort of the inhabitants during the delightful evenings of summer; and the surrounding gardens afford a place of resort to such parties as desire to solace themselves with the sweet notes of their favourite guitar.

The society of Bogota is very agreeable, the inhabitants being mild, polite, and cheerful. They are naturally fond of gaiety and amusements, as is evinced by the frequency of their tertulias, or evening parties, their balls and concerts. The ladies are remarkably lively and pleasing in their manners, and are for the most part short in stature, but delicately formed, their feet and ancles being particularly small and handsome, which they set off to great advantage by the neatness of their shoes and silk stockings. The morning dress, in which they usually attend their devotions, consists of the saya and mantilla, surmounted by a sombrero or broad-brimmed black beaver hat. The saga or skirt of black kerseymere or silk, variously ornamented, fits closely to the body, and is well calculated to show off a fine figure; the mantilla covers the neck and shoulders, and sometimes the head, and is kept close to the body by the folded arms. The dress of the beatas or female devotees is somewhat remarkable, and merits notice. Those devoted to Nuestra Señora del Carmen “are generally,” says a late writer, “young ladies, who on some occasion of sickness or peril, either of their own or of some near relation, have vowed, in case of their deliverance, to assume the habit of the Carmelite nuns for a year or a longer period, as the case may be. The Carmelite habit, as worn at Bogota, consists of a saya of fine cloth or stuff of a reddish brown or fawn colour, used by the nuns of that order, with a white hat, mantilla, and shoes. Round the waist is bound a cord of twisted silk, in imitation of the scourges carried by the nuns, but having tassels instead of knots hanging from it. This dress is very becoming, for the fair ladies who assume it do not think themselves obliged by their vow to imitate the nuns so closely as to cut off their hair. This may perhaps account for the number of youthful and generally pretty females who are to be seen wearing it, while the dark-coloured habits of the other orders of San Francisco and La Señora de Dolores are usually worn only by elderly devotees, and those whose admirers would not be quite inconsolable were they to take the veil in earnest.” The evening promenade dresses of the ladies are much more showy and diversified, both in form and texture, than those which are worn in the early part of the day, partaking a good deal of the fashions of Europe, which daily become more prevalent; and at their balls and tertulias they frequently display the additional ornaments of a profusion of rich and valuable jewels. They dance with much grace and elegance; and the favourite dances of the country, among which may be noticed the Spanish contra-danza, by its slow and graceful movements, is peculiarly well calculated to exhibit to advantage the fine figures which they possess, in common with most other women of Spanish origin. The females of the inferior classes usually go without shoes or stockings, a practice which often forms a striking contrast with the rest of their attire, which in many such cases is both showy and expensive.

The moral condition of the inhabitants of Bogota has: been variously estimated, and perhaps in most instances ∣ incorrectly. The political state of the country before 1 [7:4:736]the revolution was such as to afford little scope for the exercise of the higher faculties; and consequently they were neither remarkable for instances of atrocious crime on the one hand, nor of extraordinary virtue on the other. But the eventful and exciting scenes of the revolution have given rise to a development of character which shows that they possess in a high degree those qualities which are calculated to raise them in the scale of civilization. They are by no means deficient in natural abilities, and they only require the advantage of an improved system of education, and favourable circumstances, to acquire a high degree of cultivation.

Previous to the revolution, the men, besides their ordinary occupations or religious duties, had scarcely any other means of employing their leisure time than by devoting themselves to gambling, cock-fighting, and bull-baiting. The women, brought up in the most profound ignorance, and deeply imbued with all the unmeaning superstitions which accompany a religion that only appeals to the senses, devoted much of their time to their religious duties, and in attendance on the numerous festivals and processions which the clergy kept so constantly before them, well aware of the influence of pomp and circumstance over the ignorant and the uneducated. Some have affirmed that the females are rather lax in their morals, especially after marriage; and perhaps, if judged by the standard of female morality in the more highly educated nations of the world, they rhight lose by the comparison; yet this difference may with great justice be attributed to the peculiar circumstances in which they have been placed. The want of a good and efficient education, the demoralizing influence of some of the religious practices there prevalent, and the comparatively little estimation in which virtuous conduct in females has hitherto been held, have tended materially to lower the tone of morals in the country. But a new epoch has at length dawned upon them; efficient means have been adopted to promote education and intelligence among all classes; and a purer system of ethics seems to be gradually introducing itself into the country, as has been shown, among other things, by the establishment of a Bible Society in Bogota, under the able auspices of some of the most influential men of the country, and even aided by the Catholic clergy themselves.
