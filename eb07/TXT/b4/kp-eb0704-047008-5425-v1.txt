BEAGLES, a small sort of hounds or hunting dogs. Beagles are of different kinds, as the southern beagle, [7:4:471] something less and shorter, but thicker, than the deep-mouthed hound; the fleet northern or cat beagle, smaller and ofa finer shape than the southern, and a harder runner. From the two, by crossing the strains, is bred a third sort, considered preferable to either. And to these may be added a still smaller sort of beagles, scarcely bigger than lap-dogs, which make pretty diversion in hunting the coney or even the small hare in dry weather, but are otherwise unserviceable by reason of their size.

Beak or Beak-head of a ship, that part without the ship before the forecastle which is fastened to the stem, and is supported by the main-knee. The beak, called by the Greeks iμZο∖oς, by the Latins rostrum, was an important part in the ancient ships of war, which were hence denominated naves rostratae. The beak was made of wood, but fortified with brass, and fastened to the prow, serving to annoy the enemy’s vessels. Its invention is attributed to Pisaeus, an Italian. The first beaks were made long and high; but afterwards a Corinthian, named Aristo, caused them to be made short and strong, and placed so low as to pierce the enemy’s vessels under water. By means of these great havock was made by the Syracusans in the Athenian fleet.
