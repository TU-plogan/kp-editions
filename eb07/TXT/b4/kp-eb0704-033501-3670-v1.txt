BALZAC, John Lewis Guez de, born at Angoulême in 1594- He was one of the most distinguished and po- nular writers of his day, but his works have long since sunk into comparative obscurity. Voltaire allows him the merit of having been the first who gave numbers and harmony to French prose, but censures his style as somewhat bombastic. His writings extend to two folio volumes, which were published in that form in 1665, with a preface by the Abbé Cassaigne; but his reputation was chiefly founded upon his Letters·, which passed through many editions, and were translated into various languages. He died in 1655, and was buried in the hospital of Nôtre Dame des Anges, to which he bequeathed 12,000 livres. He also left an estate of 100 franks per annum for a gold medal to be bestowed every two years for the best discourse on some moral subject?
