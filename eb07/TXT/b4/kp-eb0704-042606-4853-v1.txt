BASILICA, rα BaΛλ∕κa, in the history of jurisprudence, a name given to a digest of laws, commenced by the emperor Basilius, and completed by his son Leo the philosopher. This collection, according to some, received the title of Basilica in honour of the emperor Basilius; while others think that it was so denominated from the circumstance of its containing βa<iιλ∣xaς διατάζεις or imperial constitutions. It was begun by Basilius in the year 867, and completed by Leo in the year 880; the former having carried the work as far as forty books, and the latter having added twenty more, in which state it was published. In 911 Leo was succeeded by his son Constantinus Porphyrogennetus, from whom the Basilica received their final revision, τr l ν τsλευτα∣αv αναχαόαξ&ιν ; and the amended edition is supposed by Heimbach to have appeared about the year 945. Opinions, however, are divided as to whether the work has descended to us in the state in which it was first published by Leo, or according to the revised and improved edition of Constantine. Brunquell thinks that wc possess the Basilica in the amended form; but Hoffmann considers this opinion doubtful, andhis suspicionshave been confirmed by the subsequent investigations of Heimbach. In the West, the Basilica never obtained the force of law; and the chief value of the collection therefore consists in the illustration it furnishes of the Justinianean body of law from which it was mostly compiled; but in this respect its utility has long been understood and acknowledged. Four complete books of the Basilica, namely, the forty-fifth, forty-sixth, forty-seventh, and forty-eighth, and fragments of two others, the twenty-eighth and twentyninth, were published at Paris in 1557, accompanied with a Latin version, by Gentianus Hervetus. In 1566, Cuja* cius published, at Lyons, a Latin version of the sixtieth [7:4:427] book, which is of great length. And the different portions' which had thus been edited were collected by Dionysius Gothofredus, and printed at Hanau in 1598 and 1606. But the more extensive and complete edition of Fabrot, which appeared at Paris in 1647, superseded these imperfect publications, and proved of great service to the study of ancient jurisprudence. It is contained in seven volumes folio, and accompanied with a Latin version of the text as well as of the Greek scholia subjoined. Of the sixty books which composed this great work Fabrot supposes that he has exhibited forty-one in an entire form; but Meerrnan, Reitz, and others, think that this estimate admits of some abatement. About a century after the date of Fabroťs edition, Reitz published four entire books of the Basilica, namely, the forty-ninth, fiftieth, fifty-first, and fifty-second, which were inserted in the fifth volume of Meerman’s Thesaurus Juris Civilis et Canonici, and, thirteen years afterwards, given to the world in a separate form, accompanied with the commentaries (as edited by Ruhnken) of Thalelaeus, Theodorus, Stephanus, Cyrillus, Gobidas, and other Greek lawyers on the titles of the Pandects and Code De Postulando sive de Advocatis, nee non de Procuratoribus et Defensoribus. With regard to the ancient Glossae, which are not without their value, they were first published by Labbé, and afterwards illustrated by Schulting and Rover.^[1.
