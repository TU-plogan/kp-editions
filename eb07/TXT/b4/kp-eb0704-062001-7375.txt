BIBLIANDER, Theodore, professor of divinity at Zurich in the sixteenth century. As he understood the oriental languages, he undertook a new edition of the Koran, the text of which he corrected, by collating the Arabic and Latin copies; and to this edition he subjoined the life of Mahommed and his successors, prefixing an apology by way of preface, which has been vehemently censured.
