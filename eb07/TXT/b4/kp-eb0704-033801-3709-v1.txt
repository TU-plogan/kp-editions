BAMBOROUGH, a village in Northumberland, on the sea-coast, fourteen miles north of Alnwick, was once a royal borough, sending two members to parliament, and even gave name to a large tract extending southward which was called Bamboroughshire. It had also three religious foundations, a house of friars preachers founded by Henry III., a cell of canons regular of St Austin, and an hospital. Its very ancient castle stands on an almost perpendicular rock close to the sea, and accessible only on the south-east side, on a spot where, according to the monkish historians, there stood the castle or palace of the kings of Northumberland, said to have been built by King Ina, who began his reign about the year 559. Part of the present ruin is by some supposed to be the remains of King Ina’s work.
