BENOIT, Renatus, a famous doctor of the Sorbonne, and curate of Eustathius at Paris, in the sixteenth century. He was a secret favourer of the Protestant religion; and that his countrymen might be able to read the Bible in their own tongue, he published at Paris the French translation which had been made by the reformed ministers at Geneva. This translation was approved of by several doctors of the Sorbonne before it went to the press, and King Charles IX. had granted a privilege for the printing of it; yet when it was published it was immediately condemned. He had, before that time, been confessor to Mary queen of Scotland during her stay in France, and attended her when she returned into Scotland. Some time previous to the death of Henry III. Dr Benoit, or some of his friends with his assistance, published a book entitled Apologie Catholique; in which it was shown that the Protestant religion which Henry king of Navarre professed was not a sufficient reason to deprive him of his right of succeeding to the crown of France. When Henry IV. had resolved to embrace the Catholic religion, Dr Benoit assisted at the assembly in which the king abjured the reformed religion. In 1597 Henry promoted him to the bishopric of Troyes in Champagne, but he could never obtain the pope’s bulls to be installed. However, he enjoyed the temporalities of that bishopric till he resigned it. He died in 1608.
