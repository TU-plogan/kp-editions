BIJANAGUR, an ancient city in the south of India, in the Balaghaut ceded territories, once the capital of a great Hindoo empire, though now in ruins. It is situated on the south bank of the Toombuddra river, directly opposite to Annagoondy. The city has been inclosed with strong stone walls on the east side, and is bounded by the river on the west, the circumference of the whole appearing to be about eight miles. The streets of this city, from thirty to forty yards wide, can be traced between the immense piles of rocks crowned with pagodas; and one street yet remains perfect. The building of this metropolis was begun in a. d. 1336. Between the sovereigns of the principality of which it was the capital, and the Mahommedan sovereigns of the Deccan, constant hostility was maintained; and in 1564, Ram Rajah, the sovereign of Bijanagur, was totally overthrown, by a combination of four Mahommedan sovereigns of the Deccan, on the plains of Tellicotta, who immediately marched to the metropolis, which they abandoned to pillage; and since this period it has lain in ruins. The travelling distance from Calcutta is 1120 miles.
