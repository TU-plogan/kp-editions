BEVELAND, North and South, the name of two Zealand islands, formed by the divided branches of the Scheldt. North Beveland is about six miles in length by four in breadth. It lies to the east of the island of Walcheren, and is separated from South Beveland by the island Wolfersdyke. The inundation of 1532 completely ruined it. For many years it remained immersed in water, and was only again formed into an island by the gradual deposits of the sea. South Beveland is twenty-four miles long by from five to eight broad. It contains the town of Goes, and several forts and villages. An active trade in corn is carried on here, and the place is considered one of the most agreeable of the Zealand islands.
