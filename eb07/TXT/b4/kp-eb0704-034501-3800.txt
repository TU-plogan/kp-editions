BANGALORE, a fortified town of Hindostan, in the rajah of Mysoreâ€™s territories, founded by Hyder. The fort, which was constructed by Hyder after the best fashion of Mahommedan architecture, was destroyed by his son Tippoo, after he found that it was incapable of effectuallyresist-jog the British army. It was afterwards repaired in 1802. 1he gardens made here by Hyder and Tippoo are extensive, and, owing to the height of the ground, the town being by observation 2901 feet above Madras, European fruits and plants may be reared. During the reign of Hyder this city was populous, but was much injured by the edicts of Tippoo, prohibiting all trade with the dominions of Arcot and Hyderabad, and by his forcing the merchants to buy from him a large quantity of goods at a high price. To complete its misfortunes, the town was stormed by the British troops under Cornwallis, and abandoned to [7:4:346]plunder. The travelling distance'from Seringapstam is 74 miles, from Madras 215, and from Hyderabad 352. Long. 77. 46. E. Lat. 12. 57. N.
