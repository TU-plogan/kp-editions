BENCOOLEN, the chief establishment possessed by the East India Company, in the island of Sumatra, on the south-western coast. It was for a few years a distinct presidency, but has been since placed under a resident, with four assistants, subject to the immediate direction of the government of Bengal. Under the East India Company’s government there is a number of districts, the lands of which were taken possession of in 1685, in virtue of an agreement with the neighbouring chiefs. In 1698 the settlement had cost the company L.200,000, and at the same time proved remarkably unhealthy. The foundation [7:4:562] of Fort Marlborough was laid in 1714; and in 1719 the settlers were expelled by the natives, but were soon permitted to re-establish themselves. In 1760 all the English settlements on the coast of Sumatra were destroyed by a French fleet under Comte đ’Estaign; but they were afterwards secured to the British by the treaty of 1763.

The settlement thus established by the East India Company was the seat of every species of mal-administration. The people were oppressed by being forced to cultivate pepper, the professed and only object of the settlement; but of this, however, the quantity produced had dwindled away to one solitary cargo yearly, of the value of L.15,000. The revenues arising from this settlement had diminished in 1824 from L.12,891, their amount in 1809, to L.6811, while the charges during the same period were increased from L.70,986 to L.101,528. In 1817 Sir Stamford Raffles arrived here as lieutenant-governor; and he gives a deplorable account of the wretchedness, desolation, and misgovernment which prevailed. He instantly began, with all his characteristic zeal, the work of reformation, by emancipating the government slaves, freeing the people from the compulsory cultivation of pepper, and introducing various other changes. Under his beneficent administration a great improvement was effected. Cultivation was extended, and trade would soon have furnished ample products. But, while these ameliorations were in progress, Sir Stamford left the settlement, in 1824, and it was soon after transferred to the government of the Netherlands. Long. 102. 3. E. Lat. 3. 50. S.
