BANNER denotes either a square flag, or the principal standard belonging to a prince. We find a multiplicity of opinions concerning the etymology of the word banner; some deriving it from the Latin bandum, a band or flag; others from the word bann, to summon the vassals to appear in arms; others again from the German ban, a field or tenement, because landed men alone were allowed a banner; and, finally, there are persons who think it a corruption of panni√®re, from pannus, cloth, because banners were originally made of cloth.
