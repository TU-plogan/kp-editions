BEACON, a signal for the better securing the kingdom against foreign invasions. On certain eminent places of the country were placed long poles, whereon were fastened pitch-barrels to be fired by night, and to produce smoke by day, to give notice in a few hours to the whole kingdom of an approaching invasion. These were beacons.

Beacons are also marks and signs erected on the coasts for guiding and preserving vessels at sea by night as well as by day. The erection of beacons, light-houses, and sea-marks, is a branch of the royal prerogative. The king has the exclusive power, by comnfission under his great seal, to cause them to be erected in fit and convenient places, as well upon the lands of the subject as upon the demesnes of the crown, which power is usually vested by letters-patent in the office of lord high admiral. And by statute 8 Elizabeth, c. 13, the corporation of the Trinityhouse is empowered to set up any beacons or sea-marks wherever they shall think such necessary; and the owner of the land or any other person destroying these, or taking down any steeple, tree, or other known sea-mark, is declared liable to severe penalties.
