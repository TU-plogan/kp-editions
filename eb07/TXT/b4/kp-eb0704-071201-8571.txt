BLOW, Dr John, a famous musician and composer, was born in 1648, at North Collingham, in the county of Nottingham, and was one of the first set of children after the Restoration, bred up under Captain Henry Cook. He was also a pupil of Hingeston, organist to Oliver Cromwell, and after that of Dr Christopher Gibbons. On the 16th day of March 1673, he was sworn one of the gentlemen of the chapel, in the room of Roger Hill; and in July 1674, upon the decease of Mr Pelham Humphrey, he was appointed master of the children of the chapel. In 1685 he was made one of his majesty’s private band; and in 1687 he was appointed almoner and master of the choristers of the cathedral church of St Paul. Blow was not a graduate of either university; but Archbishop Sancroft, in virtue of his own authority in that respect, conferred on him the degree of doctor in music. Upon the decease of Purcell in 1665, he became organist of Westminster Abbey. In the year 1699 he was appointed composer to his majesty, with a salary. Blow was a composer of anthems while a chapel-boy, and on the score of his merit was distinguished by Charles II. The king admired very much a little duet of Carissimi to the words Dite o cieli, and asked Blow if he could imitate it. Blow modestly answered he would try; and composed in the same measure, and on the same key of D with a minor third, that fine song, “Go, perjured man.” The Orpheus βritannicus of Purcell had been published by his widow soon after his decease, and contained in it some of that author’s finest songs. The favourable reception it met with induced Blow to publish, in the year 1700, a work of the same kind, entitled Amphion Anglicus, containing compositions for one, two, three, and four voices, with accompaniments of instrumental music, and a thorough bass figured for the organ, harpsicod, or theorbolute. In 1684 Dr Blow set to music an ode for St Cecilia’s day, the words by Mr Oldham. He also composed and published a collection of lessons for the harpsichord or spinet; and an ode on the death of Purcell, written by Mr Dryden. There are likewise extant of his composition sundry hymns printed in the Harmonia Sacra, and a great number of catches in the latter editions of the Musical Companion. He died in the year 1708, and lies buried in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey.
