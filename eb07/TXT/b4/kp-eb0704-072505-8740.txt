BOCHART, Samuel, one of the most learned men of the seventeenth century, was born atRoucn in Normandy in the year 1599. He early made great progress in learning, and became a proficient in the oriental languages. He was many years pastor of a Protestant church at Caen, and became tutor to Wentworth Dillon, earl of Roscommon, and author of the Essay on Translated Verse. While at Caen, he particularly distinguished himself by his public disputations with Father Veron, a Jesuit, and celebrated as a polemic. The dispute was held in the castle of Caen, in the presence of a great number of Catholics and Protestants, including among the former the duke of Longueville. Bochart came off with great honour; and his reputation was not a little increased, in the year 1646, by the publication of his Phaleg and Chanaan, which are the titles of the two parts of his Geographia Sacra. He also acquired great fame by bis Hierozoicon, printed in London in 1675, which treats of the sacred animals of Scripture. The great learning he displayed in his works rendered him esteemed not only among those of his own [7:4:726]profession, but amongst all lovers of knowledge, of whatsoever denomination. In 1652, Christina, queen of Sweden, invited him to Stockholm: he repaired thither accompanied by Huet, and was very well received. On his return to Cacn he resumed the functions of the ministry, married, and was received into the academy of that city. Bochart was a man of profound erudition; he possessed a thorough knowledge of the principal oriental languages, including the Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldaic, and Arabic; and such was his zeal for extending his acquirements, that at an advanced age he wished to learn Ethiopic. He was also remarkable for modesty and candour; but, like all scholars who have become deeply imbued with the language which has formed the favourite object of their studies, he saw Phoenician, and nothing but Phoenician, in every thing, even in the words of the Celtic; and hence the prodigious number of chimerical etymologies which swarm in his works. He died on the 16th of May 1667, in the sixty-eighth year of his age. A complete edition of his works was published at Leyden, under the title of Sam.
