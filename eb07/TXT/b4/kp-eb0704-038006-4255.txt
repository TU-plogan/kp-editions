BARGHMOTE, or Barmote, a court which takes cognizance of causes and disputes between miners. By the custom of the mines, no person is to sue any miner for ore-debt, or for ore, or for any ground in variance, but only in the court of barmote, on penalty of forfeiting the debt, and paying the charges at law.
