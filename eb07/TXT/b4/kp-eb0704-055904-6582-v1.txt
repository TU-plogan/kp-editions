BELT, Great and Little, the name of two straits which eonnect the Baltie with the Cattegat. The former lies between the islands of Zealand and Funen. Its greatest width is about twenty miles, and its depth varies from five to twenty fathoms. The navigation of the Great Belt is dangerous, from the number of sand-banks and small islands whieh it eontains. The shores in general are neither bold nor lofty, but they afford convenient harbours and anehorage. Vessels passing this strait pay toll at Nyborg, where a guard-ship is stationed to enforce eompliance. The Little Belt separates the island of Funen from Jutland. Its greatest breadth is not more than the half of that of the Great Belt, and at the fortress of Frederieia, where the tolls are levied, it does not exeeed a mile. The depth is from four to twenty fathoms. It contains several sandbanks, and the current from the Baltic to the Cattegat is of great strength. The passage of both Belts is attended with risk for large vessels, and on that aecount the Sound is more generally frequented.

Belt, Balteus, properly denotes a kind of military girdle or eineture, usually of leather, by whieh the sword or any other weapon is sustained. The belt was an essentia 1 pieee of the aneient armour; insomuch that we sometimes find it used to denote the whole armour. In later ages the belt was given to a person when he was raised to knighthood; and henee it has also been used as a badge or mark of the knightly order.

Belts, in Astronomy. See Astronomy. BEL-Tein, a superstitious custom observed in the Highlands of Scotland. It was a kind of rural saerifiee, performed by the herdsmen of every village on the first of May, and seems to be a remnant of some oriental superstition. Some aecount of this festival may be found in Pennant’s Tour, General Stewart’s Sketches, and in almost every work whieh treats of the Highlands.
