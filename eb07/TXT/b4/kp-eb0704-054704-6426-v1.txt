BELLAI, William du, lord of Langey, a French general, who signalized himself in the service of Francis I. He was also an able negociator, so that the emperor Charles V. used to observe, that “Langey’s pen had fought more against him than all the lances in France.” He was [7:4:548] sent to Piedmont in quality of viceroy, where he took several towns from the imperialists. His address in pene- "trating into the enemy’s designs was surprising. In this he spared no expense, and often obtained intelligence of the most secret counsels of the emperor and his generals. He was extremely active in influencing some of the universities of France to give a judgment agreeable to the .desires of Henry VIII. king of England, when this prince wished to divorce his queen in order to marry Anne Boleyn. It was then the interest of France to favour the king of England in this particular, it being an affront to the emperor, and a gratification to Henry, which might serve to form a strict alliance between him and Francis I. Langey was also a man of learning, and composed several works, the most remarkable of which was, the History of his Own Times, in Latin, divided into ogdoades, or parts, each consisting of eight books. While Langey was in Piedmont in 1542 he received some remarkable intelligence which he was desirous tQ communicate personally to the king, and being very infirm, he ordered a litter for his conveyance; but after passing the Rhone, near Lyons, he became so extremely ill, that he was obliged to stop at a small town, where he died on the 9th of January 1543. He was buried in the church of Mans, and a noble monument was erected to his memory.
