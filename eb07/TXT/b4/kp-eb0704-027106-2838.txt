BACCHIUS, a follower of Aristoxenus, supposed by Fabricius to have been tutor to the emperor Marcus Antoninus, and consequently to have lived about A. d. 140. He wrote in Greek a very short introduction to music, in the form of dialogue, which Meibomius has published with a Latin translation. The dialogue was first published in the original by Mersennus, in his commentary on the first six chapters of Genesis.
