BARBATELLI, Bernardino, otherwise called Po-clιetti, a painter of history, fruit, animals, and flowers, was born at Florence in 1542. He was the disciple of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio at Florence. His touch was free, light, and delicate, and the colouring of his objects inexpressibly true; and, besides his merit in this style of painting, the historical subjects which he designed from sacred or profane authors were much admired. He died in 1612.
