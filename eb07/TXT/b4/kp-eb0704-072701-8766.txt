BODMIN, a borough-town of the hundred of Trigg, in the county of Cornwall, 234 miles from London. It is one of the county towns; the assizes and quarter-sessions being held here alternately with Launceston. The county jail and house of correction are handsome buildings of modern erection. The little trade in serges has nearly become extinct. The corporation consists of a mayor and eleven burgesses, who return two members to the House of Commons, and are now under the influence of the Marquis of Hertford. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1951, in 1811 to 2050, and in 1821 to 2902. The market is held on Saturday.
