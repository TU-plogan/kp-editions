BECKINGHAM, Charles, an English dramatic writer, was the son of a linen-draper in London, and born in 1699. He was educated under the learned Dr Smith, at Merchant Tailorsâ€™ School, where he made great proficiency in his studies, and gave the strongest proofs of extraordinary abilities. In poetry, more particularly, he early discovered an uncommon genius; and two dramatic pieces of his writing were represented on the stage before he had completed his twentieth year. The titles of these plays, both tragedies, are, Henry IV. of France, and Scipio Africanus. Besides these dramatic pieces he wrote several other poems; but his genius was only allowed a brief space to disport itself in, for he died on the 18th of February 1730, in the thirty-second year of his age.
