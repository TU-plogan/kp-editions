BERGEN, a city in Norway, the capital of the province of the same name. It is situated on the shore of the gulf or bay of Baag, has a fine harbour with two good entrances, and is surrounded by hills, some of which attain the height of 1800 feet. It contains seven churches, four of stone and three of wood, and about 2000 houses, of which all excepting 140 are of wood. From this cause it has suffered often and severely from fire. The inhabitants, amounting to 18,080, are employed, many in the fishery and navigation, and some in various manufactures, all upon a small scale, and chiefly for home consumption. There are about 120 ships belonging to theport, whose chief business consists in conveying timber to the different ports of Europe. Long. 4. 25. 33. E. Lat. 63. 23. 40. N.
