LAPIS, in general, is used to denote a stone of any kind or description.

Lapis, in Roman antiquity, a geographical measure denoting a mile, because miles were distinguished by erecting a stone at the end of each; from the number marked on which, the length of way to or from Rome might be known. This device is ascribed by Plutarch to Caius Gracchus; but it was more accurately executed by Augustus, who erected a gilt pillar in the forum, at which all the public ways of Italy, distinguished by stones, were terminated. The same thing was done in the Roman provinces. Hence the phrases tertius lapis, centesimus lapis, for three or a hundred miles; and sometimes the ordinal number, without lapis, as ad duodecimum, at twelve miles distance.
