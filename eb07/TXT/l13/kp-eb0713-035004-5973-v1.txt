LIMOGES, an arrondissement in the department of the Upper Vienne, in France, 769 square miles in extent. It comprehends nine cantons, divided into eighty-three communes, containing 89,500 inhabitants. The capital of the department, as well as that of the arrondissement, is the city of the same name, situated on the right bank of the river Vienne. It is ill built, with narrow and crooked streets, and very antique buildings. There is a fine Gothic cathedral, the façade of which is much admired. The episcopal palace and the mint are striking edifices. It contains 2570 houses, with 20,500 inhabitants. It is a place of great manufacturing industry, producing cotton twist, thin woollen and some linen goods; china-ware, scarcely excelled by that of Sevres; besides hats, wine, and copper articles. Long. 1. 10. E. Lat. 45. 49. N.
