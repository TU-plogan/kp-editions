LACTIFEROUS, an appellation given to plantsabound-ingwith a milky juice, as the sow-thistle andvarious others. The name of lactiferous, or lactescent, is given to all those plants which abound with a thick, coloured juice, whatever may be its colour. Most lactiferous plants are poisonous, except those with compound flowers, which are generally of an innocent quality. Of the poisonous lactescent plants, the most remarkable are sumach, agaric, maple, burning thorny plant, cassada, celandine, puccoon, prickly poppy, and the plants of the natural order contortae, as swallow-wort,apocynum, cynanchum,and cerbera. The bell-shaped flowers are partly noxious, as cardinal flower; partly innocent, as campanula. Amongst the lactescent plan‘,ş with compound flowers that are innocent in their quality, may be mentioned dandelion, picris, hyoseris i wild lettuce, gum succory, hawkweed, bastard hawkweed, hypochoeris, goat’s beard, and most species of lettuce.
