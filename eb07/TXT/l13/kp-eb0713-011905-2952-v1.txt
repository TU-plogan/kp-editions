LATTALATTA, one of the small islands adjacent to Gilolo, and about twenty-five miles in circumference. It is separated from the island of Jappa by a strait above a mile and a half in length, and in some places not above forty-six yards broad, in others eight miles. There is also a cluster of small islands lying off the west coast of Gilolo, a few minutes to the north of the equinoctial line, and about the 127th degree of east longitude.
