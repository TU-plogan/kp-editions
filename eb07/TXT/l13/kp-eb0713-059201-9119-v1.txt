LUCULLUS, Lucius Licinius, a Roman general celebrated for his eloquence, his victories, and his riches. In his youth he made a figure at the bar; but,being afterwards sent as quaestor into Asia, and praetor into Africa, he governed those provinces with great moderation and justice. Scarcely was he known as a military man, when he twice defeated the fleet of Hamilcar, and gained two great victories over him. His happy genius was greatly improved by study; for he employed his leisure in reading the best authors on military affairs. Being made consul along with Aurelius Cotta, during the third war with Mithridates king of Pontus, he was sent against that prince; and this expedition was attended with a series of victories, which did him less honour than an act of generosity towards his colleague. The latter, willing to take advantage of his absence to signalize himself by some great exploit, hastened to fight Mithridates, but was defeated and shut up in Chalcedonia, where he must have perished, if Lucullus, sacrificing his resentment to the pleasure of saving a Roman citizen, had not flown to his assistance, and disengaged him. All Pontus then submitted to Lucullus, who being continued in his government of Asia, entered the territories of Tigranes, then the most powerful king in Asia. That prince marched with a formidable army against Lucullus, who defeated him with a handful of men, and killed great numbers of his forces; took Tigranocertes, the capital of his kingdom; and was ready to put an end to the war, when the intrigues of a tribune got him deposed, and Pompey nominated in his stead. Lucullus having brought home prodigious riches, now gave himself up to excessive luxury; and his table was served with a profusion and splendour until that time unknown. He brought from the East a great number of books, which he formed into a library, and gave admission to all men of learning, who frequented it in great numbers. Towards the end of his life, he fell into a kind of madness; and Lucullus, his brother, was appointed his guardian. He is said to have been the first who brought cherries into Europe, having imported the grafts from the kingdom of Pontus.
