LOWESTOFF, a town of the county of Suffolk, in the hundred of Mutford with Lothingland, 114 miles from London. It stretches along a cliff two furlongs from the sea-shore. It has a considerable share of the herring, as well as of the mackerel fishery, and is much frequented for sea-bathing in the summer. A canal uniting Norwich with the sea at this place has been recently finished, and promises to add to its prosperity. The church is a fine Gothic building. The market is held on Wednesday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2332, in 1811 to 3189, in 1821 to 3675, and in 1831 to 4394.
