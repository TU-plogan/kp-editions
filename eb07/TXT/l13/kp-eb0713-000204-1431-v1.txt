LABEO, C. Antistius, a celebrated lawyer of the age of Augustus and Tiberius, was son of Antistitis Labeo, who formed one of the cυηspiracy against Caesar, and, after the unsuccessful battle of Philippi, caused himself to be put to death by one of his own slaves. His son seems to have inherited all the independent-principles'of the father, and to have expressed at times hiş opinions respecting the measures of Augustus with such freedom, that it was thought by his friends that he was subject to fits of insanity. (Hor. Sat. i. 3, 82; Suet. Aug. 54.) Some say that he was offered the consulship by Augustus, but that he refused the honour, lest he should be suspected of having sold his independence to the emperor. Others say that he was a candidate for the consulship, and that Augustus caused M. Ateius Capito to be elected in preference to him. (Tacit. Aim. iii. 75.) He had applied himself more particularly to the study of law, and left many works, of which scarcely any thing remains except the title; eight books on Probabilities, of which Julius Paulus made an abridgment; a work in forty-two books, entitled Posteriores, because it appeared after his death. Of these two works fragments are to be found in the pandects of Justinian. The latter is abridged by Jabolenus, who flourished under Trajan. (Gell, xiii. 10.) His other works are, Commentaries on the Twelve Tables, and on the Edicts of the Praetor and Curile Aediles; a Treatise on the Praetor Urbanus and Peregrinus; a Treatise on Pontifical Law, in fifteen books. It is disputed whether some other works mentioned by St Augustin belong to this Labco, or to another of the same name.
