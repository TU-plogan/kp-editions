LAUSATIA, one of the circles into which the present kingdom of Saxony is divided. It touches on the south the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia, and on the north and the east the Prussian provinces of Brandenburg and of Silesia. It is extended over 1650 square miles, comprehends sixteen cities and towns, 458 villages, and. 336,500 inhabitants, of whom one fifth are of the ancient race of Wenden or Vandals, and still retain their primitive language and manners. The northern portion of the circle is mountainous, but the southern division is more level, and is fertile and well cultivated. The chief city is Bautzen.
