LEOMINSTER, a borough and market-town of the hundred of Wolphy, in Herefordshire, situated on the river Wye, 137 miles from London. It has a corporation, consisting of a high steward, bailiff, recorder, and twelve burgesses, and still sends, as before, two members to parliament. The church is a neat and spacious building, adorned with an altar-piece by the celebrated Rubens. The tower of it has a musical peal of eight bells. There was formerly some woollen manufactures, which have disappeared. The chief trade now is in wool and flax, the latter of which grows of excellent quality. The market was formerly held on Thursday, but has been exchanged for Friday by act of parliament. The magistrates of Leominster have an exempt jurisdiction. The population of the borough amounted in 1801 to 3019, in 1811 to 3238, in 1821 to 3651, and in 1831 to 4300; but the whole parish at the last census contained 5249 inhabitants.
