LOANDO, St Paul de, a city on the coast of Angola, capital of the Portuguese settlements in Western Africa. It is built partly upon a hill, which commands the surrounding country, and partly on the sea-shore, and covers a large extent of ground. It has no walls, but possesses a good fort, garrisoned by malefactors. The streets are wide and regular. The houses of the whites are built of stone, and those of the natives of mud and straw. The port is safe and spacious, and is defended from storms by an island lying in front. The city is the seat of a bishop, and possesses numerous churches and convents. The surrounding country is pleasant and fertile, abounding in cattle, corn, and fruits; but water is very scarce, and must be brought some distance. The climate during summer is warm, but regular sea-breezes moderate the heat considerably. The population is estimated at 3000 whites and free people of colour, without determining the number of slaves, one proprietor often having more than 100 in his service. Long. 13. 22. E. Lat. 8. 55. S.

Loando is also the name of an island situated opposite the city, and about twenty miles long and one broad. It is separated from the main coast only by a narrow channel. It produces no grain, but yields good pasture for sheep and goats, and there are some fisheries upon its coast. The wealthier inhabitants of the city have a number of country houses and gardens here for the purposes of recreation; and it also contains several small villages. It yields, by digging to a small depth, the best water in this part of the country, from which the city is principally suppliedl
