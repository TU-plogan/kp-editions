LACCADIVES, an archipelago of low islands lying off the Malabar or western coast of India, between the 8th and 13th degrees of north latitude. There are nineteen considerable ones; but as most of them are surrounded with reefs and steep rocks, with a great depth of water close to them, the approach to them is very dangerous. Between these islands there are many channels, through which ships from India, bound to Persia or Arabia, frequently sail. The safest of these is called Mamale, or the Nine-degree Channel, which runs between the islands of Seuhilipar and Kalpenny. The largest of these islands is [7:13:6] about seven miles in length and two and a half in breadth. Most of them are inhabited by a race of Mahommedans called Moplays. They do not yield grain, but produce an infinite quantity of cocoa nuts, from the husks of which they form the coir cables, which are more elastic and durable than hemp, as the sea-water, instead of rotting, preserves them. These islands are well supplied with fish, and carry on a trade with the small shells called cowries, which pass as coin all over India. They are nominally dependent on Cannanore, but their poverty has been always their chief security. They were discovered by Vasco ċle Gama in 1499, but have since been little frequented by Europeans.
