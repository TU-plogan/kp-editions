LORCA, a city of Spain, in the province of Murcia. It is situated on a small river called the Sangonera, which is frequently dry. The soil is excellent for producing wheat, barley, olives, and fruits, but frequently fails from want of water, an evil which was attempted to be remedied by the construction of dykes in order to retain the streams when ;hey are abundant; but, in 1803, these banks were burst )y an unusual weight of water, the lands below were temporarily inundated, and since then they have at times felt ;he great evil of want of water. The city has nine parish churches, ten monasteries, 21,866 inhabitants, fourteen Saltpetre houses, with a house for preparing soda; and it carries on a great deal of trade through the harbour of lguilas, which is eleven and a half miles distant from it.
