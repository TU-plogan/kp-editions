LIBRA, or Balance, one of the mechanical powers. See Balance. Libra, in Astronomy, one of the twelve signs of the zodiac, exactly opposite to Aries, and so called because when the sun is in this sign at the autumnal equinox, the days and nights are equal, as if weighed in a balance. The stars in this constellation are, according to Ptolemy 17, to Tycho 10, to Hevelius 20, and to Flamsteed 51.

Libra also denotes the ancient Roman pound, borrowed from the Sicilians, who called it litra.

The libra was divided into 12 uncice or ounces, and the ounce into 24 scruples. The divisions of the libra were, the uncia, one twelfth; the sextans, one sixth; the quadrans, one fourth; the triens, one third; the quincunx, five ounces; the semis, six; the septunx, seven; the bes, eight; t Arndodrans, nine; the dextrans, ten; and the deum, eleven; whilst the as weighed twelve ounces or one libra.

The Roman libra was used in France for the proportions of their coin till the time of Charlemagne, or perhaps till that of Philip I. in 1093, their sols being so proportioned that 20 of them were equal to the libra. By degrees it became a term of account; and every thing of the value of twenty sols was called a livre. Libra Pensa, in our law books, denotes a pound of money in weight. It was'usual in former days not only to tell the money, but to weigh it, because many cities, lords, and bishops, having their mints, coined money, and often very bad money too; for which reason, though the pound consisted of twenty shillings, they always w eighed it.
