LARVAE, in Antiquity, derived from the Etruscan word lax or lars, signifying “prince or lord,” denoted the ghosts of the deceased, considered as wicked and mischievous. Hence is formed the term larvatus, that is, larva indutus or demoniac. The ingenious Mr Farmer urges the etymology and use of this term to prove that the heathen demons were human ghosts. The larvae were also called lemures.
