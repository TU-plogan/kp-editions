LAPATHUS, Lapethus, or Lepithus, in Ancient Geography, a town of Cyprus, with a port or station for ships, and a cognominal river. It was built by a colony of Phoenicians, according to Scylax; by Belus king of Tyre, according to Alexander Ephesus. According to Strabo, it was built by a colony of Spartans; and one of the nine kings resided here, the last of whom was Pisistratus, who commanded the naval force of Alexander the Great. There was a temple here dedicated to Venus.
