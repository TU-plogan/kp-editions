LYCIA, a country of Asia Minor, bounded by the Mediterranean on the south, by Caria on the west, by Pamphylia on the east, and by Phrygia on the north. It was anciently called Milyas and Tremile, from the Milyae or Solymi, a people of Crete, who came to settle there. The country received the name of Lycia from Lycus, the son of Pandion, who there established himself. The inhabitants have been greatly commended by all the ancients for their sobriety and justice. They were conquered by Croesus, king of Lydia, and afterwards by Cyrus. Though they were subject to the power of Persia, yet they were governed by their own kings, and only paid a yearly tribute to the Persian monarch. When Alexander marched into the East, they became part of the Macedonian empire, and afterwards were ceded to the house of the Seleucidae. The country was reduced into a Roman province by the Emperor Claudius.
