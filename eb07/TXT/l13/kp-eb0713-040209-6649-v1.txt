LLANDAFF, a small city, but so classed because it is the see of a bishop. It is in the hundred of Kibbon, of the county of Glamorgan, Wales, 162 miles from London, and is situated on the river Taff’. The cathedral is an ancient building, of the architecture of various ages, and of most discordant styles, but containing some admirable monuments. The palace of the bishop may be traced by remains of ancient walls, and the building itself is reported to have been destroyed by the Welsh prince, Owen Glendower. Llandaff, though a city, has no market. It has a small harbour on the north bank of the Severn, two miles from Cardiff. The population amounted in 1801 to 860, in 1811 to 960, in 1821 to 1138, and in 1831 to 1299.
