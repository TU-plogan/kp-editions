LOIRET, a department of France, formed out of a part of the ancient Orleannois. It extends in north latitude from 47. 35. to 48. 22. and in east longitude from 1. 24. to 2, 59., comprehending 2789 ιl square miles, or 675,191 hectares. It is bounded on the north by the departments of the Seine and Oise and the Seine and Marne, on the east by Yonne, on the south by the Nièvre, the Cher, and the Cher and Loire, and on the west by the Eure and Loire. It is divided into four arrondissements, fourteen cantons, and 111 communes, whose population amounts to 134,500 persons. It is, as a whole, a fruitful plain; but, upon the right side of the Loire, it is well covered with profitable forests. The soil is light and sandy, especially in the arrondissement of Montargis, but highly productive, although it scarcely affords a sufficiency ∙of corn for the consumption of the inhabitants. Wine is the most valuable article of cultivation, and both red and white wine of good quality are made, as well as much vinegar and brandy. It is favourably situated for the conveyance of its productions by internal navigation. Much fruit, as well as wood, is conveyed by water to Paris. There are manufactures of cotton and of linen goods, of hosiery, paper, and leather, and some refineries for sugar. The department elects three deputies to the legislative body. The capital is the city of Orleans.
