LENFANT, James, a learned French writer, was born in 1661. After studying at Saumur, he went to Heidelberg, where he received imposition of hands for the ministry in 1684. He discharged the functions of this character with great reputation there, as chaplain of the electress dowager palatine, and pastor in ordinary to the French church. But the descent of the French into the palatinate obliged him to depart from Heidelberg in 1687. He went to Berlin, where the elector Frederick, afterwards king of Prussia, appointed him one of the ministers. He [7:13:229] continued there thirty-nine years, distinguishing himself by his writings. He was preacher to the queen of Prussia, Charlotte" Sophia, and, after her death, to the king of Prussia. In 1707 he took a journey to England and Holland, where he had the honour to preach before Queen Anne, and might have settled in London, with the title of chaplain to her majesty. In 1712 he went to Helmstadt, in 1715 to Leipsig, and in 1725 to Breslau, to search for rare books and manuscripts. It is not certain whether it was he that first formed the design of the Bibliothèque Germanique, which began in 1720; or whether it was suggested ;o him by one of the society of learned men, which took the name of Anonymous, and who ordinarily met at his house. He died in 1728. His principal works are, 1. The History of the Council of Constance, in two vols. 4to; 2. A History of the Council of Pisa, in two vols. 4to; 3. The New Testament, translated from the Greek into the French, with Notes by Beausobre and Lenfant, in two vols. 4to; 4. The History of Pope Joan, from Spanheim’s Latin Dissertation; 5. Several pieces in the Bibliothèque Choisie, La République des Lettres, La Bibliothèque Germanique, and other publications.
