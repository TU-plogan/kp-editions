LIVIUS, Titus, the most celebrated of the Roman historians, was descended from an illustrious family which had given several consuls to Rome. Only a few particulars of his life have been transmitted to us. He was born at Patavium, now Padua, in the north of Italy, B. c. 59, the year before Cicero was driven into banishment; and died, at the advanced age of ninety-six, a. d. 18, the same year as Ovid. He resided during the greater part of his life at Rome; and, if we may credit a statement of Suetonius (in Claud. 41), became the instructor of the Emperor Claudius. His history was written partly at Rome and partly at Naples, and it is said that his reputation was so widely diffused, that a native of Gades, now Cadiz, in Spain, actually visited Rome for no other purpose than to have the pleasure of forming an acquaintance with the historian. (Plin. Ep. fi. 3.) From some inscriptions found at Padua in 1413, it has been asserted that Livy was twice married, had two sons and four daughters; but this must rest merely on conjecture, as there were no doubt many of the same name in Padua. Seneca (Prooem. v. Controu.), indeed, states that one of his daughters was married to L. Magius the rhetorician.

Besides his history, we are acquainted with the titles of three other works of which he was the author; but not a fragment of them has been preserved. These were, Epistola ad Eilium scripta, mentioned by Quintilian (i. 10); Dialogi, which Seneca (Epist. c.) hesitates whether he ought to class amongst historical or philosophical works; and Libri ex professo Philosophiam continentes. The loss, however, of these works, is less a subject of regret than that of the greater part of his Roman History, or, as he himself modestly entitles it, Annals of the Roman people. This work extends from the building of the city to the year 744 (b. c. 9), when Drusus was carrying on war in Germany, and in which he died. Livy undertook this work probably at the suggestion of Augustus, when he was already far advanced in years. It consisted of 142 books, of which only thirty-five remain; and some of these (lib. xli. xliii. xliv. xlv.) are in a very imperfect state. The first ten contain the history of Rome from its foundation to the year of the city 460, the others (xxi.-xlv.) from 536 to 586, or from the beginning of the second Punic war to the end of the wars with Perseus and Gentius. Of the remaining books we possess only short epitomes, which have been supposed, though without any sufficient reason, to have been composed by the writer Florus. It would appear that a complete copy of Livy’s History existed at the beginning of the sixteenth century; but all attempts to discover it have hitherto proved unavailing. Some fragments have indeed been found, and published at Rome, by Niebuhr (1820); but they are few and unimportant. There is, indeed, no loss that has befallen us in Roman literature at all to be compared to that which has left this history imperfect.

Livy follows a chronological arrangement in his history, and, like Dionysius of Halicarnassus, has adopted the Ca-tonian era for his basis. He therefore supposed the city of Rome to have been founded b. c. 751, whereas Varro placed it two years earlier, b. c. 753. The sources from which he derived his information, more particularly for the earlier parts of his history, seem less worthy of belief, though he probably had recourse to the best within his reach. All the more ancient historical records had no doubt disappeared, and he could therefore only be acquainted with their statements through the medium of later annalists. For this early period he had recourse to the [7:13:401]works of no Greek historian, unless we include amongst them that of L. Cincius Alimentas, who, though a Roman, wrote in the Greek language. This author served in the second Punic war, and he is called by Livy (vii. 3) a most diligent investigator of ancient monuments. In the early part of the war he fell into the hands of Hannibal, and from him he received an account of his passage through Gaul and across the Alps, which he incorporated in his history. To the works of this writer Livy acknowledges himself much indebted. As to the sources from which he drew his materials for the second decade (xi.-xx.), which is lost, all that can be said is only matter of conjecture; but we know that Polybius was the principal writer whom he consulted, and that he followed that writer generally both in the arrangement of his materials and in the development of the story. It is not a sufficient answer to this that Livy seldom alludes to Polybius as his authority, since he does not think it necessary to cite the writer upon whom he depends for his information, unless on occasions where there is a difference of opinion. There is no doubt, that wherever he has adopted the statements of Polybius, we may place perfect confidence in the account; and yet, where they differ, we must not condemn Livy, who evidently consulted Roman authorities of undoubted credibility, and who may, upon due examination, have come to the conclusion that Polybius was mistaken. The difference in the accounts given by the two historians of Hannibal’s passage across the Alps is an example of this, though the balance of probability is greatly in favour of that of Polybius.

Livy has been accused of a wilful perversion of the truth, of an undue partiality for his own country, and a desire to recommend himself to the favour of the nobility, by flattering their pride by the manner in which he records the deeds of their ancestors. But if he represents the characters of his countrymen in a different light from other writers, might he not suppose himself better able to appreciate their conduct? and if his love of country led him to conceal whatever might be prejudicial to them in the eyes of posterity, it was a fault for which he may be forgiven, though it certainly must be allowed to detract considerably from the value of his work. He has been accused also of superstition, because he has reported faithfully all the prodigies and omens in which those early ages abounded, and which seemed to have formed the principal part of their religion; but he has several times observed, that he narrates those wonderful events because he found them in the ancient annalists whom he consulted, without meaning to vouch for their accuracy. Livy was evidently gifted by nature with a brilliant talent for narration, and for seizing the characteristic features of humanity. He was a poet, though without the power or perhaps the love of versifying. His rhetorical powers, too, were of the highest order; and, in the palmy state of the republic, he would have ranked amongst the first orators of his age. The periods of Livy are full and well rounded, in imitation of the style of Cicero; and indeed the age in which he lived would have tolerated no other mode of writing. It is strange that there should be any difficulty in discovering the political sentiments of the historian; but he felt that he was writing under the eye of a despot, however amiable, and he thought himself obliged to suppress many sentiments to which he would in other circumstances have given utterance. He was fully sensible of the degeneracy of his own days, and was glad to forget it by reviving the recollection of all that was glorious and noble in the past. He might also imagine that he could excite in the breasts of his countrymen a desire to emulate the heroic deeds of their ancestors, and might thus be the means of restoring the constitution of his country to its ancient form and strength. It is said that Augustus accused him of being too favourable to the party of Pompey (Tacit. Ann. iv. 34); and we may therefore conclude that he was in his heart a partisan of the republic. It has been much disputed what Asinius Pollio [Quintil. viii. 1) meant by the accusation he brought against Livy of Patavinity [Patavinitas) ; but it seems the most likely conjecture that it was some provincialism in the language and style, perceptible to the refined ear of a Roman critic, though we can no longer discern it.

Livy’s History was first printed at Rome, about the year 1469, by Sweynheym and Pannartz, in folio. Of this rare edition Lord Spencer is in possession of a fine copy; but the most exquisite one is that printed on vellum, which formerly belonged to the Imperial Library at Vienna, but was afterwards acquired by a private collector in England. Amongst the subsequent editions of the history may be mentioned that of Gronovius, “cum notis variorum et suis,” Leyden, 1679, in three vols. 8vo; that of Leclerc, Amsterdam, 1709, in,ten vols. 12mo; that of Crevier, Paris, 17 35, in six vols. 4to; that of Drakenborch, Amsterdam, 1738, in seven vols. 4to, reprinted at Stuttgardt, 1820- 1827, in fifteen vols. 8vo; that of Ruddiman, Edinburgh, 1751, in four vols. 12mo; that of Homer, London, 1794, in eight vols. 8vo; that of Oxford, 1800, in six vols. 8vo; and that of Ruperti, Göttingen, 1807, in six vols. 8vo. The edition of the first five books of Livy, by Dr John Hunter of St Andrews, Cupar Fife, 1822, is remarkable for its great accuracy, and is accompanied with English notes, in which are treated some of the most refined principles of philology. (See Lachmann, F. De Pontibus Historiarum Livii, Comment. 4to, Gotting. 1822-1828. Maierotto, J. H. L. De Candore Livii, fol. Berlin, 1796; De Testimoniorum Livii fide, 1797; De Livii Arte Narrandi et Artificio Historico 1798.)

Livius Andronicus, a comicpoetwho flourished at Rom e about 240 years before the Christian era. He was the first who turned the personal satires and Fescennine verses, so long the admiration of the Romans, into the form of a proper dialogue and regular play. Though the character of a player, so valued and applauded in Greece, was reckoned vile and despicable amongst the Romans, Andronicus acted a part in his dramatical compositions, and engaged the attention of his audience by repeating what he had worked up after the manner of the Greeks. Andronicus was the freedman of Μ. Livius Salinator, whose children he educated. His poetry had grown obsolete in the age of Cicero, whose nicety and judgment would not even recommend the reading of it.
