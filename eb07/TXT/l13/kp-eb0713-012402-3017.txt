LAUNCESTON, a borough town of the hundred of East, in the county of Cornwall, 213 miles from London. It is pleasantly situated on a gentle elevation overlooking the river Tamer. It has good markets, which are held on Wednesday and Saturday. It is one of the county towns, in which the assizes are held in the spring, as they are at Bodmin in the summer. The corporation consists of a [7:13:125]mayor, a recorder, and twelve aidermen. The population amounted in 1801 to 1483, in 1811 to 1758, in 1821 to 2183, and in 1831 to 2231. It formerly returned two members to the House of Commons, but by the reform act elects now only one.
