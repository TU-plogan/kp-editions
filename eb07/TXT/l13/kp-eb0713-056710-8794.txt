LORETTO, a city of the delegation of Macerata, in the papal dominions, in Italy. It is situated at the spot where the river Musone falls into the sea. It is surrounded with wallsand ditches, has a cathedral, and several other churches, and contains about 8000 inhabitants. It is remarkable for the Santa Casa, or sacred house, which is affirmed to have been miraculously brought to this place in 1294, and over which a large church has been constructed in order to preserve it. It is an object of veneration with many Catholics, and is visited by great numbers of pilgrims. The subsistence of the people mainly depends on this object, and in making rosaries, crucifixes, medallions, and other articles for the gratification of pious visitors. Its wealth was dissipated during the French revolution, but it has since accumulated treasures, though not with the rapidity of former times. Long. 13. 29. 45. E. Lat. 43. 27. N.
