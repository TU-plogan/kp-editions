LOGOGRAPHY, a method of printing, in which the types, instead of answering only to single letters, are made to correspond to entire words. In the year 1783, there appeared a treatise upon this subject by Henry Johnson, in which the origin as well as the utility of the method are largely discussed. Mr Johnson informs us, that about five years before, that is, in the year 1778, intending to publish a daily list of blanks and prizes in the lottery, numerically arranged, he found that it could not be accomplished in time by the ordinary method of printing. On this account he procured types of two, three, or more figures, as was necessary for this purpose; and thus any entire number might as readily be taken up as if it had been a single type. His next attempt was in forming some large mercantile tables of ι pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings. For these he procured types expressive of any sum of money ready composed and united; “by which every species of figure-printing could be performed for the tenth part of the cost, printers always charging it double the price of letter-printing.” Having thus succeeded to his wish in his two first attempts, he next began to consider if the method could not be applied to words; and in this also the success, he says, was equal. The properties of the logographic art, according to its author, are, 1rf, that the compositor shall have less charged upon his memory than in the common way; 2<7, that it is much less liable to error; 3g?, that the type of each word is as easily laid hold of as that of a single letter; 4/Ä, that the decomposition is much more readily performed, even by the merest novices, than the distribution of letters; 5zZ¢, that no extraordinary expense, nor greater number of types, is required in the logographic than in the common method of printing. But, for fuller details, we must refer to the work above mentioned.
