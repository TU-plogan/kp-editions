LEGATUS, a military officer amongst the Romans, who acted as deputy of the commander-in-chief. The legati, at their first institution, were appointed not so much to command as to advise; and they were generally chosen by the consuls, with the approbation of the senate. As to [7:13:165]the number of the legati we have no certain information, though we may upon good grounds assign one to every legion. In the absence of the consul or proconsul, they had the honour of the fasces. Under the emperors there were two sorts of legati, consulares and praetorii. The former commanded whole armies, as the emperorâ€™s lieutenants-general; the latter had the command of particular legions. The legati under the proconsuls in the provinces served for judging inferior causes, managing smaller concerns, and remitting things of great moment to the governor or president himself. This, as above hinted, was originally the duty of the legati, though, as we have also seen, they were afterwards admitted to command in the army.
