LANGBAINE, Dr Gerard, a learned English writer, was born in 1608. He was educated at Queen’s College, Oxford, and became keeper of the archives of that university, and provost of his college. He was highly esteemed by Usher, Selden, and other learned men; and he died in 1657. He published an edition of Longinus, in Greek and Latin, with notes; and other works.

Langbaine, Gerard, the son of the former, was born in 1656. He was put as apprentice to Mr Symonds, bookseller in St Paul’s Churchyard; but was soon afterwards called thence by his mother, upon the death of his eldest brother, and by her entered as a gentleman commoner of University College, Oxford, in 1672. Here he squandered a good part of his estate; but afterwards corrected his manner of living, and for some years lived in retirement near Oxford. During this time he improved his taste for dramatic poetry; and at first wrote some small pieces without his name, but afterwards published several works which he publicly owned. In 1690 he was elected infe rior beadle of arts in the university of Oxford; and, in January following, was chosen superior beadle of law; but he died in 1692. He wrote, 1. The Hunter, a Discourse on Horsemanship; 2. A new Catalogue of English Plays, with their best editions, and divers remarks on the originals of most plays, and on the plagiarisms of several authors; 3. An ∕∖ccount of the English Dramatic Poets.
