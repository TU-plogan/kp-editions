LARGE, a nautical term applied to the wind when it crosses the line of a shipâ€™s course in a favourable direction, particularly on the beam or quarter. Thus, if a ship steers west, then the wind in any point of the compass to the eastward of the south or north may be called large, unless when it is directly east, and then it is said to be right aft. Sailing large is, therefore, advancing with a large wind, so as that the sheets are slackened and flowing, and the bowlines entirely disused. This phrase is generally opposed to sailing close-hauled.
