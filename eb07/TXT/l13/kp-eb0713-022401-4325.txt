LEIXLIP, a post and fair town of Ireland, pleasantly situated in the county of Kildare and province of Leinster, about eight miles from Dublin. Near it are the ruins of the church and castle of Confy. The castle of Leixlip is beautifully situated on the banks of the river Liffey. It is a fine edifice, with large and pleasant gardens, at one side of which is a fine waterfall called the Salmon leap, there being plenty of that species of fish hereabouts. A mile from this is Castletown, the magnificent seat of Mr Conolly.
