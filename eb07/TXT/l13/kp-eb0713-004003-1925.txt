LAMJUNGH, an extensive district in Northern Hindustan, tributary to the Ghoorkbali rajah of Nepaul. It has the great Himalaya ridge for ics northern boundary; and, like the rest of Northern Hindustan, it has an elevated and rugged surface, with intervening fertile valleys, watered by streams from the northern mountains. The district has been imperfectly explored. The principal towns are MucundnatÄ¥ and Lantargur.

LAMMAS-Day, the first of August, so called, as some will have it, because lambs then grow out of season by becoming too large. Others derive it from a Saxon word, signifying loaf-mass, because on that day our forefathers made an offering of bread prepared from new wheat.
