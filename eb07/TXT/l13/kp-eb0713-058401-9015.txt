LUCANAS, a province of Peru, in South America, bounded on the north by the province of Castro Vireina, on the cast by Parina Cochas, and on the south and west by Camana. It is 180 miles in length, and varies from thirty-six to ninety in breadth. It is situated amongst the craggy rocks of the Cordilleras; and the temperature is very cold, but the soil is fertile. The chief grains cultivated are wheat, barley, and maize; and in the valleys fruits are grown with considerable success. It has some silver mines, which are supposed to be the richest in Peru, and to which the province owes its chief importance. Its capital is a small place of the same name, situated in latitude 14. 58. south.
