LAESTRYGONES, the most ancient inhabitants of Sicily. Some suppose them to be the same as the people of Leontium, and to have been neighbours to the Cyclops. They fed on human flesh; and when Ulysses landed on their coasts, they sunk his ships and devoured his companions. According to Homerâ€™s description, they were of a gigantic stature. A colony of them is supposed to have passed over into Italy with Lamus at their head, where they built the town of Formiae; and hence the epithet of Laestrygonia is often used for that of Formiana.
