LINUS, in classical history, a native of Colchis, who was contemporary with Orpheus, and one of the most ancient poets and musicians of Greece. It is impossible, at this distance of time, to discover whether Linus was the disciple of Orpheus, or Orpheus of Linus. The majority, however, seem to decide this question in favour of Linus. According to Archbishop Usher, he flourished about 1280 B. c. and is mentioned by Eusebius amongst the poets who wrote before the time of Moses. Diodorus Siculus tells us, on the authority of Dionysius of Mitylene the historian, who was contemporary with Cicero, that Linus was the first amongst the Greeks who invented verses and music, as Cadmus first taught them the use of letters. The same writer likewise attributes to him an account of the exploits of the first Bacchus, and a treatise upon Greek mythology, written in Pelasgic characters, which were also those used by Orpheus, and by Pronapides the preceptor of Homer. Diodorus says that he added the string called liclianos to the Mercurian lyre, and ascribes to him the invention of rhythm and melody, which Suidas, who regards him as the most ancient of lyric poets, confirms. Marpurg conceives that Linus invented catgut strings for the use of the lyre, which, before his time, was only strung with thongs of leather, or with different threads of wax strung together. He is said by many writers to have had several disciples of great renown; amongst whom were Hercules, Thamyris, and, according to some, Orpheus. Hercules, says Diodorus, in learning from Linus to play upon the lyre, being extremely dull and obstinate, provoked his master to strike him; which so enraged the young hero, that instantly seizing the lyre, he beat out the brains of the musician with his own instrument.
