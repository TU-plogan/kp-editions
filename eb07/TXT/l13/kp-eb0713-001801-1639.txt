LAHDACK, a mountainous district and independent Tartar kingdom in Northern Hindustan, situated to the north of the great Himalaya ridge of mountains, principally between the thirty-fourth and thirty-seventh degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north and east by Thibet, on the w est by Cashmere, and on the south by the Nahry Sangkar province. These limits are not, however, precisely defined. This country imports from Thibet fine goatsâ€™ hair or shawl wool, which is re-exported to Cashmere, and there manufactured into shawls; and its exports consist chiefly of fruit. The inhabitants are supposed to be worshippers of the Delai Lama. This country, since the British conquests, has been extended to the Himalaya Mountains, and has been penetrated by British functionaries, amongst others by Mr Williams; and from his information, and the drawings which he exhibited, the inhabitants seemed to Bishop Heber to resemble the Kalmucks in dress, countenance, and religion. Their written character is, however, different from the Mongolian. They carry on a pretty regular intercourse with Russia; and it is singular that sheets of gilt leather, stamped with the imperial eagle, were amongst the presents which the king of Lahdack sent when he offered his allegiance to the British government. The capital is of the same name; it is the mart of all the trade that is carried on in the country, and is the rendezvous of the merchants who travel from Hindustan to Yarkand in Chinese Tartary, whence they proceed in a body the greater part of the way along the banks of the Indus. The position of this place is extremely uncertain. According to the best maps, it is placed in long. 78. 3. east, latitude 35.35. north, two hundred miles northeast from the city of Cashmere. These Tartars have showed themselves very friendly to the British; and their Khan, as is stated by Bishop Heber, sent a formal offer of his allegiance to the British government, which was declined. At a point above the town of Drans, in Little Thibet, the main stream of the Indus is met by a smaller river, which has been traced from Rodauk in Thibet, and flowing past Lahdack, the capital of Little Thibet, is then named the Lahdack River. Near to Lahdack it is joined by another stream from the north-west, which Lieutenant Macartney conjectures to issue from the Lake of Surikol. It was formerly thought that this river was one of the principal branches of the Ganges, but it is now ascertained to be a tributary of the Indus.
