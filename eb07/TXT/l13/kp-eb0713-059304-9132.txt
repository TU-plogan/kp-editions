LUFF, the order from the pilot to the steersman to put helm towards the lee-side of the ship, in order to make the ship sail nearer the direction of the wind. Hence, luff round, or luff a-lee, is the excess of this movement, by which it is intended to throw the shipâ€™s head up in the wind in order to tack her. A ship is also said to spring her luff when she yields to the effort of the helm, by sailing nearer to the line of the wind than she had done before.

Luff Tackle, a name given by sailors to any large tackle that is not destined for a particular place, but may be variously employed as occasion requires. It is generally somewhat larger than the jigger tackle, although smaller than those which serve to hoist the heavier materials into and out of the vessel, which latter are the main and fore tackles, the stay and quarter tackles, and so forth.
