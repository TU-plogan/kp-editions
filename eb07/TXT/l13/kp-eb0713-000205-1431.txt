LABERIUS, Decimus, a Roman knight, who was particularly distinguished as a writer of mimi, that is, farces in the language of the common people, and for their amusement. The exact period of his birth is unknown, but he died B. c. 43, a few months after the murder of Caesar. Having caused some annoyance to the dictator by the freedom of his language, he was ordered by him to appear on the stage as an actor in one of his own plays, when he had reached the age of sixty. The prologue which he pronounced on this occasion is preserved by Macrobius {Set. ii. 7), and is so beautiful that it makes us regret that more of his writings have not come down to us. When he had finished, he proceeded towards the places assigned to the knights; but his appearance on the stage had deprived him of all the privileges enjoyed by that order, and no one was willing to make way for him. Cicero, observing his embarrassment, said, in allusion to the number of new senators admitted by Caesar, “Recepissem to nisi anguste sederem ;” upon which Laberius sarcastically replied, “Mirum si anguste sedes qui soles duabus sellis sedere,” thereby reproaching Cicero with his versatility of conduct. We have the titles of forty of his pieces (see Fabricius, BibUoth. Lat. i. p. 477), but only a few fragments of them have been preserved. They have been published by Stephanus, Paris, 1564; and are also found in the Catalecta veterum Poetarum by Scaliger, and in the Epigrammata vetera, Lyons, 1596.
