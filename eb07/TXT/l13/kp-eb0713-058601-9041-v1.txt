LUCCA, a dukedom in Italy, extending in north latitude from 43. 46. to 44. 14., and in east longitude from 10. 3. to 10. 44. It has enclosed within it a small portion of Tuscany, and has the communes of Menuciano, Albiano, and Renzano separated from it, between the territories of Modena and Tuscany. It comprehends 440 square miles, with one city and 290 towns and villages, which are inhabited by 150,000 persons, being the most dense population of any state in Europe. It is bounded on the north by Modena and Tuscany, on the east and the south by Tuscany, and on the west by the Mediterranean Sea. The Apennines form the northern part of the duchy, and extend from Monte Guiliano to the sea, gradually declining in height as they proceed to the westward. The other parts are level, and of high fertility. The river Serchio is the only considerable stream, and, by the numerous canals connected with it and employed in irrigation, is one of the chièf causes of the great power of production which the soil displays. The agriculture of Lucca is most admirably conducted. The plains and valleys appear like gardens, in which corn and pulse fields are intermingled with olive plantations and fruit trees. The hedges are filled with elm, mulberry, and other trees, around which the vines are to be seen clustering in elegant festoons. Along the shore are rich meadows, on which numerous homed cattle are fed, whilst near them other fields exhibit most abundant crops of rice. Even the mountains almost to the summits are covered with vines, or with olive, chestnut, and mulberry trees; and the Apennines themselves produce chestnuts, as well as the finest pines and larches. Notwithstanding the application of all the labour to agriculture, the duchy does not produce corn equal to the consumption, but receives it from the other states in exchange for the oil and silk, which is abundantly obtained. As the kind of agriculture practised engages all the labour, scarcely any of it is directed towards manufactures; and even the silk, except that used for internal purposes, is not organized, but is exported in the raw state. The executive government of Lucca was conferred, by the congress of Vienna, on the Empress Maria Louisa, the wife of Napoleon. The power of making laws is intrusted to a senate of thirty-six members, who meet for a month every year. The revenue of the duchy is from L.60,000 to L.70,000 annually, of which the civil list of the regent is L. 12,000. The military force is composed of from 1000 to 1200 men. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on the canal of Ozzorti, which joins the river Serchio. It is walled, and contains the palace of the regent, an old Gothic cathedral, a university, and some other institutions for education, three hospitals, and 17,450 inhabitants. There are some respectable manufacturers of woollen cloths and casimeres. The environs are adorned by many villas, and are cultivated with the minute attention which is usually paid to gardening. Long. 10. 12. E. Lat. 43. 49. N.
