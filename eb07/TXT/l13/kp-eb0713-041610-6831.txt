LODI, a delegation or province within the government of Milan, in the Austrian kingdom of Venetian Lombardy. It is surrounded by the other Austrian provinces of Bergamo, Cremona, Pavia, and Milan. It extends over 709 square miles, and comprehends two cities, eight markettowns, 189 villages, with 27,726 houses, and 195,485 inhabitants. It is well watered by various streams, some running to the Po, and others to the Adda; and the whole is fertile. The district around the city comprehends some of the richest lands of the Austro-Italian dominions. It is chiefly a rich pasture, upon which the largest herds of cows are fed. The dairies are managed with much skill and attention, and yield the greater part of that rich cheese known in most parts of Europe by the name Parmesan, but which in Italy is commonly described by the name of this city, as Frornaggio Lodisana. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on the river Adda, over which is a bridge that was the scene of one of the most daring and successful events of the early years of Bonaparteâ€™s military career. It is an old, extensive city, the see of a bishop, and of the provincial courts of law. It contains a cathedral and nineteen other churches, and 1412 houses, with 17,812 inhabitants. There is a fine theatre, a royal college, and an institution of a collegiate kind for the education of females. The chief employment consists in spinning and weaving silk, and there are also some manufactures of earthenware and china. Long. 9. 25. 32. E. Lat. 45. 18. 31. N.
