LIMIT, in a restricted sense, is used by mathematicians for a determined quantity to which a variable one continually approaches; in which sense, the circle may be said to be the limit of its circumscribed and inscribed polygons. In Algebra, the term limit is applied to two quantities, one of which is greater and the other less than another quantity; and in this sense it is used in speaking of the limits of equations, by which their solution is much facilitated.
