LOUTH, a maritime county in the province of Leinster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the county of Down and the bay of Carlingford, on the east by the Irish Sea, on the south by the county of Meath, and on the west by the counties of Meath and Monaghan. It is the smallest county of Ireland, comprising only 200,484 acres, of which 185,568 are capable of cultivation, and 14,916 are bog or unprofitable mountain.

In the time of Ptolemy it formed part of the maritime district inhabited by the Voluntii. Afterwards it was known by the name of Argiall, Orgiall, or Uriell, which also comprehended the greater part of the counties of Meath, Monaghan, r and Armagh. Its leading families of Irish extraction were the O’Carrols and the M‘Scanlans∙ It was conquered by the English under De Courcy in his progress northwards to Ulster, and formed one of the twelve counties into which King John divided that part of Ireland which acknowledged his authority. It is now divided into the five baronies of Ardee, Upper and Lower Dundalk, Ferrard, and Louth, which are subdivided into sixty-one parishes, all in the archdiocese of Armagh, and two parts of parishes in the diocese of Clogher.

The southern part of the county is flat, diversified by gentle undulations of the surface. Proceeding northwards it becomes more hilly, until, at its most northern extremity, it rises into the mountains of Ravensdale and Carlingford, of considerable elevation. The rivers are the Dee, the Clyde, the Fane, and the Castletown. None of them are navigable, being useful solely for irrigation, and other purposes of rural economy. The Boyne forms part of the southern boundary of the county. It is navigable for large vessels as far as Drogheda. The county has a considerable line of sea-coast, consisting chiefly of a sandy strand, except where it is broken by the projection of Clogher Head, a bold promontory, on which is a fishing town of the same name. The bay of Dundalk extends beyond this point for seven miles at its mouth, indenting the coast for an equal distance inland. It*is considered as peculiarly dangerous for shipping. The Carlingford Mountains, which bound the northern extremity of the county, separate it from the bay that takes its name from them. This latter bay, which forms the line of demarcation both between the counties of Louth and Down and the provinces of Leinster and Ulster, is deep and narrow, extending in length upwards of nine miles, with an average breadth of a [7:13:575]mile and a half. It is navigable nearly to the town of Newry, and its shores on both sides are much admired for their bold and picturesque scenery. An oyster, in high estimation amongst gastronomes Jbr the peculiar delicacy of its flavour, is found in this bay.

The soil in the southern lowlands is well adapted for tillage, being composed of a rich vegetable mould resting on marl or on limestone, sometimes with a substratum of l slate. The quality of the soil diminishes in agricultural value as the land rises towards the north, and the summits of the mountainous district produce only heath and scanty herbage.

The mountains are composed chiefly of granite. On their borders hornblende and primitive greenstone are bund in abundance, after which are exterior ranges of transition rock. The lower lands are of the clay-slate for-nation. The line of separation between the granite and the ⅛y-slate extends from Carlingford Bay, over the summit .>f the Ravensdale Mountains, into the county of Armagh. ?loetz limestone appears in the neighbourhood of Drog-ιeda and Ardee. A lead mine was worked for a short Period at Salterstown, near the sea-coast. There is a mineral spring at Ballymascanlan.

The returns of the population, taken at different periods, •»resent the following results :—
[table]

According to the last of these returns, the ratio of po-ulation to the total number of acres in the county is as 1; 1∙85, and to the number of acres capable of profitable ultivation as 1 to 1∙69.

The county, though the smallest in Ireland, sent no fewer than twelve representatives to the Irish parliament, "wo were returned for the county, two for the town of '⅛rogheda, and two for each of the boroughs of Dundalk, ιrdee, Carlingford, and Dunleer. But the act of union feduced this number to four, two for the county, one for Drogheda, and one for Dundalk; and this arrangement 8)∏tinues under the reform act.

The number of freeholders entitled to vote at elections f representatives for the county in parliament, at three reriods, 1st, previously to the disqualification of the forty-milling freeholders, 2d, subsequently to their disqualification, and, 3c?, under the reform act, is as follows :—

Under the provisions of the act passed in 1836, the con- ∣abulary is to [be placed under a sub-inspector, under ∣∣hom there are to be five chief constables, ten head con-Ĭables, and eighty constables and sub-constables. The ιmber of the constabulary previously to this new ar-ngement was four chief constables and eighty sub-con-tables, which were maintained at an annual expense of Il3578, being at an average of L.43 nearly.

The state of education, according to the returns made to ∣μ∙liament in 1821 and 1824-26, is as follows:—
[table]

Of the number stated in the latter of these returns, Í81 were of the Established Church, 5664 were Roman tholics, and ninety-five Dissenters; the religious per-ιsion of thirty-six was not ascertained. The total num- ∣r of schools was 169, of which twenty-one, affording <iucation to 1358 children, were supported by grants of public money; twenty, affording education to 1106, were supported by the voluntary contributions of societies or individuals; and the remaining 128, in which 4512 children received instruction, were supported wholly by the fees of the pupils. There is an endowed classical school at Dundalk, on the endowment of Erasmus Smith.

The lands capable of cultivation are mostly kept in tillage. Potatoes, wheat, oats, and barley, raised according to the succession here stated, form the principal crops. In the northern districts, oats are chiefly raised. The systems generally adopted are those of the most approved kind, as are also the implements employed. From the attention paid to introduce the best breeds of cattle of every denomination, the different species cannot now be easily distinguished. Sheep are most abundant in the hilly districts. Many parts of the county are well planted; the neighbourhood of Collon particularly exhibits a fine specimen of the attention paid by its proprietor to this mode of improving and embellishing the country. The ash-tree grows in the lower grounds to a great size. The coasts furnish a constant supply of fish; and the flat shores abound with sea-fowl, especially barnacle, which, however, is not so highly esteemed for flavour as that of Wexford or Derry. The manufacture of coarse linens is carried on to a considerable extent, and latterly the cotton manufacture has gained ground.

The appearance of the dwellings of the peasantry in the smaller towns and villages indicates a considerable degree of comfort. In the hilly and more remote districts it deteriorates considerably. In their manners, food, and clothing, they differ in no respect from those of the neighbouring portions of Leinster and Ulster. Fuel is scarce, except in the vicinity of the sea-ports, into which English and Scotch coal is imported.

Few counties can boast of so many remains of antiquity. There are two round towers, one at Monasterboice, 110 feet in height, and in a state of excellent preservation; the other at Dromiskin, much decayed. At the former of these places there are also the remains of two chapels, and of two finely-sculptured crosses, one of them eighteen feet high. Near the banks of a stream called the river of Bal-richan, is a large artificial cave, accidentally discovered by the sinking in of a horse whilst ploughing. It consists of several narrow passages, the sides and top of which are formed of flag-stones. Some bones of large and small animals were found in it. About two miles from Dundalk are the ruins of a very ancient structure, which has some resemblance to the hull of an ancient galley. There are no traces of doors, windows, or loop-holes. The building has given rise to much antiquarian discussion. At Ballymascanlan is a cromleach called the Giant’s Load. It consists of a rock twelve feet long and six broad, elevated on three upright stones. Near it is Castle Rath, surrounded by moats and lesser raths, and with a remarkable tumulus in its vicinity. The great mound of Castleguard, near Ardee, is ninety feet in height, and 600 feet in circumference at its base. Its summit terminates in an area 140 feet round. It is well planted, and surrounded by a deep trench. At Faughart are the remains of an ancient intrenchment. The decisive battle which terminated in the defeat and death of Edward Bruce, by Sir John Bermingham, afterwards Lord a Louth, was fought near this place. The remains of castles are numerous. That of Carlingford, built by King John, occupies a commanding position on a rock projecting into the bay. Castletown stands within sight of the town of Dundalk. Terfeckan Castle, once the residence of the learned Archbishop Usher, is now utterly in ruins. The county is equally remarkable for the number of its ancient monastic edifices. Mellifont, a Cistertian abbey, five miles west of Drogheda, presents some remains equally remarkable for their beauty and singularity of architecture[7:13:576]. Others are to be traced at Carlingford, Faughart, and Monasterboice.

The principal modern seats are, Collon, the residence of Lord Oriell; Barmeath, belonging to the Bellew family; Rokeby Hall, the mansion of the Count de Salis; Louth Hall, that of Lord Louth; Ravensdale Park; and Clermont.

Dundalk, the county-town, a place of great antiquity, is situated at the mouth of the Castletown River. It consists of one long street, intersected by some cross passages. Its most remarkable building is the court-house, the front of which, modelled from the temple of Theseus at Athens, is considered as the finest specimen of pure Grecian architecture in Ireland. The other public buildings are, the parish church, two Roman Catholic chapels, a large barrack, a gaol, assembly and news rooms, a linen-hall, a charter school, and an infirmary. Dundalk is a great mart for the export of grain. The harbour is commodious but shallow. The cambric manufacture is carried on to some extent. Its population, in 1831, amounted to 10,078 souls. The other towns containing a population of upwards of one thousand souls are, Ardee 3975, Carlingford 1319, Collon 1153.

Louth, a market-town of the county of Lincoln, in the hundred of Louth Eske, in Lindsay division. It is T44 miles from London, being situated on the river Lud, from which a canal has been constructed, communicating with the sea, about seven miles distant. It has a considerable coasting trade, and good markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays. It is governed by a corporate body, composed of a warden and six assistants. The population amounted in 1801 to 4236, in 1811 to 4728, in 1821 to 6012, and in 1831 to 6927.
