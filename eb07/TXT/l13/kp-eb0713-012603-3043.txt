LAURO, Philippo, a celebrated painter, was born at Rome in 1623. He learned the first rudiments of the art from his father Balthasar, who was himself a good painter; but he afterwards studied under Angelo Carosello, his brother-in-law, and proved so great a proficient, that in a short time he far surpassed his tutors in design, colouring, and elegance of taste. He applied himself to painting historical subjects in a small size, enriching the backgrounds with lively landscapes, that afforded the eye and the judgment equal gratification; but though his small paintings are most approved, he finished several grand compositions for altar-pieces which were highly esteemed. He died in 1694; and his works are eagerly bought up at high prices all over Europe.
