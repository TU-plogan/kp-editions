LIST, in commerce, the border of cloths or stuffs, serving not only to show their quality, but to preserve them from being torn in the operations of fulling, dyeing, &c. List is used on various occasions, but chiefly by gardeners for securing their wall trees.

List is also used to signify the enclosed field or ground wherein the ancient knights held their jousts and combats. It was so called, as being hemmed round with pales, barriers, or stakes, as with a list. Some of these were double, one for each cavalier, which kept them apart, so that they could not come nearer each other than within a spear’s length.

Civil List, in the British polity. The expenses defrayed by the civil list are those which in any shape relate to civil government, as the expenses of the household; all salaries to officers of state, to the judges, and every one of the king’s servants; the king’s private expenses, or privy purse; and other very numerous outgoings. The civil list is indeed properly the whole of the king’s revenue in bis own distinct capacity; the rest being rather the revenue of the public or its creditors, though collected and distributed again in the name and by the officers of the crown. It now stands in the same place as the hereditary income did formerly; and as that has gradually diminished, the parliamentary appointments have increased. See England.
