LAMECH, of the race of Cain, was the son of Methu-sael, and father of Jabal, Jubal, Tubal-Cain, and Naamah s Lamech is celebrated in Scripture for his polygamy. One day he said to his wives, “Hear me, ye wives of Lamech; I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven fold.” These words contain an unintelligible riddle. The reader may consult the commentators. There is a tradition amongst the Hebrews, that Lamech, growing blind, ignorantly killed Cain, believing him to be some wild beast; and that afterwards he slew his own son Tubal-Cain, who had been the cause of this murder, because he had directed him to shoot at a certain place in the thickets where he had seen something stir. Several other suppositions are produced to explain this passage concerning Lamech, but all seem equally uncertain and absurd.

Lamech, the father of Noah. He lived an hundred fourscore and two years before the birth of Noah (Gen. v. 25, 31); and after that he lived five hundred and ninety-five years longer.
