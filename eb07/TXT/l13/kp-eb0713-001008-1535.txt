LADRONES, or Mariana Islands, a cluster of small islands in the North Pacific Ocean, off the southern extremity of China, and stretching 450 miles from north to south. These islands are fourteen, or, according to others, sixteen in number; namely, Guam or St John, the largest, Zarpane or Rota, Aguignan or St Ann, Tinian, Saypan or St Joseph, Anatachan or St Joachim, Sarigan or St Charles, Guguam or St Philip, Amalagan or Conception Isle, Pagon or St Ignatius, Agrigan or St Xavier, Assonsong or Assumption Island, and Urac, a desert isle. With the adjacent islands, the Ladrones are so near to the continent that they appear like disjointed fragments from the mainland. The islands to the eastward of the great Ladrone are high and uneven, and the depth of water amongst them is about twenty fathoms. Those to the westward are of a more even surface, and appear like a continued land, and the water amongst them is shoaler. These islands have a very barren and unpromising aspect, having scattered patches of verdure in particular spots, but their general appearance being little better than naked rocks, with scarcely a tree or shrub visible. These islands have been celebrated by the author of Anson’s Voyage, as little short of a terrestrial paradise. It was in 1742 that Anson’s wearied crew landed on them, wasted with sickness and a long sea-voyage, and naturally delighted with the appearance of land in any form; and these islands were, besides, at that time in a state of cultivation. Having since been neglected, they are now overrun with the rank vegetations of a tropical climate; and when the island was visited by subsequent navigators, amongst others by Byron, it was found to be an uninhabitable wilderness, overgrown with impenetrable thickets. The reason of this change was, that, owing to the oppressive policy of the Spaniards, by whom these islands had been conquered, the inhabitants, some time previous to Anson’s visit, had been removed to another island, and had left behind them, in the improved state of the country, proofs of their industry and civilization. Cotton and indigo trees abound, and generally all the productions of the tropical climates. Wild hogs are abundant, and of a very large size. The inhabitants are tall in their persons, and very active and robust; they are rude in their habits, and follow blindly the ignorant superstition of their priests, who instruct them in the belief of a malignant spirit, whom they appease by certain ceremonies. Long, of the Great Ladrone, 113. 44. E. Lat. 21. 52. N.
