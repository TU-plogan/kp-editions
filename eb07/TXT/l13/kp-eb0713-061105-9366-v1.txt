LYON King of Arms. This office is of great antiquity and respect in Scotland; and although the precise date of its institution is unknown, yet it must have been as early as the introduction of armorial figures as hereditary marks of gentility and distinction into this country, which was in the twelfth century. The regalia of this officer are, a crown of gold, with a crimson velvet cap, a gold tassel, and an ermine lining; a velvet robe reaching to his feet, with the arms of the kingdom embroidered thereon, before and behind, in the proper tinctures ;’ a triple row of gold chains round his neck, with an oval gold medal pendant thereto, on one side of which is the royal bearing, and on the other St Andrew with his cross enamelled in proper colours, and a baton of gold enamelled green, powdered with the badges of the kingdom. The Lord Lyon’s rank is superior to that of any other king of arms, as he holds his office immediately from the sovereign by commission under the great seal; whereas the kings at arms in England are deputies to the Earl Marshal, and act under his authority. Formerly Scotland was divided into two provinces, the one on the north, and the other on the south side of the Forth; and these provinces were under the management of two deputies appointed by the Lord Lyon, to superintend the execution of all the business of his office. Before the revolution, the Lord Lyon, upon his admission to office, was solemnly crowned by the sovereign or his commissioner, in presence of the nobility, the officers of state, and other great men, after a suitable sermon preached in the royal chapel; and his crown was of the same form with the imperial crown of the kingdom. On solemn occasions he wears the regalia above described; at all other times he wears the oval gold medal or badge on his breast, suspended by a broad green ribbon. He has the absolute disposal of all the offices in his own court, and of the places of heralds and pursuivants. The messengers at arms throughout Scotland are also created by him, and are amenable to his jurisdiction; and the powers vested in him by his commission are the same with those of the sovereign in all matters relative to the marks of gentility. See Heraldry.
