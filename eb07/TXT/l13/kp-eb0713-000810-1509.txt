LACINIUM, in Ancient Geography, a noble promontory of the Bruttii, in Italy, the southern boundary of the Sinus Tarentinus and the Adriatic, all to the south of it being deemed the Ionian Sea. It was famous for a rich temple of Juno, surnamed Lacinia, with a pillar of solid gold, which Hannibal intended to carry off; but, according to Cicero, was dissuaded by a dream.
