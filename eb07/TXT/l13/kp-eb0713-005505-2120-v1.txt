LANDAU, a canton of the province of the Rhine, in the kingdom of Bavaria. It is formed out of a portion of the former principality of Zwegbrucken, or Deux-Ponts, and is situated on the frontier of France, from which it is divided by the river Lauter. It is 558 square miles in extent, and contains eleven cities and market-towns, 126 villages, and 101,600 inhabitants. It is a mountainous and woody district, but with some rich and fertile valleys, yielding corn and cattle; but the chief produce is wood, which is floated down the Rhine, to the cities in Holland, in large rafts. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on the river Queich, one of the fortresses garrisoned by the German confederation. It is a regular and strong place, of four fronts, with eight curtains, defended by seven bastions, three redoubts, and seven lunettes, and surrounded with broad ditches. It has a citadel furnished with bomb-proof casernes and magazines, and celebrated for the sieges of 1702, 1704, 1713, and 1793. It contains 550 houses, and 4240 civil inhabitants. It has some manufactories of hemp, flax, and wool, and makers of twine, paper, hats, and hosiery. Long. 25. 47. E. Lat. 49. 11. N.
