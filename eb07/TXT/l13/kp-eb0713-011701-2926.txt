LASSA, a town of Thibet, and capital of a province of the same name. It is the capital of the country, and the seat of the Delai Lama. It belongs, however, to the Chinese, who have a viceroy here, with a garrison, commanded by a general officer, whose influence is superior to that of the lamas. It has been visited by few Europeans, and only by Catholic missionaries, who have left no very accurate or satisfactory description of it. The territory extends as far west as Kheroo, distant 350 miles west-southwest, which is within its limits. The city of Lassa is usually crowded with royal and noble personages from all parts of Asia, who come to present their homage, with splendid offerings, to the Delai Lama. His temple is crowned with a gilded dome, and adorned with numerous pyramids, either gilt or crowned with silver. Long. 91. 25. E. Lat. 29. 3Ã’. N.
