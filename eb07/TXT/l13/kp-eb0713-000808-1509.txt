LACHRYMATORY, in Antiquity, a vessel in which were collected the tears of a deceased personâ€™s friends, and preserved along with the ashes and the urn. Lachrymatories were small glass or earthen bottles, chiefly in the form of phials. At the Roman funerals, the friends of the deceased, or the praeficae, women hired for that purpose, used to fill them with their tears, and deposit them carefully with the ashes, in testimony of their sorrow, imagining that the manes of the deceased were thereby comforted and consoled.
