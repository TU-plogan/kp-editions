LIMBORCH, Philip, a learned writer amongst the Remonstrants, was born at Amsterdam in 1633. After having made great proficiency in his studies, he was, in 1655, admitted to preach in public, which he did first at Haerlem. His sermons had in them no affected eloquence, but were solid, methodical, and edifying. He was chosen minister of Gouda, whence he was called to Amsterdam, where he held the professorship of divinity, in which he acquitted himself with great reputation till his death, which happened in 1712. He had many friends of distinction in foreign parts, as well as in his own country. Some of his letters to Mr Locke are printed along with those of that celebrated author. He had all the qualifications suitable to the character of a sincere divine, lived an example of every virtue, and preserved the vigour of his body and mind till a considerably advanced age. He wrote many estimable works, the principal of which are, 1. Amica Collatio de veritate religionis Christianae cum erudito Judeco, in 12mo; 2.

a Complete Body of Divinity, according to the opinions and doctrines of the Remonstrants; and, 3. a History of the Inquisition, which was translated into English by Dr Samuel Chandler. Limborch also published the works of the famous Episcopius, who was his great-uncle by the motherâ€™s side.
