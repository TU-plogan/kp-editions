It is a most picturesque country, covered with mountains, hills, lakes, rivers, and forests, but inhabited by only 165,000 inhabitants, in five cities or towns, and 5489 detached settlements. The chief employment is cutlery, sawing wood, and extracting some copper and iron from the mines. The capital is a city of the same name, situated on the Stang An, over which there is a well-constructed stone bridge. It is the seat of a bishop, and has a respectable cathedral, and two other churches; a gymnasium, with a good library and collections of natural history and medals; with 550 houses, and 2995 inhabitants, who carry on some trade in tanning and in linen weaving.
