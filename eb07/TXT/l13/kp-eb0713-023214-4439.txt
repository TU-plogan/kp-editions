LERIDA, a city of Spain, in the province of Catalonia. It is strongly fortified, and in a situation favourable for defence. It was the brilliant theatre of one of the campaigns of Julius Caesar, and continued to be a place of military importance down to the war of the succession, when it supported the Austrian family; but, after the battle of Almanza, it submitted to the Bourbons. It is situated near the junction of the river Cinca with the Ebro, in a rich and well-cultivated plain. It is the see of a bishop, has a university, and a strong citadel; four parish churches, sixteen monasteries, one hospital, and 16,818 inhabitants.
