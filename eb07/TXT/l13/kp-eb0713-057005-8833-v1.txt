LOUISIANA, one of the United States of North America, is bounded on the east by the state of Mississippi, on the west by the Sabine River, on the north by the Arkansas territory, and on the south by the Gulf of Mexico. It extends from longitude 89. to 94. 5., and its extreme southern point is in latitude 28. 56. whilst its northern limit is in latitude 33. The average length is about 240 miles, and the mean breadth rather more than 200 miles, the area being estimated at 48,220 square miles. The surface of Louisiana presents great diversity of appearance, and no state in the union possesses a greater quantity of the very finest land. It includes all the varieties, from the most recent and still periodically inundated alluvial flats, to elevations which approach the magnitude of mountains; every quality of soil, from the most productive to the most sterile, from unwooded plains to dense and almost impenetrable forests. The southern part of this state, from Lake Borgne to Sabine River and from the Gulf of Mexico to Baton Rouge and Red River, is an alluvial tract of country, extending about two hundred and forty miles in length by from seventy to one hundred and forty in breadth. It is intersected by numerous rivers, bays, creeks, and lakes, which divide the country into a great number of islands. Three fourths of the state are destitute of any elevation which deserves the name of a hill. The pine woods generally have a surface of a very particular character, rising into fine swells, with table surfaces on the summit, and valleys from thirty to forty feet deep. But they in no part present the aspect of a range, and are scattered over the country like the waves of an agitated sea. The alluvial soil is level, and the swamps are dead flats. The vast prairies, which constitute a large portion of the state, present a surface as level as a frozen lake. With the exception of the shaking prairies, they are higher and drier than the savannahs of Florida. A range of hills commences by gentle undulations in Opelosas, rises gradually, and diverges towards the river Sabine. In the vicinity of Natchitoches it preserves a distance intermediate between the Sabine and Red Rivers, and increases in elevation to the western part of the state. A second line of hills, not far from Alexandria, commences on the north side of Red River, and separating between the waters of that river and Dudgemony, unites with another chain of elevations which bound the alluvial plains of the Washita as bluffs, gradually diverging from that river as they pass beyond the western limits of the state. There are likewise some considerable hills beyond the Mississippi, and in some other parts the country is high; but, generally speaking, Louisiana is one immense plain, divided into pine woods, prairies, swamps, and hickory and oak lands. The pine woods have almost invariably a poor soil. The greater proportion of the prairies is second-rate land, and some of them are even sterile. A few, however, in Opelosas, and those of Attakapas, possess great fertility. They are in general more level than those of the upper country. A very considerable extent of them has a cold clayey soil, with a hard crust near the surface. In other places the soil is of inky blackness, and in the hot and dry season it cracks into fissures of some inches in width. A considerable belt of these prairies, near the gulf, is low, marshy, and in rainy weather inundated. The bottoms are generally rich, but in very different degrees. Those of the Mississippi and Red Rivers are particularly so, and the vegetation there is remarkable for its size and luxuriance. The cotton on fresh lands of the richest quality reaches the size of a considerable shrub. The bottoms of Red River possess extraordinary fertility, and the lower courses of this stream constitute the paradise of cotton planters. The soil is said to derive its fertility from a portion of salt which is intimately mixed with it, and from its peculiar friability; and the darkish red colour which it bears is to be traced to the presence of the red oxide of iron. All the branches of Red River, and they are very numerous, partake of the character of the main stream. The other parts of Louisiana which have the richest soils are, the island of New Orleans, a narrow neck of land, insulated by various lakes and rivers. About one third of this neck is under cultivation, the other two thirds being swamp. This tract is the finest part of the rich country called the Coast, which is that part of the bottom of the Mississippi commencing with the first cultivation above the Balize, about forty miles below New Orleans, and extending one hundred and fifty miles above it. It is from one to two miles in breadth; and a richer tract of land of the same extent cannot be found on the globe. It is secured by an embankment, called a levee, from six to eight feet in height, and for the most part sufficiently broad to afford room for a fine road. Above the levee, on the east bank of the river, are situated the parishes of Baton Rouge and East and WestFeliciana. The latter parish is pleasantly diversified with hills and valleys, and belonging to it are the richest planters and the best plantations in the state, in some of which there are from five to eight hundred acres under cultivation. West of the Mississippi there are some [7:13:571] tracts of soil very fertile, and here the sugar-cane thrives well. A considerable portion of Attakapas is of great fertility, as are smaller portions of Opelosas, which is, however, best adapted for a grazing country. Near the Red River there occur several tracts of very fertile soil, on parts of which the richest cotton is produced. The lands on the Washita River are black, like, those on the Mississippi; and the alluvions on the lower courses of this stream furnish an admirable soil for cotton, and other productions that require the same climate.

A very great proportion of the surface of this state is covered with prairies, almost all of which are so associated with one another as to form a family, the natural connection of all the branches being easily traced. The first that occur west of the Mississippi are those which are included under the general name of Attakapas; a term implying “man-eater” in the language of the savages who formerly inhabited it, and who are said to have been cannibals. It is an immense plain of grass, stretching from the Atchafa-laya on the north to the gulf on the south. It is extremely fertile, innumerable herds of cattle and horses graze upon it, and at intervals are scattered over its immense surface the houses of the agriculturists. To the west of this prairie occurs that of Opelosas, still larger than the former, and computed to contain nearly 8000 square miles. It is divided, by various natural boundaries or obstructions, into a number of prairies, which have separate names and marks of distinction. The soil, though occasionally very fertile, is less so than that of Attakapas; but this deficiency is compensated by the greater salubrity of the climate, which is reckoned the healthiest in the state. There are here very considerable cotton plantations, and some of indigo; and the parish, which bears the same name, is one of the most populous in the state. Bellevue prairie is situated partly in Opelosas, partly in Attakapas, and, as its name imports, affords a delightful prospect. Calcasiu and Sabine prairies are names descriptive of the different forms, shapes, and openings of this continuous line of prairies, as it stretches along the settlements from the Plaquemine to the Sabine. Some of them are of great extent, and they all possess nearly the same characteristics. They are ge- ι nerally so level as to appear to the eye a perfect plain; but there occasionally occur swells and declivities, such as are sufficient to carry the water from them. The margin which borders on the gulf is commonly a wet marsh, covered with a luxuriant growth of tall reedy grass called cane-grass. In various parts of these prairies there are islands of timber lands. Wherever a bayou or stream I crosses the prairie, it is marked with a fringe of timber; and here the soil is invariably rich, as well as at the points of the prairie; but towards the Sabine it is less so. Attakapas is the first and most fertile, and that of the Sabine the last and most sterile. Beyond Opelosas prairie most of the people subsist by rearing cattle, sheep, horses, and mules. Many of the horses are of the Andalusian and Numidian breed; and the cattle are excellent, though slenderly formed. Numbers of the inhabitants are French, and though often opulent, from habit and inclination they adhere to the simplicity of pastoral life and primitive nature. Thousands of cattle range the plains, there is a rustic abundance of every thing, and the land abounds in milk and honey. There are various other prairies, but as they are of less importance than those above enume- 1 rated, and moreover possess similar general features, they do not require any particular description.

Wheat and rye do not flourish here in general, but oats and barley succeed well; and maize grows luxuriantly on the alluvions and rich lands. The sweet potato, convolvulus batatas, in the sandy soil attains its utmost perfection. They are of different species, and occasionally of a very large size, but all are extremely nutritive, and raised with ease in great abundance. ∙ The Irish potato is not so easily raised, and is only cultivated for eating during thìe early part of summer. Garden vegetables generally appear to have no assignable limit upon aì soil so varied, and in a climate so near the tropics. It may seem almost incredible that horticulture should be neglected in Louisiana, yet such is the case; and the fact seems the more unaccountable, when it is considered that some individual gardens present what would appear an irresistible temptation. The pumpkin and melon tribe flourish in this climate. All the northern fruits come to perfection, with the exception of apples. The apple-tree covers itself with blossoms and fruit, which, before it ripens, shows a black speck, decays, and falls. Different kinds of figs grow in the greatest abundance, and the tree would appear to attain its largest size in this quarter; but, although growing spontaneously, it is only to be found on a few farms. Along the whole shore of the gulf, and in some other places, the orange-tree, sweet and bitter, flourishes, and the fruit is of the finest quality. The cultivated vine flourishes abundantly; and wild grapes, such as the summer, winter, fox, muscadine, and pine-wood grape, are abundant. Berries are neither so common nor so good as in the north, but various kinds of wild fruit are common in the woods. There are an immense number of wild and cultivated flowering shrubs, which flourish in this region; and the abundance of mulberry trees holds out a prospect that the culture of silk will ere long form one of the branches of trade in this state. The timber-trees on the bottoms are willow, cotton-wood, honey-eye locust, pawpaw, and buck-eye; on the rich uplands, elm, cucumber, ash, hickory, mulberry, black walnut, with abundance of grape vines; and on the second rate, or sandy uplands, white, pitch, and yellow pines, and various kinds of oak. As yet agriculture is only in its infancy, the principal object being not to produce a great variety of crops, but to obtain the greatest amount of the staple productions. Sugar and rice are the staples of the state in general south of 30°, and cotton north of that parallel; the latter, however, is extensively cultivated in every part of the state. Sugar-cane is a very rich and abundant article of growth in Louisiana. It requires the richest soil, the mould of which should at least be a foot deep. There are three or four varieties or species, as the African, the Otaheitan, the West Indian, and the riband cane. The Otaheitan grows luxuriantly, and ripens considerably earlier than the West Indian; but it is said to contain saccharine matter, in comparison with the other, only as two to three. The riband cane is a new and beautiful species, which possesses the advantage of not requiring so long a season for ripening. Throughout the state the planters are turning their attention to the cultivation of the sugar-cane, and nothing yields so rich a harvest. The rice is remarkably fair, and yields abundantly. There is a great extent of land favourable for the production of the upland rice; and no limit can be assigned to the amount which might be raised. The cotton cultivated here is an annual plant, growing in the rich lands more than six feet in height, and the larger stalks of the size of a man’s arm, throwing out a number of branches, on which form large and beautiful whitish-yellow blossoms. It is planted from March till the middle of May, in drill rows, six feet apart. The kinds of cotton cultivated are, Louisiana, green seed or Tennessee, and recently Mexican cotton. The green seed is not so fine a staple, but it is less subject to the destructive malady called the rot. The Mexican is of a finer staple, yields more abundantly, and has not hitherto suffered from rot. It is being commonly adopted, and the importation of seed from Tampico and Vera Cruz is becoming a considerable business. Sea Island cotton grows well upon grounds that have been exhausted by the [7:13:572] continued cultivation of the other kinds. All the species exhaust the soil; but the seeds, which accumulate in prodigious quantities around the gins, furnish an admirable manure, which supplies the deficiency of nutriment. Attempts have been made to cultivate the tea plant; and benne, which yields an oil similar to that of olives, succeeds well. Indigo was formerly a prime object of attention amongst the planters, but the cultivation of it has been in a great measure abandoned. The finest tobacco is raised, but it is not so profitable as sugar and cotton, although that which is cultivated in the vicinity of Natchitoches is said to equal the tobacco of Cuba. Louisiana produces annually an average crop of more than 100,000 hogsheads of sugar, and five millions of gallons of molasses. It is to this individual branch of agriculture that the prosperity of the

Union in general, and the west in particular, has in a great measure been attributed. Such is a sketch of the agriculture of Louisiana. We shall now describe the divisions of the state, and the principal towns belonging to it

The state of Louisiana is, for the better arrangement in the choice of the legislature, divided into twelve counties These are,

The county of Orleans, Rapides.

German Coast, Natchitoches

Acadia, Concordia.

Iberville, Ouachita.

Lafourche, Opelosas.

Point Coupee, Attakapas.

This division was made in 1812, when the constitution by which the state is governed was first framed.

New Orleans, the commercial capital of the state, and the emporium of western commerce, is situated on the east bank of the Mississippi, in a bend so deep and sinuous, that the sun rises to the inhabitants of the city from the opposite shore, in north latitude 29. 57. and in longitude 98. 8. west from Greenwich. It is nearly intermediate between Boston and Mexico, although the passage from New Orleans to Vcra Cruz is much shorter by sea than to Boston. It consists of the old city properly so called, which is built in the form of a parallelogram, of which the longer sides are 1320 yards in length, and the shorter, or the depth of the city towards the swamp, 700 yards. No city on the globe possesses so great natural advantages for a commercial capital as New Orleans. It has an easy communication with the ocean; and above the city there are 20,000 miles of navigation by means of the Mississippi and its numerous tributaries, whilst various bayous connect it with different parts of the state. By a basin and canal it communicates with Lake Ponchartrain, the lakes thence to the Gulf of Mexico, the opposite Florida shore, with Mobile, Pensacola, and the whole gulf-shore east and west. There is also a railroad four and a half miles long between the city and Lake Ponchartrain. Seen from the harbour, New Orleans presents a striking panoramic view. The old city is divided into six squares, each square having a front of 319 feet in length, and being divided into twelve lots. Few of the streets are more than forty feet wide. Buildings of brick have now replaced the wooden structures of which the city was formerly composed. The French and Spanish styles of building predominate, and the houses are stuccoed externally. The public buildings are, the town-house, the hospital, the cathedral church of St Louis, the convent of Ursaline nuns, the barracks, the custom-house, the market-house, five banks with a capital of 4,000,000 of dollars, a government-house, district court of the United States, water-works, two theatres, and a Presbyterian and other churches. Several of these buildings, as the cathedral, are large, commodious, and handsome. The Fauxbourg of St Mary, and other new parts of the city, are built principally of brick, after the American style; and in general the city is gradually becoming American in all its characteristics. Between the city and the bayou St John, are the villages St Johnsburg and St Claud. The commerce of this city is immense, and constantly increasing. There are sometimes in the harbour 1500 flat boats at a time; and steam-boats arrive and take their departure every hour. No place in the United States has so .much activity and bustle of commerce, crowded into so small a space, in the months of February and March. During the season of bringing in the cotton crop, whole streets are barricaded with cotton bales. The amount of domestic exports from this city exceeds twelve millions of dollars a year, being greater than that of any other city of the Union excepting New York, and nearly equalling that place. The greatest items which enter into this amount are sugar and cotton. From being placed in the midst of immense swamps, New Orleans is generally considered as unhealthy, but few towns in the United States have increased with greater rapidity. The market in general is cheap and abundant, and the productions of every climate find their way thither. This city necessarily exercises a very great moral influence over all the western country; and there is not a distinguished merchant, planter, or farmer, in the Mississippi valley, who has not made at least one trip to this place. The police of the city is at once mild and efficient, and the municipal and criminal courts are prompt in administering justice. A great portion of the inhabitants of New Orleans arc of French and Spanish descent, and the French language is more used than the English. During the busy season, the manners, dresses, customs, and languages of every quarter of the globe are here exhibited. The means of education in this city are very limited compared with those of the other large cities of the United States, but there have been great improvements within the last few years; and, considering that one half of the people are slaves, the state of morals is better than might be expected. The following are some of the principal imports into New Orleans for the year 1829 :—Bagging, 13,472 pieces; buffalo robes, 15,210 lbs.; cotton, 269,571 bales; corn in ears, 91,882 barrels; flour, 157,323 barrels; lard, 110,206 kegs; pig lead, 146,203 pigs; deer-skins, 6215 packs; tobacco, 29,432 hhds. The amount of cotton exported in the year ending the 30th of September 1830 was 354,024 bales. Nothing seems adverse to the growth of New Orleans except the unhealthiness of its climate; but, by draining and otherwise improving it, it will probably be rendered more healthy, and become one of the largest cities in the Union.

Donaldsonville, on the west side of the Mississippi, at the efflux of Lafourche, ninety miles above New Orleans, has a number of houses, and has been selected by the legislature as the place for the future political capital of the state. Baton Rouge is on the east side of the Mississippi, 140 miles above New Orleans. It is pleasantly situated on the last bluff that is seen on descending the river. The site is thirty or forty feet above the highest overflow of the river. The United States barracks here are built in a fine style, and are supposed to be amongst the handsomest and most commodious of the kind. There is a delightful prospect from the esplanade, including a great extent of the coast, with handsome houses and rich cultivation below, and commanding an extensive view over the back country to the east. The town consists of a number of French and Spanish houses, with several green squares, and contains 1200 inhabitants. St Francisville is a considerable village, of nearly the same size as Baton Rouge. A good way to the westward of this town is Jackson, which is the seat of an incipient college. On ι the opposite shore is Point Coupee, a wealthy French settlement. Galvez-town is situated on Bayou Manshac, or Iberville, not far from where it enters Lake Ponchartrain. Alexandria, on Red River, seventy miles from the Mississippi, and 150 from the mouth of the river by its course, is situated on the south bank of the river, half a mile below the fall. It is central to the rich planting country of Bayous Rapide, Robert, and Boeuf. It is the seat of justice for the parish, has a bank, a number of stores, and respectable attornies and physicians, and issues a weekly paper. Vast quantities of cotton are exported from this place. The last town of any size towards the south-western frontier of the United States is Natchitoches, about sixty miles above Alexandria. The Spanish trade for a considerable distance into the interior of the Mexican state centres here, and it is the great thoroughfare for people going to and returning from these states. The trade from them consists chiefly in bars of silver, and in horses and mules. Manufactured goods, groceries, spirits, and tobacco, are sent in return. This is a very considerable and growing place, and is likely to become the largest town in the country, except New Orleans. It is beautifully situated on the bank of the river, and is at the head of the steam-boat navigation. A few leagues to the west of this town is the ancient Spanish town of Adayes, the inhabitants of which are all Spanish. There are some other places, but none of such importance as to demand particular mention.

The canal which connects the city of New Orleans with Lake Ponchartrain has already been mentioned. Where it terminates, at the north of the city, there is a convenient basin, excavated entirely by art, and large enough to contain a great number of vessels. Immense labour and expense were necessary to render the river navigable, especially at [7:13:574] the mouth of the lake, where a large and impassable bar was removed, and large piles of wood driven into the sand to prevent it from forming again. A provision in the charter of this canal corporation allows them to extend it to the Mississippi.

The roads are for the most part good, but when they diverge to any distance from the rivers they are subject to inundation. Numerous railroads and canals have been projected; and there is no country in the world where nature has done more towards forming natural canals, which a little labour would complete by artificial extensions.

The country was first peopled by the French, but the Spaniards obtained possession of some parts, and established colonies in it. It was again conquered by the English, and many of the original settlers remained in the country. It was not admitted into the federal union until 1812. From the frequency of these conquests, and the number of settlers from different nations, the character of the inhabitants is different from that of those in most of the other states. The descendants of the French possess many characteristics of that people, and formerly lived in a state of pastoral simplicity. They are mild, vivacious, and polite. The American planters are high minded, social, irascible, and generous; much addicted to hunting, gambling, and dissipation. The people generally are volatile, gay, benevolent, and easily excited to joy or sorrow. Education was formerly at a very low ebb, but latterly ample and munificent appropriations have been made, each parish in the state granting eight hundred dollars annually for that purpose. The language generally spoken is French, but in a very corrupt state. The prevailing religion is Roman Catholic, there being only a few Baptists and Methodist societies, and one Presbyterian church, in the state.

The constitution differs in some minor points from those of the other western states. The senators are elected for a period of four years, one fourth vacating their seats annually; and they must possess a property worth 1000 dollars before they can be chosen. The representatives are elected for two years, and, to be eligible, must have property in the parish worth 500 dollars. The governor is elected for four years, with a salary of 7000 dollars annually, and cannot be chosen for the next term. A supreme and circuit court exercise the judiciary power, together with a municipal or parish court. Every free white man above twenty-one years is entitled to vote in the elections, provided he has been six months in the parish, and has paid taxes. In civil jurisprudence, this state has, with some modifications, adhered to that derived from France and Spain; but in criminal matters they have followed the English jurisprudence.

This state has an extensive, and, from its great natural advantages, rapidly increasing commerce. The quantity of sugar manufactured yearly averages about 60,629 hhds.; the quantity of molasses 3,018,041 gallons, and it is expected that this state will furnish abundance of this article for the whole consumption of the United States. The tobacco exported averages 29,543 hhds. annually, and the cotton in the same period 308,243 bales. The yearly quantity, however, depends entirely upon the season. The total amount of exports and imports in 1833 was, imports 9,590,505 dollars, and exports 18,941,373 dollars. The amount received in the state for postage for die year ending the 31st of March 1832, was 4,812,898 dollars. The number of banks in 1834 was ten, having a capital of 23,664,755 dollars, and they issued notes to the amount of 4,793,730 dollars. The number of ships belonging to the state in 1830 was 399, and the number of seamen employed 4789. (r. r. r.)
