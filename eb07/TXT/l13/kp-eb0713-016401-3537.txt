LEEFOGA, one of the smallest of the Hapace Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean. It is not above seven miles long, and in some places not above two or three broad. There is a reef running to a considerable extent from the east end of it, on which, from being exposed to the trade-winds, the sea breaks with great violence. It was here that in 1800 the Port-au-Prince privateer was cut off, and almost all the crew massacred. Long. 185. 40. E. Lat. 12. 49. S.
