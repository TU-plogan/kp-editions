LATIMER, Hugh, bishop of Worcester, was born about the year 1480, at Thurcaston, in Leicestershire. He was the only son of a yeoman of that village. At the age of fourteen he was sent to Christ’s College, Cambridge, where he applied himself to the study of divinity, and in proper time took the degree of bachelor in that science. At this time he was a zealous Catholic, and was honoured with the office of keeper of the cross to the university; but when he was about thirty years of age, he became a convert to the Protestant religion; and being then one of the twelve licensed preachers of Cambridge, he promulgated his opinions with great freedom. It was not long before he was accused of heresy; and being summoned before Cardinal Wolsey, he was obliged to subscribe certain articles of faith, which he certainly did not believe. About the year 1529 he was presented by the king to the rectory of Westkinton, in Wiltshire, to which place, after residing some time at court with his friend and patron Dr Butts, he retired; but having resumed his former invectives against the Catholic doctrines, he was again summoned to answer certain interrogatories, and again obliged to subscribe a recantation. In 1535, he was promoted to the bishopric of Worcester, a dignity which he continued to enjoy till the year 1539, when, rather than assent to the act of the six articles, he resigned his mitre, and retired into the country; but in a short time he was accused of speaking against the six articles, and committed to the Tower, where he continued prisoner till the death of Henry VIII. which happened in January 1547. On the accession of Edward VI. Latimer was released, but not restored to his bishopric, though he had preached several times before the king, and continued to exercise his ministerial functions with unremitting zeal and resolution. But young Edward finished his short reign in the year 1553; and Mary having ascended the throne, Latimer was immediately doomed to destruction, and, together with Cranmer and Ridley, confined in the Tower. In April 1554, they were removed to Oxford, that they might dispute with the learned doctors of both universities. Latimer declined the disputation on account of his great age and infirmities, but delivered his opinion in writing; and, having refused to subscribe the Romish creed, was condemned for heresy, and, in the October following, burned alive, along with Bishop Ridley. He behaved with uncommon fortitude on the occasion, and died a real martyr to the Reformation. His general character is that of a learned, virtuous, and brave man. His works are, 1. Sermons, 1635, in folio; 2. Letters in Fox’s Acts and Monuments (vol. ii.), 1580; 3. An Injunction to the Prior and Convent of St Mary’s in Worcestershire.
