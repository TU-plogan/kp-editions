LIMBURG, a city of the Netherlands, in the province of Liège, and arrondissement of Verviers. It is fortified, and stands on the river Besdre, and, including its suburb Dalhem, contains 320 houses, and 2000 inhabitants. Long. 5. 58. E. Lat. 50. 40. N.

Limburg, a city of the duchy of Nassau, in Germany, the capital of the bailiwick of that name. It is situated on the river Lahn, is surrounded with walls, and has the mint for the ducal coinage. It has some mineral springs, and contains 508 houses, with 2820 inhabitants. The neighbourhood produces the best, wheat of any part of Germany.

Limburg, a province of the Netherlands, formed out of the greater part of the former French department of the Lower Meuse, and a small portion of the department of the Roer, to which has been added a portion of Dutch Limburg, part of the bishoprick of Liège, of Austrian and Prussian Guelders, and some small part of the duchies of Cleves and Juliets, with communes taken from the circle of Westphalia in Germany. It is now a compact district, extending over 1546 square miles, between north latitude 50. 44. and 51. 45. and between east longitude 4. 52. and 6. 5. It is a level plain, except that a few hills, of no great height, rise in the south-east division. The soil is generally fertile in the vale, through which the Meuse, its only navigable river, runs; but the north-western part consists chiefly of barren heaths. The parts of these heaths that are cultivated produce scarcely any grain, except buck wheat. The meadows on the banks of the Meuse, as well as the lands adjoining to them, where clover is grown, are adapted to the breeding and fattening of cattle; and their dairies, which are conducted on the plan of the Hollanders, produce excellent butter and cheese. Much rape seed is also raised for making oil, and the crops of hemp, flax, madder, chicory, and tobacco, are found profitable. Coals are obtained in some parts; and the quarries yield good stone, peculiarly adapted to building under water, for which there is a great demand in Holland. The manufactures of the province are inconsiderable, and confined chiefly to such articles as are of common domestic demand. There are in the province three arrondissements, divided into twenty-two cantons, and subdivided into 336 communes. The inhabitants, amounting to 292,500, are for the most part of the Walloon race; but the Dutch, Flemish, and Walloon dialects are almost equally spoken by them. The capital is Maestricht.
