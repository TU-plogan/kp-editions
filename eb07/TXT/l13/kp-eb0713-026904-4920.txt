LIBANUS, a lofty mountain of Syria, the ancient Lebanon, so celebrated in Scripture. Its direction is nearly north and south, from the vicinity of Tripoli to the borders of Palestine. Its distance from the Mediterranean is from thirty to forty miles. To the east there is the parallel chain of Anti-Libanus, which is covered with snow at its summit. The exact height of the mountain of Lebanon has not been ascertained. Mr Buckingham ascended to its summit; but he does not state its precise height, which must be considerable, as it is covered with snow to an unknown depth at all seasons; for he mentions, that though his horses sometimes sunk to the belly, they never were able to penetrate to the ground. The cedars of Lebanon, so often mentioned, still flourish at a lower level on the hill. Mr Buckingham saw about 200 cedar trees, all fresh and green. Some of them were very large, the trunk ten or twelve feet in diameter, with branches of corresponding size, each of them like large trees extending outward from the parent stock, and overshadowing a large space of ground. The view from the summit was magnificent, embracing the boundless prospect of the ocean to the westward, with the coasts of Syria. To the east the prospect was interrupted by the range of Anti-Libanus. The mountain consists of a species of limestone, which presents frequently the appearance of towers and castles.
