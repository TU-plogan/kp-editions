LOOM, the weaver’s frame, a machine by which many distinct threads are woven into one piece. Looms are of various structures, accommodated to the various kinds of materials to be woven, and the various modes of weaving them, namely, for woollens, silks, linens, cottons, cloths of gold, and other works, as tapestry, ribands, stockings, and other articles, each of which will be found under its proper head. The weaver’s loom-engine, otherwise called the [7:13:567]Dutch loom-engine, was brought from Holland to London about the year 1676.

Loom, at sea. If a ship appears big when at a distance, they say she looms, or appears a great sail. The term is also used to denote the indistinct appearance of any other distant objects.
