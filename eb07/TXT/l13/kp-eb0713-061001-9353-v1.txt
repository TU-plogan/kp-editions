LYDIAT, Thomas, a learned English divine, was born in 1572, and educated at Oxford. About the year 1609, he became acquainted with Dr James Usher, afterwards archbishop of Armagh, who carried him to Ireland. He studied at Dublin College for about two years, after which he returned to England; and the rectory of Alkrington becoming vacant, he was presented to it. But at length, being bound for the debts of a near relation, which he found himself unable to pay, having before spent his patrimony in printing several books, he was sent to prison, and confined at Oxford, in the King’s Bench, and elsewhere, until Sir William Boswell, a generous patron of learned men, Dr Robert Pink, warden of New College, Bishop Usher, and Dr Laud, discharged the debt. In the civil wars he suffered much in his rectory of Alkrington from the parliamentary party, by whom he was four times pillaged to the value of at least L.70, and even forced for a quarter of a year together to subsist on the bounty of others. Fie wrote some pieces in English, and several works in Latin, on chronology, and natural history; and died in 1646.
