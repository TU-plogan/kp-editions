LINDUS, in Ancient Geography, a town of Rhodes, situated on a hill on the western side of the island. It was built by Elepolemus the son of Hercules, according to Diodorus Siculus; but by one of the Heliades, grandsons of the Sun, named Lindus, according to Strabo. It was the native place of Cleobulus, one of the wise men. Here was the famous temple of the Lindian Minerva, built by the daughters of Danaus. Cadmus enriched this temple with many splendid offerings. The citizens dedicated and hung up here the seventh of Pindarâ€™s Olympic odes, written in letters of gold. The ruins of that superb edifice are still to be seen upon the top of a high hill which overlooks the sea. Some remains of the walls, consisting of stones of an enormous size, still show that it had been built in the Cyclopian style.

Lindo, the modern city, stands at the foot of the hill. A bay of considerable wideness and depth serves as a harbour to the city. Ships find good anchorage there in twenty fathoms water. They are safely sheltered from the south-west winds, which constantly prevail during the severe[7:13:359] season of the year. In the beginning of winter, they cast anchor off a small village named Massary. Before the building of Rhodes, Lindus was the harbour which received the fleets of Egypt and of Tyre; and it was enriched by commerce. Mr Savary observes, that a judicious government, by taking advantage of its harbour and happy situation, might yet restore it to a flourishing state.
