LEGHORN, properly Livorno, a commercial city of the duchy of Tuscany, in Italy. It stands on the sea-shore, near the island of Melora, which, by its castle, defends the entrance of the harbour. It is surrounded by strong walls on every side; but towards the land these are thought to be untenable, from being commanded by neighbouring heights. The outer harbour has not depth of ater for ships of more than 400 tons burden. It is surrounded by a long mole, the efficiency of which is lessened by the great quantity of sand brought in by the west and the north winds. The inner harbour, called Darsena, is only used for repairing ships, and for the reception of fishing boats and small craft. The river Arno connects Florence with the harbour of Leghorn. It is a well-built city, with many massive houses, which, if not elegant, are well calculated for a mercantile place. There is a ducal and an episcopal palace, many churches and hospitals, and more than 6000 houses, with 72,924 inhabitants. One third of the population consists of Jews, who are enclosed in a separate quarter, but otherwise enjoy greater privileges than in almost any other part of Italy. The trade is very extensive, and much ingenuity is applied to several branches of manufactures of a minute kind, such as works in coral, ivory, and marble, in distilling liqueurs, in preparing snuff, cream-of-tartar, soaps, starch, powder, leather, shot, and other articles. It is, next to Marseilles, the most extensive sea-port in the Mediterranean, and it is visited by ships from England, France, America, and the northern countries of Europe, and has considerable shipping belonging to its merchants, who trade chiefly with the towns in Northern Africa. The following table will show the several nations whose commerce with this port is carried on by their own vessels.

The far greater proportion of Neapolitan, Sardinian, Tuscan, Lucchese, and Roman vessels, consists of small coasting craft, of from fifteen to twenty tons burden.
