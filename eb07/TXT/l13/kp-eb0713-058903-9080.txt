LUCIFERIANS, a religious sect, who adhered to the schism of Lucifer, bishop of Cagliari, in the fourth century, who was banished by the Emperor Constantius for saving defended the Nioene doctrine concerning the three hersons in the Godhead. St Augustin seems to intimate that the Luciferians believed the soul, which they consifered as of a carnal nature, to be transmitted to the children from their fathers. Theodoret says that Lucifer was the author of a new error. The Luciferians increas-d mightily in Gaul, Spain, Egypt, and other countries. The occasion of the schism was, that Lucifer would not allow any acts he had done to be abolished. There were inly two Luciferian bishops, but a great number of priests and deacons. The Luciferians cherished a peculiar aversion to the Arians.
