LAMBETH, a very large parish in the hundred of Brixton, in the county of Surrey. It may bc considered as one of the suburbs of London, on the south side of the Thames, and only separated from it by that river. Its boundaries are very wide, extending on the east from Southwark, to Wandsworth on the west, and till it comes, at Norwood, in contact with Croyden to the south. It is remarkable for the palace of the Archbishop of Canterbury, an ancient and magnificent pile of building, of the architecture of various ages, from the year 1197 down to the present time, when it has been recently repaired and beautified by the taste and the munificence of the present occupier of that high ecclesiastical dignity. The library contains a most curious and valuable collection of books and manuscripts, calculated to throw much light on the ecclesiastical and civil history of the kingdom, as well as on the pedigrees of many illustrious families. The buildings, park, and gardens, are said to contain thirteen acres. The parish church is near the palace, and is a small old building; but new churches of appropriate size have been built under the recent act for building churches in different parts of the parish, which, though not quite adequate to the population, afford tolerable accommodation to the worshippers. The parish contains several large establishments of a benevolent kind, especially the new bedlam for insane persons, the philanthropic institution, and the asylum for female orphans, and the Westminster lying-in hospital. From its easy access to London, which three of the bridges over the Thames afford, many valuable manufacturing and commercial establishments are within the parish. Boatbuilding is one that gives employment to numerous persons. Iron-founderies, and especially shops for making steam-engines of all powers, are extensive branches of trade. Breweries and distilleries are among the list of its [7:13:39] means of industry, and especially establishments for making vinegar and British wines. The celebrated gardens of Vauxhall are within this parish, and have been of late much improved in magnificence, as well as in the moral decorum, which was formerly a subject of regret and complaint. The parish is now divided into five districts, viz. St John’s Waterloo, Kennington, Brixton, Norwood, and that which remains to the parish church. The annual value of the real property, according to the assessment of 1815, was L.220,618. Few parishes show a more rapid increase of population than this. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 27,939, in 1811 to 41,644, in 1821 to 57,638, and in 1831 to 87,856. Under the reform bill, Lambeth returns two members to the House of Commons.
