LINACRE, Thomas, a physician, was born at Canterbury about the year 1460, and educated there under the learned William Selling. He thence removed to Oxford, and in 1484 was chosen fellow of All-Souls’ College. Selling, his former instructor, being at this time appointed ambassador from King Henry VII. to the court of Rome, Mr Linacre accompanied him to Italy, where he attained a high degree of perfection in the Greek and Latin languages. At Rome he applied himself particularly to the study of Aristotle and Galen, in the original. On his return to Oxford, he was incorporated doctor of physic, and chosen public professor in that faculty. But he had not been long in England before he was commanded by Henry VII. to repair to court, to attend the young Prince Arthur as his tutor and physician. He was afterwards appointed physician to the king, and after his death to his successor Henry VIII. Dr Linacre founded two medical lectures at Oxford, and one at Cambridge; but that which has most effectually immortalized his name amongst the faculty, is his being the founder of the College of Physicians in London. He beheld with vexation the wretched state of physic in those times; and, by an application to Cardinal Wolsey, obtained a patent in 1518, by which the physicians of London were incorporated. The intention of this corporation was to prevent illiterate and ignorant persons from practising the art of healing. Dr Linacre was [7:13:351]the first president, and held the office as long as he lived. Their meetings were held in his own house in Knightrider Street, which he bequeathed to the college. But, when he was about the age of fifty, he took it into his head to study divinity, entered into orders, and, in 1509, was collated to the rectory of Mersham. In the same year he was installed as prebendary of Wells, in 1518 as prebendary of York, and in the following year was admitted precentor of that cathedral. This, we are told, he resigned for other preferments. He died of stone in the bladder in October 1524, at the age of sixty-four, and was buried in St Paul’s. Thirty-three years after his death, Dr John Caius caused a monument to be erected to his memory, with a Latin inscription, which contains the outlines of his life and character. He was a man of great natural sagacity, a skilful physician, a profound grammarian, and one of the best Greek and Latin scholars of his time. Erasmus, in his epistles, speaks highly of his translations from Galen, preferring them even to the original Greek. His works are, 1. De emendata Structura Latini Sermonis libri sex, London, printed by Pynson, 1524, 8vo, and by Stephens, 1527, 1532; 2. Rudiments of Grammar, for the use of the Princess Mary, printed by Pynson, and translated into Latin by Buchanan, Paris, 1536. He likewise translated into Latin several of Galen’s works, which were at different times printed abroad; also Procli Diadachi Sphoera, translated from the Greek, Venice, 1499, 1500.
