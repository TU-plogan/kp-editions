LACHSA, Laiisa, or Hajar, a division of Arabia, extending along nearly the whole of the south-western coast of the Persian Gulf, from its entrance at Cape Mussendoom, and to a considerable distance inland. Like most other parts of Arabia, the coast is fertile and well peopled; but the interior consists of sandy plains. This country is famed for a breed of asses and camels, and some thousands of the latter are annually exported to Syria. It produces dates, rice, and cotton. The coast from Mussendoom to Bahrein had become such a refuge for pirates, who interrupted by their depredations the trade of the Red Sea, that in 1809 the British government fitted out an expedition at Bombay for the purpose of chastising them. They succeeded in taking by assault Ras-el-Khima, the principal port on this coast, in November 1809, and, burning seventy vessels, carried off considerable plunder. The principal town is Lachsa, situated a few miles up the river Astan, which forms at the mouth a species of bay, opposite to which are the islands of Bahrein, famous for pearls. Long. 48. 34. E. Lat. 26. 56. N.
