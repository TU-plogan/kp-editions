LEBRIJA, or Lebrixa, a town of Spain, in the province of Andalusia, about three leagues north of Xeres, and on the road by the plain from that city to Seville. It was a plain of great celebrity during the contests between Caesar and Pompey. It was the head-quarters of the latter, and the place where three Roman knights had formed a conspiracy to desert, with all the cavalry, and join Caesar, a few days before the decisive battle of Meenda. A Roman camp, near the town, with a magnificent castle in the centre, is still remaining. The lower part is Roman bricks, the upper part is of Moorish erection. It is partly n ruins, but a large portion is converted into a monastery, and the whole has a most imposing effect. The country aiound is very fertile, abounding in corn, wine, and oil, in the cultivation of which the inhabitants find employment. It contains 6000 inhabitants.
