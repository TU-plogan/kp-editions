LUS, a city of France, the capital of a canton in the department of the Upper Pyrenees. It stands in a romantic situation in the pleasing valley of Bastan, at the foot of the Pic de Leyrey, and on the Gave de Barrĕges, and contains about 2200 inhabitants. Near to it is the mineral spring of St Sauveur, which is frequented by invalids, [7:13:596]both for drinking and bathing, the water being of the temperature 98° of Fahrenheit.

. Lus, a district in the eastern part of the Persian province of Mekran, the country of the ancient Oritae. It is of a circular form, and bounded on three sides by an immense range of mountains, separating it from the western part of Mekran, Beloochistan, and Scind. The face of the country is flat and sandy, producing abundant crops of every species of grain. There are four passes through the mountains which encompass Lus; two into Scind, one into western Mekran, and one into Beloochistan. The country is under the jurisdiction of a petty chief, who can bring about 4000 irregular troops into the field, and enjoys a revenue of 50,000 rupees per annum. The capital is Bayla; but the chief maritime port is Sommeany, which is a small and mean place.
