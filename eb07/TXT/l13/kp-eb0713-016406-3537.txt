LEETAKOO, or Lattakoo, the capital of the BosÂ· huana territory, in Southern Africa. The old town of this name, when first visited in 1801, contained from 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants, who had made some advancement in the arts of civilized life; but in consequence of a schism in one of the tribes, the inhabitants removed to a place about sixty miles farther north. New Leetakoo is supposed to contain about 6000 people.
