LEUCOTHOE, or Leucothea, in fabulous history, the wife of Athamas, who was changed into a sea deity. She was the Matuta of the Romans, and had a temple at Rome, where all the people, particularly women, offered vows for their brothers’ children. They did not entreat the deity to protect their own children, because Ino had been unfortunate in hers. No female slaves were permitted to enter the temple; or if curiosity tempted them to transgress this rule, they were beaten with the greatest severity.
