LACHESIS, in Mythology, one of the Parcae or Fates. Her name is derived from ^KaÎ³w, to measure out by lot. She presided over futurity, and was represented as spinning the thread of life, or, according to others, holding the spindle. She generally appeared covered with a garment variegated with stars, and holding spindles in her hand.
