LAVATER, John Gaspard Christian, best known by his writings on physiognomy, was born at Zurich, in Switzerland, in 1741. He was brought up a protestant minister, and entered into holy orders in 1761. He was for some time pastor of the orphans’ church in that city; but from the year 1778 he was deacon and pastor of St Peter’s church in the same place. The eloquence of his discourses in the pulpit, as well as the ardent zeal and Christian benevolence with which he discharged the duties of his office, procured for him an early reputation. Though not much conversant with books, he had a very extensive knowledge of human nature, and a most acute discernment. His theological writings in prose and verse arc little known, but his works on physiognomy have extended his fame throughout every part of Europe. We are informed by umself, that he felt an early propensity to study the human face, and frequently drew such features as made a peculiar impression upon his mind; but his choice of physiognomy was fixed by the suggestion of Dr Zimmerman, who, having heard his remarks on the singular countenance of a soldier whom they saw passing by as they stood together at a window, urged him to pursue and methodise his ideas. He soon acquired a full conviction of the reality of physiognomical science, and of his own discoveries in it. His first volume on this subject appeared at Leipzig in 1776, and the twenty sections of which it was composed he modestly denominated fragments. With him it appeared to be an axiom, that the powers and faculties of the mind have representative signs in the solid parts of the countenance. This] notion he extended to all animated nature, firmly believing that internal qualities invariably denote themselves by external marks or tokens.

Two more volumes soon appeared in succession, containing a wonderful assemblage of curious observations, refined reasoning, delicate feeling, and philanthropic sentiments, with a number of engravings highly finished and singularly expressive. This work was well translated into the French and English languages, and for some time formed the favourite topic of literary discussion. So much was its author admired, that no foreigner of distinction passed through Zurich without obtaining an interview with Lavater, and asking his opinion of some character from a shade or miniature. His huge volumes, however, are now seldom looked at except for the sake of the plates, and his physiognomical notions appear to be consigned to oblivion with other sciences of a chimerical nature. One of the best known of his miscellaneous publications is his Aphorisms on Man, which contain originality both in sentiment and expression, with deep and philosophical views of human nature.

Lavater was zealously attached to the Christian revelation, and translated Bonnet’s Inquiry into the Evidences of Christianity, into the German language. This book he dedicated to the celebrated Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelsohn, with a challenge either to refute it publicly, or profess his conviction of the truth of its arguments. This challenge he afterwards confessed to have been inconsiderate, and allowed that his zeal had misled him. His popularity at Zurich was so extremely great, that in his walks it was no uncommon thing to see the people flocking around him, and kissing his hand in token of respect. He had a most exemplary moral character, and his zeal in doing good was scarcely ever surpassed. He was mild and moderate in conversation, although naturally full of fire and sensibility; he was candid in his estimate of such as differed from him in opinion; he always rose early, and never took his breakfast till he thought he had earned it. He was the determined enemy of tyranny in every shape, being possessed of the genuine Swiss zeal for liberty. He was therefore a friend to the French revolution at its commencement; but the rapine, plunder, and bloodshed which afterwards disgraced it, made him one of its bitterest adversaries. On the day when the unfortunate city of Zurich was stormed by Massena in 1799, he received a wound in the breast from a Swiss soldier in the streets, to whom he had formerly been a benefactor. He never wholly recovered from the effects of this wound; and he brought on a train of dangerous symptoms by attending for more than an hour, in the open air, a man who was condemned to be shot as a spy. The activity and vigour of his mind, however, continued till a short time before his death, which took place on the 2d of January 1801.
