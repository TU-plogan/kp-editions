LIBATION, amongst the Greeks and Romans, was an essential part of solemn sacrifices. It was also performed alone, as a drink-offering, by way of procuring the protection and favour of the gods in the ordinary affairs of life. Libations, according to the nature of the gods in honour of whom they were made, consisted of different liquids, but wine was that most usually employed. The wine offered to the gods was always unmixed with water. There were libations of water, libations of honey, libations of milk, and libations of oil, called wj^αλ∕α kga. The libation was made with a serious deportment and solemn prayer. At sacrifices, the libation, after it had been tasted by the priest, and handed to the bystanders, was poured out upon the victim. At entertainments a little wine was generally poured out of the cup, before the liquor began to circulate, to show the gratitude of the guests to the gods for the blessings they enjoyed.

Libations were likewise in use amongst the Hebrews, who poured out a kind of wine on the victim after it was killed; and the several pieces of the sacrifice were laid “pon the altar, ready to be consumed in the flames.
