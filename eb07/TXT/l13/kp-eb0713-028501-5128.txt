LIBITINA, in the Roman mythology, the goddess who presided over funerals. This goddess was the same with the Venus Infera or Epithymbia of the Greeks. She had a temple at Rome, where a certain piece of money was lodged for every person who died, and whose name was recorded in a register called Libitinoe Patio. This practice was established by Servius Tullius, to obtain an account of the annual number of deaths in the city of Rome, and consequently the rate of increase or decrease of its inhabitants.
