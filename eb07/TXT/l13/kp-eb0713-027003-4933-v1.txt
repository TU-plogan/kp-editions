LIBERALIA, feasts celebrated by the ancient Romans, in honour of Liber or Bacchus, and the same with those which the Greeks called Dionysiaca. They derived their name from liber, free, a title conferred on Bacchus in memory of the liberty or freedom which he granted to the people of Boeotia; or, perhaps, because wine, of which he was the reputed deity, delivers men from care, and sets their minds at ease and freedom. Varro derives the name of this feast from liber, free, because the priests were free from their function, and eased of all care, during the time of the liberalia ; as the old women officiated in the ceremonies and sacrifices of these feasts.
