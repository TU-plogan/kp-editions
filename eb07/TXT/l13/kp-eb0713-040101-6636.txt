LIVONIA, a province or stadtholderate in European Russia. A part of Esthonia is now included in it, viz. Dorpat and the island of Oesel. It extends over 20,636 square miles, between 56.34. and 59. 3. north latitude, and 23. 29. and 27.32. east longitude. Though a great part of the province is sandy, and contains much woody, swampy, and heathy land, yet there are many portions of good soil, very productive in corn, hemp, and flax, which form the principal exports from Riga, and the several small ports along the shore of the Baltic. The inhabitants are about 800,000, the greater part of whom are of German origin, amongst whom the ancient tribes, the Letts and the Esthonians, are much mingled, though their original language has nearly disappeared. About two thirds of the population adhere to the Lutheran religion; the rest are Greeks, Catholics, or Jews. The trade is extensive in the export of native products; and in some seasons the quantity of corn grown beyond that consumed causes a brisk trade in grain, as well as in the spirits distilled from it, and pays for the salt, iron, lead, wine, and articles of luxury which the country does not yield.
