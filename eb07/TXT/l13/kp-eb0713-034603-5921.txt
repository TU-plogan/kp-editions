LIMA, a department of the republic of Peru, in South America, bounded on the north by Truxillo, on the east by Junin and Ayacucho, on the south by Arequipa, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The Cordillera of the Andes ranges along its eastern side. The climate is considered as fine; and although the atmosphere is cloudy and humid, it seldom rains throughout the whole year. The heat is excessive along the coast; but as the country becomes more elevated towards the interior, the air becomes purer and more temperate. Earthquakes are frequent, from six to twelve occurring annually; and these convulsions of nature on a large scale seem to observe a periodical return at intervals of fifty years. It is watered by several streams, but none of any considerable size, the largest being the river Rimae, which, during the summer months, is much swollen by torrents from the Andes. The soil is good, and agricultural pursuits are followed to a considerable extent. The chief wealth of the country 7 , however, consists in the produce of the mines, which are worked by proprietors in Lima. Next to Lima in importance is the sea-port of Callao, situated in the bay of that name, and containing a population of about 8000. The port is defended by three castles, which are surrounded with thick walls, a moat, and batteries of great strength. It is connected with the city of Lima by a straight road, about six indes in length. It was entirely destroyed by an earthquake in 1746, when upwards of 3000 of the inhabitants are said to have perished, and nineteen ships sunk in the harbour. Trade has lately much increased, and the town has greatly improved. Its appearance, however, is mean and unfavourable.

Lima, a city in the department of that name, and capital of the republic of Peru, is situated in a spacious plain, on the southern bank of the river Rimae, about ten miles from the sea. Long. 76. 56. 45. W . Lat. 12. 3. S. The population, according to the latest accounts, is 40,000 inhabitants. It was founded in 1553 by Pizarro, who called it La Ciudad de les Reyes, or City of Kings; but the name has been since changed to Lima, a corruption of Rimae. The city is built in an amphitheatre formed by sierras of the great chain of the Andes, which shelter it from the northerly [7:13:347]and easterly winds. The figure of the city is nearly semicircular, the river being the diameter, and is two miles long from east to west, and one and a quarter in breadth. It consists of 157 squares, and 355 streets, built at right angles, and about twenty-five feet wide. The streets are well paved, and furnished with streams of water, which are arched over, and rendered subservient to cleanliness and other conveniences. It stands nearly 700 feet above the level of the sea, and, when seen from Callao roads, presents a beautiful appearance, owing to its numerous domes and spires rising from so elevated a situation. The entrance is by a fine avenue Or public walk called the Almeda, i at the termination of which are the ruins of a handsome gate. It is surrounded by a brick wall, flanked with thirty-four bastions, but without embrasures. At the south-eastern extremity of the city is a small citadel, called Santa Catalina; and on the right side of the river, connected with the city by a bridge, is the suburb of San Lazarro, which is inhabited by the lower classes. The city having suffered much from earthquakes, the houses are generally built of one story, the walls being composed of mud and cut straw, formed into bricks by the heat of the sun, and strengthened by pieces of timber. The houses of the wealthy inhabitants, built in a Moorish style, generally consist of a square pile, two stories in height, enclosing a quadrangular court, which is surrounded with piazzas, and sometimes contains a second, or even third inner court. The Plaza, or great square, in the centre of the city, is surrounded partly with shops and private houses, and partly with public buildings. On the eastern side is the cathedral, to the north of which is the principal parish church, adorned with a beautiful façade, and adjoining it is the archiepiscopal palace, part of which is now occupied by the Peruvian synod. On the north side are the viceroy’s palace and the city hall, under which is the city jail. In the centre of the square is a fine brass fountain, erected in 1653, the water of which being the best in Lima, is conveyed to all parts of the city. In this square the principal market is held. The cathedral is a noble edifice, and at each corner is a tower, nearly 200 feet in height. The interior is very rich, and the high altar has a magnificent appearance. The roofs of the houses, and domes and spires of the churches, are built of wood, covered with stucco-work, variously ornamented, which presents a splendid appearance when viewed from a distance; but the traveller is apt to feel disappointed upon a nearer inspection. Formerly the number of monks was reckoned at 1200, but they have now decreased nearly one fifth in amount. There are fourteen convents for females, and a number of religious houses, into which ladies retire for a short period. Some of the conventual churches are remarkably beautiful; that of St Domingo having a tower about 180 feet high, which is the loftiest in the city. There are several hospitals of a charitable and benevolent description. The university, founded in 1549, and possessing peculiar privileges, is a handsome building, with several good halls, and an extensive library.

The higher classes of the inhabitants are generally well educated, though in a limited sense; and the females are equally celebrated for their vivacity and beauty. They are said, however, to be somewhat licentious in their manners; and their walking-dress, consisting of a petticot fitted close to the body, and a hood thrown over the head, seems peculiarly favourable to intrigue. Both sexes are addicted to smoking; but the females do not practise it openly. All classes of the inhabitants are extravaganten their dress, the richest stuffs of Europe being used even on ordinary occasions. Music, cards, and dancing, are the principal sources of amusement; bull-fights having been abolished. Gambling formerly prevailed in the higher circles; but this vice has of late sensibly diminished. The

Spaniards of Lima are at present almost all creoles; the European Spaniards having quitted the country at the period of the revolution. There were formerly 15,000 slaves; but slavery was abolished in 1828 by the new constitution. Lima has been repeatedly laid in ruins by earthquakes, the most destructive of which were those of 1678 and 1746, when, out of 3000 houses, not more than twenty were left standing. In 1822 and 1828 also very destructive earthquakes occurred. The political events which have occurred in Lima will be fully detailed under the article Peru.
