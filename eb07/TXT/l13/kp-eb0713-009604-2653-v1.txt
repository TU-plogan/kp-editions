LAOMEDON, a king of Troy, whose history is involved in fables. He was son of Ilus king of Troy, and married Strymo, called by some Placia, or Leucippe, by whom he had Podarces, afterwards known by the name of Priam, and Hesione. He built the walls of Troy, and was assisted by Apollo and Neptune, whom Jupiter had banished from heaven, and condemned to be subservient to the will of Laomedon for one year. When the walls were finished, Laomedon refused to reward the labours of the gods, and soon afterwards his territories were laid waste by the sea or Neptune, whilst his subjects were visited by a pestilence sent by Apollo. Sacrifices were offered to the offended divinities; but the calamities of the Trojans increased, and nothing could appease the gods, according to the words of the oraclc, but annually to expose to a sea monster a Trojan virgin. Whenever the monster appeared, the marriageable maidens were assembled, and the lot decided which of them was doomed to death for the good of her country. λVhen this calamity had continued for five or six years, the lot fell upon Hesione, Laomedon’s daughter. The king was unwilling to part with his daughter, whom he loved with uncommon tenderness, yet conscious that his refusal would greatly irritate the wrath of the gods. In the midst of his fear and hesitation, Hercules came and offered to deliver the Trojans from this public calamity, if Laomedon would promise to reward him with a number of fine horses. The king consented; but when the monster was destroyed, he refused to fulfil his engagements, and Hercules was obliged to besiege Troy and take it by force of arms. Laomedon was put to death, after a reign of twenty-nine years; his daughter Hesionc was given in marriage to Telamon, one of the conqueror’s attendants; and Podarces was ransomed to the Trojans, and placed upon his father’s throne. According to Hyginus, the wrath of Neptune and Apollo was kindled against Laomcdon because he had refused to offer as a sacrifice on their altars all the first-born of his cattle, according to a vow which he had made.
