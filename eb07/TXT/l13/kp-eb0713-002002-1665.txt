LAIBACH, or Laybach, one of the governments into which the Illyrian province of Austria is divided. It extends over 8394 square miles, and contains twenty-five cities, forty-two market-towns, and 5947 villages and hamlets, with 611,730 inhabitants. It is for the most part mountainous, except in the centre, where it is level and fertile. Its chief products are corn, fruit, wine, wood, iron, copper, and marble. The capital is a city of the same name, situated on the river from which that name is derived. It is well built, but antique, and contains a cathedral, with ten other catholic churches, two hospitals, 980houses, and about 10,000 inhabitants. Above the town, on a hill on which it is built, is a strong fortress, at present appropriated to the confinement of criminals. There is a collegiate establishment, with a rector and twenty-one professors, who superintend the instruction of students in theology, philosophy, law, and medicine, and confer degrees in each of these faculties. There are manufactures of silk, of ribbons, of china-ware, of leather, and of various chemical productions; and an extensive trade is carried on with Italy, with Bavaria, and with Croatia.
