LEYTA, one of the southernmost of the Philippines, ninety-five miles in length by thirty-eight in breadth. The soil is fertile, and the mountains abound in deer, wild hogs, and fowls. The air is pure, healthy, and temperate. A chain of mountains runs through the island in a direction north-west and south-east; and so materially do they influence the climate, that the seasons are entirely different on opposite sides of the mountains. The inhabitants amount to 9000, who pay a tribute in wax, rice, or cloth. Long. 124. 40. E. Lat. 10. 50. N.
