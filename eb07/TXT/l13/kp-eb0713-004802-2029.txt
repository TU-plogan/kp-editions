LAMPEDUSA, an island of the Mediterranean Sea, belonging to the kingdom of Naples. It stretches from cast to west, and is thirteen miles and a half in circumference, with a level surface, except to the south-east, where it shelves from a height of 400 feet to a low shore, indented, or rather serrated, with many caves, of which the largest is called the harbour; and the island is entitled to notice, because it was proposed to retain this port at the time Bonaparte disputed our demand to retain possession of,Malta after the peace of Amiens. It has few inhabitants, though an attempt was made to establish a colony during the late war, which has since been abandoned. The chief products are fire-wood and fish. It is ten miles from Tripoli, and seventy-five from Malta. The castle at the harbour is in longitude 12. 35. 10. east, and in latitude 35. 29. 19. north.
