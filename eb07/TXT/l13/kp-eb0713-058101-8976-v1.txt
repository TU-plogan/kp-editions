LOXA, a province of Colombia, in the department of Azuay, bounded on the north by Guayaquil, on the east by Jaen, on the south by Yaguarsongo, and on the west by Zamora. It is situated on an elevated and healthy situation, fertile in all kinds of grain, It affords the finest cinchona, and was long supposed to be the only place which produced that medicament in any degree of perfection. £ochineal is also found in considerable abundance. Its principal commerce consists in woven stuffs of cotton, wool, and carpet, which are held in high estimation. It possesses also two or three gold mines, which are worked. Its chief town is Loxa, situated in a beautiful and extensive valley, between two streams, which flow from the Andes. It was formerly a place of considerable importance, though now much decayed, and still contains several convents. Long. 79. 15. W. Lat. 3. 59. S.
