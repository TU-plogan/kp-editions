LIEVENS, John or Jan, a celebrated painter, was born at Leyden in 1607. He discovered an early inclination for the arts, and was the disciple, first of Joris van Schooten, and afterwards of Peter Lastman. He excelled principally in painting portraits, but he also executed several historical subjects with great success. He came over to England, where he resided three years, and painted the portraits of Charles I., the queen, the prince of Wales, and several of the nobility; after which he returned to Antwerp, where he met with full employment for his pencil. We have several etchings by this master, which are performed in a slight but masterly manner. The chiaro scuro is very skilfully managed in them, so as to produce a most powerful effect. His style of etching bears some resemblance to that of Rembrandt; but it is in general coarser, and less finished.
