L, A SEMI-VOWEL, or liquid, forming the eleventh letter of the alphabet. It is derived from the old Hebrew lamed, or Greek lambda Î». It is sounded by intercepting the breath between the tip of the tongue and the fore part of the palate, with the mouth open, and makes a sweet sound, with something of an aspiration; hence the Britons and Spaniards usually doubled it, or added an h to it, in the beginning of words, as in llan, or lhan, a temple, sounding nearly like fl. In English words of one syllable it is doubled at the end, as tell, bell, knell ; but in words of more syllables than one it is single at the end, as evil, general, constitutional. It is placed after most of the consonants in the beginning of words and syllables, as black, glare, adle, eagle, but before none. Its sound is clear in Abel, but obscure in able, and the like.

As a numeral letter, L denotes 50; and with a dash over it, thus, L, 5000. Used as an abbreviation, this letter stands for Lucius; whilst L. L. S. represents a sesterce. (See Sesterce.) LA is the syllable by which Guido denotes the last sound of each hexachord. If it begins in C, it answers to our A; if in G, to E; and if in F, to D.
