LISMORE, one of the Hebrides, or Western Islands of Scotland, belonging to Argyleshire, situated at the mouth of Loch Linnhe, about nine miles in length, and from one to two in breadth. The surface is hilly and uneven; but the soil is fertile, and yields a sufficient quantity of grain for the support of the inhabitants; oats, barley, potatoes, and flax being the articles of crop generally cultivated. The whole island lies upon a rock of limestone, which article is exported in considerable quantities. In the lakes there are strata of marl found varying from ten to sixteen feet in depth. It was anciently the residence of the bishops of Argyle, and contained, Until very recently, a Roιhan Catholic college for the education of the clergy of that persuasion in this part of the country. The ruins of an old castle are still to be seen, and in several places vestiges of fortified camps. The population amounted in 1831 to 1790.

Lismore, a town of Ireland, in the county of Waterford, situated on the southern bank of the Blackwater, about twenty-six miles north-east of Cork. It was formerly a considerable city, being the see of a bishop, but has been often destroyed by fire, and is now a small, mean place. It possesses a small cathedral, and a castle situated on the verge of a rock which rises perpendicularly over the river. It has no manufacture of any kind, the inhabitants being principally engaged in agricultural pursuits.
