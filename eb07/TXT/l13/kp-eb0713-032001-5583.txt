LIEFKENSHOEK, a strong fortress of the Netherlands, in the province of East Flanders. It stands on the left bank of the Scheldt, opposite Lillo, and with it forms the chief defence of that river. It has four bastions, two ravelins, a ditch, and counterscarp, with only one gate towards the water; and the whole country on the land side can be laid under water when the defence requires it.
