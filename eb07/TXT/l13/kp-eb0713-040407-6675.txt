LOCHABER, a district of Inverness-shire, in Scotland. It is bounded by Moidart on the west, Glengary on the north, Badenoch on the east, and Lorn on the south. It derives its name from the lake or loch of Aber; and extends about twenty miles from east to west, and thirty from north to south. The country is barren, bleak, mountainous, and rugged. See Inverness-shire.
