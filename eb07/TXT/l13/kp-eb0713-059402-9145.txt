LUGO, a city of Spain, in the province of Galicia, on the river Tuy, which runs to the Mino. In this place there are some manufactories of linen and stockings, and some tanneries. Near it is the mountain village of Cerbrero, whose fields are covered with snow four months in the year, but whose pasture in summer is excellent, and produces cheese, which is highly esteemed throughout Spain. At this place the army under Sir John Moore, in his celebrated retreat, having suffered the greatest hardships from the severity of the climate, the haste of their march, and the want of the requisite refreshments, offered battle to the enemy, which, however, was declined.
