LANARK, the head burgh of the county of that name, is situated on an eminence half a mile from the Clyde, on its northern bank, at the distance of thirty-two miles west from Edinburgh, and twenty-five miles south-east from Glasgow. The derivation of the name has been the subject of much dispute, and is still involved in doubt. Lanark is one of the most ancient towns in Scotland. It appears to have been of considerable importance as early as the tenth century; for the first parliament ever held in Scotland was assembled here by Kenneth II. in 978; and at the royal castle of Lanark, the charter of William the Lion in favour of the town of Ayr was dated, in 1197. It was also the scene of the first military exploit of Sir William Wallace, who there slew the English governor for his cruelty and oppression, and in the neighbouring rocky fastnesses raised the standard of deliverance.

Lanark was originally erected into a royal burgh by Alexander I. There were several subsequent charters granted by other kings; but the last onc, confirmatory of all the rest, was given by Charles I. in 1632.

Till the beginning of the present century, Lanark presented a mean and deserted appearance, and was said to be a “finished town but the rapid increase of the cotton manufacture at Glasgow, of the benefit of which Lanark reflectively enjoys a portion, has done much in reviving a spirit of improvement. The old houses are being rapidly modernised, and many new houses have been added. A branch of the Commercial Bank has been established, and a handsome house erected for the accommodation of their agent. A new jail and splendid county buildings have been erected, reading-rooms instituted, and many other indications of growing prosperity and wealth are manifested in a marked manner.

The staple occupation, previously to the introduction of the cotton manufacture, was the making of shoes and stockings; but latterly these manufactures have been mostly limited to the consumption of the district. About 700 persons are engaged in weaving, and about 100 in shoemaking.

Lanark, along with Hamilton, Airdrie, and Falkirk, sends one representative to parliament. The municipal government is vested in a provost, two bailies, and fourteen councillors.

The population of the burgh in 1794 was 2000, in 1831 it was 4266, and it must have increased considerably since that period. The population of the parish in 1831 was 7672.

Lanark, New, a manufacturing village, the most extensive for spinning cotton in Scotland. It is situated on the northern bank of the Clyde, a little below the celebrated falls, and about a mile distant from the town of Lanark. It was erected about the year 1785, by Mr David Dale, an enterprising and benevolent individual.

New Lanark afterwards came into the possession of Mr Robert Owen, son-in-law of its founder, who, by his exertions in the cause of education, brought the establishment into great notoriety. Mr Owen, in the prosecution of the grand object of his life, was, fortunately for his reputation as a philanthropist, early led to perceive the benefits to be derived from receiving infants into his educational institution; and thus originated that system which subsequently attracted so much attention. Messrs Walker and Company, the present proprietors, continue the infant school, and give gratis instruction to the more advanced children belonging to the village, in all the more useful branches of education; and the regulation adopted by Mr Owen, that no child under ten years of age, and who cannot read and write, and understand accounts, shall be received into the work, continues to be strictly enforced.

About fifteen years ago one of the mills was burned down; but in 1835 the proprietors rebuilt it on a greatly enlarged scale, and, it is said, are about to fit it up as a power-loom weaving factory. A gas-work has also been completed, on a scale sufficiently adequate to light up both the works and the village.

The population of New Lanark, about ten years ago, was 2260; but, according to the returns of 1831, the number was then reduced to 1901. It is now (1836) farther reduced to 1850 souls, of whom about 1100 are employed in the works. Owing to the improvements in machinery, more work is now performed by these than was done by 1500 or 1600, the number employed at the period of its greatest population. Besides, it is worthy of remark, as a greater triumph of machinery, that in the change thus effected, the number of men required has been greatly reduced, and their places occupied by women and boys.

The people of New Lanark are better informed, and their moral character and general deportment rank higher, than usually obtains amongst those of their class.

The situation of the village is low, but the cleanliness of its spacious and well-ventilated streets gives an idea of comfort exceedingly gratifying to the stranger, and must be highly conducive to health.
