LUZON, Lucon, or Luconia, one of the Philippine islands, and the largest of the whole group, situated between the thirteenth and nineteenth degrees of north latitude, and extending from the 120th to the 124th degrees of east longitude. It is 400 miles in length, by 115 in average breadth. The greater part of this island is mountainous, being intersected in its whole length from north to south by an elevated chain, from which diverge various ramifications and detached mountains of a conical figure, in the midst of extensive plains. The soil is remarkably fertile, and the climate for the most part moist; but it is temperate, considering the situation of the island within the tropics. It yields cotton, indigo, sugar, tobacco, and generally all sorts of tropical produce, the richest fruits of the West as well as of the East Indies, and, with ordinary industry, would rival the Moluccas in the production of spices and precious aromatics. In the mountains are found wild cinnamon, nutmegs, ebony, sandal wood, together with excellent timber for building and shipping. Gold is washed down from the higher grounds, and is found among the sands and mud of its rivers, brooks, and lakes. Civet cats are common, and ambergris is thrown on the coast in prodigious quantities. There are several volcanoes on the island, and many warm springs and small lakes, indicating an internal combustion, from which probably originate the earthquakes to which the island is subject. In 1650 one of these earthquakes overturned almost all the city of Manilla; and in 1754 another took place, which was attended with the most destructive effects. The coast is indented by many bays and commodious harbours; that of Manilla is the finest in the world, and is the only one frequented by ships of burden. The Spaniards on their arrival found upon the coast a nation of Moors, who called themselves Tagalians, and were Malayans by descent. They are for the most part a quiet and tractable people. After their conquest by the Spaniards they were most cruelly oppressed by monopolies and other tyrannical restraints; the population of the country was diminished, agriculture discouraged, and the inhabitants, destitute of any motive to energy, have sunk into indolence. Manilla is the capital. The population is estimated at 900,000, though nothing certain is known on this subject.
