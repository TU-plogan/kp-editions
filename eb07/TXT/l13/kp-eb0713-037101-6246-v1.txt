LIPPE-DETMOLD, a principality in the north-west of Germany. It is bounded on the north by the Prussian Westphalian province, on the north-east by Schauenburg, on the east by Hanover and Waldeck, and on the southeast, south, and west by the Prussian provinces. It is 453 square miles in extent, and comprehends six walled towns, five market-towns, and 145 villages, with 71,450 inhabitants. It is a hilly and woody district, between the Rhine and the Weser. On the slope of the hills there is some good wheat and rye land, but the whole principality produces barely corn sufficient for the consumption, and the cultivation of potatoes has been of late years extended in a degree commensurate with the increase of the population. The only articles for exportation furnished by the state are wood, which passes down the Weser to Bremen; flax and linen yarn, which is sold to the makers of linen in Lemgo, Bielfield, and other parts of Westphalia; and woo], which passes by Bremen to England or Holland. There are no mines, but there is a saline spring at Salzuflen, from which 35,000 bushels of culinary salt are prepared. The income of the state is about L.48,000 yearly, of which L.30,000 is derived from the princely domains and royalties. There was a national debt till lately, but it is nearly discharged by a sinking fund. The military force consists of a battalion of infantry, containing 300 men; besides which there is a militia, in which every man is liable to serve. The principality is divided into twelve bailiwicks. The capital is the city of Detmold, containing 2500 inhabitants.
