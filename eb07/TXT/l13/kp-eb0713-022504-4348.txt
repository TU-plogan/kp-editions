LEMBERG, a circle in the Austrian province of Gallicia, extending over 1090 square miles. It comprehends four cities, two market-towns, and 167 villages, with 18,551 houses, inhabited by 140,468 individuals, of whom 18,550 are Jews. The capital of the circle, as of the province, is a city of the same name, but recently has assumed the name of Lopoldstadt. It is situated on the river Peltew, which runs into the Vistula. It is surrounded with gentle elevations, in a fertile district, and, though antique, is well built, especially in the suburbs. It contains a Catholic, an Arminian, and a Greek cathedral, with eleven other churches, nine monasteries, and a Lutheran chapel. There are, in 2515 houses, 41,490 inhabitants. It is a place of considerable trade, which is chiefly in the hands of the Jews. There are some manufactures of linen and woollen cloth, of ribbons, turnery ware, and musical instruments; but the trade rather arises from its being the seat of government, than from any productions of internal creation. There is a university with no less than twenty-six professors, and an academy with six teachers. There is also a public library, much increased of late years. It is in long. 24. 3. 20. Ä½. and lat. 49. 51. 42. N.
