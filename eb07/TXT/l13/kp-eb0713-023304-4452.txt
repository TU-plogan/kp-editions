LESKARD, a market and borough town of Cornwall, in the hundred of West, 237 miles from London. It was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, and is governed by a mayor, recorder, and twelve capital burgesses. Upon the hills to the north are many tin mines at work, and the country surrounding feeds many sheep, so that the chief trade consists of tin and wool. The population of the town amounted in 1801 to 1860, in 1811 to 1975, in 1821 to 2423, and in 1831 to 2853; but the whole parish at the last census contained 4042 inhabitants.
