LIMITED Problem denotes a problem that has but one solution, or some determinate number of solutions; as to describe a circle through three given points that do not lie in a right line, which is limited to one solution only; to divide a parallelogram into two equal parts by a line parallel to one side, which admits of two solutions, according as the line is parallel to the length or breadth of the parallelogram; or to divide a triangle in any ratio by a line parallel to one side, which is limited to three solutions, as the line may be parallel to any of the three sides.
