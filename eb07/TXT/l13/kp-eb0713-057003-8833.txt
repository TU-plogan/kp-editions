LOUIS, or St Louis, Knights of, the name of a military order in France, instituted by Louis XIV. in 1693. Their colours were of a flame colour, and passed from left to right; the king was their grand master. There were in the order eight great crosses, and twenty·four commanders; but the number of knights was not limited. At the time of their institution, the king charged his revenue with a fund of 900,000 livres for defraying the pensions of the commanders and knights.

Louis d’Or, a French coin, first struck in the year 1640, under the reign of Louis XIII. See the article Money. By the French mint regulations it was at length made equal to twenty-four livres, or L.l sterling. This, however, was underrating it in respect of silver; and hence, as every one preferred paying his debts in the overvalued coin, silver became the principal currency of France, the gold coins being either sent to the melting-pot, or exported. In Britain the process was reversed. Gold having, for a long period, been overvalued by our mint in respect of silver, it became the principal currency of the country.
