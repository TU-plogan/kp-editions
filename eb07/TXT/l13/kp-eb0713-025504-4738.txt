LEUCOTHOE, or Leucothea, in fabulous history, the wife of Athamas, who was changed into a sea deity. She was the Matuta of the Romans, and had a temple at Rome, where all the people, particularly women, offered vows for their brothersâ€™ children. They did not entreat the deity to protect their own children, because Ino had been unfortunate in hers. No female slaves were permitted to enter the temple; or if curiosity tempted them to transgress this rule, they were beaten with the greatest severity.
