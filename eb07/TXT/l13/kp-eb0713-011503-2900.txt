LARGO, Upper and Nether, is the name of two small villages of Fifeshire, situated near the shore of the Frith of Forth. The former is a very agreeable place, about a mile from the sea, on the road between Leven and Anstruther. It has a parish church, an ancient Gothic fabric, with a spire rising from the middle. Nether Largo is an extensive fishing village, much resorted to as summer quarters. This was the birth-place of Alexander Selkirk, the accredited prototype of the fictitious Robinson Crusoe. The weaving of linen is a source of emolument both here and at Upper Largo.
