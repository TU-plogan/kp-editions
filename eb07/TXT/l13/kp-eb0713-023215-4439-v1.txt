LERWICK, the principal, and, indeed, with the exception of Scalloway, a village containing a few scattered cottages, the only town in the Zetland Islands. It is situated [7:13:233] on the east side of Mainland, the largest island of the group, in latitude 60. north, and longitude 1. west. It consists of one irregular, ill-paved street, with several lanes branching off. The town is of comparatively modern date. Captain Smith, who visited the islands in 1633, describes the harbour, but makes no allusion to any town, which he would have done had it then existed. In 1700, Brand speaks of it as containing between two and three hundred families. A century afterward^, it is described as having a population of about 1000. By the census of 1821 the inhabitants amounted to 2224, and by that of 1831 to 2750. The only public buildings are, the town-house, which unites under one roof the court-room, the prison, the custom-house, and masonic lodge; the parish church; and a dissenting meeting-house. To the south of the town stands Fort-Charlotte, a citadel, first erected during the protectorate, and rebuilt by the second Charles in 1665; but having been burned in 1673 by the Dutch, it lay in ruins till 1781, when it was re-modelled, mounted with twelve guns, and named after the queen of George HI. The harbour of Lerwick, called Bressa Sound, is large and most secure, the depth of water varying from five to sixteen fathoms. Two thousand busses from Holland, it is asserted, have found accommodation in it during the fishing season; and Sir Robert Sibbald says that, in 1653, the English fleet, consisting of ninety-four men of war, lay some days in the harbour, and that in 1665, another fleet, to the number of ninety-two sail, were there for some time. The only manufactory in Lerwick is one of straw-plait; still there is a considerable trade carried on with Leith and other towns. The exports are chiefly fish, butter, hides, tallow, calf and rabbit skins, stockings, and, till lately, kelp; the imports are, coals, cloths, groceries, and grain, Zetland not producing a sufficient quantity of the last for the consumption of the inhabitants. Few strangers have visited Lerwick without being delighted with the kindness and hospitality of the inhabitants; and all agree in praising the morals and intelligence of the common people. From the statistical returns made to the General Assembly in 1833, by the committee for increasing the means of education and religious instruction in Scotland, it appears that in the parish of Lerwick, containing a population of 3194 (viz. 2750 in the town, and 444 in the landward part of the parish), there are six schools, the parochial, and five on the teachers’ own adventure; 201 scholars, of whom sixty-five attend the parochial, and 136 the other schools; and that, of the whole number of scholars, sixty-one are learning Latin, and twenty-five mathematics. The same document states, that all the inhabitants above six years of age are able to read; but this statement must be received with some grains of allowance.
