LAMEGO, a city of Portugal, in the province of Beyra. It is situated on the south side of the river Douro. The country which surrounds it yields the best port wine, and in large quantities. As the roads in Portugal are generally bad, the mercantile company of the higher Douro have in some measure obviated the evil by constructing a good road from Lamego to Oporto. The wines are now brought with less inconvenience than formerly, and are less subject to impure mixture than when they were transmitted by the internal voyage on the river. Lamego is a bishopâ€™s see, and has a splendid cathedral, library, vineyards, and a fair. It has one ruined castle, one parish church, four monasteries, one hospital, one alms-house, 1648 houses, and 6592 inhabitants.
