LEUCOPET RIANS, 'rn Ecclesiastical History, the name of a fanatical sect which sprang up in the Greek and eastern churches towards the close of the twelfth century. The fanatics of this denomination professed to believe in a double trinity; rejected wedlock; abstained from flesh; treat- -ed with the utmost contempt the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s supper, with all the various branches of external worship; placed the essence of religion in internal prayer alone; and maintained that an evil being or genius dwelt in the breast of every mortal, and could be expelled thence by no other method than by perpetual supplication to the Supreme Being. The founder of. this sect of enthusiasts is said to have been a person called Leucopetrus, and his chief disciple Tychicus, who corrupted, by fanatical interpretations, several books of Scripture, particularly St Matthew’s Gospel.
