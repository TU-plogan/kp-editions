LAVENHAM, a town of the hundred of Baberg, in the county of Suffolk, sixty-two miles from London. It is governed by a corporation of six capital burgesses, chosen for life. It had once a cloth manufactory, which has disappeared, and now only carries on some trade in hempen goods. The population amounted in 1801 to 1776, in 1811 to 1711, in 1821 to 1898, and in 1831 to 2107.
