LENGTHENING, in ship-building, the operation of cutting a ship down across the middle, and adding a certain portion to her length. It is performed by sawing her planks asunder in different places of her length, on each side of the midship frame, to prevent her from being too much weakened in one place. The two ends are then drawn apart to it limited distance, which must be equal to the proposed addition of length. An intermediate piece of timber is next added to the keel, upon which a sufficient number of timbers are erected to fill up the vacancy produced by the separation. The two parts of the kelson are afterwards united by an additional piece, which is scored down upon the floor timbers, and as many beams as may be necessary are fixed across the ship in the new interval, finally, the planks of the side are prolonged so as to unite ŵ'ith each other, and those of the ceiling are refitted in the ⅛ame manner, by which the whole process is completed.
