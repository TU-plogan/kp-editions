LITHOSTROTON, amongst the Romans, was a pavement of mosaic work, consisting of small pieces of cut marble of different kinds and colours, and first used in the time of Sylla, who caused one to be formed at Praeneste, in the temple of Fortune, and afterwards in private houses. They were brought to such perfection, that they exhibited representations of nature with all the accuracy of the finest painting.
