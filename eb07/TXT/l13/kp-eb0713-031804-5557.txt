LIBYA, in general, a term which, according to the Greeks, denoted Africa. It was derived from Lub, thirst, being a dry and thirsty country. See Africa. Libya, in a more limited sense, was the middle part of Africa, extending north and west, between the Mediterranean to the north, and Ethiopia to the east. It was divided into the Hither or Exterior Libya, and the Farther or Interior. The former lay between the Mediterranean on the north, and the Farther Libya and Ethiopia beyond Egypt on the south. The Farther or Interior Libya was a vast country, situated between the Hither Libya on the north, the Atlantic Ocean on the west, the Ethiopic on the south, and Aethiopia beyond Egypt on the east.

Libya, in a still more confined sense, called Libya Propria, was a northern district of Africa, and part of the Hither Libya, situated between Egypt on the east, the Mediterranean on the north, the Syrtis Major and the Pcgio Tripolitana to the west, the Garamantes and Aethiopia beyond Egypt to the south. This Libya was again subdivided into Libya taken in the strictest sense of all, and into Marmarica and Cyrenaica. Libya in the strictest sense was the most eastern portion of Libya Propria, next to Egypt, with Marmarica on the west, the Mediterranean on the north, and the Nubi, now called Nubia, to the south.
