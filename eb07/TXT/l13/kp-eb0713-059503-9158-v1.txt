LUNEBURG, one of the provinces of the present king- <⅛n of Hanover. It was formerly the duchy of that name, epcted by the emperor of Germany, in the year 1235, and »length came to the Hanoverian branch of the family of Înswick. It extends along the left bank of the river Elbe, by which it is divided from the Prussian and the ιish dominions. It is 4475 square miles in extent, and onprehends twelve cities, twenty-six market-towns, 184 ≡ishes, in which are 1501 hamlets, 32,944 houses, and aībut 280,000 inhabitants. It is generally a level district, wιh a sandy soil; but near the rivers there is some good å¶ble and pasture land, though the heaths form seven ta ths of the whole province. The principal river is the Ej>e, into which the Ilmenau, the Ohre, and their tributi/ streams, fall; but some of the rivers run to the Wess. The climate, though not unhealthy, is severely cold i⅛winter, and as intensely hot in summer. The chief e∣ployment, besides husbandry, is spinning flax. The caital is the city of the same name, on the Ilmenau, wjch is navigable to the Elbe. It contains four churches, ^orphan-house, two hospitals, and 1898 dwellings, most-Sι a very ancient style, and 10,039 inhabitants. The ce is now in a dilapidated state, and there are few p⅛lic buildings, though there are institutions for educati«. There is but little trade, except in salt made from a pine spring, and in brewing, distilling, and tanning, for tl¢use of the neighbourhood. Long. 10. 19. 32.∙E. Lat. 5⅛15. 7. N.
