LABADISTS, a sect of religionists in the seventeenth century, followers of the opinions of John Labadie. Some of their opinions were, that God could, and did, deceive men; that, in reading the Scriptures, greater attention should be paid to the internal inspiration of the Holy Spirit than to the words of the text; that baptism ought to be deferred until mature age; that the good and the wick-eÎ±[7:13:2] entered equally into the old alliance, provided they descended from Abraham, but that the new admitted only spiritual men; that the observation of Sunday was a matter of indifference; that Christ would come and reign a thousand years upon earth; that the eucharist was only a commemoration of the death of Christ, and that, though the symbols were nothing in themselves, yet that Christ was spiritually received by those who partook of them in a due manner; that a contemplative life was a state of grace and of divine union during this life; that the man whose heart is perfectly content and calm, half enjoys God, has familiar entertainments with him, and sees all things in him; and that this state was to be come at by an entire self-abnegation, by the mortification of the senses and their objects, and by the exercise of mental prayer.
