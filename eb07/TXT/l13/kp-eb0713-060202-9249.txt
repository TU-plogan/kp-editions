LUXEMBURG, a grand duchy of Germany, under the government of the house of Orange Nassau. Before the French revolution, it comprehended the two duchies of Luxemburg and Bouillon; but on being conquered by France, it was divided by that power between the department of the Ardennes and that of the Forests. In consequence of the treaty of 1815 it assumed the present form. It extends in north latitude from 49. 26. to 50. 16. and in east longitude from 5.1. to 6. 29., and contains 2378 square miles. At present it is bounded on the north by the province of Liège in the Netherlands, on the east by the Prussian province of the Lower Rhine, on the south and south-west by the French departments of the Moselle, the Meuse, and the Ardennes, and on the north-west by the Netherland province Namur. It is divided into three circles, and these into twenty-five cantons and 314 communes, with 255,600 inhabitants, who are partly Germans and partly Walloons, and all adhere to the Roman Catholic church. The surface is filled with hills and a few secondary mountains, and many extensive woods and heaths. The most pleasing and fruitful valleys are those in the arrondissement of the capital; the poorest and wildest, in that of Neufchatel. The chief river is the Moselle, which conveys to the Rhine the water of most of the smaller streams. The Ourthe rises in this province, but is an inconsiderable river till it enters France. The agriculture is in a backward state, and produces little corn, and that chiefly rye and winter barley; and though the cultivation of potatoes has been much extended, some importation is necessary to supply food in every year. The breed of horses is considerable, and though they are of small size, they are strong and active, and fit to mount light troops. The sheep are numerous, and the flesh of them of excellent flavour; but the wool is for the most part indifferent, though of late years some flocks have been improved by crosses with the Merino race. Fruit is abundant; a little wine is made, and a good quantity of cider from the apples and pears, from both of which, as well as from corn, much brandy is distilled. The iron mines afford employment to the population when their labours can be spared from the laborious work which their poor soil requires. The produce of the metal is about 10,000 tons yearly, which is mostly sent out of the duchy in a raw state, although the state of the roads is such as to make conveyance very expensive, except when from frost there is no other employment for the horses and men. A large quantity of slates for roofing houses is furnished, and in some parts the marshy spots supply much turf for fuel. The manufacturing industry is almost confined to linen spinning and weaving, and to making paper. The common articles of clothing’and furniture are generally made within each department. The capital is the city of Luxemburg, one of the garrison towns of the German confederation, and commonly occupied by the troops of some of its members, most commonly Prussians. It is one of the most formidable fortresses in the world, both from the nature of its position, and the vast labour which has been applied to strengthen its natural capability of defence. The civil inhabitants are 9500, in 1500 houses, and depend partly on the money spent by the garrison, and partly on manufactures, the principal of which is tanning leather, and making glue, paper, and tobacco. The (river Alzette or Elze runs by the fortifications, and supplies water to the inhabitants. Long. 6. 4. E. Lat. 49. 37. N.

Luxemburg, François Henry de Montmorency, duke of, and marshal of France, a renowned general in the service of Louis XIV. was born in 1628. He was with the Prince of Condé at the battle of Rocroi in 1643; and in 1668 he distinguished himself at the conquest of Franche Compté. In 1672 he commanded in chief the French army in Holland, when he defeated the enemy near Woerden and Bodegrave; and he was universally admired for the fine retreat which he effected in 1673. He became marshal of France in 1675; gained the battle of Fleurs in 1690, that of Steenkirk in 1692, and that of Nerwinde in 1693. He died at Versailles in 1695.
