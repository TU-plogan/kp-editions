LENA, a large river of Asiatic Russia, which rises in the ridge of mountains to the north-west of Lake Baikal, and which flows almost from south-west to north-east, till near Yakoutsk. In this part of its course its tributaries are the Wilime and the Olekma; and, combined with the Obi and the Toungouska, it furnishes an almost continued navigation across Siberia. Soon after passing the Yakoutsk, it receives the Aldane, the largest of its tributaries, by which the navigation is continued nearly to Okhotsk. Turning north-west from this point, and slightly declining to the west, it rolls through vast and uninhabited plains. The Wilhoui is the only other considerable one of its tributaries. It has a broad and deep channel, and it forms numerous islands, both in its course and in the sea at its mouth. The length of its course may be estimated at 2000 miles.
