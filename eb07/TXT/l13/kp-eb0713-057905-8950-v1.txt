LOWER, Richard, an eminent English physician in the seventeenth century, was born in Cornwall, and educated at Westminster school and Oxford. He afterwards studied medicine, and practised under Dr Thomas Willis, whom he instructed in some parts of anatomy, especially when the latter was writing his Cerebri Anatome. In 1674, Lower, along with Dr Willis, discovered the medicinal waters at Ashop, in Northamptonshire, which, upon their recommendation, became very much frequented. In 1666, he followed Dr Willis to London, practised physic under him, and became a fellow of the Royal Society, and also of the College of Physicians. In 1669 he published his Tractatus de Corde; and after the death of Dr Wi∏is in 1675, he was esteemed the most eminent; physician in London. Upon the breaking out of the Popish Plot in 1678, he closed with the Whigs, supposing that that party would carry all before them; but being mistaken, he lost his credit and practice together. Lower died in 1691.
