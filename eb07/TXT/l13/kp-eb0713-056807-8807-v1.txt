LOT, a department of France, formed out of the division of Quercy, in the ancient government of Guienne. It extends in north latitude from 44. 14. to 45. 2. and in east longitude from 0. 52. to 2. 2., being in extent 2156 square miles, or 398,406 hectares. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Corrèze, on the east by Cantal and Aveyron, on the south by Tarn-Garonne, and on the west by Lot-Garonne and Dordogne. It comprises three arrondissements, twenty-nine cantons, and 345 communes, and is peopled by 263,500 persons. It is an undulating district, with hills of moderate height, having between them valleys of great fertility. The soil is generally dry and somewhat rocky, but is covered with a coat of mould, deepest in the valleys, which produces excellent corn, so that the surplus of grain is greater than in any other of the departments of France. The several fruits, especially plums, chestnuts, and walnuts, are raised in great abundance; but the chief fruit is the grape, which is grown extensively on the hills. The wine has great reputation, both from being uninjured by transportation, and by keeping good for a long time. The best grows in the arrondissement of Cahors, whence about 60,000 pipes are sent, some of them to Bordeaux. Much brandy also is made, as well as vinegar, and both enjoy great reputation. The agriculture is well conducted, and, besides corn, affords good crops of pulse, hemp, flax, and saffron. The breed of black cattle is very good, and the flocks of sheep are numerous; the quality of the wool having been much improved of late years by crossing their own with Merinos from Spain. The only mines are some few of iron; but the quarries yield mill-stones, alabaster, marble, limestone, and fullers’ earth, in great abundance. The manufactures are inconsiderable, consisting of woollen and linen cloth, some hardware, paper, and leather. The department elects three deputies to the legislative body. The capital is the city of Cahors.
