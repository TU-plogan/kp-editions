LANGPORT, a market-town of the hundred of Pitney, in the county of Somerset, 131 miles from London. It stands at the junction of the river Ivell with the Paret, which latter is navigable to the port of Bridgewater, and by which coals, iron, and other heavy goods are dispersed over a great tract of country. The market is held on Saturday. It is an ancient borough, governed by a portreeve and bailiffs; but has not returned members to parliament, as it did in ancient times. It is situated in a fertile division of the county. The population amounted in 1801 to 754, in 1811 to 861, in 1821 to 1004, and in 1831 to 1245.
