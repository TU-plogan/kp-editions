LATERE, a term used to denote the qualifications of the cardinals whom the pope sends as legates into foreign countries. They are called “legates a latere," as being his holiness’s assistants and counsellors in ordinary. They are the most considerable of all the legates, being such as the pope commissions to take his place in councils; and they are so called because he never confers this office on any but his favourites and confidants, who are always a latere, at his side. A legate a latere has the power of conferring benefices without a mandate, and of legitimating bastards; and a cross is carried before him as the ensign of his authority.

De Latere, legates who are not cardinals, but yet are intrusted with an apostolic legation.
