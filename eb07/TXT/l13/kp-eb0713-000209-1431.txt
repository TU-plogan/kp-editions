LABORATORY, the chemistâ€™s workhouse, or the place where furnaces are built, vessels kept, and operations performed. In general the term laboratory is applied to any place where physical experiments in pharmacy, chemistry, pyrotechny, and the like, are performed. See Chemistry.

Laboratory, in military affairs, signifies that place [7:13:3]where all sorts of fire-works are prepared, both for actual service and for experiments, viz. quick matches, fuzes, port-fires, grape-shot, case-shot, carcasses, hand-grenades, cartridges, shells filled, and fuzes fixed, wads, &c.
