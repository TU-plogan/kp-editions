LARACHE, or El Arache, a seaport town of the kingdom of Morocco, in Northern Africa, is situated at the mouth of the Luccos, a river which anciently bore the name of Lixus. This town, which formerly belonged to the Spaniards, has some neat buildings; and, though not regularly fortified, possesses a fort and two batteries in good repair. It has been made the imperial arsenal, and is very strong towards the sea. The town contains about four hundred houses, which extend from the banks of the river up the steep declivity of a hill facing the north. It was built, as well as the principal fortifications, by Christians. The streets are paved; there are several mosques, and a deeent bazaar, surrounded with very handsome stone piazzas; but there is a great deficiency of water. The depth and security of the river, which is about half a mile aeross at the ferry, render it the best port which the emperor possesses for his larger vessels; but ships exceeding two hundred tons burden cannot get in, on account of the bar, whieh is continually on the increase. The road is not seeure in winter during the prevalence of southerly and westerly winds, but from April to September inclusive it affords a safe anchorage. The climate is mild, and the same as in Andalusia. Laraehe is situated in long. 6. 1. 30. W. and lat. 35. 13. 15. N.
