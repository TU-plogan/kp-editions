LEANDER, in poetical history, a young man of Abydos, in Asia. He used to swim across the Hellespont by night to visit Hero, his mistress, who set forth a light to guide him; but in a tempestuous winter night he was drowned; upon which Hero seeing him dead on the shore, cast herself headlong from the tower, and perished.
