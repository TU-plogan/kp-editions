LOW -Bell, in birding, a name given to a bell by means of which birds are taken in the night, in open champaign countries, and amongst stubble. The method is to go out about nine o’clock at night in a still evening, when the air is mild and the moon does not shine. The low-bell should be of a deep and hollow sound, and of such a size that a man may conveniently carry it in one hand. The person who carries it makes it toll all the way he goes, as nearly as may be, in the same manner in which the bell on the neck of a sheep tolls as it goes on and feeds. There must also be a box made like a large lanthorn, about a foot square, and lined with tin, but with one side open. Two or three great lights are to be set in this; and the box is to be fixed to the person’s breast, with the open side forwards, so that the light may be cast forward to a great distance. It will spread as it goes out of the box, and distinctly show to the person that carries it whatever there is in the large space of ground over which it extends, and consequently all the birds that roost upon the ground. Two persons must follow him who carries the box and bell, one on each side, so as not to be within the reach of the light to show themselves. Each of these is to have a hand-net, of about three or four feet square, fastened to a long stick or pole; and on whichever side any bird is seen at roost, the person who is nearest is to lay his net over it, and take it with as little noise as possible. When the net is over the bird, the person who laid it is not to be in a hurry to take the bird, but must stay till he who carries the light is got beyond it, that his motions may not be discovered. The blaze of the light and the noise of the bell terrify and amaze the birds in such a manner that they remain still to be taken; but the people who are engaged in the work must keep as quiet and still as may be. Some people are fond of going on this sport alone. The person then fixes the light box to his breast, and carries the bell in one hand and the net in the other; the net in this case may be somewhat smaller, and the handle shorter. When more than one are out at a time, it is always proper to carry a gun, as it is no uncommon thing to spy a hare when on this expedition.
