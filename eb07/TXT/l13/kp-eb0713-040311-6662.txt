LOANGO, a considerable country in that part of the coast of Africa known by the name of Lower or Southern Guinea. Its limits are not accurately known. The country tributary to the king of Loango, however, extends from Cape Lopez to the river Congo, a distance of upwards of 400 miles; but Loango proper occupies only the middle part, being bounded by the town of Malemba on the south, and that of Mayomba on the north. The coast in some parts is high, of a red-coloured soil, and the hills are covered with a luxuriant vegetation; but generally it is composed of a very fine sand carried about by the slightest breeze. Towards the interior the soil is fertile, but little improved by an indolent people. The principal grains cultivated are, the manioc, which is used instead of bread, the maize, a species of pulse, and the potato, which grows to a much larger size and is of a stronger flavour here than in Europe. The palm and several other fruit-trees grow wild in abundance, and a great part of the country is covered with thick grass, which often attains the height of eight or ten feet. Wild animals are found, but generally of the smaller tribes; the Chinese hog, sheep, and goat, are used for domestic purposes. The [7:13:404]climate is in general good. The year is divided into the dry and the rainyseasons, both of nearly equal duration. During the dry season, from April to October, the climate is exceedingly warm, and so entirely free from hurricanes or high winds, that vessels may anchor on any part of the coast with perfect safety. The temperature, however, is cooled by regular light breezes from the south and southeast. Rain occurs very seldom, and is never violent; but heavy dews fall during the night, which are sufficient for the support of vegetable life. In the rainy season the heat of the sun is greater than in the dry, and would be insupportable but for the great rains which fall and refresh the atmosphere. Iron and copper are found in the country, but the natives are not aware of the method of extracting them from the soil. Salt abounds in shallows along the coast, and is also obtained in the interior by boiling and allowing the water to evaporate. Trades and manufactures are entirely neglected, or only exercised as far as is absolutely necessary for the purposes of life. The inhabitants live in a state of great ignorance and superstition, and although several missions have been sent to the country, little or no good has come of them. The males are very indolent; their chief occupation is hunting or fishing; agricultural affairs they deem degrading, and leave to the females to perform. Their houses are built of straw and junk, and roofed with palm leaves bound together with small branches, which forms a covering impenetrable to rain. They are congregated in villages, and surrounded with palm and cocoa-nut trees, which are carefully kept from injury. The government is despotic, and the dignity is transmitted only in the female line. The princess has the right of choosing her husband, who is compelled to accept the honour, and is debarred the privilege of polygamy, enjoyed in an unlimited manner by his subjects. The king is elected by a council of seven, and it is necessary that the choice should fall on a prince of the blood. His authority is constitutionally absolute, but he is obliged to be circumspect in the use of it in the case of chiefs or tributary princes, who are often equal in power with himself. He is assisted in the executive government by several ministers of state, and great part of the judicial authority is exercised by an assembly in the different villages and towns. He is restricted from using any article not the produce of the country. The slave-trade was formerly carried on to a great extent in this country, but is now much diminished. The port of Loango was almost the exclusive theatre of this trade, but other towns on the coast are now equally frequented. From this practice the population is greatly diminished, and now scarcely exceeds 600,000.

Loango, a city, capital of the above kingdom, situated about a league from the sea, in a large and fertile plain. It is about four miles in circuit; but this extent is owing principally to the houses being built in squares, with large spaces between. The streets are long, straight, and kept very clean. The harbour is not deep enough to admit vessels of large tonnage, and its entrance is obstructed by a range of rocks stretching half way across. The coast around the city is recognised by red cliffs, which appear very brilliant when illuminated by the morning rays of the sun. There is some trade here in fine stuffs, manufactured by the inhabitants from leaves. The population is about 15,000. Long. 12. 13. E. Lat. 4. 40. N.
