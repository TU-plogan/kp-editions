LUDLOW, Edmund, son of Sir Henry Ludlow, was tm at Maidenhead, and educated in Trinity College, Cκford. His father being opposed to the king’s interest, Hr Ludlow joined the same party, and was present at the l;ttle of Edgehill as a volunteer under the Earl of Essex, lbon the death of his father, he was∙chosen knight of the sire for Wilts, and obtained the command of a regiment α horse for the defence of that county. He was one of 't⅛ judges of Charles I. and after his death was sent by to parliament into Ireland, in quality of lieutenant-gene-n of the horse, an employment which he discharged with iligence and success until the death of the lord-deputy L’ton, when he acted for some time as general, though v¢hout that title; Cromwell, who knew him to be sin-cyely in the interest of the commonwealth, always findig out some pretext to evade conferring that office upon hn. The last stroke would have been given by Ludlow tithe Irish rebellion, if the usurpation of Cromwell had ñ| prevented it. Under his power he never acted; and t⅛ugh Cromwell used his utmost efforts to gain him, he ≡jained inflexible. After Cromwell’s death, he endeavored to restore the commonwealth; but Charles II. be-in recalled, he thought proper to conceal himself, and es-Ci∣ed into Switzerland, where he settled. After the re-vJution, he came over to England, in order to be employ-éiin Ireland against King James; but having appeared píflicly in London, it gave great offence, and an address W3 presented by Sir Edward Seymour to King William Il praying for a proclamation in order to apprehend Co-Jciel Ludlow, attainted for the murder of King Charles I. l⅜n this he returned to Switzerland, where he died. Tiring his retirement in that country he wrote his Mem∣rs.

*[∣UDOLPH, Job, a learned writer of the seventeenth c∣tury, was born at Erfurt, in Thuringia. He travelled muh, was master of twenty-six languages, visited libraries searched everywhere after natural curiosities and ahquitics, and conversed with learned men of all natius. He published a History of Ethiopia, and other cùöus books.

Wudolph, Henry William, nephew of Job above men-tiaed, was born at Erfurt in 1655. He came to Eng-lãní as secretary to Μ. Lenthe, envoy from the court of Cd∣enhagen to that of London; and being recommended to ’rince George of Denmark, he was received by that price as his secretary. He enjoyed this office for some y⅛s, until he was incapacitated by a violent disorder, whn he was discharged with a handsome pension. After he ιad recovered, he travelled into Muscovy, where he was well received by the czar, and where his knowledge led the ignorant Muscovite priests to believe him a conjuror. On his return to London in 1694, he was cut for the stone; and, as soon as his health would permit, in acknowledgment of the civilities he received in Muscovy, he wrote a grammar of their language, that the natives might learn their own tongue in a regular method. He then travelled into the East, to inform himself of the state of the Christian church in the Levant; the deplorable condition of which induced him, after his return, with the aid of the Bishop of Worcester, to print an edition of the New Testament in the vulgar Greek, in order to present it to the Greek church. In 1709, when such numbers of Palatines came over to England, Mr Ludolph was appointed by Queen Anne one of the commissioners to manage the charities raised for them; and he died early in the following year. His collected works were published in 1712.
