LICOLA, or Lago di Licola, a lake in the kingdom of Naples, anciently famous for excellent fish; but, in the year 1538, an explosion of a volcano changed one part of it into a mountain of ashes, and the other into a morass. It was anciently known by the name of the Lucrine Lake, the oysters of which are highly commended by Horace.
