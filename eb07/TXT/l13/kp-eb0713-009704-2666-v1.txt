LAPIDARY, an artificer who cuts precious stones. The art of cutting precious stones is of great antiquity. The French have carried it to high perfection, but they are not in any degree superior to the British. There are various machines employed in the cutting of precious stones, according to their quality. The diamond, which is extremely hard, is cut on a wheel of soft steel, turned by a mill, [7:13:98] with diamond dust tempered with olive oil, which also serves to polish it. The oriental ruby, sapphire, and topaz, are cut on a copper wheel, with diamond dust tem-pęred with olive oil, and are polished on another copper wheel with tripoli and water. The hyacinth, emerald, amethyst, garnets, agates, and other stones not of an equal degree of hardness with the other, are cut on a leaden wheel with smalt and water, and polished on a tin wheel with tripoli. The turquoise of the old and new rock, girasol, and opal, are cut and polished on a wooden wheel with tripoli also.

Lapidary is also used for a virtuoso skilled in the nature, kinds, and values of precious stones; or a merchant who deals in them.

Lapidary Style denotes the style proper for monumental or other inscriptions. This is a kind of medium between prose and verse; the jejune and the brilliant are here equally to be avoided. Cicero has prescribed the rules of it: Accedat oportet oratio varia, vehemens, plena spiritus. Omnium sententiarum gravitate, omnium verborum ponderibus, est utendum.
