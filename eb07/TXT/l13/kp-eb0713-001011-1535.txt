LAELIUS Sapiens, C., was the son of C. Laelius Nepos, and distinguished by his love of philosophy in an age when war still continued to be regarded as the only employment worthy of a Roman. He was the pupil of Diogenes the stoic, and afterwards of Panaetius. (Cic. Fin. ii. 8.) He was the intimate friend and companion of Scipio Africanus the younger, and attended him in his expedition into Africa when he took Carthage, b. c. 146. (Appian. Pun. 126.) He was then employed as praetor in Lusitania, where he obtained considerable advantages over Viriathus. (Cic. Off. ii. 11.) He was elected consul along with Servilius Caepio (b. c. 140); but notwithstanding the able manner in which he discharged the du [7:13:11]ties of the office, he did not succeed in being re-elected, a circumstance which Cicero laments in most feeling language. (Tusc. V. 19.) Laelius spent much of his time in the country, devoting himself partly to rural occupations, and partly to study. The mildness of his disposition, and the equanimity of his temper, are noticed by Horace, when he speaks of mitis sapientia Loel√º. (Sat. ii. 1.) He was the intimate friend of Pacuvius and Terence; and it is said that he and Scipio assisted the latter in the composition of some of his plays. It was no doubt his friendship with Scipio that induced Cicero to place the name of Laelius at the head of his beautiful essay on Friendship. The interlocutors are Laelius himselfi and his two sons-in law, C. Fannius and Q. Mucius Scaevola.
