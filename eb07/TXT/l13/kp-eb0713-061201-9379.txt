LYONS, or Lyon, an arrondissement of the department of the Rhone, in France, 531 square miles in extent. It comprehends sixteen cantons, which are divided into 128 communes, and contains 225,670 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, built by the Romans before the Christian era, and at present, next to Paris, the most important city in the French dominions. It is on a peninsula formed by the junction of the rivers Saone and Rhone; the quays on whose banks are, the most striking parts of the city, which, though built since the revolutionary destruction of it, has scarcely any erections worthy of much admiration; but some of the numerous bridges over the two rivers are striking objects. The most remarkable buildings are the Saracenic cathedral, the hotel de ville, and the hospital called hotel de Dieu. There is an establishment for education, consisting of a primary and secondary school of great repute, with the finest provincial library in France, consisting of about 120,000 volumes, with which are connected a museum, an observatory, a botanical garden, and a veterinary institution. Abundance of Roman antiquities are to be seen in the city and its vicinity. The population is at present about 140,000 persons, but it includes the commune. The chief occupation is the manufacturing of silk goods, velvets, satins, and all other kinds of the same elegant fabrication. There are, besides, as appears by the statement below, manufacturers of cotton, woollen, and leather goods, as well as of gold lace, jewellery, paper, and a variety of chemical preparations, and of perfumery. Lyons is remarkable as the birth-place of the Emperors Claudius and Caracalla, and of the poet Sidonius Apollinaris; and, in modern times, of the sculptor Coisevor, of the naturalist Jussieu, and of the antiquarian Spon. It is in long. 4.44. E., and lat. 45. 45. N.

A Statement of the Operative Population of the City of Lyons, distinguishing the several Trades and Manufactures in which the same are engaged, and the number actually employed in each, exclusively of their Families when the same are not employed in any Trade or Manufacture.
