LUDWIGSLUST, a town of the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, in the bailiwick of Grabow. It is the residence of the sovereign, who has a fine palace, with parks and pleasure-gardens around it. The palace is a large and highly-ornamented building, and contains a picture-gallery with some fine paintings. A new road, recently constructed, connecting Berlin with Hamburg, passes through this place, by which means it has become a great thoroughfare. The town contains a Lutheran and a Catholic church, 624 houses, and 3840 inhabitants, mostly depending for subsistence on the court.
