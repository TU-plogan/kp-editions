LUCIA, St, one of the Caribbee Islands, in the West Indies, situated in latitude 13. 37. north, and longitude 60. 58. west. It is about thirty-two miles in length and twelve in breadth, and is divided longitudinally by a ridge of lofty hills, from 1200 to 1800 feet in height, clothed with the finest timber. Its appearance from the sea is very striking, presenting great diversity of scenery. At its southern extremity are two mountains of volcanic origin, called the Sugar Loaves, which rise perpendicularly from the sea to a great height, in the form of parallel cones, tapering towards the summits. They are covered with evergreen foliage, and Orm the entrance into a small but deep and beautiful bay. The mountains, which run north and south throughout the sland, are of volcanic formation, and assume the most fantastic shapes, abounding in deep chasms and pointed eminences. They are completely covered with wood, which attracts the clouds, and the island is consequently deluged with rain nine months out of the twelve. This is the reason why the climate is so unhealthy; but it will become less so in proportion as the woods are cut down, and the morasses and stagnant waters drained off. At the foot of the mountains there are numerous small lakes, in which the water is perpetually boiling, and in some places the ebullition is so violent that the water is thrown up to the height of four or five feet. The valleys throughout the island, as well as the plains upon the coast, are fertile, and under good cultivation, being well watered by numerous rivulets. The island is divided into two territories; Basseterre, the low or leeward territory, which is well cultivated, and the most populous, though the prevalence of stagnant waters and morasses renders the climate very unhealthy; and Capisterre, the high or windward territory, which is also very unhealthy, but is becoming less so as the wood on the high lands is cleared away. These territories are divided into three districts, which are again subdivided into ten parishes, the aggregate population of which, in 1832, amounted to 22,743. The inhabitants are, for the most part, engaged in agricultural pursuits. The principal stock in the island consists of 676 horses, 2421 horned cattle, 1616 sheep, and 765 goats.

This general description will be better understood from the following statistical tables, relative to the population, the produce, the shipping attached to the island, ând the number of seamen employed.

From this return, it appears that the number of acres in the island is 32,803½; but, as the upper part of the hilly country has not been taken into account, the total number cannot be less than 37,500 acres.

The Shipping attached to the Island, and the Number of Seamen employed, are as follows.
[table]

The value of the merchandise imported into the colony in 1832 was L.35,958, .and the exports from it the same year amounted to L.51,126. The authorized coins in circulation are British, Spanish, and French. The weights in use are the French pound and quintal.

The taxation, which amounts to nearly L.10,000, falls very heavily on the producers, and is much complained of.

St Lucia was first settled by the English about the year 1635, and belonged alternately to France and England, till 1803, when it was finally captured by the English. The white inhabitants are generally French, who profess the religion, speak the language, and possess the manners of that country, but who maintain little intercourse with the English residents. Their affairs are administered by a governor and council, with French laws where these are not adverse to the British.

The only town in the island is Castries, which is situated in a long and winding bay of the same name. It is a small, mean place, and very unhealthy, but possesses an excellent harbour. The fort is situated about two miles from the town, on the summit of a hill called Mornefortune. On the west coast there is an excellent harbour called the Little Careenage, accessible at the entrance to only one vessel at a time, but capable within of containing thirty ships of the line. Nearly six miles from the harbour of St Lucia, is a small island called Pigeon Island, about half a mile long and a quarter broad. It is of some importance as a military station, from its commanding a view of every ship which enters or departs from the adjacent island of Martinique. It is, moreover, valuable for a very fine and extensive anchorage between it and the northern part of St Lucia. The climate is the most salubrious in that quarter.

Lucia, St, a city of the island of Sicily, in the kingdom of Naples, situated on a river of the same name in the province of Demone, 190 miles from Palermo. It is in a healthy situation, on the declivity of the mountain Dinnamane, and contains 6000 inhabitants.
