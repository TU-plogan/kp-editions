LOO-CHOO Islands, called Lewchew by Mr Macleod, and by others Liqueo, or Lieoukiou. This group of islands is situated in the Eastern Ocean, to the south of Japan, about 400 or 500 miles east of the Chinese coast. They were little known to Europeans until they were visited by Captains Maxwell and Hall in the Alceste and Lyra in 1816, on their return from conveying Lord Amherst to China. Very full accounts have been published by Captain Hall and M$ Macleod of these islands, and of the climate and soil, as well as of the inhabitants, who appeared to these gentlemen to be extremely simple and interesting in their manners. These islands are in number thirty-six; but the only one of any great extent is the

Great Loo-choo, which is thirty miles in length, and from twelve to fifteen in breadth. The climate is here a happy medium between the opposite extremes of heat and cold. Being situated in the middle of a vast ocean, these islands are refreshed by the sea breezes, which, blowing continually over them, produce an agreeable coolness. They are also well watered by small rivers and streamlets, which, rising in the central eminences, flow in different directions to the sea, and afford an abundant supply of excellent water. Being in the latitude of 26. N., the scenery, though not quite so rich, is, according to Captain Hall, even more pleasing to the eye than in countries nearer to the equator; the vegetation not being so luxuriant as to overload the landscape with foliage. The style of the landscape is on the whole decidedly tropical, though there is much variety; and the groves of pine trees 'give some parts of the country quite a European character. The orange and lime, the banyan of India, and the Norwegian fir, all thrive in Loo-choo. The mode of dressing the ground at Loo-choo is very neat, and resembles that of China, particularly in the process of manuring and irrigation. Tobacco, wheat, rice, Indian corn, millet, sweet potatoes, brinjals, and many other tropical vegetables, grow in great perfection at Loo-choo. Along the sides of the hills, and around the villages, the bamboo and rattan grow to a considerable size. But Captain Hall mentions that the pine was the most conspicuous tree which they observed on the island, rising to a great height and size. Some are forty feet in height, and three or four in girth. The cattle on this island are of a small black breed, and invariably used instead of horses for agricultural purposes. Hogs, goats, and poultry, with rice and a great variety of vegetables, form the chief food of the inhabitants, milk being seldom used. The English saw no geese on the island, nor sheep; but their horses, though very small and slender, were sufficiently strong for the natives. Their goats and pigs were also diminutive; but the poultry were large and excellent. These islands are not infested by any wild animals. They had no carts or wheeled carriages of any kind, all loads being carried by horses; and the roads, which are numerous, and generally kept in excellent order, measure generally from six to ten feet across.

The whole coast of Loo-choo, as well as of the other islands, is encircled with coral reefs, which do not appear above water; and when the weather is calm, and their situation is not pointed out by breakers, they are exceedingly dangerous to mariners. The Alceste, Captain Maxwell’s ship, was several times in danger from these hidden rocks. This singular formation, which appears to be extending itself over the Pacific, was minutely examined by Captain Hall. After the sea has left it for some time, it becomes dry, and appears to be a compact rock; but no sooner does the tide rise again, and the waves begin to wash over it, than millions of coral worms, protruding themselves from holes in the surface, begin their operations; so that, from their prodigious numbers, the whole surface of the rock appears to be alive and in motion. These insects or worms cannot raise the rock above the surface of the water, and the level of the highest tide is accordingly the limit of the rock upwards, after which a horizontal field comes to be formed coincident with that plane, and perpendicular on all sides; and thus the reef, extending itself perpendicularly, and in all directions, becomes extremely dangerous to navigators. On the coast of Loo-choo there are several excellent harbours, particularly one, which is capacious and safe, and affords everywhere depth of water for the largest ships, with secure anchorage. Its banks consist of high rocks, overgrown with climbing plants and flowers.

These islands are inhabited by a singular and apparently amiable people. They are of a diminutive stature, [7:13:566] not exceeding in their average height above five feet two inches. But they are strong, well-made, and athletic; and in complexion they are quite as fair as the natives of Spain and Portugal. They invariably manifested towards their English visitors the most gentle, polite, and humane dispositions, but with that jealousy of them as strangers which is peculiar to China, Japan, and all the neighbouring countries. They were at first extremely averse to the landing of their visitors, and it was only after long deliberations that they were induced to concede the liberty of doing §o. But our people were confined to a small space on the sea-shore, under a burning sun; and it was only by renewed entreaties that they were allowed to extend their walks into the country. The’natives, however, very freely visited the English ships, and examined them carefully in all their equipmentsand detail. They accepted readily the hospitality of the strangers, and conformed to their manners in every thing. In their interviews they always showed a natural good breeding, bowing whenever they spoke to the English, uncovering their heads in their presence, and, in drinking, bowing to all around. After they had permitted the English to land, many visits were paid; but they never admitted the strangers into the interior of their town, and even limited their walks within a certain space. Any attempt to pass these bounds was always resisted by the sentinels; not, however, by force, but by a polite request, and by representing, that if the orders of the court were transgressed, blame would fall upon them. Some overtures were made by Captain Maxwell for an interview with the king; but these were always steadily resisted, on the ground or pretence that no embassy or letters were brought from the king of Eng-Iand, to whom, however, the king of Loo-choo wrote a letter, which was unfortunately lost in the wreck of the Alceste. It was extremely difficult to bring about any intercourse with this people. Ordinary requests were made the subject of tedious négociations; and the most ungracious feature in their character was their uniform aversion to any intimate communication with their visitors. In one particular they manifested a rigid adherence to Chinese manners; namely, in carefully withholding from the view of the Europeans their women, though the latter did not appear otherwise to be very closely confined. The practice of polygamy, which prevails in China, has no place here, and, the English were told, was even held in abhorrence. From the free intercourse also of the different sexes, the parties had opportunities of being acquainted before marriage.

One of the most remarkable facts mentioned by Captain Hall is, that the natives of these islands were unacquainted with the use of fire-arms. From all that the English could observe, they were even ignorant of the use of money; and though those amongst the natives who had visited China must have seen the currency of that country, yet none of them showed any desire to possess Spanish dollars or gold coins, nor could it ever be learned whether they were in possession of any common medium of exchange. With regard to their want of arms, it is supposed by Mr Macleod, that the Chinese, after conquering, had disarmed them. The musketry and cannon of the English were objects of great wonder to them; and when they saw Captain Maxwell bring down a bird on the wing, they were shocked and terrified, and requested that fire-arms should not be again brought into the island. When Napoleon was informed, at St Helena, that these people had neither arms nor money, he ridiculed the idea as incredible and absurd, and affirmed that the English had been imposed on. The result justified his penetration. These people are well acquainted with both; and it is now known that, notwithstanding all their fair seeming, they are about the most remorseless pirates in the Yellow Sea. In their intercourse with our people, however, they were remarked for their honesty; insomuch, that though they were freely admitted on board of the English ships, and many valuable articles were often in their way, yet nothing was ever missed.

They appear to live on social and friendly terms with one another, and have frequently pic-nic parties in the fields, the dinner being carried about in little japanned boxes, with sliding drawers, fastened to the end of a bamboo. They entertained the English at dinner; and the meal consisted of hard-boiled eggs coloured and sliced, fish dried in butter, sliced junk smoked, sliced pig’s liver; then came tea, which was succeeded by an unpalatable dish of coarse, soft, black sugar, wrapped up in unbaked dough. Cakes in various shapes, with something like cheese, completed the entertainment; the intervals being filled up with drinking sackee, and with smoking.

The Loo∙chooans appear to have made no progress in science or literature, though several individuals amongst them were distinguished by the English for their intelligence, and turn for inquiry. Their language is a dialect of the Japanese; but they have Chinese books, which are studied by the learned. Their religion seems to resemble the superstition of China; but it is remarkable that the order of priests, who are generally objects of veneration in all countries, are here considered as an inferior caste. All the science of these islanders is derived from the Chinese. Their practice of medicine is also Chinese; and they generally*administer to their patients roots, seeds, and dried flowers of the country. The capital of Great Loo-choo, and of the archipelago, is situated five miles from its port of Napakiang. The English were not allowed to approach it, but saw it from a distance, beautifully situated on the top of a hill; the houses, intermingled with the trees, rising above one another, and the royal palace above the whole. When the English left these islands, the natives professed the most affectionate regard for them, and expressed (with what sincerity the reader may judge) the deepest regret at their departure.
