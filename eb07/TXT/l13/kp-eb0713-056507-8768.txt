LOOE, West, a borough and township in the parish of Talland, in Cornwall. It is opposite to East Looe, on the same river, with which it is connected by a bridge. It had formerly the privilege of returning two members to parliament, but of this it has been deprived by the reform act. It has a small but convenient harbour, defended by a battery. The population amounted in 1801 to 376, in 1811 to 433, in 1821 to 539, and in 1831 to 593.
