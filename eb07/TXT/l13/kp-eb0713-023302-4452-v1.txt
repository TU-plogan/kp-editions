LESCAILLE, James, a Dutch poet and printer, was born at Geneva. He and his daughter Catherine Lescaille excelled most of the Dutch poets. But the latter, who was surnamed the Sappho of Holland, and the tenth muse, died in 1711. A collection of her poems has been printed, in which are the tragedies of Genseric Wenceslaus, Herod and Mariamne, Hercules and Dejaneira, Nicomedes, Ariadne, Cassandra, and others. James Lescaille, her father, deserved the poet’s crown, with which the Emperor Leopold honoured him in the year 1603. He died about the year 1677, aged sixty-seven.
