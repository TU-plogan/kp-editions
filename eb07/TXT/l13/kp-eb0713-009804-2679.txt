LAPITHUS, in fabulous history, a son of Apollo by Stilbe. He was brother to Centaurus, and married Orsi-nome, daughter of Euronymus, by whom he had Phorbas and Periphas. The name of Lapithae was given to the numerous children of Phorbas and Periphas, or rather to the inhabitants of the country of which they had obtained the sovereignty. The chief of the Lapithae assembled to celebrate the nuptials of Perithous, one of their number. Amongst them were Theseus, Dryas, Hopleus, Mopsus, Phalerus, Exadius, Prolochus, Titaresius, and others. The Centaurs were also invited to partake of the common festivity; and the amusements would have been harmless and innocent, had not one of the intoxicated Centaurs offered violence to Hippodamia, the wife of Perithous. The Lapithae resented the injury, and the Centaurs supported their companions; upon which the quarrel became universal, and ended in blows and slaughter. Many of the Centaurs were slain, and they were at last obliged to retire. Theseus amongst the Lapithae showed himself brave and intrepid in supporting the cause of his friends; and Nestor also was not less active in the protection of chastity and innocence. Hesiod has described the battle of the Centaurs and Lapithae; as has also Ovid, in a more copious manner. The invention of bits and bridles for horses is attributed to the Lapithae.
