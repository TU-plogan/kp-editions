LYNN-REGIS, a sea-port, market-town, and borough of the county of Norfolk, in the hundred of Freebridgc, ninety-seven miles from London. It is situated on the right bank of the river Ouse, a⅛out eight miles from the sea. The harbour is capable of receiving 300 sail of vessels. From its situation at the mouth of a long river, it is advantageously placed for exporting the productions of the soil, and for conveying to a large district the foreign commodities they require. There is a large quantity of wine imported from Portugal and Spain, and of hemp, wood, flax, and other articles from the Baltic. The market-place is very extensive and handsome; the quays for landing wine are convenient; and though some of the streets are narrow, it is on the whole a well-built town. It is governed by a mayor, high steward, recorder, and aldermen, and returns two members to parliament. There are good markets on Tuesdays and Saturdays. The principal church, St Margaret’s, is one of the largest parochial churches in England. It was erected in 1160, and repaired and enlarged in 1741. There are two other churches or chapels, besides places of worship for the several descriptions of dissenters. The population amounted in 1801 to 10,096, in 1811 to 10,259, in 1821 to 12,253, and in 1831 to 13,370.
