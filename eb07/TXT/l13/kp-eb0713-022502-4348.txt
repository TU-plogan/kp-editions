LELEGES, anciently a people of Asia, of Greek origin; the name denoting “a collection of people.” They first occupied the islands; then passing over to the continent, they settled partly in Mysia, on the Sinus Adramyttenus, and partly in that part of Ionia next to Caria. There were also Leleges of Laconia. These went to the Trojan war with Altes their king. Achilles plundered their country, and obliged them to retire to the neighbourhood of Halicarnassus, where they fixed their habitation. The inhabitants of Laconia and of Megara also bore this name for some time, from Lelex, one of their kings.
