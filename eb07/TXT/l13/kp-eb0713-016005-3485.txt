LEE, an epithet used by seamen to distinguish that part of the hemisphere to which the wind is directed, from the other part whence it blows, and which is accordingly called to windward. This expression is chiefly used when the wind crosses the line of a shipâ€™s course, so that all on one side of her is called to windward, and all on the other side to leeward. Hence, Under the Lee, implies farther to the leeward, or farther from that part of the horizon whence the wind blows.

Under the Lee of the shore, means at a short distance from the shore which lies to windward. This phrase is commonly understood to express the situation of a vessel anchored, or sailing under the weather-shore, where there is always smoother water, and less danger of heavy seas, than at a great distance from it.

Lee Lurches, the sudden and violent rolls which a ship often takes to the leeward in a high sea, particularly when a large wave strikes her on the weather-side.

LEE-Side, all that part of a ship or boat which lies between the mast and the side farthest from the direction of the wind; or otherwise, that half of a ship which is pressed down towards the water by the effort of the sails, as separated from the other half by a line drawn through the middle of her length. That part of the ship which lies to windward of this line is accordingly called the weather-side. Thus, admit a ship to be sailing southward, with the wind at east, then is her starboard or right side the lee-side, and the larboard or left the weather-side.
