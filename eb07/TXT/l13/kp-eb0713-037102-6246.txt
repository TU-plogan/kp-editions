LIPPI, Lorenzo, an historical and portrait painter, was born in 1606, and learned the principles of painting from Matteo Roselli. He had a fine genius for music and poetry, as well as for painting; and in the latter his proficiency was so great, that some of his compositions in the historical style were taken for those of Roselli. But becoming dissatisfied with the manner of that master, he chose that of Santi di Titi, who was excellent both in design and invention, and appeared to have more of simple nature and truth in his compositions than any other artist of that time. At Florence Lippi painted many excellent designs for the chapels and convents, by which he extended his reputation; and at the court of Innspruck he painted a great number of portraits of the first nobility, which were deservedly admired. Yet, although he was fond of imitating simple nature without any embellishments of invention, his works are held in the highest esteem for the. graceful airs of the heads, the correctness of his outline, and the elegant disposition of the figures. He died in 1664.
