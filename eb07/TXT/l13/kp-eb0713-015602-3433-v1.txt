LEAGUE, a measure of length, containing more or fewer geometrical paces, according to the different usages and customs of countries. A league at sea contains 3000 geometrical paces, or three English miles. The French league sometimes contains the same measure, and sometimes consists of 3500 paces; the mean or common league consists of 2400 paces, and the little league of 2000. The Spanish leagues are larger than the French; seventeen Spanish leagues making a degree, or twenty French leagues, or sixty-nine and a half English statute miles. The Dutch and German leagues contain each four geographical miles. The Persian leagues are pretty nearly of the same extent with the Spanish; that is, they are equal to four Italian miles, which is pretty near what Herodotus calls the length of the Persian parasang, which contained thirty stadia, eight of which, according to Strabo, were equal to a mile. The word comes from leuca or leuga, an ancient Gaulish word for an itinerary measure, and retained in that sense by the Romans. Some derive the word leuca from λεuxoς, ιvhite, as the Gauls, in imitation of the Romans, marked the spaces and distances of their roads with white stones.

League also denotes an alliance or confederacy between princes and states for their mutual aid, either in attacking some common enemy, or in defending themselves against one. The word comes from liga, which, in the corrupt Latin, was used for a confederacy: Qua quis cum alio ligatur.

Leagues, amongst the Greeks, were of three sorts: 1. ∑woι⅜, ∑u>3>jκ>j, or E ∣ ξηvη, by which both parties were obliged to cease from hostilities, without molesting the allies of each other; 2. Emμaχ ι ∕a, by which they engaged to lend assistance to each other in case of invasion; and, 3. 2vμμaχ∕a, by which they engaged to have the same friends and enemies, and to assist each other upon all occasions. All these leagues were confirmed with oaths, and imprecations, and sacrifices. The victims most generally sacrificed were a boar, ram, or goat, sometimes all the three; and sometimes bulls and lambs. They cut out the testicles of the animal, and stood upon them whilst they swore; then some of the hair of the victim was distributed to all present; and, lastly, they cut the animal’s throat, which was called ocκ∕α ημmv, in Latin, ferire foedus. This being done, they repeated their oaths and imprecations, calling the gods to witness the honesty of their intentions. A libation was then made of wine, which was mixed, to imply their conjunction and union; and whilst this was pouring out, they prayed that the blood of him who should break the treaty might be poured out in like manner. Upon these occasions no part of the victim was eaten. Still further to increase the solemnity of this obligation, the league was engraved upon brass, fixed up in places of public resort, and sometimes read at the solemn games. Some exchanged certain cυμβο ∖ a, or tesseroe, upon the occasion, and frequently sent ambassadors on an appointed day, to keep each other in mind of their engagements.

The League, byway of eminence, denotes that famous one which existed in France from the year 1576 to 1593. Its intention was to prevent the succession to the crown of Henry IV. who was of the reformed religion; and it ended with his abjuration of that faith.

The Leaguers, or confederates, were of three kinds. The zealous leaguers aimed at the utter destruction, not only of the Huguenots, but also of the ministry. The Spanish leaguers had principally in view the transferring of the crown of France to the king of Spain, or the infanta his daughter. The moderate leaguers aimed only at the extirpation of Calvinism, without any alteration of the government.
