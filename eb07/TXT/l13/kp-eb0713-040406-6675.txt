LOCCUM, a town of the province of Calenbourg, in the kingdom of Hanover. It contains 152 houses, and 1120 inhabitants. It is remarkable for its abbey, which is possessed by a Protestant superintendent, and is the richest preferment of the church of Hanover, as the abbot of Loccum is the chief magistrate of the district, and has a seat in the upper legislative house of the states.
