LAYERS, in Gardening, are tender shoots or twigs of trees, laid or buried in the ground, till, having struck root, they are separated from the parent tree, and become distinct plants. The propagating of trees by layers is done in the following manner: The branches of the trees are slit a little way, and laid under the mould for about half a foot; the ground should first be made very light, and after they are laid they should be gently watered. If they do not remain easily in the position they are put in, they should be pegged down with wooden hooks. The best season for doing this is, for evergreens, towards the end of August, and, Tor other trees, in the beginning of February. If they be found to have taken root, they are then cut off from the main plant the succeeding winter, and planted out. If the branch be too high from the ground, a tub of earth is raised to a proper height for it. Some pare off the rind, and others twist the branch, before they lay it; but this is not necessary. The end of the layer should be about a foot out of the ground; and the branch may either be tied tightly round with a wire, or cut upwards from a joint, or cut round for an inch or two at the place; and it is a good method to pierce several holes through it with an awl above the part tied with the wire.

LAZAR-House, or Lazaretto, a public building, of the nature of an hospital, to receive the poor, and those afflicted with contagious distempers. In some places, lazarettos are appointed for the performance of quarantine; in which case those only are confined in them who have come from places suspected of being infected with the plague.
