LEIPZIG, one of the circles into which the kingdom of Saxony is divided. It extends over 1195 square miles, comprehends twenty-three cities and towns, with 794 villages, and contains 216,564 inhabitants. It consists of two parts, Leipzig and Wurzen, which are again subdivided into bailiwicks. The city of the same name is the capital. It is situated on the river Pleisse; is surrounded with walls, which are useless for any defensive purpose; and contains a population, including the garrison and the university, of 38,000 persons. The university is more remarkable for its learning than for the number of its students, but it has a good library, observatory, anatomical theatre, and other establishments for professional education. There are one Catholic, one Reformed, and eight Lutheran churches. Some of the streets are narrow, but the houses are large, and the market-place is a fine square. It is a place abounding in manufactures of various kinds; but few of them are on an extensive scale, and most of them for articles of convenience and luxury. It has a prosperous trade, chiefly arising from its two great fairs, which are resorted to by producers and consumers from all parts of Germany, many of the former being from England, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. It is the great emporium of German literature, where books, at whatever place printed, are commonly published. It has been the scene of battles in 1631 and in 1646, and especially in October 1813, when the fate of the French empire was decided in what the Germans have called “the battle of nations.” Long. 12. 16. 31.
