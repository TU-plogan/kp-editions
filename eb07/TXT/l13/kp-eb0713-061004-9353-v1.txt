LYME-REGIS, a borough and market town of the county of Dorset, in the hundred of Whitchurch, 143 miles from London. It stands on the side of a steep hill, overlooking the sea, and has a small artificial harbour, called the Cobbe, secure for vessels of small tonnage. It has been i much frequented of late years for the purposes of sea-bathing, and appropriate institutions for the accommodation of visitors have been established. It is an ancient borough, and previously to the passing of the reform act returned two members to parliament, but now elects only one. There is a well-supplied market on Friday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1451, in 1811 to 1925, in 1821 to 2269, and in 1831 to 2621.
