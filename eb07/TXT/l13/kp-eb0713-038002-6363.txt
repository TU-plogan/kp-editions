LITHGOW, William, a Scotchman, whose sufferings by imprisonment and torture at Malaga, and whose travels on foot over Europe, Asia, and Africa, seem to raise him almost to the rank of a martyr and a hero. He published an account of his peregrinations and adventures. Though , the author deals much in the marvellous, the account of the strange cruelties which he gives us has yet an air of truth. Soon after his arrival in England from Malaga, he was carried to Theobald’s upon a feather-bed, that King James might be an eye-witness of his “martyred anatomy,” by which he means his wretched body, mangled, and reduced to a skeleton. The whole court crowded to see him, and his majesty ordered him to be taken care of, and he was twice sent to Bath at his expense. By the king’s command he applied to Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, for the recovery of the money and other things of value which the governor of Malaga had taken from him, and for L.1000 for his support. He was promised a full reparation for the damage he had sustained; but the perfidious minister never performed his promise. When he was upon the point of leaving England, Lithgow upbraided him with the breach of his word, in the presence-chamber, before several gentlemen of the court. This occasioned their fighting upon the spot; and the ambassador, as the traveller oddly expresses it, had his fistula, with which disorder he was afflicted, contrabanded with his fist. The unfortunate Lithgow, who was generally condemned for his spirited behaviour, was sent to the Marshalsea, where he continued a prisoner during nine months. At the conclusiorrof the octavo edition of his Travels, he informs us, that in his three voyages, “his painful feet have traced over, besides passages of seas and rivers, 36,000 and odd miles, which draweth near to twice the circumference of the whole earth.” Here the marvellous seems to rise to the incredible, and to place him, in point of veracity, below Coryat, whom it is nevertheless, certain that he far outwalked. His description of Ireland is whimsical and curious. This, together with the narrative of his sufferings, is reprinted in Morgan’s Phoenix Britannicus.
