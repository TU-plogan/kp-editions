LAMPRIDIUS, Aelius, one of the writers of the Augustan History, who lived at the beginning of the fourth century, during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantius, to whom he dedicates his work. The Augustan History is composed by six different authors, and contains a series of biographical sketches of the Roman emperors, from Hadrian to Carus and his sons (117-285, a. d.). These authors were, Aelius Spartianus, Vulcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius Pollio, Flavius Vopiscus, Aelius Lampridius, and Julius Capitolinus. Lampridius wrote the four lives of Commodus, Diadumenus, Heliogabalus, and Alexander Severus. He seems to have been more attentive to the accuracy of his facts than to the beauty of his style. It is supposed by Vossius (Z)e Hist. Lat. ii. 7), and by Fabricius (Biblioth. Lat. iii. 6), that Lampridius and Spartianus are the same writer; but this opinion has been ably refuted by Demoulines. (See Moller, Diss, de Ael. Lampridio, Altorf, 1688; Casaubon, ad. Spart. Adrian.') Lampridius, Benedict, of Cremona, a Latin poet of the sixteenth century. He taught Greek and Latin at Rome and at Padua, until he was invited to Mantua by Frederick Gonzaga to undertake the tuition of his son. He wrote epigrams and lyric verses, both in Greek and Latin, which were printed separately, as well as amongst the Delicioe of the Italian poets.
