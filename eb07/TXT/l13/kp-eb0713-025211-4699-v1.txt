LETT, Gregorio, an eminent Italian writer, was descended of a family which once made a considerable figure at Bologna. Jerom, his father, was page to Prince Charles de’ Medicis; served some time in the troops of the grand duke as captain of foot; and married at Milan, where lie settled in 1628. He was afterwards governor of Almantea in Calabria, and died at Salerno in the year 1639. Gregorio was born at Milan in 1630, studied under the Jesuits at Cosenza, and was afterwards sent to Rome by an uncle, who wished him to enter the church; but he being averse to this, proceeded to Geneva, where he studied the principles of religion and government. Thence he went to Lausanne; and having contracted an acquaintance with John Anthony Guérin, an eminent physician, lodged at his house, made profession of the Calvinist religion, and married his daughter. He settled at Geneva, where he spent nearly twenty years, carrying on a correspondence with learned men, especially with those of Italy. Some contests obliged him to leave that city in 1679; upon which he went to France, and then to England, where he was received with great civility by Charles II. who, after his first audience, made him a present of a thousand crowns, and promised him the place of historiographer. Whilst in England, he wrote a history of that country; but as this work displeased the court, on account of his too great liberty in writing, he was ordered to leave the kingdom. He went to Amsterdam in 1682, and was honoured with the place of historiographer to that city. Leti died suddenly in 1701. He was a man of indefatigable application, as is evinced by the multiplicity of his works. The principal of these are, 1. The Universal Mo [7:13:253] narchy of Louis XIV.; 2. The’ Life of Pope Sixtus V.; 3. The Life of Philip II. King of Spain; 4. The Life of the Emperor Charles V.; 5. The Life of Elizabeth, Queen of England; 6. The History of Oliver Cromwell; 7. The History of Great Britain, in five vols. 12mo; 8. The History of Geneva; besides other works.
