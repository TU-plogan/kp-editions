LARCENY, or Theft, by contraction for lątrociny, latrocinium, is distinguished by the law into two sorts; the one called simple larceny, t or plain theft, unaccompanied with any other atrocious circumstance; and the other, mixed or compound larceny, which also includes in it the aggravation of a taking from one’s house or person.

Simple lareeny, when it is the stealing of goods above the value of twelvepence, is called grand larceny, but when of goods to that value, or under, is petit larceny ; offences which are considerably distinguished in their punishment, but not otherwise. Mixed or compound larceny is such as [7:13:114]has all the properties of the former, but is accompanied with either one or both of the aggravations of a taking from the house or Me person.
