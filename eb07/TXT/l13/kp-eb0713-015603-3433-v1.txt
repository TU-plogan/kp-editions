LEAK, at sea, is a hole in the ship, through which the water comes in. A ship is said to spring a leak when she begins to leak, or to let in the water. The manner of stopping a leak is to put into it a plug wrapped in oakum and well tarred, or to insert a tarpawling clout, which keeps out the water, or to nail a piece of sheet-lead on the place. Seamen sometimes stop a leak by thrusting a piece of salt beef into it. The sea-water, says Mr Boyle, being fresher than the brine imbibed by the beef, penetrates into its body, and causes it to sv√ell so as to bear strongly against the edges of the broken plank, and thereby stops the influx of the water. A ready way to find a leak in a ship is to apply the narrower end of a speaking trumpet to the ear, and the other to the side of the ship where the leak is supposed to be; then the noise of the water rushing in at the leak will be distinctly heard, and thereby discovered.
