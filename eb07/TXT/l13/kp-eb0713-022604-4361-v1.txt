LEMNOS, an island in the Archipelago, in the Turkish province of Lesbos or Midilly. It extends over 165 square miles, from north latitude 39. 46. to 40. 2. and from east longitude 24. 52. to 25. 33. It is very narrow in the middle, where there are two harbours on the opposite sides of the tongue of land which joins the two parts. These are mountainous, and, though not lofty, were in ancient times said to have been volcanic; and the warm springs near the mountain Therma confirm the opinion. The soil is not highly fertile, but it produces wheat, barley, grapes, figs, almonds, and some oil. Water is not abundant, and there is a great scarcity of fuel. The inhabitants are about 8000, mostly Greeks, and inhabit two towns and fifty villages, some of whom find occupation in the fisheries. The capital is the town of the same name, the ancient Myrina. It is the scat of a Greek bishop, is without walls, but protected by a castle, and has a small haven, and about 1000 inhabitants, of whom 300 are Turks. There are some establishments for building vessels, which is the principal employment of the population.
