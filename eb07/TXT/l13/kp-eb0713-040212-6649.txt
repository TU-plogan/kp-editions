LLANELLY, a town which had formerly a market, in South Wales, in the hundred of Carnwallen and county of Carmarthen. It is 220 miles from London. It stands on a creek running out of the Severn, called the Bury, at the mouth of which is an island, on which formerly stood the monastery of Machunis. The chief trade consists in the shipment of coals for Bristol, and the several towns of the north of Somerset and Devon. This commerce has increased the population, which, including the whole parish, amounted in 1801 to 2972, in 1811 to 3891, in 1821 to 5649, and in 1831 to 7646.
