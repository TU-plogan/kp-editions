LISBON, a city of Portugal, the metropolis of that kingdom, as well as of the province of Estremadura, in which it is situated. It is built on the banks of the river Tagus, which is a most secure and capacious harbour, well defended, and capable, of admitting 10,000 sail of vessels, without danger to them. The only difficulty is the bar at the entrance, which makes it hazardous either to enter or depart without the aid of skilful pilots. Between the bar and the city the strong castle of Belem, under whose guns all ships must pass, is a sufficient protection. Few finer objects can be seen than a panoramic view from the harbour of Lisbon. The smooth expanse of water studded [7:13:376] with ships, the vineyards on the surrounding hills, interspersed with villas, and the magnificent city extending two miles along the shore, afford a coup ďoeil which has few equals.

Lisbon is a city of great antiquity; it was known in remote periods by the name Ulyssippo,andits origin attributed to Ulysses. It was a municipium under the Roman government, and one of the favourite cities under the Moorish yoke. It was regained from the African marauders in 1154, by Alphonso, who had a few years before assumed the regal power, and who was assisted by a fleet of adventurers bound on a crusade to the Holy Land. Since that period it has continued the metropolis of Portugal, an independent kingdom, except from the year 1580 to 1640, when it was united to the Spanish monarchy.

From the vicissitudes this city has experienced, we may expect to find it abounding in Phoenician, Roman, and Moorish antiquities; but the tremendous earthquake which it suffered in 1755 buried most of what then remained in a heap of ruins. After the dismal catastrophe of that period, the city rose again with unexampled rapidity, and with a beauty and splendour far exceeding its former condition. The traces of this calamity are not, however, wholly obliterated. Near the river, and the Praça di Commercio, large masses of ruined churches and convents are visible amongst the modern buildings; and the fractured strata of the rocks on which these stand, still show the nature of the concussion which destroyed the former city. This city seems exposed to this calamity, as there have been frequent shocks of earthquakes since; and indeed few years pass without some slight indications of a tendency in the earth to similar tremblemens. The streets of Lisbon are of competent breadth, and paved; but, owing to the inequality of the ground on which they stand, and their slippery state, they are uncomfortable to walk or ride through. The attention of a vigilant police is wanted to enforce a greater observance of cleanliness. As few of the Portuguese nobility reside on their estates, their residences within the city are very splendid; and some of the richer merchants have houses, 4 which in appearance rival those of the higher orders; but the habitations of the lower classes of the inhabitants are miserable and disgusting by their excessive filthiness.

The public buildings are very spacious; and some of the few which sustained the concussion of 1755 exhibit fine specimens of ancient architecture. The church of Belem is one of these, and though two of the columns which supported the roof were then thrown down, and have since been replaced by two mis-shapen masses of modern masonry, it exhibits the finest specimen of the Arabesque-Gothic style of building. The royal palace is finely situated on the banks of the Tagus at Belem, but, being composed of wood, is not equal to the general taste of the other public buildings. The most imposing object near Lisbon is the aqueduct, which conveys fresh water to the city, and which in grandeur yields to no work of ancient or modern times. The cathedral is a large and magnificent building, and endowed with a revenue estimated at more than L.100,000 sterling annually.

Lisbon is enriched with such establishments as usually adorn the capitals of kingdoms. It possesses an academy of sciences, a botanic garden, a well arranged cabinet of natural history, some public libraries, amongst which that of the Regalia contains upwards of 80,000 volumes, a college for the nobles, and several other seminaries. Amongst other charitable institutions, is an hospital, where the sick of all countries are freely admitted and relieved.

The climate of Lisbon is remarkably salubrious, and is sought after by invalids from the more northern countries, for relief in pulmonary complaints. It is thought that the water drunk in this city has a tendency to alleviate these maladies. This water, which is brought from Montelavar by the aqueduct, is strongly impregnated with carbonate of lime, and, on analysis, is like the water of Clifton, but has a greater quantity of lime in a state of suspension.

The markets of Lisbon are most profusely supplied with every article that can administer to human appetite. The consμmption of animal food is small, that of beef exceeding that of mutton in a very great degree; but, for the number of inhabitants, the quantity of animal food consumed in Lisbon is only one eighth of that which London requires to supply it. Fish, both from the sea and the rivers, is abundant and cheap. Fruit of every kind, and flour of excellent quality, are to be purchased; and garlic, which seems to be one of the articles in most extensive demand, is furnished in prodigious quantities.

Before the great earthquake of 1755, the city of Lisbon was calculated to contain 150,000 inhabitants; but, by the census taken in 1804, the number amounted to 240,000. The removal of the court to Brazil did not diminish the population, but it has since declined, so that in 1830, by the last census, there were only 200,000, which, indeed, was both increased and enriched by this city having been during the peninsular war the focal point through which communication with the army was maintained, and the dépôt for the ammunition, provisions, and recruits, destined to support the forces employed in the interior of Spain and Portugal.

There are few people in Lisbon occupied in manufactures. Some fine woollen cloths are made, some linens, and a quantity of silk goods more than equal to that of both the others. The greatest taste of this city is displayed in its jewellery business, in which, though rather tawdry than elegant, they excel. The goldsmiths and silversmiths are excellent workmen. As a specimen of the best faculties exercised in that branch, it deserves to be noticed, that the splendid service of plate presented to the Duke of Wellington by the government of Portugal was wholly made in Lisbon; and no person was permitted to execute the least part of the work who was not a native of the kingdom. This service, both for value and for the exquisite workmanship, is the first collection that was ever seen, and far exceeds that of any royal household in Europe.

The foreign trade of Lisbon is second to no city in Europe excepting that of London. Its domestic productions, wine, oil, fruits, and bay salt, are conveyed to all the northern parts of the continent of Europe, but more especially to England, with which is the principal commerce. It receives in return from every country the articles in which it excels; from Russia, hemp, flax, and other naval stores; from the other parts in the Baltic Sea, linens, iron, steel, salted fish, timber, pitch, and tar; from Germany and Holland it obtains linens, corn, and some other commodities. England makes returns in cloths, linens, cotton, hardware, porcelain, and the various products of its looms, its forges, and its kilns. France supplies some linens, and the more fanciful articles of its tasteful industry. These varied commodities, received at Lisbon, are partly consumed in Portugal, whilst a very considerable proportion of them are destined for re-exportation to the transmarine settlements.

The commerce of Lisbon is considerable with the Portuguese establishments in China, in India, and on both sides of the continent of Africa. The latter consists principally of such articles as are required to be given in exchange for human beings, in that abominable traffic denominated the slave-trade, but which deserves to be stigmatized as the commerce of cruelty and the stimulus to murder and barbarism. Brazil furnished for a long period the great rudiments oí the distant trade of Lisbon. Its sugars were distributed from hence to all the continental ports, where they obtained the name of the port at which they had first been received
[7:13:377]

in Europe. The cotton from that country, before the recent encouragements to its growth had given birth to its present enormous production, all centred in Lisbon; and it was the entrepôt for the gold, the silver, and the precious stones which the mines of Brazil yielded.

The removal of the seat of the Portuguese government from the European metropolis to its American dominions, caused a great revolution in the commercial relations of both parts of the empire. Brazil, having quitted its colonial character, had its ports opened to the commercial ships of all nations; the transit trade of Lisbon was in some measure terminated; but the alteration communicated such a stimulus to Brazil, and its population, its wealth, and its productions, increased so much within the first ten years that elapsed after the emigration of the court, that, after allowing for what passed direct to and from Brazil in its intercourse with other countries, its transactions of commerce with Lisbon were as great as before the removal of the government.

We have no authentic accounts of the foreign imports and exports; but some judgment may be formed from the eturns of the vessels that entered the port in the years, 1829, 1830, and 1831, as furnished by the British consul :—

The average number of vessels, and their tonnage, which belonged to the port of Lisbon in the same three years, was, by the consular report, sixty ships, and of 9090 tons burden.

Lisbon is situated in north latitude 38. 42. 20., and west longitude from London 8. 37. 25., as determined by trigonometrical observations.
