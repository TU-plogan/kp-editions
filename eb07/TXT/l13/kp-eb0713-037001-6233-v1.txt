LIPES, a province of Bolivia, or Upper Peru, in the department of Potosi, abouζsixty leagues long from northwest to south-east, and twenty in breadth. It was formerly a place of great wealth, possessing a considerable number of valuable mines; but many of them have been abandoned on account of the breaking in of water. It has still two mines of gold, one of silver, and one of copper; together with mines of red and white copper, the strata of which are intermixed with gold, silver, iron, and loadstone. The climate is generally cold, and the land unfruitful; but there are particular parts where it is good, and vegetation considerable. Cattle are found in great abundance, inhabiting that part of the chain of the Andes which intersects the province. There are also great numbers of birds.

Lipes, the capital of the above province, was formerly a large and populous town, but has gradually decayed in importance with the province. It is now a small and miserable place. Long. 68. 16. W. Lat. 21. 40. S. The population of the district and town is estimated at about 20,000.
