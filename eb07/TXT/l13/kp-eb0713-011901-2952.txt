LATONA, in Mythology, a goddess, whose history is very obscure. Hesiod makes her the daughter∙ of Titan Coeus, and Phoebe his sister. She was admired for her beauty, and celebrated for the favours which she granted to Jupiter. Juno, always jealous of her husband’s amours, made Latona the object of her vengeance, and sent the serpent Python to disturb her peace and persecute her. Latona wandered from place to place during the time of her pregnancy, continually alarmed for fear of Python. She was driven from heaven; and Terra, influenced by Juno, refused to give her a place where she might rest and bring forth. Neptune, moved with compassion, struck with his trident and made immoveable the island of Delos, which had before wandered in the Aegean, appearing sometimes above and sometimes below the surface of the sea. Latona, changed into a quail by Jupiter, came to Delos, where she resumed her original shape, and gave birth to Apollo and Diana, leaning against a palm tree or an olive. But her repose was of short duration. Juno discovered the place of her retreat, and obliged her to fly from Delos. She wandered over the greater part of the world; and in Caria, where her fatigue compelled her to stop, she was insulted and ridiculed by the peasants, of whom she asked for water whilst they were weeding a marsh. Their refusal and insolence provoked her, and she entreated Jupiter to punish their barbarity. They were all changed into frogs. She was also insulted by Niobe, who boasted herself greater than the mother of Apollo and Diana, and ridiculed the presents which the piety of her neighbours had offered to Latona. At last, Latona, though persecuted and exposed to the resentment of Juno, became a powerful deity, and saw her children receive divine honours. Her worship was generally established where her children received adoration; particularly at Argos, Delos, and other places, where she had temples. She had an oracle in Egypt, celebrated for the true and decisive answers which it gave. Latona, Venus, and Diana, were the three goddesses most in veneration amongst the Roman women.
