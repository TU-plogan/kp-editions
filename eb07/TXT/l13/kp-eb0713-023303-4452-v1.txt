LESGHISTAN, a territory of the Caucasus, bounded on the north by Circassia, and on the east by Daghestan. It is a stupendous range of mountains running in a south-easterly direction, of great length, but of inconsiderable breadth, and forming the whole north-eastern frontier of Georgia. Dr Reineggs describes this mountainous tract as broken by innumerable and frightful gulfs. These, he says, are united by strong stone or wooden bridges, by roads carried over impracticable rocks; streams are confined to a particular course, and wholesome spring-water is carried everywhere by pipes and canals cut out of the rock. The soil being scanty, and the level ground insufficient to enable the proprietor to raise the means of subsistence, he ingeniously contrives to increase the surface to the very summit of the heights, by graduated terraces, filling the intermediate spaces with rubbish, and covering them with earth. The houses of the inhabitants, seen from a distance, have an awful appearance, being situated on the loftiest summits of the mountain, and on the most frightful precipices. The Lesghaes are the bravest, as they are the most turbulent, of all the nations of the Caucasus, being the terror and scourge of all the neighbouring tribes, whose villages they lay waste, and whose inhabitants they carry into servitude. They are partly Mahommedans and partly idolaters, the few tribes who yet remain in ignorance never changing the object of their veneration, which is either the sun, moon, or stars, or any other grand object that has made an impression on their minds. They have from time immemorial maintained their independence, partly by their own valour, and partly owing to the inaccessible nature of their country. They are accustomed to hire themselves out to fight the battles of their neighbours; their pay is twelve roubles the campaign, which must not last above three months. In these wars they often take opposite sides, to which they remain faithful, so that it frequently happens that a Lesghae falls by the hand of his brother or intimate friend. They are lightly dressed, according to the custom of the Tartars; and are armed with a gun, pistols, dagger, and sabre. Their women are distinguished for their beauty, surpassing even the females of Mount Caucasus; and they bring the largest prices in the markets of Constantinople.
