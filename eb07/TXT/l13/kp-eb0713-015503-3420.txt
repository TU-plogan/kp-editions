LEAD, a metal of a white colour, inclining to blue, and the least ductile, the least elastic, and the least sonorous of all the metals, but possessing a considerable degree of specific gravity.

The lead mines of Great Britain have been wrought from a very remote era. Previously to 1289, however, it would seem that those of Derbyshire only had been explored. But in the year now mentioned lead mines were discovered in Wales; and traces of silver having also been found in them, they were wrought with increased assiduity and attention. The present produce of the lead mines of Great Britain cannot be ascertained with any degree of accuracy. The lead mines of Derbyshire have been supposed to yield 5000 or 6000 tons annually; but they are said to be on the decline. Those upon the borders of Cumberland and Northumberland are supposed to yield, at an average, from 11,000 to 12,000 tons. The total produce of the Scotch mines is estimated at above 4000 tons. Subjoined is a table showing the past and present state of the trade in this article.

More than a third part of the whole lead sent out of the country in 1833 went to the United States, about 3000 tons to the East Indies and China, 1483 tons to Russia, and the remainder, in comparatively insignificant quantities, to various other countries. The decline of trade which has taken place since 1821 has been attributed to the opening of very rich mines in Spain; whilst the cheapness and facility with which they can be wrought enables the Spaniards to undersell every other country. The price of lead has fluctuated very much. The average price from 1800 to 1810 was L.27. 14s. 6d. per ton; from 1811 to 1821, L.23. 6s. 6d. per ton; and from 1822 to 1832, L.20. 7s. per ton. In 1832 the price had sunk as low as L.13. 10s. per ton, but it has since risen; indeed there is scarcely any article the price of which is subject to such variations. In France the consumption is rapidly increasing, and it is nearly all imported from Spain. The importations have increased from 6,211,500 kilogrammes, at an average of the four years ending 1822, to 15,742,192 kilogrammes, at an average of the two years ending with 1830. The lead-mines of the United States are as productive as any in the world, and have recently become of considerable importance. Those on Fever River produced in 1832 about 1412 tons. American manufactures of white and red lead, as well as shot, now nearly supply the domestic market.
