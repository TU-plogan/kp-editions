LAUNDER, in Mineralogy, a name given in Devonshire, and other places, to a long and shallow trough, which receives the powdered ore after it comes out of the box or coffer, a sort of mortar, in which it is powdered with iron pestles. The powdered ore, which is washed into the launder by the water from the coffer, is always finest nearest the grate, and coarser all the way down.
