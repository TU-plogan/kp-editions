LEARCHUS, a celebrated Greek sculptor of Rhegium, in the south of Italy, who seems to have flourished at a very early period, before 620 b. c. He made a statue of Jupiter in bronze, which was seen at Sparta, and which was regarded as the most ancient work of its kind. It was not of one piece, but was made of pieces worked separately, and fixed to one another by means of nails and large hooks, so that the parts could not be separated. It is this species of work which Quatrem√®re de Quincy has perfectly explained under the name of Sphurelaton in his Jupiter Olympien. (Pausanias, iii. 17. See Winckelmann, Op. vi.1,7.)
