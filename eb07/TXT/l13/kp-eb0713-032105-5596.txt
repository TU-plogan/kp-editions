LIEUTENANT, an officer who supplies the place and discharges the office of a superior in his absence. Of these, some are civil, as the lord-lieutenants of kingdoms, and the lord-lieutenants of counties; and others are military, as the lieutenant-general, lieutenant-colonel, &c.

Lord-LiEUTENANT of Ireland is properly a viceroy, and has all the state and grandeur of a king of England, except being served upon the knee. He has the power of bestowing all the offices under the government, of dubbing knights, and of pardoning all crimes, except high treason.

Lord-LiEUTENANrs of Counties are officers who, upon any invasion or rebellion, have power to raise the militia, and to give commissions to colonels and other officers, and to arm and form them into regiments, troops, and companies. Under the lord-lieutenants, are deputy-lieutenants, who possess the same power; these are chosen by the lord-lieutenants, out of the principal gentlemen of each county, and presented to the king for his approbation.

Lieutenant, in the land service, is the second commissioned officer in every company both of foot and horse, next to the captain, and who takes the command upon the death or absence of the captain.

Lieutenant of a Ship of War, the officer next in rank and power to the captain, in whose absence he is accordingly charged with the command of the ship, as also the execution of whatever orders he may have received from the commander relating to the kingâ€™s service. See Navy.
