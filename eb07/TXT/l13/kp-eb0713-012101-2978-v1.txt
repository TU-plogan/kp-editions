LAUDOHN, Field-Marshal, a celebrated general in the imperial service, born in 1716, was a native of Livonia, and descended from a Scotch family. He made his first campaigns under Marshal Munich, in the war of 1738, between the Russians and Turks, and was present at the taking of Oczakow, as well as at Choczim, and Sta-wutzchane, where the Turks were entirely defeated. In 1741 Frederick the Great refused to take young Laudohn into his service, saying he did not like his countenance; but this monarch, who was considered as the greatest general of his age, afterwards observed that he had often admired the positions of other generals, but that he had ever dreaded the battles of Laudohn. In 1756, when but just entered into the service of the house of Austria, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, he made such rapid progress, that within less than a year he became a general of artillery, and within three years commander-in-chief of the army. He rescued Olmutz when besieged by the Prussians, beat the king himself at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, took General Fouquet prisoner at Zorndorf, carried Glatz and Schweidnitz by assault, and stopped the progress of Frederick in a war which might have proved fatal to the house of Austria. In 1778, when elevated to the rank of field-marshal, at the head of sixty thousand men, he prevented Henry, brother to the king of Prussia, from joining his army to that of the king. At Dubicza, Novi, Grandisca, and Belgrade, in the war between the emperor and the Turks, he had but to present himself before the enemy, and say with Caesar, Veni, vidi, vici. But at his head-quarters in Moravia he was seized with a fever, in consequence of an operation he underwent for an obstruction in the urethra. His impatience under the medical applications, the impetuous ardour of his character, and, above all, the knowledge of his importance in the war, contributed to irritate his mind, and promote the violence of the fever. He resisted the application of cataplasms, before and after the incisions were made, with a fatal obstinacy, which raised the inflammation to such a height, that he expired under an access of fever, on the 14th of July 1790, in the seventy-fourth year of his age.
