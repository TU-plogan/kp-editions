LAMINGTON Priors, a town of the hundred of Knightlow, in the county of Warwick, in a pleasant situation on the banks of the river Learn, ninety miles from London, and two from Warwick. Owing to the discovery of some mineral springs of several kinds, it has grown in a few years from a village to a handsome and considerable town, frequented by numerous visitors both for health and amusement. An hotel, a church, and a market, have been erected, with conveniences for bathing and drinking the waters. The population amounted in 1801 to 315, in 1811 to 543, in 1821 to 2183, and in 1831 to 6209.
