LLANOS, San Juan de los, a province in that part of the republic of Colombia which formerly constituted the viceroyalty of New Granada, being bounded on the north by Meridas and Varinas, on the east by Varinas, on the south by Quixos, and on the west by Bogota. Its limits are somewhat vague, the name signifying province of the plains, which extend their dreary surfaces from 200 to 300 leagues in length, and about the same in breadth. It is watered by many large rivers, the principal being the Rio Meta, the Casanare, the Vichada, and the Orinoco. The soil is fertile, and perfectly level: not a hill nor any other inequality is to be seen as far as the eye can reach. But the appearance of the plains is totally changed at different seasons of the year. During the rainy season they are covered with fine grass, on which numerous herds of cattle graze; and in the time of extreme drought, vegetation being destroyed by the excessive heat of the sun, they appear but a sandy desert. Upon the banks of the rivers, however, vegetation is at all times so profuse and often so thick as to be almost impenetrable. The climate is immoderately hot, and very unhealthy. In some parts the air is pure, and in others vaporous, and full of fine dust raised from the dried mud of the rivers.

The northern portion of this province has been recently separated into a distinct district called Casanare, which name is now often applied to the whole. In this territory, cacao, maize, yucas, plantains, &c. are produced; and the lakes and rivers furnish abundance of fish for the [7:13:403] support of the inhabitants. Its principal town is Pore, situated in an unhealthy climate, about 133 miles northeast of Bogota, and containing 500 inhabitants. On the banks of the rivers there are many missionary and other villages, instituted for the conversion of the scattered tribes of Indians who roam through the country between the Orinoco and the Andes. These tribes are termed Llaneros, or inhabitants of the plains, whose chief employment consists in attending to the herds of cattle which feed on the pastures. The principal commodity of the plains is the peltry of animals manufactured by the inhabitants. The population, including Casanare, is about 20,000.

Llanos, San Juan de lοs, the capital of the above province, is situated in longitude 73. 55. 30. west, and latitude 3. 11. north, about fifty miles east-south-east of Bogota. It was founded in 1555, and was celebrated for the gold found in its neighbourhood, but now contains very few inhabitants, who live in great poverty.
