LARISTAN, a province of Persia, which extends along the northern shore of the Persian Gulf, from the fifty-fifth to the fifty-eighth degree of east longitude. It is bounded by Fars on the north-west, and Kerman on the north-east, and is the poorest and least productive province of Persia. The country is arid, and so destitute of wholesome water, that it would be uninhabitable were it not for the periodical rains, which fill the cisterns of the natives, and enable them to cultivate the date tree, together with a small quantity of wheat and barley. The coast is in possession of the different Arab tribes, who, under the government of their own sheiks, maintain their independence, and pay a trifling tribute to the king. They subsist chiefly by piracy, and reside in small towns or mud forts scattered along the shore of the gulf. The chief town, besides Lar, the capital, is Congoon, containing 6000 or 7000 inhabitants.
