LAMA is the name of the sovereign pontiff, or rather god, of the Asiatic Tartars. He is never to be seen but in a secret place of his palace, amidst a great number of lamps, sitting cross-legged upon a cushion, and adorned all over with gold and precious stones; and at a distance his worshippers prostrate themselves before him, it being unlawful for any to kiss even his feet. He is called the great lama, or lama of lamas, that is, priest of priests. The orthodox opinion is, that when the grand lama dies, either of old age or infirmity, his soul in fact only quits a crazy habitation to look for another younger or better; and it is discovered again in the body of some child, by certain tokens known only to the lamas or priests, in which order he always appears.
