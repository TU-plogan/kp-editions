LAR, the capital of the province of Laristan, in Persia, once a magnificent city, but now in ruins. It is situated at the foot of a range of hills in an extensive plain, which is covered with palm trees. The houses are commodious and neatly furnished, each having a badgeer and surdαb ; the former to cool the inner apartments, and the latter to retire to in the summer season, in order to avoid the intolerable heat of the climate. The residence of the khan, or governor, is in the middle of the city, and is surrounded by a strong wall flanked with towers. The celebrated castle of Lar, now in ruins, is situated on the summit of a hill, immediately behind the town, and is said by the Persians to have been impregnable. The city is decorated with many handsome buildings; and the bazaar, which is in good repair, is said to be the noblest structure of the kind in Persia. It is very ancient, and is built in the same manner as that of Shiraz, but on a much grander scale, the arches being lofty, the breadth and length greater, and the workmanship in every way superior. It still contains 12,000 inhabitants, and is celebrated for the manufacture of muskets and of cotton cloth. Long. 52. 45. E. Lat. 27. 30. N. (Kinneir’s Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire?)
