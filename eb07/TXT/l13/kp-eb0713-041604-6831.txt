LOCUS Geometricus, a line by which a local or indeterminate problem is solved. A locus is a line, any point of which may equally solve an indeterminate problem. Thus, if a right line suffice for the construction of the equation, it is called locus ad rectum ; if a circle, locus ad circulum ; if a parabola, locus ad parabolam ; if an ellipsis, locus ad ellipsin ; and so of the rest of the conic sections.
