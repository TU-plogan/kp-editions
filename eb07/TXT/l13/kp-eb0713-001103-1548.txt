LAEVIUS, a Latin poet, whose age is unknown, but who probably lived before the age of Cicero. A poem of his, entitled Erotopagnia, or Love-Games, is quoted by Aulus Gellius. Apuleius also quotes six lines from the same poet, but he does not state from what work he borrowed them. Laevius had also composed a poem entitled the Ccntaurs, which Festus quotes under the title of Petrarum.
