LANCASTER, a town, the capital of the county of the same name, in the north of England, 239 miles from London. It is a sea-port, situated on the river Lune, along whose banks are some fine quays, on which are the warehouses of the several merchants and traders. The Lune is connected, by navigable canals, with the several rivers which run through England, by which great facilities are communicated for internal intercourse, and for dispersing the commodities which the trade of the town draws to it from America, the West Indies, and the Baltic. Lancaster is well built, and the streets properly paved. The church is a fine Gothic structure; and near to it is the castle, in which are the county jail, and the courts where the assizes are held. It is an ancient structure of the reign of Edward III.; on the top of it is a large square tower called John of Gauntâ€™s chair, from which is a fine prospect over the surrounding country. The markets are held on Wednesday and Saturday, and are well supplied. This town is governed by a mayor, recorder, aiderman, and bailiffs; and elects, as it did before the alteration, two members to the House of Commons. It formerly conferred the title of duke upon several members of the reigning family. The annual value of the real property, as assessed under the propertytaxin 1815, amounted to L.34,117. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 9030, in 1811 to 9247, in 1821 to 10,144, and in 1831 to 12,613.
