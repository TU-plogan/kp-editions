LYMPHATI was a name given by the Romans to such as were seized with madness. It is supposed to be used for Nymphaü, because the ancients imagined that every person who had the misfortune to see a nymph was instantly struck with frenzy. Lymphati may indeed signify madmen, as derived from lympha, water, over which element the nymphs were thought to preside; but ʹ it appears most likely that distracted people were called lymphati, from the circumstance of madmen being affected with the hydrophobia, or dread of water, after the bite of a mad dog; for this peculiarity, in cases of canine madness, was not unknown to the Romans.
