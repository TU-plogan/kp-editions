LINCOLN, a city, the capital of the county of that name, 133 miles from London, situated at the bottom, on the side, and the top of a lofty hill, which rises from the banks of the river Wilham. It was formerly walled, and the castle, now converted into the county prison, still remains. The cathedral is on the summit of the hill, and is a most conspicuous object from an extensive surrounding country. It is a magnificent fabric, with two towers at the western front. It was found to be one of the richest in gold, silver, and precious stones, of any of the religious institutions of the kingdom in the reign of Henry VIII. and is still the seat of the largest of all the bishoprics. The city as a whole is not well built, and the streets leading from the lower to the upper town are too steep to be ascended by carriages, which make use of a circular road round the face of the hill, without the city. The town is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, and two sheriffs, and returns, as before, two members to parliament. The assizes and elections for the county are held here. It has no manufactures; and not much trade, what little there is, is carried on by the river William, which has a communication with the Trent, through the Foss Dyke. The city has an exempted jurisdiction, within a circuit of nearly twenty miles. It contains, besides the cathedral, ten parish churches, and seventeen parishes. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 4909, in 1811 to 8861, in 1821 to 10,367, and in 1831 to 11,892.
