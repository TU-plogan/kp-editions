LITCHFIELD, a city in the hundred of Offlow, in Staffordshire, situated upon a branch of the river Trent, 119 miles from London by Coventry, and 124 by Northampton. It has been an episcopal city almost from the introduction of Christianity into this island; and the cathedral is said to have been first built in the year 300. It is a fine building, walled in like a castle, and, from its elevated situation, a prominent object over a great extent of country. A spire rises from the centre, 256 feet in height; and at the west end are two towers, terminating also in spires. This city was for a short period in the eighth century made the see of an archbishop; but was soon afterwards reduced again to a bishopric. In the year 1072, it was removed to Chester, and in 1102 to Coventry, and united to that see. The cathedral is a fine piece of architecture, and the interior is adorned with some marble monuments, particularly those of Dr Johnson and Mr Garrick, both natives of the city. The government is executed by a corporation consisting of two bailiffs and twenty-four burgesses, and sends, as before the passing of the reform act, two members to parliament. It is a county, with exempt jurisdiction. There is little trade, except what is internally carried on upon the canals. It has markets on Tuesdays and Fridays. The population amounted in 1801 to 4712, in 1811 to 5022, in 1821 to 6075, and in 1831 to 6723.

Litchfield, a county of Connecticut, United States, bounded on the north by Massachusetts, on the east by Hartford, on the south-east by New Haven, on the southwest by Fairfield, and on the west by New York. The face of the country is rough and mountainous; but the soil is good, yielding excellent crops of wheat and Indian corn, and affording fine pasturage. From the inland situation of the county, no maritime commerce can be carried on, and the inhabitants are almost wholly engaged in agricultural and manufacturing pursuits. The population amounted in 1830 to 42,855.

Litchfield, the capital of the above county, a posttown, situated about thirty miles west of Hartford, and thirty-one north-north-west of New Haven. The situation is elevated, and affords a beautiful and extensive prospect of the surrounding country. The town contains a courthouse, a jail, a female academy, a law-school, a printing establishment, a bank, and nine places of worship. It is a good agricultural town, and possesses numerous mills and manufacturing establishments, cotton manufactories, ironworks, &c. Long. 73. 37. W. Lat. 4L 50. N. The population amounted in 1830 to 4456.
