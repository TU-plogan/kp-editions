LOOP, in the iron-works, is a part of a sow or block of cast iron broken or melted off from the rest, and prepared for the forge or hammer. The usual method is, to break off the loop of about three quarters of a hundredweight. This loop is taken up with slinging-tongs, and beaten with iron sledges till it be brought to a square mass of about two feet long, which is called a bloom.
