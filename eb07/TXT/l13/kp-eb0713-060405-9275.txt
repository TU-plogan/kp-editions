LYCAEUM, Auxε∕ov, in Antiquity, the name of a celebrated school or academy at Athens, where Aristotle explained his philosophy. The place was composed of portico - and trees planted in the quincunx form, where the philosophers disputed walking. Hence the philosophy of the Lycaeum is used to signify the philosophy of Aristotle, or the peripatetic philosophy. Suidas observes, that the Lycaeum[7:13:605] took its name from its having been originally a temple of Apollo Lycaeus, or rather a porticoor gallery built by Lycaeus, son of Apollo; but others state that it had been built either by Pisistratus or by Pericles.
