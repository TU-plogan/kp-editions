LINLITHGOW, the capital of the county of that name, and once a place of some importance, is pleasantly situated on the bank of a fine lake, sixteen miles west from Edinburgh, and thirty-one east from Glasgow. It consists chiefly of a single street, running east and west along the south bank of the lake, containing many substantial though old houses; and is gradually improving in appearance, in consequence of the increasing number of modern buildings. The name Linlithgow is supposed by some tυ signify the concavity of the Lin or Loch, and according to others the lake of the sheltered valley. It is a very ancient town, having been the residence of royalty, and hence was entitled to be called a king’s burgh in the twelfth century. It possesses an old palace or castle built by David I., which was destroyed by fire in 1745, and has not since been repaired. It has also a very ancient church, built in the Gothic style, ornamented with a spire of some height; and three dissenting meeting-houses. Though the town is very dull in appearance, the inhabitants are by no means inactive. The tanning of leather, for which the adjoining lake affords great convenience, is carried on to a considerable extent; as also the craft of shoemaking. Linen and woollen manufactures are pretty extensive, and there is a large calico-printing establishment about a mile from the town. It receives great advantage from the Union Canal, which passes in the immediate vicinity, for transporting goods to the capital. There is a weekly stock market held on Friday. The population in 1831 amounted to 4874.
