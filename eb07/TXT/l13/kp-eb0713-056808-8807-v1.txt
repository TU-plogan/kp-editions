LOT and Garonne, a department of France, formed out of those parts of the ancient government of Guienne denominated Condomois and Agenois. It extends in north latitude from 43. 58. to 44. 45. and in longitude from 0. 21. east, to 0. 49. west, containing 2249 square miles, or 532,640 hectares, of which 306,720 are under the plough, 65,320 are vineyards, 59,640 are woods and forests, 32,726 are meadows, 52,704 are uncultivated, 6816 are marshes, and the remainder are the courses of rivers and the sites of towns and villages. It is bounded on the north by the departments of the Gironde and of the Dordogne, on the east by those of the Lot and the Tarn-Garonne, on the south by Gers, and on the west by the Gironde. It is divided into four arrondissements, twenty-nine cantons, and 435 communes, and contains 326,850 inhabitants, of whom about 30,000 are Protestants, and the remainder adhere to the Roman Catholic church. It is a lofty plain, intersected with deep valleys, the hills bounding which are covered with vines, whilst the bottoms have streams bordered by fertile meadows. The two chief rivers, the Lot and the Garonne, are navigable for barges the whole length of the department, and receive the waters of numerous tributary streams. The soil is generally fertile, and though, from attachment to old and slovenly customs, agriculture is ill conducted, as much corn is produced as enables one fourth of the crops to be disposed of to the neighbouring departments. The land is chiefly occupied by small farmers, who pay their rent by delivering half the crops to the owner. Besides corn, much hemp of excellent quality is raised, and also some flax. A vast quantity of fruit is produced. The wine is generally of a medium quality; but some of great estimation is made in Thezac, Perigord, Lavocal, and Clairac. The forests, besides fire and building wood, yield tar, turpentine, and pitch, and considerable quantities of cork. A great number of bees are kept, which make much honey and wax; and it is said that two millions of geese are maintained. The only mines are those of iron, which furnish yearly about 1400 tons, the greater part of which is manufactured for home consumption into various kinds of hardware. There are some manufactures of sailcloth and other linens, and of woollens, leather, glass, paper, and snuff from tobacco grown in several parts. One of the most extensive employments is that of cork-cutting, which is said to supply more than thirty millions of corks. The members chosen for the legislative body are three. The capital is the city of Agen.
