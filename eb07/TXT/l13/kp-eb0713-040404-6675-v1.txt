LOBO, Jerome, a Jesuit missionary, was born at Lisbon in the year 1593. He became a member of the society of Jesus at the age of sixteen, and in 1622 went out as a missionary to the East Indies. After making some stay at Goa, he sailed to the coast of Mozambique; and subsequently penetrated into Abyssinia, where his zeal and resolution drew upon him the hatred of the monks, in consequence of which he incurred much danger and suffering. On his return to Portugal he was shipwrecked on the coast of Natal, where seven months were spent in constructing shallops to bring away the survivors. One of these foundered, but that in which Father Lobo sailed arrived safe at Angola. After a variety of adventures he arrived at Lisbon; and he employed himself in the cause of the Ethiopian mission both at Madrid and Rome. He made a second voyage to the Indies, where he was appointed rector of the house at Goa. But he returned to Lisbon in 1658, and was chosen rector of the college of Coimbra, where he died in 1678, at the age of eighty-four. Lobo wrote an historical account of Abyssinia in the Portuguese language, which contains information both curious and valuable. It was translated into French by the Abbé Legrand, in 1728, in 4to; and the earliest production of Dr Samuel Johnson was an abridged version of this work into English.
