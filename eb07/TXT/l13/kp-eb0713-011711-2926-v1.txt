LATHE, a very useful engine for the turning of wood, ivory, metals, and other materials. The invention of the lathe is very ancient. According to Diodorus Siculus, the first who used it was a grandson of Daedalus, named Talus. Pliny ascribes it to Theodore of Samos, and mentions one Thericles, who rendered himself famous by his dexterity in managing the lathe. With this instrument the ancients turned all kinds of vases, many of which they enriched with figures and ornaments in bas-relief. The Greek and Latin authcrs make frequent mention of the lathe; and Cicero calls the workmen who used it vascularii. It was a proverb amongst the ancients, to say a thing wa3 formed in the lathe, in order to express its delicacy and justness. The lathe is composed of two wooden cheeks or sides, parallel to the horizon, having a groove or opening between, and perpendicular to these are two other pieces called puppets, made to slide between the cheeks, and to be fixed down at any point.at pleasure. These have two points, between which the piece to be turned is sustained. The piece is turned round backwards and forwards by means of a string put round it, and fastened above to the end of a pliable pole, and underneath to a treadle or board moved with the toot. There is also a rest which bears up the tool, and keeps it steady. As it is the use and application of this instrument that forms the greatest part of the art of turning, we refer for the particular description of it, as well as [7:13:118] the manner of applying it in various works, to that head. See Turning.
