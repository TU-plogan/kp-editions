LANGLAND, or Longlande, Robert, an old English poet, who flourished about 1350, He was a secular priest, and a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford. He is said to have been born in Shropshire. He wrote the Visions of Pierce Plowman, a piece which abounds with imagination and humour, though dressed to great disadvantage in very uncouth versification and obsolete language. It is written without rhyme, an ornament which the poet has endeavoured to supply by making every verse begin with the same letter. Dr Hickes observes, that this kind of alliterative versification was adopted by Langland from the practice of the Saxon poets, and that these Visions abound with Saxonisms; he styles him celeberrimus ille satirographus, morum vindex acerrimus. Several poets attempted imitations of his visions, and the learned Selden mentions him with honour.
