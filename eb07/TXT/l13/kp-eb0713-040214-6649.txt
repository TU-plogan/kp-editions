LLANGOLLEN, a town of Wales, in the county of Denbigh and hundred of Chirck, 192 miles from London. It is in a most romantic situation on the river Dee, and on the great post road from London to Dublin. The bridge is an object of great curiosity. About two miles from it are the striking remains of Valle Cruces Abbey, and not far from it those of one of Owen Glendowerâ€™s castles. It has a market, which is held on Saturday. The population of the whole parish amounted in 1801 to 2658, in 1811 to 2897, in 1821 to 3535, and in 1831 to 4498.
