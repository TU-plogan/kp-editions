LOURISTAN, a mountainous district in the province of Irak, in Persia, where it borders on Khusistan. This extensive tract of country, which runs along the whole frontier of Khusistan, and extends as far to the east as the longitude of 50. and to the north as far as the latitude of 33. 40. is by far the richest and most fruitful part of Irak. From this mountainous tract several large rivers descend into the level province of Khusistan, and there is hardly a valley that is not watered by many lesser streams. The pasture is not luxuriant, and no attention is paid to agriculture; the inhabitants, the Illiats, preferring a wandering life, and principally subsisting on the produce of their flocks. They are a savage and fearless race, subject to no law but the will of their chiefs, and seem to differ only in name from the rude inhabitants of the same country in. the days of Alexander. They reside in black tents, even during the winter; and consequently, with the exception of Korumabad, there are no towns, and but few villages. They deduce their descent from a high antiquity, though they do not deny that their ancestors intermarried with several Turkish hordes which they had invited from Persia to settle amongst them.
