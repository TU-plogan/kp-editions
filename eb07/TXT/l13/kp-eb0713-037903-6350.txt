LITANY, a solemn form of supplication to God, in which the priest utters some things fit to be prayed for, and the people join in their intercession, saying we beseech thee to hear us, good Lord. The word comes from the Greek λ∕rαvua, supplication, from λ∕rαveυω, I beseech.

At first the use of litanies was not fixed to any stated time, but they were only employed as exigencies required. They were observed, in imitation of the Ninevites, with ardent supplications and fastings, to avert the threatening judgments of fire, earthquakes, inundations, or hostile invasions. About the year 400, litanies began to be used in processions, the people walking barefoot, and repeating them with great devotion; and it is pretended, that by this means several countries were delivered from great calamities. The days upon which these were used were called rogation days. These were appointed by the canons of different councils, till it was decreed by the council of Toledo that they should be employed every month throughout the year; and thus by degrees they came to be used weekly on Wednesdays and Fridays, the ancient stationary days for fasting. To these days the rubric of the episcopal church has added Sundays, as being the greatest days for assembling at divine service. Before the last review of the common prayer, the litany was a distinct service by itself, and performed some time after the morning prayer was over; at present it is made one office with the morning service, being ordered to be read after the third collect for grace, instead of the intercessional prayers in the daily service.
