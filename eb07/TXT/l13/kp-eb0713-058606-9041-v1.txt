LUCERNE, a canton in the centre of Switzerland, being surrounded by Arau, Schweitz, Unterwalden, Zug, and Berne. It is 792 square miles in extent. The southern part is covered with a portion of the lofty Alps, but the whole is elevated, the lake of the four forest cantons being 1320 feet above the level of the sea. There are, however, some extensive plains, with well-cultivated fields, which produce corn, potatoes, and, from die dairies, a great deal of butter and cheese. It is one of the cantons which produce more food than they consume. It is a highly picturesque country, from the height of its mountains and the rapidity and clearness of its streams. The inhabitants amount to about 100,000, chiefly adhering to the Romish church. A great portion of the land belongs to the church and other [7:13:587] corporate bodies. The taxes to the state are lower than in the other cantons. The constitution is that of an aristocratic republic, with a senate composed of sixty-four members chosen for life, and thirty-six for a shorter period. The canton is divided into three bailiwicks. The capital, of the same name, is built at the efflux of the river Reuss from the lake of the four forest cantons, or of Lucerne. It is surrounded with walls and towers, and contains five churches, two convents for men and two for females, 620 houses, and 5000 inhabitants. It has a lyceum, a gymnasium, and other schools. The inhabitants are active manufacturers of hats and hosiery, of printed calicoes, of leather, beer, vinegar, and some smaller articles, and carry on the chief trade of the canton, by means of which wine, sugar, coffee, and other foreign articles are disposed of.
