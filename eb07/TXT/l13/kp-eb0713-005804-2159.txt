LANFRANCO, Giovanni, an eminent Italian historical painter, born at Parma in 1581. He was first the disciple of Augustin, and, after his death, of Annibal Caracci, whose taste in design and colouring he so happily attained, that he was intrusted to execute some of his designs in the Farnese Palace at Rome. By order of Pope Urban VIII. he painted in St Peterâ€™s Church at Rome the representation of that saint walking on the water, which afforded the pope so much satisfaction that he knighted him. He died in 1647.
