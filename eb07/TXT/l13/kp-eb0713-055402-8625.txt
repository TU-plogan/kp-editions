LONGEVITY, the same as length of life. From the different longevities of men in the beginning of the world, after the Flood, and in subsequent ages, Mr Derham deduces an argument for the interposition of a divine Providence. Immediately after the creation, when the world was to be peopled by one man and one woman, the ordinary age was nine hundred and upwards. Immediately after the Deluge, when there were only three persons to stock the world, their age was cut shorter, and none of those patriarchs excepting Shem arrived at five hundred. In the second century we find none who reached two hundred and forty, and in the third none but Terah who arrived at two hundred years; the world, at least a part of it, by that time being so well peopled that they had built cities, and cantoned themselves out into distinct nations. By degrees, as the number of people increased, their longevity diminished, until at length it came down to seventy or eighty years. That the common duration of manâ€™s life has been the same in all ages since the above period, is plain both from sacred and profane history. Plato lived until he was eighty-one, and was accounted an old man; and the instances of longevity produced by Pliny (lib. vii. c. 48) as very extraordinary may most of them be matched in modern histories. In the following tables are collected into one point of view the most memorable instances of long-lived persons of whose respective ages we have any authentic records.

I Although longevity prevails more in certain districts of it in almost every quarter of the globe. This appears khan in others, yet it is by no means confined to any par-from the preceding table, as well as from that which is ticular nation or climate; nor are there wanting instances here subjoined.

We have seen a list of a hundred and four persons, one of whom died under a hundred and twenty years f age, and one of whom, it is said, lived to the prodigious ge of a hundred and eighty. Of these long-lived indivi-uals, forty-one belonged to England, sixteen to Scotland, nd twenty-four to Ireland.
