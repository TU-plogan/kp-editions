LITUUS, amongst the Romans, was the staff made use of by the augurs in quartering the heavens. It was crooked at one end, and thickest in the curved part, according to Aulus Gellius. Upon medals we frequently meet with a representation of it, amongst other pontifical instruments. It was called Lituus Quirinalis, from Quirinus, a name of Romulus.

Lituus was also an instrument of music in use in the Roman army. It was straight, excepting that it had a little bending at the upper end, like a lituus or sacred staff of the augurs; and from the similitude it derived its name.
