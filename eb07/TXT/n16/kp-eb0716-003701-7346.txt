NAVIGATORS ’ Islands, a group of islands in the Southern Pacific Ocean, remarkable for their extent, fertility, and population. They are about ten in number, and are situated between 169. and 172. 30. west longitude, and from latitude 13. 25. to an uncertain boundary southward. When seen from the ocean they present a lofty appearance, and are mountainous, but neither surrounded with a low border nor enclosed by reefs, like the Society Islands. The first discovery of these islands was made in 1722, by Roggewein and Bauman, who fell in with the easternmost of the number; whilst Bougainville, in 1768, added another; and Perouse, in 1787, discovered the two westernmost, which are the largest, being more than forty miles in length. The last navigator was informed of three more to the southward. The whole group was visited in 1791 by Captain Edwards. The inhabitants are a stout and well-made race, of the ordinary height of five feet nine or eleven inches. They are altogether savage in their manners, which are said to be remarkably profligate and indecent. They are also of the most ferocious dispositions. The least dispute between them is followed by blows from clubs, sticks, or paddles, and is often attended with the loss of life. They are very ingenious, and fashion their work dexterously with hatchets shaped like adzes, and made of very fine and compact basalts. With these they finish works in wood, and give them so high a polish that they appear to be coated with the finest varnish. They also manufacture a species of cloth which possesses great strength and pliability, and is well calculated for the sails of canoes. The name of Navigators’ Islands was bestowed by Bougainville, from the practice which prevails amongst the inhabitants of continually travelling in canoes. We have no data upon which we can calculate the amount of the population; but it must be considerable, considering that these islands are amongst the largest and most fertile in the South Seas.
