NEOMENIA, or Noumenia, a festival of the ancient Greeks, celebrated at the beginning of every lunar month. As the name imports, it was observed upon the day of the new moon, in honour of all the gods, but especially Apollo, who was called Neomenios, because the sun is the fountain of light; and whatever distinction of times and seasons may be made on account of other planets, yet they are all owing to him as the original of those borrowed rays by which they shine. The games and public entertainments at these festivals were provided by the rich, to whose tables the poor flocked in great numbers. The Athenians at these times offered solemn prayers and sacrifices for the prosperity of their country during the ensuing month.

The Jews had also their neomenia, or feast of the new moon, on which peculiar sacrifices were appointed; on this day also they had a sort of family entertainment and rejoicing. But the most celebrated neomenia was that at the beginning of the civil year, or first day of the month Tisri, on which no servile labour was performed; and the people then offered particular burnt sacrifices, sounding the trumpets of the temple. The modern Jews keep the neomenia only as a feast of devotion, which any one may observe or not as he pleases.
