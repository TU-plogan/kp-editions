NISIBIN, a village of Persia, in the pachalik of Bagdad, which was in ancient times the celebrated fortress of Nisibis, and, from the time of Lucullus until the decline of the empire, was regarded by the Romans as the firmest bulwark of the East. This city was taken by Lucullus, from Tigranes, king of Armenia. It was three times besieged by the king of Persia, who, by the treaty of Dura, at last obtained quiet possession of the fortress, which had successfully resisted the utmost efforts of his arms. Niâˆ™ sihis, in the hands of the Persians, braved the attacks of successive emperors, and baffled the military talents of Belisarius; until at last, after the final overthrow of the house of Artaxerxes, it was reduced, along with the other cities of Mesopotamia, under the power of the Saracens. The foundations of the walls, and several detached towers, as well as part of the church built in honour of St James, who was formerly bishop of Nisibis, are still standing. They overlook the little but rapid river Mygdonius, and are approached by a small Roman bridge of twelve arches. To the west there is a view of the lofty mountains of Sinjar, covered with verdure; and the prospect to the north and east is bounded by the ridge of Mount Masius, forming a vast amphitheatre, at the extremity of which, in a clear day, may be descried the distant turrets of Merdin. The adjacent country has a pleasing appearance, the numberless villages which overspread the plains being built wholly on conical hills, bearing a striking resemblance to our feudal castles. Grecian and Roman coins, with other antiquities, are frequently dug out of the ruins. The black tents of the Kurds now cover the greater part of the city. Nisibin is seventy-eight miles south-east of Diarbekir, and seventy north-west of Mosul.
