NEW GALLOWAY, a small royal burgh of Scotland, in the centre of the stewartry of Kircudbright. It is pleasantly situated on the western bank of the Ken. The town is formed of a single street, stretching along the public road. The parish church is about half a mile from the town, on the north side. There is attached to the townhouse a criminal and debtor’s jail, surmounted by a steeple and town clock. Below the town a handsome stone bridge was erected over the river in 1822. The inhabitants are entirely supported by the retail trade arising from the demands of the population of the surrounding country. It was erected into a royal burgh in 1629. By the set or constitution which, in 1708, received the sanction of the convention of royal burghs, the town ought to be governed by a provost, two bailies, a treasurer, and fifteen councillors; but as the parliamentary constituency do not amount to that number, the council is never complete. It has no funds or property of any description, with the exception of customs and small dues, which do not amount to L.3 yearly. It returns a member to parliament along with Wigton, Stranraer, and Whithorn. The population amounts to about 500.
