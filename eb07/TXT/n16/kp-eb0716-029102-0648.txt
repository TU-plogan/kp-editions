NOVEMVIRI, nine magistrates of Athens, whose government lasted but for one year. The first of them was called archon, or prince; the second basileu,s, or king; the third polemarchus, or general of the army; the other six were called thesmothetae, or lawgivers. They took an oath to observe the laws, and, in case of failure, obliged themselves to bestow upon the commonwealth a statue of gold as large as themselves. Those who discharged their office with honour were received into the number of the senators of Areopagus.
