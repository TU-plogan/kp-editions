NENIA, or Naenia, in ancient Latin poetry, a kind of funeral song sung to the music of flutes at the obsequies of the dead. Authors represent the naenia as sorry compositions, sung by hired female mourners, called praeficae. The first rise of these naenia are ascribed to the physicians. In the heathen antiquity, the goddess of tears and funerals was called Nenia, whom some suppose to have given that name to the funeral song, and others to have taken her name from it.
