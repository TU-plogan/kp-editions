NUYTS, Peter, a native of Holland, and a leading character in that extraordinary transaction which happened between the Japanese and the Dutch about the year 1628. In 1627 Nuyts arrived in Batavia from Holland, and was in the same year appointed ambassador to the emperor of Japan, by the governor and council of Batavia. He repaired to that empire in 1628; and being a man of a haughty disposition, and extremely vain, he believed it practicable to pass upon the natives for an ambassador from the king of Holland. Upon his assuming this title and rank, he was much more honourably received, caressed, and respected than former ministers had been. But he was soon detected, reprimanded, and reproached in the severest manner, sent back to the port, and ordered to return to Batavia with all the circumstances of disgrace imaginable; notwithstanding which, his interest was so great, that, instead of being punished as he deserved, he was immediately afterwards promoted to the government of the island of Formosa, of which he took possession in the following year. He entered upon the administration of affairs in that island with the same disposition that he had shown whilst ambassador, and with the most implacable resentment against the Japanese; neither was it long before an opportunity offered, as he thought, of revenging himself on them to the full. Two large Japanese ships, with upwards of five hundred men on board, came into the port, upon which he took it into his head to disarm and unrig them, in the same manner as the Dutch vessels are treated at Japan. The Japanese did all they could to defend themselves from this ill usage; but at last, for want of water, they were forced to submit. Governor Nuyts went still farther. When they had finished their affairs at Formosa, and were desirous of proceeding, according to their instructions, to China, he put them off with fair words and fine promises, till the monsoon was over. They then began to be very impatient, and desired to have their cannon and sails restored, that they might return home; but the governor had recourse to new artifices, and, by a series of false promises, endeavoured to prevent them from making use of the season most proper for that voyage. The Japanese, however, soon perceived his design, and at length, by a bold attempt, accomplished what, by fair means and humble entreaty, they could not obtain; for, by a daring and well concerted effort, they took him prisoner, and compelled him and one of the council to sign a treaty for securing their liberty, free departure, and indemnity, which was afterwards ratified by the whole council. Nuyts was first confined in Batavia, and afterwards delivered up to the Japanese, notwithstanding the most earnest entreaties on his part to be tried, and even to suffer any kind of death, where he was, rather than to be sent to Japan. Thither, however, he was sent in 1634, when he was submitted to the mercy or discretion of the emperor; and the consequence was, that, though imprisoned, he was well used, and could go anywhere, provided his guards were with him, which was more than he could possibly have expected. He now looked for nothing but the continuance of his confinement for life. On a particular occasion, however, namely, the funeral of the emperorâ€™s father, he was, at the request of the Dutch, set free, and returned again to Batavia, to the surprise of the people of that settlement, who adopted ever afterwards a very different conduct with respect to the Japanese.
