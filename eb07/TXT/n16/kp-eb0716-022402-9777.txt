NIGRITIA, Negroland, or Soudan, a general name for a considerable portion of the interior of Africa, some parts of which are as yet unknown, while some have been only recently explored by Clapperton, De Caille, Lander, and others. It comprises a great number of kingdoms, large and small, each of which will be found described under its own head. It appears to include all those countries which are situated between the sixth and seventeenth degrees of north latitude, and the eighth degree of west and thirty-second degree of east longitude. They are represented in maps as stretching along both sides of the Niger, and cluster around the great Lake Tshad or Shary. Still farther to the east, in the neighbourhood of the Bahr-el-Abiad or White River, one of the great branches of the Nile, is the country of the Shilluks, comprising Donga, Kordofan, Darfur, and Bergoo. The other chief states are Bambarra, Timbuctoo, and Kong, on the west; and Houssa, Burgou, Yarriba, Nouffe or Nyffe, Fundah, Bornou, Mandara, Be-gharmi, Kanem, and others, in the centre. These, although widely scattered, will, if taken as a whole, be found to be bounded on the north by the Sahara, on the east by Nubia, on the south by the Mountains of the Moon and Lower Guinea, and on the west by Senegambia. As thus defined, Nigritia is about 2500 miles from west to east, 500 from north to south, and has a superficial area of 1,250,000 square miles. A considerable portion of this territory is traversed by the Niger. In the centre is Lake Tshad, into which some large rivers empty themselves. For an account of this vast inland sea, and the surrounding country, the reader is referred to the article Bornou. There are several high ranges of mountains, such as those of Kong and Donga; some of the summits of the Mountains of the Moon are covered with perpetual snow. The nature of the climate, the productions and other particulars regarding this portion of Africa, will be found described in the article Africa.
