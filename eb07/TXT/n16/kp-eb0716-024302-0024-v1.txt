NORDEN, Frederick Louis, an ingenious traveller and naval officer in the Danish service, was born at Gluckstadt, in Holstein, in the year 1708. He was well skilled in the mathematics, ship-building, and especially in architecture; and in 1732 he obtained a pension to enable him to travel for the purpose of studying the construction of ships, particularly that of the galleys and other rowing vessels used in the Mediterranean. He spent nearly three years in Italy; but Christian VI. being desirous of obtaining a circumstantial account of Egypt, Mr Norden, whilst at Florence, received an order to extend his travels to that country. How he acquitted himself of this commission appears from his Travels into Egypt and Nubia, printed at Copenhagen in 1756, and which were soon afterwards translated into English by Dr Peter Templeman. In the war between England and Spain, Mr Norden, then a captain in the Danish navy, attended Count Ulric Adolphus to England, whence they went out as volunteers under Sir John Norris, and afterwards under Sir Chaloner Ogle. During his stay in London, Mr Norden was made a fellow of the Royal Society, and gave the public drawings of some ruins and colossal statues at Thebes, in Egypt, with an account of the same in a letter to the Royal Society, 1741. His health was at this time declining, and having repaired to France, he died at Paris in 1742.

Norden, a seaport town of the kingdom of Hanover, in the province of East Friesland, and the capital of the bailiwick of the same name. It stands at the mouth of the river Leysand, but the harbour is not good; and it contains 814 houses, with 4917 inhabitants. It is much resorted to in the summer as a sea-bathing place, and there are several distilleries and breweries, with some export of corn. Long. 7. 6. 1. E. Lat. 53. 35. 57. N.
