NEGAPATAM, a considerable seaport in the south of India, and province of Tanjore. It is well fortified, and has a regular citadel of a pentagonal form, with wet ditches. It has no considerable trade; but is frequently touched at by ships for refreshments, which are plentiful. The town lies at the north side of the citadel, near which is the mouth of a small river, capable of receiving vessels which draw little water. At the mouth of the river there is a bar, over which the surf breaks with great violence in bad weather, and renders the entrance dangerous. The anchoring place is about three miles from the shore, opposite the town, where there is very little current; and to the south-east of the town, at the distance of five miles, there is a shoal above five miles in length, having from three to six fathoms water on it. It was originally a small village, but was fortified and improved by the Portuguese. In 1660, it was taken from them by the Dutch, who strengthened its fortifications, and made it the capital of their settlements on the Coromandel coast, where they established a mint. Under their rule it enjoyed a long period of tranquillity; its trade increased, and it became a very flourishing city. In 1781 it was besieged and taken by the British with about 4000 troops, and was finally ceded to them at the peace of 1783; since which period the fortifications have been neglected, and the trade has been transferred to other places.
