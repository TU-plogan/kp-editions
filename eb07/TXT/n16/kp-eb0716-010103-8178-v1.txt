NEPOMUK, a town of the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia, in the circle of Klattau, adjoining to which are some extensive iron-works and mines, on the hill called the Gruneburg, belonging to Prince Colloredo. It is a place highly venerated, from having given birth to John Nepomuk, in the year 1320. That person is reported to have been confessor to the queen, whose chastity was suspected by her spouse. He demanded of the confessor the revelation of what had passed in the confession; but Nepomuk refused to disclose it. For this he was bound hand and foot; and still refusing to discover the secrets, was in that condition thrown into the Moldau and drowned. He was afterwards, for this conduct, canonized by the pope, and included in the catalogue of martyrs. He thus became the tutelar saint of the Bohemian Catholics.
