NEMESIS, in pagan worship, the daughter of Jupiter and Necessity, or, according to others, of Oceanus and [7:16:93]Nox, and who had the care of revenging the crimes which human justice left unpunished. She was also called Ad-rastaea, because Adrastus king of Argos was the first who raised to her an altar; and Rhamnusia, from her having a magnificent temple at Rhamnus in Attica. She had likewise a temple in the Capitol at Rome. Nemesis is represented with a stern countenance, holding a whip in one hand and a pair of scales in the other.
