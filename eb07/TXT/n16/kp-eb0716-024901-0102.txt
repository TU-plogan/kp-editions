NORTHALLERTON, a borough, market-town, and parish, in the north riding of the county of York, 225 miles north-north-west from London. It is situated on the side of an eminence, which, rising from the banks of a branch of the river Swale, called the Wiske, slopes gently towards the east, and consists chiefly of one broad street about half a mile in length. It is surrounded by an exceedingly rich and fertile tract of country, the parish alone containing 13,000 acres of land. The market-place is spacious, and is surrounded by commodious houses, built principally of brick. The town was formerly celebrated for its fine ales; its chief manufactures at the present time are those of leather and linen. The church is a handsome Gothic structure, built in the form of a cross, and containing several fine old monuments. There is likewise a grammar school, of ancient but uncertain foundation. A new prison was erected, as a relief to the county jail of York, several years ago, according to a plan of Howard. Here was formerly a castle, as well as a convent for nuns; but no vestige of either now remains. This town has a weekly market on the Wednesdays, and five fairs are held during the year. At a short distance from the town was fought the celebrated battle of the Standard, in the year 1138, between the English and the Scots, when the latter were defeated. The government of the borough is vested in a bailiff, deputed by the Bishop of Durham, who is lord of the manor; and it returns two members to parliament. The population of the parish amounted in 1821 to 4431, and in 1831 to 5118; that of the borough amounted in 1821 to 2626, and in 1831 to 3004.
