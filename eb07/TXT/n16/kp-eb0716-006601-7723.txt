NAXIA, the anxient Naxos, is one of the largest and most fertile of the islands in the Archipelago, known as the Cyclades. Its greatest length from north to south is seventeen miles, and its greatest breadth about twelve miles. The north point is in latitude 37. 12. Although the rocks are of a most repulsive appearance, yet the island is diversified by hills, valleys, and plains, and is well wooded and watered. Besides the city of its name, it contains thirty-five villages, and a population of about 17,000 persons. It produces corn equal to six monthsâ€™ consumption, and a surplus of oil, fruits, and cheese. Large quantities of oranges and lemons are exported. There is no port on the island for ships to enter.
