NOMENCLATURE, Nomenclatura, a catalogue of several of the more useful or radical words in any language, with their significations, compiled in order to facilitate the use of such words to those who are to learn the tongue, such as the Latin, Greek, French, and Italian nomenclatures: or it is a system of technical language, by which the objects of any science are denoted, as, for instance, the present language of chemical science, usually called the “new chemical nomenclature,” from its recent construction.
