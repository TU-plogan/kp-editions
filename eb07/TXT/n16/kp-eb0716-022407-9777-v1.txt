NILCUND, a town of Northern Hindustan, and one of the celebrated places of Hindu pilgrimage, situated among the Himalaya Mountains, on the frontiers of Thibet. The cold at this place is intense; and at the end of June or beginning of August, when it is chiefly visited, the road is nearly impassable on account of the depth of snow. Avalanches are common on the road, and glaciers are seen in various parts. In the vicinity of this place there is a colossal statue of Gunneis; but the temple is dedicated to Mahadeva, one of whose numerous names is Nilcund, or Blue Throat. Long. 88. 50. E. Lat. 27. 51. N.
