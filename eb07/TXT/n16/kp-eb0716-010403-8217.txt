NESHIN, a circle in the Russian province Tschernigow, extending in north latitude from 50. 32. to 52. 26. and in east longitude from 21. 19. to 22. 43. It is one of the most extensive but poorest portions of the ancient Ukraine. The capital is a city of the same name, situated on the river Ostin, 822 miles from St Petersburg, and is the best built city, not only of the province, but of the country which was formerly known as Little Russia. It is surrounded with walls and defended by a citadel; and it contains fifteen churches, 3000 houses, and 16,500 industrious inhabitants. There are several establishments of Greeks and Arminians, who have manufactories of silk goods, soap, leather, liqueurs, and especially of perfumery, which is dispersed throughout the whole of Russia, and sent into Moldavia, Poland, Hungary, and even to Vienna. There are three great annual fairs, at which much business is transacted in wool, tobacco, honey, wax, salt, and manufactured goods. Public schools are maintained for instruction in the classical languages, and in modern Greek. It is situated in north latitude 51. 2. 45. and east longitude 21. 44. 25.
