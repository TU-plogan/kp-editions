NESSUS, in fabulous history, was a celebrated Centaur, the son of Ixion and a Cloud. He offered violence to Dejanira, whom Hercules had intrusted to his care, with orders to carry her across the river Evenus. Hercules saw the distress of his wife from the opposite shore of the river, and immediately let fly one of his poisoned arrows, which struck the Centaur to the heart. Nessus, as he expired, gave the tunic which he then wore to Dejanira, assuring her that from the poisoned blood which flowed from his wound it had received the power of calling a husband away from unlawful loves. Dejanira received it with pleasure, and this mournful present caused the death of Hercules.
