NERBUDDAH, a large river of Hindustan, in the province of Gundwana, which, after a course of 750 miles, falls into the Gulf of Cambay. This river has its source at Omercuntuc, in the above province, close to that of. the Soane. The Mahanuddy has also its source in the same mountain. A Hindu temple is found in the centre of the table-land at Omercuntuc; and here the Nerbuddah rises from a small well, and flows along in a smooth stream, until it is precipitated into the Mundlah. This is described as a great fall by the natives; and the river at the foot of the table-land expands into a wide surface, and, being joined by other streams, assumes the appearance of a large river. From this point its course is due west, with the straightest course of any river perhaps in the world. It passes through Gundwana, Khandesh, Mulwah, and Gujerat, and, after passing the city of Broach, falls into the Gulf of Cambay, and is navigable for boats to a considerable distance. This river was in former times the boundary between Hindustan Proper and the Deccan or southern peninsula. It is sometimes called the Reva.
