NOVATIANS, Novatiani, a sect of ancient heretics, who arose towards the close of the third century, and were so called from Novatian, a priest of Rome. They were also denominated Cathari or Puritans. Novatian first separated from the communion of Pope Cornelius, on pretence of his being too easy in admitting to repentance those who had fallen off in times of persecution. Novatus coming to Rome, joined himself to the faction of Novatian, and both maintained that there was no other admission into the church but by the repentance in baptism, grounding their opinion on the words of St Paul: “It is impossible for those önee enlightened, and who have tasted the heavenly gift, if they fall away, to renew themselves by repentance.” Not that they denied but a person who had fallen into any sin, however grievous, might obtain pardon by repentance; for the Novatians themselves recommended repentance in the strongest terms. But their doctrine was, that the church had not the power to receive sinners into its communion, as having no way of remitting sins but by baptism, which, once received, could not be repeated. In process of time the Novatians softened and moderated the rigour of their master’s doctrine, and only refused absolution to very great sinners. The two leaders were proscribed, and declared heretics, not for excluding penitents from communion, but for denying that the church had a power of remitting sins.
