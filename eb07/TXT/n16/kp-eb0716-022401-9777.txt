NIGIDIUS FIGULUS, Publius, one of the most learned men of ancient Rome, who flourished at the same time with Cicero. He wrote on various subjects, but his pieces appeared so refined and difficult that they were not regarded. He assisted Cicero, with great prudence, in defeating Catilineâ€™s conspiracy, and did him many services in the time of his adversity. He adhered to Pompey in opposition to Caesar, which occasioned his exile; and he died in banishment. Cicero, who had always entertained the highest esteem for him, wrote to him a beautiful consolatory letter, the thirteenth of the fourth book of his Epistolae ad Familiares.
