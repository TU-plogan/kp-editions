NUNIA, a village of Irak Arabi, about three quarters of a mile from the Tigris, opposite to Mosul. It is supposed to be the site of the ancient Nineveh. The history of this metropolis is lost in succeeding ages, and it appears to have fallen into decay after the building of Babylon; indeed in the reign of Hadrian it was so completely destroyed, that even the place where it stood was unknown. A city erected afterwards near the spot was called Ninus; and Mr Kinneir is of opinion that it is the ruins of the latter, and not those of old Nineveh, that are still visible. He mentions that he examined these remains in 1810, and that they consisted of a rampart and fosse, forming an oblong square four miles in compass. The wall is on an average twenty feet in height, and is covered with grass, like the Roman intrenchments in England.
