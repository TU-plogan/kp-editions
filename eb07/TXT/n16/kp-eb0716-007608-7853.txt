NEGADA, more properly Anegada, the most northern of the cluster of islands known by the name of the Virgin Islands, in the West Indies, and unhappily celebrated for the number of shipwrecks, in many cases accompanied with a heavy loss of life, which it has occasioned. It was first permanently settled by individuals who hoped to reap considerable advantages by collecting the spoil of the vessels wrecked on its inhospitable shores. They found that the loose ground which covered it was capable of bearing provision crops, and even cotton; whilst the rearing of stock, and the sale of the underwood, which was progressively cleared away, and, being very full of gum, had a preference in the market of St Thomas, furnished a further resource. The great object, however, always has been the wreck of vessels; and the indolence of the inhabitants is only thoroughly roused by the cry of “a vessel on the reefs.” The moment this is raised, all becomes activity and bustle. Boats and small craft of every description push off towards the scene of destruction, and both skill and intrepidity are exercised to the uttermost to get first on board. The surface of Anegada is the production of the tribe of lithophytae, based, it is presumed, on a submarine elevation. The appearance of the island when approached is remarkable. First, single trees show themselves on the horizon; then the most elevated part of the island, called Frank’s Landing, which may be descried eight miles off in clear weather; and, last of all, the lower land. Its greatest length is 10∙07 English miles, and its greatest breadth, which is about the middle, 4∙25 English miles; but it afterwards diminishes towards both extremities. The reef by which it is surrounded approaches nearest on the north side of the island, where at one point it unites with the shore. Generally speaking, the distance of the reef from the island is inconsiderable on the northern, west [7:16:77]ern, and partly on the southern side. To the eye Anegada appears a dead flat, with only a turpentine or loblolly tree overlooking the underwood. However, the ground rises gradually from north to south, about sixty feet. There is some rather productive soil on the island, and a great number of ponds, which, in long-continued dry weather, produce considerable quantities of salt. There is abundance of fresh water; and the surrounding sea abounds with good fish, as do also the ponds. There are some rare specimens of plants in Anegada. The feathered tribes are very numerous; and there is an abundance of domestic animals. The population of Anegada consists at present of eleven white and twenty-one coloured and black families.
