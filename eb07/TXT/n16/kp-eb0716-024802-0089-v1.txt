NORRKOPING, a city of Sweden, in the province of Linkoping. It stands on both sides of the river Motala, and is connected together by a bridge of boats. It is a moderately built town; one side of the river rising against the side of a hill, the other part being almost level with the water. The streets are wide and well paved, and there are some handsome squares, with a fine market-place. It contains three churches, one of which is for the Germans. There are several institutions for instruction and for charitable purposes. In 1834, it contained about 2000 houses and 10,500 inhabitants. It is the principal place of trade in the kingdom, next to Stockholm. It lias some large fabrics of cutlery, and of all kinds of iron and copper Ware. There are refineries for sugar and salt, some weavers of linen, cotton, and woollen goods, manufactories of soap and leather, and conveniences for building ships. The export trade consists of iron, steel, and copper in bars or -in manufactured articles; in timber, pitch, tar, cordage, and sometimes salted fish. As the river is not more than twelve feet in depth, the larger ships are compelled to take in and discharge their cargoes a little below the city. Long. 16. 5. 24. E. Lat. 58. 36. 5. N.
