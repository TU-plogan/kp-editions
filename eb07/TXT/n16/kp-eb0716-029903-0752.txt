NUMA Pompilius, the fourth son of Pompilius Pompo, an illustrious Sabine. Having married Tatia, the daughter of King Tatius, he remained with her in his native country, preferring the tranquillity of a private life to the splendour of a court. Upon the death of his wife, with whom he had lived thirteen years, he gave himself up entirely to the study of w isdom; and, leaving the city of Cures, confined himself to the country, wandering from solitude to solitude, in search only of those woods and fountains which religion had consecrated. His recluse life gave rise to the fable, which was very early received amongst the Sabines, that Numa lived in familiarity with the nymph Egeria. Upon the death of Romulus, both the senate and people strongly solicited him to become their king. They despatched Julius Proculus and Valerius Volesus, two senators of distinction, to acquaint Numa with their resolution, and make him an offer of the kingdom. The Sabine philosopher at first rejected their proposal; but being at last prevailed upon by the arguments and entreaties of the deputies, joined with those of his father, and of Martius his near relation, he at length yielded, and having offered sacrifices to the gods, set out for Rome, where he was received by all ranks of people with loud shouts of joy.

After a reign of forty-two years, during which he had given every possible encouragement to the useful arts, and in which he had cultivated peace, Numa died in the year of Rome 82. Not only the Romans, but also the neighbouring nations, were eager to pay respect to the memory of a monarch whom they revered for his abilities, moderation, and humanity. He forbade his body to be burned, according to the custom of the Romans, and ordered it to be buried near Mount Janiculum, along with many of the books which he had written. These books were accidentally found by one of the Romans, about four hundred years after his death; and as they contained nothing new or interesting, but merely the reasons why he had made innovations in the form of worship and in the religion of the Romans, they were burned by order of the senate.
