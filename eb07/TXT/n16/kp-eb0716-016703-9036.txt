NEWPORT, a small town, or rather village, of Cornwall, in the parish of St Stephen, near to Launceston, which had long the privilege of sending two members to the House of Commons; but it has been disfranchised. The parish in which it stands contains 1084 inhabitants, few of whom live within the limits of the borough.

Newport, a market-town of the county of Salop, in the hundred of South Bradford, 140 miles from London. It is situated upon a plain on the borders of Staffordshire, and has a market, which is held on Saturday.

Newport, a town of the county of Pembroke, in the hundred of Kemmess, in South Wales, distant 244 miles from London. It is situated on the river Nevern, which is navigable, and runs into the Bristol Channel. It is a corporate town, governed by a mayor, twelve aidermen, and a recorder; but the market, having long declined, has at length disappeared. The population amounted in 1801 to 1392, in 1811 to 1433, in 1821 to 1666, and in 1831 to 1798.

Newport, a market-town of the county of Monmouth, and hundred of Wentlodge, 147 miles from London. It stands at the mouth of the river Usk, across which ther√© is a fine bridge. A canal, divided into two branches, and running into great coal-fields, has created a large trade in coals between this town and the opposite ports of the Bristol Channel in the counties of Somerset and Devon. In the neighbourhood there are many ruins of ancient castles and of religious houses. The market is held on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1135, in 1811 to 2346, in 1821 to 4001, and in 1831 to 5441.

Newport, a town situated within the parish of Carisbrook, in the Isle of Wight, and the capital of that island. It is seventy-nine miles from London, and stands upon a gentle elevation close to the river Medina. It is a well-built town, with a good market-place, wide streets, and respectable dwellings. It has a corporation, consisting of a mayor, twelve aidermen, and twelve burgesses, in whom was formerly vested the right of electing two members to the House of Commons; but this is now extended to all the inhabitants. There are good markets, which are held on Wednesday and Saturday, and at the latter the greater part of the corn grown on the island is sold. About one mile from the town is Carisbrook Castle, a remarkable pile, celebrated for the imprisonment of Charles I. within its walls. It is still in tolerable preservation. The population amounted in 1801 to 3585, in 1811 to 3855, in 1821 to 4059, and in 1831 to 4081.

The church, situated upon an elevation, is an ancient and magnificent building; and near it there are several alms-houses endowed by a citizen of London. Considerable occupation is afforded in making bone lace, and there are paper-mills. It was long the residence of the poet Cowper. There are markets, which are held on Wednesday and on Saturday.
