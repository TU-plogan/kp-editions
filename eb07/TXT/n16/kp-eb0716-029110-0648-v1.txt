NOWOGOROD, a province of Great Russia, which takes its name from the city which is now its capital, but was formerly that of the whole of Russia. The governments of Olonez, Pfkow, Twer, and a part of that of St Petersburg, were included in it, till the recent divisions of the empire were established. It now extends between 57. 18. and 61. 8. north latitude, and between 20. 4. and 29. 41. east longitude, over 56,616 square miles. It contains ten cities, and 7932 villages, which are formed into 690 parishes, having each a church. The inhabitants are 964,500, and almost exclusively adhere to the Greek worship. The face of the country is level, though it includes the Waldai Hills; but none of these is more than 300 feet above the level of the sea. The soil in the northern part is marshy, and chiefly covered with moss; but in the south there is some dry and good land, the cultivation of which rewards the labourer, and the province produces more corn, chiefly rye, than it consumes. It also yields flax, hemp, and mucn wood. The climate is severe, being nearly similar to that [7:16:292] of St Petersburg. The fisheries on the rivers and lakes yield much subsistence. There is but little commerce, and none but domestic manufactures.

Nowogorod, a city of Russia, the capital of a province, and of one of the thirteen circles of the same name into which that province is divided. It is situated in latitude 58. 32. 31. north, and longitude 31. 14. 16. east. It is the seat of the military government of Twer, as well as of both the military and civil governments of the province in which it stands. The site is on the banks of the Wolchow, where the water of the Ilmen is received into that stream, forming a river of more than a mile in breadth. The antiquities of the city are more striking than its beauties. The cathedral, with its brazen gates, is an object of curiosity for its venerable age, as is the tomb of St John of Nowogorod, a saint to whose shrine numerous pilgrims resort. It contains fifty-eight stone and four wooden churches, three monasteries, and 1550 houses, with 10,100 inhabitants. Though ill built, and with irregular narrow streets, it has an imposing appearance at a little distance, from the numerous spires and cupolas which are displayed. The chief occupations of the people are making sail-cloth and tanning leather.

Nowogorod Sewersk, a circle of the Russian province Tschernigow, extending in north latitude from 51. 51. to 52. 24. and in east longitude from 31. 51. to 34. 19. The capital is a city of the same name, situated on the river Desna, 751 miles from St Petersburg. It is surrounded with walls, and has a castle, but neither in a good state of repair. It contains 1600 ill-built houses, with 8300 inhabitants, who carry on no manufactures, and subsist by trading in the productions of the surrounding soil. Long. 32. 48. E. Lat. 52. 50. N.
