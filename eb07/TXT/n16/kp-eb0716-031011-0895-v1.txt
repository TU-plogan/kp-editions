NUREMBURG, or Nurnberg, a city of Bavaria, in the circle of the Rezat, and the bailiwick of the same name, of which it is the capital. It is situated on the river Pegnitz, which divides it into two parts. The walls are now kept in a state which renders them indefensible. It is an extensive but thinly peopled city, having much declined from the prosperity it enjoyed in the middle ages, when it was a free imperial city, and the place where the emperors occasionally resided. The city now contains 4500 houses, and 28,200 inhabitants, with eight Lutheran churches, one for the Catholics, and a chapel for the Calvinists. It has also many Jews. It is still a place of considerable manufactures, but they are chiefly on a small scale, furnishing the turnery wares called by its name, cutlery, braziery, looking-glasses, spectacles, needles, mathematical, musical, and surgical instruments, watches, leaf gold and silver, paper, maps, and other articles. It is celebrated as the birthplace of Albert Durer the painter, and the residence of Rudolph the inventor of wire, of Peter Hele the inventor of watches, of Denner the inventor of the clarionet, of Ebner the first cutler, and of Behairn, who first constructed globes.
