NORD, a department of France, and, as its name denotes, the most northern of the kingdom. It has been formed out of French Flanders, French Hennegau, and the Cambresis, extending in north latitude from 49. 58. to 51. 5, and in east longitude from 2. 1. to 3. 9. Its surface is 2406 square miles, or 581,500 hectares, in extent. It is a level plain, with few elevations; and only one of them, the hill on which Cassel stands, attains the height of 400 feet above the level of the sea. The soil is generally moist and heavy, but, owing to good cultivation, is highly fertile, except on some sandy moors on the sea-shore near Dunkirk. According to the Description Topographique et Statistique, the land under the plough amounts to 326,430 hectares, the meadows to 138,428, the woodland to 62,129, the morass and other uncultivated fields to 15,000; and the remainder is occupied by rivers, roads, gardens, and the sites of cities, towns, and villages. In no other part of France is agriculture practised with so much skill and assiduity as in this department. The fields, by good ploughing and abundance of manure, yield crops constantly without fallowing; and corn is almost generally followed by green crops, which, especially the clover, is only to be matched in the province of Flanders, in the Netherlands. Abundance of wheat, winter and summer barley, oats, [7:16:243]; and the several kinds of pulse, are produced; and although the land is not quite two English acres to each individual of the population, the produce is more than sufficient for their consumption, and much of it is exported.

The department is watered by numerous streams, the greater part of which are emptied into the Scheldt, which enters from the department of the Aisne, and, after a course of about forty-five miles, passes through the Netherlands to the sea. Some few of the rivers fall directly into the sea, and others reach it by the Sambre and the Meuse. There are several canals, used either for navigation or for the purpose of irrigation. The inhabitants of the department amount to about 900,000, who, besides the employment connected with agriculture, are occupied in the fisheries, and in manufactures. The sea-fishing consists in the taking of herrings, cod, turbot, and others, and is extended also to the Greenland whale-fishery; whilst that on the rivers and canals furnishes a large portion of food. The chief manufacture is that of linen, including cambrics, damask table-linen, lawns, and thread-lace. This is said to employ 40,000 looms, and to furnish occupation for more than 160,000 persons in spinning. Some woollen and cotton goods are also made, as well as hats, hosiery, and leather. There are likewise many oil-mills, breweries, and distilleries of corn-spirits. The chief trade is carried on at Lush, but there are also extensive works at Douay, Cambray, Dunkirk, and Valenciennes. This department belongs ecclesiastically to the bishopric of Cambray. The chief court of law is held at Douay; and the department elects eight deputies to the legislative body. The religion is that of the Roman Catholic church, though there are a few Protestants, who support three chapels or churches for their worship.

Nord, Cotes du, a department of France, formed out of a part of the ancient province of Bretagne, and extending in north latitude from 48. 16. to 48. 56. and in west longitude from 2. 12. to 3.49. It is bounded on the north by the sea, on the east by the department of Ille Vilaine, on the south by that of Morbihan, and on the west by Finisterre. It is 3022 square miles, or 736,720 hectares, in extent, and contains five arrondissements, forty-seven cantons, and 376 communes, with a population of 540,000 persons. It is a level plain, interspersed with a few gentle elevations. The shore is covered with rocks and small islands, and encircled by a belt of sandy soil, but intermixed with a few rich meadows near the rivers. The streams are all of but short course, and only navigable at the time of high'tides. The climate is temperate, but moist and changeable. Agriculture is in a backward state, as is the civilization of the inhabitants, who speak for the most part a kind of Welsh, and live mostly in small villages or little farms; but,by subsisting chiefly on bread made of oats or buck-wheat, they furnish grain sufficient for their own consumption, and produce, besides, hemp and flax, which are converted into wearing apparel in their own houses, or made into sail-cloth and other articles. The fisheries give employment to some of the inhabitants; and iron mines, of which there are a few, furnish occupation to others. Much honey and beesâ€™ wax is obtained from the department. It sends four deputies to the legislative chamber.
