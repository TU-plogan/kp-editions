NEW YEARâ€™S GIFTS, presents made on the first day of the new year. Nonius Marcellus refers the origin of this custom amongst the Romans to Tatius king of the Sabines, who reigned at Rome conjointly with Romulus, and who having considered as a good omen a present of some branches that had been cut in a wood consecrated to Strenia, the goddess of strength, which he received on the first day of the new year, authorized this custom afterwards, and gave to these presents the name of strenae. However this may be, the Romans on that day celebrated a festival in honour of Janus, and at the same time paid their respects to Juno; but they did not pass it in idleness, lest they should become indolent during the rest of the year. They sent presents to one another, of figs, dates, honey, and other things, to show their friends that they wished them a happy and agreeable life. Clients, that is to say, those who were under the protection of the great, carried presents of this kind to their patrons, adding to them a small piece of silver. Under Augustus, the senate, the knights, and the people presented such gifts to the emperor, and in his absence deposited them in the Capitol. Of the succeeding princes, some adopted this custom and others abolished it; but it always continued amongst the people. The early Christians condemned it, because it appeared to be a relic of paganism and a species of superstition; but when it began to have no other object than that of serving as a mark of benevolence and esteem, the church ceased to disapprove of it.
