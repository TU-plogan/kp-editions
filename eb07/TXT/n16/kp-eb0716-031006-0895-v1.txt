NUNDINAL, Nundinalis, a name which the Romans gave to the first eight letters of the alphabet, which were used in their calendar. This series of letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, is placed and repeated successively from the first to the last day of the year; and one of these always expressed the market-days or the assemblies called nundinae (quasi novendinae), because they returned every nine days. The country people, after working eight days successively, repaired to town on the ninth to sell their several commodities, and to inform themselves of all that related to religion and government. Thus the nundinal day being under A on the first, ninth, seventeenth, and twenty-fifth days of January, &c. the letter D will be the nundinal letter of the year following. These nundinals bear a very great resemblance to the dominical letters, which return every eight days, as the nundinals did every nine.
