NEREIDS, in the pagan theology, sea-nymphs, daughters of Nereus and Dorus. The Nereids were esteemed very handsome, insomuch that Cassiope, the wife of Cepheus, king of Ethiopia, having triumphed over all the beauties of the age, and dared to vie with the Nereids, they were so enraged that they sent a prodigious sea-monster into the country; and, to appease them, Cassiope was commanded by the oracle to expose her daughter Andromeda, bound to a rock, to be devoured by the monster. In' ancient monuments, the Nereids are represented as riding upon sea-horses; sometimes with an entire human form, and at other times with the tail of a fish.
