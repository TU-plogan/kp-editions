NIESTER, or Dneister, a large river of Polish Russia, having its source in the lake Niester, in the palatinate of Lemburg, where it passes by Halicz. It then separates Podolia and Oczakow from Moldavia and Budziac Tartary, and falls into the Black Sea at Belgorod, between the mouths of the Dnieper and the Danube.
