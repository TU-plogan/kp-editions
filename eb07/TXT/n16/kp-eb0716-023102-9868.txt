NINIA, or Ninian, commonly called St Ninian, a holy man amongst the ancient Britons. He resided at or near a place called by Ptolemy Leucopibia, and by Bede Candida Casa; but the English and Scotch called it White-borne. He is said to have been the first who converted the Scots and Picts to the Christian faith, which he effected during the reign of Theodosius the Younger. Bede informs us that he built a church dedicated to St Martin, in a style unknown to the Britons of that time; and adds, that during his time the Saxons held this province {Gallovidian now Galloway), and that, as the converts to Christianity increased in consequence of the labours of this saint, an episcopal see was established there. Dr Henry, considering that few or none of the writings of the most ancient fathers of the British church are now extant, and that we can know but little of their personal history, and the extent of their erudition, gives a short account of some of them. Of St Ninian, he says that he was a Briton of noble birth and excellent genius. “After he had received as good an education at home as his own country could afford, he travelled for his further improvement, and spent several years at Rome, which was then the chief seat of learning as well as of empire. From thence he returned into Britain, and spent his life in preaching the gospel in the most uncultivated parts of it, with equal zeal and success.”
