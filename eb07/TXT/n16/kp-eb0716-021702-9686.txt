NIEMEN, a large river of Poland, which rises in Lithuania, where it passes by Bielicka, Grodno, and Kowno; it afterwards runs through part of Samogitia and Prussia, where it falls into the lake called the Knrisch-haff, by several mouths, of which the most northern is called the Russ. This lake communicates with the Baltic.
