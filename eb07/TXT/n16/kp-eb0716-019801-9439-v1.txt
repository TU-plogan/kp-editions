NEYER, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Cutch, situated about the twenty-fourth degree of north latitude, and bounded on the south-east by the fenny tract called the Runn. The country has been but imperfectly explored, and is of an arid and sandy nature, being intersected by no streams or rivers. Water is procured from deep wells, which in many seasons afford but a precarious supply. The inhabitants are generally thieves and depredators. The country abounds in horses of a very superior quality, which enables the plundering rajpoots to extend their ravages far and wide. The Coolies, also, who inhabit this tract, are very curiously armed with a curved stick like the blade of a sabre. This is burnt and made extremely hard, and thrown to the distance of 120 yards, at which distance they can break a man’s leg, or kill him if they strike him on the head.
