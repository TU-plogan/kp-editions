NIPHON, an extensive island in the east of Asia, forming by much the largest portion of the empire of Japan. It is of an irregular form, with numerous windings, and is 800 or 900 miles in length, but in average breadth it does not exceed 100. The spiritual and temporal capitals of Jedo and Macao are situated in this island; but for a particular account of these the reader is referred to the article Japan.
