NEWTON-STEWART, a small town in the county of Wigtön, and parish of Penninghame, Scotland. It extends about a mile on the right bank of the river Cree, and consists of one long street, in which is the tolbooth, and a very short one along the old road to Glenluce. It is connected with Creebridge, a village of about 220 inhabitants, in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, by an elegant bridge of granite over the river Cree. The post-road from London to Portpatrick passes through the town. The first houses were built in 1701, and for many years the number seems to have been small. It was erected into a burgh of barony about the year 1780, by the then proprietor, under the name of Newton-Douglas; but the original name has been again assumed. About the year 1793, a cotton manufactory was established on the banks of the Cree, at an expense of L;20,000; but the speculation did not succeed, and it was eventually given up. The whole property belonging to the company was purchased in 1830 by the Earl of Galloway, who is superior of the town. Cotton weaving forms a considerable part of the trade of the place; but it has diminished much of late years. The curing of bacon has been carried on for several years back, and the amount brought by the curers has yielded from L.5000 to L.7000 annually to the inhabitants of the surrounding district. There are several tan-works, and an extensive brewery, in full operation. Vessels of from thirty-five to seventy and eighty tons registered burden, and even some of a larger size, sail up the Cree to within a mile of Newton-Stewart. Their cargoes generally consist of coals, lime, and merchants’ goods. Besides the parish school, there is an endowment, called the Douglas School, for the education of the children belonging to the place. Arrangements are at present (1837) in a state of forwardness to erect a new parish church, instead of the old church, built in 1777. There are other three places of worship in the town, one belonging to the Relief body, one to the Reformed or Cameronian presbytery, and a Roman Catholic chapel. There is a weekly market held on Friday, and various cattle markets throughout the year. The population amounted in 1821 to 1774, and in 1831 to 2260.
