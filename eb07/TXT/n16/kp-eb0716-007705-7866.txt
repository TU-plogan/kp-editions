NEGOMBO, a large and populous village in the island of Ceylon, advantageously situated for carrying on the inland trade, particularly with Colombo, by a branch of the Mullivaddy River. It has a fort, erected by the Dutch, for the protection of the cinnamon cutters, which still remains; and there are, besides, three long ranges of buildings which serve for barracks and storehouses. The neighbouring county produces in abundance cinnamon and rice, and the gardens are well stocked with vegetables. This place was taken without opposition by the British in 1796. Long. 79. 49. E. Lat. 7. 19. N.
