NEGRAIS Isle, a small island situated at the western mouth of the Irrawaddy River, in the kingdom of Ava. It has an excellent harbour, without exception the most secure in the Bay of Bengal, as a ship launches at once into the open sea, and may work to the southward without any other impediment except what the monsoon opposes. Cape Negrais, the south-westernmost extremity of India beyond [7:16:78]the Ganges, is in long. 93. 15. E. and in lat. 16. N., and is known by a temple of Buddha erected on it. This island was occupied by the British in 1697, and it was supposed that it would entirely command the trade of Pegu, and form a secure harbour for the British ships during the monsoons. But these hopes proved fallacious, and the settlement was withdrawn. In the year 1757 the island was ceded to the British by Alompra, the Burman emperor, and the place was formally taken possession of in 1757. In 1759 some disputes having arisen between the Burman governor and the English resident, the place was suddenly attacked in the month of October, and all the British who could not effect their escape were suddenly put to death. Since this period the Burmans have been excessively jealous of any visits from Europeans, and will not permit any â€¢ships to pass up the Bassein branch of the river.
