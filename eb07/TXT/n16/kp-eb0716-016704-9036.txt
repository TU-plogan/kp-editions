NEW ROSS (anciently Roseponte) is not, as its name might import, a new town, but one of considerable antiquity, and is called new only to distinguish it from an older place in the neighbourhood, also called Ross, but now of no importance. New Ross is denominated an ancient borough in the charter which was granted to it by James I. It is situated on the left bank of the river Barron, in the county of Wexford, at the distance of eighty-six statute miles from Dublin. The river is navigable up to the town for vessels of 200 tons burden. On the banks are extensive quays and lofty warehouses. A wooden bridge over the Barron connects the town with the county of Kilkenny. A thriving export trade is carried on in agricultural produce, and the commerce of the town is increasing, and likely to increase considerably. Great advantages are expected to accrue from the port having been opened by the lords of the treasury for the importation and bonding of customable goods; and a communication is contemplated with Kilkenny by means of inland navigation. The place was formerly enclosed by walls, and regularly fortified, yet it made but a feeble resistance to the army of Cromwell. In 1798, an obstinate and bloody conflict ensued here between the kingâ€™s troops and the insurgents. The borough of New Ross returns one member to parliament. In 1831 the population stood thus: Males, 2173; females, 2838; total, 5011. The families chiefly employed in agriculture were eighteen; in trade, manufactures, and handicraft, 532; not comprised in the two preceding classes, 578; total, 1128.
