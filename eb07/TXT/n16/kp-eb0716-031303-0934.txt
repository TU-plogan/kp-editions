NYMPHAEA, amongst the ancients, certain structures, although it is doubtful of what kind they were. Some take them to have been grottoes, deriving their name from the statues of the nymphs with which they were adorned; but that they were considerable works, appears from their having been executed by the emperors, or by the city prefects. In an inscription, the term is written nymfium. None of all these nymphaea has remained till our time. A number of years ago, indeed, a square building of marble was discovered between Naples and Vesuvius, with only one entrance, and some steps leading down to it. On the right hand as you enter, towards the head, there is a fountain of the purest water, along which, by way of guardian, is placed a naked Arethusa of the whitest marble. The bottom or ground is of variegated marble, and encompassed with a canal fed by the water from the fountain. The walls are set round with shells and pebbles of various colours, by whichÂ« are expressed the twelve months of the year, and the four political virtues, as also the rape of Pro? serpine; Pan playing on his reed, and soothing his flock; and the representations of nymphs swimming, sailing, and wantoning on fishes. It seems pretty evident that the nymphaea were public baths; for at the same time that they were furnished with pleasing grottoes, they were also supplied with cooling streams, by which they were rendered exceedingly delightful, and drew great numbers of people to frequent them. Silence seems to have been a particular requisite in these retreats, as appears by this inscription, Nymphis loci, bibe, lava, tace. The building between Naples and Vesuvius, mentioned above, was certainly one of these nymphaea.
