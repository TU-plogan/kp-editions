NETTINGS, in a ship, a sort of grates made of small ropes seized together with rope yarn or twine, and fixed upon the quarters and in the tops. They are sometimes stretched upon the ledges from the waist-trees to the rooftrees, from the top of the forecastle to the poop, and sometimes are laid in the waist of a ship to serve instead of gratings.
