NORRLAND, one of the provinces of Sweden, which extends in north latitude from 62. 28. to 64. 25. and in east longitude from 14. 41. to 15. 40. being 1078 square miles in extent. It is divided into three bailiwicks, and contains only two towns, with a great number of detached rural establishments. The number of inhabitants does not exceed 61,000. The capital is Hernosand, a city of 1850 inhabitants. In regard to prospects, it is one of the most picturesque in that romantic kingdom, presenting naked rocks rising to 1800 feet amongst lakes, rivers, and woods. The chief products, besides corn, which is scantily grown, are deals and tar, with some iron. The principal branch of industry is making linen, which is spun by both sexes during the long nights of winter.
