NEUFCHATEL, an arrondissement of the department of the Lower Seine, in France, extending over 641 square miles, and peopled with 84,000 inhabitants. It is divided into eight cantons and 200 communes. The capital is the city of that name, situated in a fertile country watered by the river Bethune. In 1837 it contained 3430 inhabitants, who were employed chiefly in making woollen cloths of various descriptions for the Paris market. In the neighbourhood some good cider and perry are made. Long. 1. 30. E. Lat. 49. 45. N.

Neufchatel, or, in German, Neuenburg, a canton in the western part of Switzerland. It extends in north latitude from 46. 51. to 47. 10., and in east longitude from 6. 22. to 7. 1., being 293 square miles. It contains three cities, three market-towns, 112 villages and hamlets, with 7468 houses, and 62,500 inhabitants, all of whom are of the Burgundian race, and speak the French language. About 2500 profess the Catholic religion, and the remainder adhere to the reformed church. The land rises like an amphitheatre from the lake of Neufchatel, which is 1312 feet above the level of the sea, to the mountains of the Jura, which divide it from France, the highest points of which are about 3600 feet. The lake of the same name is a very fine object, being about twenty miles in length and four in breadth, and it has the extraordinary depth of 420 feet. The soil is of a medium fertility, generally resting upon a calcareous subsoil, on which the products ripen early. It scarcely produces corn sufficient for the consumption of the people, but it yields abundance of potatoes, pulse, culinary vegetables, and fruits, especially grapes. The wine is of a moderate quality. The quantity usually made is about 600,000 gallons, of which one half is exported. The chief manufacturing occupation consists in making watches and watch movements. About 130,000 are annually sent to other countries; and materials for the interior works, especially the chains, are exported to a large amount. The females are employed in making thread lace. A few good printed calicoes are also produced. The king of Prussia is the prince, and there is a council which regulates the internal affairs, of which the members are chosen for life. The revenue of the principality is 440,000 francs, the expenditure 420,000. It is bound to furnish to the Swiss confederacy a force of 960 men, and a contribution of 19,200 francs. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on the lake, at the point where the river Seyon falls into it. It contains two churches, a senate-house, three hospitals, and 540 houses, with 4715 inhabitants. The chief trade is in wine, and in the craft which navigate the lake, and are partly employed in fishing. Long. 6.45.19. E. Lat. 46. 59. 16. N.
