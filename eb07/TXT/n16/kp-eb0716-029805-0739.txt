NUDDEA, a town of Bengal, and capital of a district of the same name. It is situated on an island at the confluence of the Jelinghy and Cossimbazar Rivers with the Hooghly, sixty miles north from Calcutta. It was the capital of a Hindu principality anterior to the Mogul conquest of Hindustan, and was taken and entirely destroyed in the year 1204. In modern times it has been the seat of a Brahmin seminary of learning; anterior, however, to that in Benares. Long. 88. 24. E. Lat. 23. 25. N. The district is situated between the twenty-second and twenty-fourth degrees of north latitude. It is of a sandy soil, and is considered as the healthiest and driest part of Bengal, though it is not equally productive with some others. It is computed to contain 764,000 inhabitants, about a third of whom are Mahommedans. The principal towns are Kishenagur, Nuddea, and Santipore.
