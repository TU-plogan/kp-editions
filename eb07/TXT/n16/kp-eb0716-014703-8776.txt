NEWBERN, a post-town and port of entry in North Carolina, North America. It is very pleasantly situated on the south-western bank of the Neuse, at the junction of the Trent. It contains a court-house and other public buildings, including several places of public worship. Being considered healthy, as well as eligibly situated for trade, Newbern enjoys considerable commerce, the exports being principally of grain, pork, lumber, and naval stores. A steam-boat plies between this place and Elizabeth city, and thus connects it with the great routes to the northward, and to Charlestown. The population in 1820 amounted to 3363, and in 1830 to 3776.
