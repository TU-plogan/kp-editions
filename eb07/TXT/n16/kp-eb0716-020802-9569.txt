NICOMEDIA, the metropolis of Bithynia, which was built by Nicoedes, the grandfather of Prusias. Nicoedia was famous, not only under its own kings, but also under the Romans; it was the royal residence of Diocletian, and also, if we may credit Nicephorus, that of Constantine whilst Constantinople was building. It is situated at the bottom of a bay of the Propontis, in Asia Minor, and still bears the ancient name. Long. 30. 0. E. Lat. 4L 20. N.
