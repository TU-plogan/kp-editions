NEWBURGH, a royal burgh and parish of Scotland, in the county of Fife, advantageously situated on the south side of the river Tay. The town seems to be coeval with the abbey of Lindores, and was early created a burgh of regality under the abbot of that place. In the year 1457 it was erected into a royal burgh, and the charter was again renewed by Charles I. in the year 1631. The royalty extends over 400 acres, of which 178 imperial acres belong to the burgh. The town of Newburgh may be said to have been entirely rebuilt within the last fifty years. It consists of a single street of considerable length, which has been levelled to a gentle slope, the side paths being neatly paved. This street is parallel with the course of the river; and from its centre a by-street leads down to the harbour, which formerly consisted of three continuous piers, projecting into the south deep of the river; but towards the east two additional piers were lately erected, on which have been built several dwelling-houses, storehouses, granaries, and other conveniences for commerce. A new town -house was erected in 1808; and there has recently been attached to it a building of considerable dimensions for the accommodation of those engaged in the stock-market. The new parish church was erected in 1833; it is in the Gothic style, and is a handsome and elegant structure. There is also a meeting-house of the United Associate Synod, which is a plain and commodious edifice. The whole of the buildings are constructed of the greenstone trap found in the parish. The town is lighted with gas. The principal employment of the inhabitants is connected with the linen trade, which is in the hands of thirteen individuals, who not only employ all the weavers in Newburgh, but furnish work for great numbers in the different villages throughout Fife. They also export their goods directly to the West Indies and South America. There is here a considerable trade in corn; and Newburgh divides with Kirkcaldy the exporting of the grain and other agricultural produce from Fife. There are only ten vessels, from sixty to a hundred and fifty tons burden, that belong to Newburgh, and these are chiefly engaged in the coal trade; but vessels from all quarters land and take in their cargoes here. Besides, those bound for Perth must often wait for the flowing of the tide, and many of them have to unload part of their cargoes before proceeding. The river here is about two miles broad, and ships of 500 tons burden can reach this port. Operations have, however, been commenced on an extensive scale to contract the river, as well as to deepen it by dredging. Salmon fishing is carried on to a considerable extent, and affords employment to about sixty of the weavers of the place during the summer months. The fish are shipped for London by one of the Dundee steamers. The principal objects of interest in the parish are the remains of the celebrated abbey of Lindores, which was founded in the year 1178; Mugdrum’s Cross, a little to the westward of the town; and Macduff’s Cross, about one mile to the south. The value of the raw agricultural produce of the parish is about L.6000 a year; and the sum annually expended in the manufacture of linen in the town amounts to about L.128,500. The debt of the burgh is nearly L.1650. Its yearly revenue is about L.170, and its yearly expenses amount to nearly L.100. The burgh is governed by two magistrates and fifteen councillors. The population of the parish and burgh amounted in 1811 to 2118, in 1821 to 2190, and in 1831'to 2642. The parliamentary burgh voters give their suffrages in the election of a member for the county of Fife.
