NICE, a part of the continental dominions of the king of Sardinia, and usually distinguished as a countship. It extends in east longitude from 6. 27. to 7. 51. and in north latitude from 43. 45. to 44. 28., and contains 1430 square miles. It is divided into four provinces, viz. Nice, Sospello, Oneglia, and Monaco; and it is said to contain 200,000 inhabitants. The city of Nice is the capital of the countship, as well as of the province of its own name. It is situated on the shore of the Mediterranean, in the Gulf of Genoa, where the Paglion falls into the sea. It has an artificial haven, capable of containing 200 vessels, and is protected from the waves by a long mole. It is fortified both towards the land and towards the sea. It contains narrow, gloomy, and filthy streets, but, from some of the terraces on the shore, it has fine prospects towards the sea, including the hills near Genoa, and the distant mountains of Corsica. It contains a cathedral, two parish churches, fifteen monasteries, four nunneries, several oratories, and two hospitals, with 2000 houses, a few of them very magnificent, with 19,645 inhabitants. There is an extensive trade in silk, and in liqueurs, essences,perfumes,and soaps; and the fishery is a considerable source of employment. It was the birth-place of the painter Vanloo, and of the celebrated mathematician Cassini. Long. 7. 10. E. Lat. 43. 41. N.
