NECTANEBUS, or Nectanabis, a king of Egypt, who bravely defended his country against the Persians. His grandson of the same name formed an alliance with Agesilaus, king of Sparta, and with the assistance of that prince he quelled a rebellion of his subjects. Some time afterwards, he was joined by the Sidonians, Phoenicians, and inhabitants of Cyprus, who had revolted from the king of Persia. This powerful confederacy was soon attacked by Darius, the king of Persia, who marched at the head of his troops. Nectanebus, to defend his frontiers against so dangerous an enemy, levied twenty thousand mercenary soldiers in Greece, the same number in Libya, and sixty thousand were furnished in Egypt. But this numerous body was not equal to the Persian forces, and Nectanebus, being defeated in battle, gave up all hopes of resistance, and fled into Ethiopia, where he found a safe asylum. From that time the kingdom of Egypt became tributary to the king of Persia.
