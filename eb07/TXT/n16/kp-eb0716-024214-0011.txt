NOOTKA, or Vancouverâ€™s Island, an island of New Georgia, on the western coast of North America. Black granite, mica, grit for grindstones, and hematites, are found there. In some places the vegetable earth forms a bed of two feet in thickness. The climate here is favourable to vegetation, being much milder than that of the eastern coast of America in the same latitude. Nootka Sound, situated in latitude 49. 35. north, and longitude 126. 36. west, was discovered by Captain Cook in 1778. The water in the sound is from forty-seven to ninety fathoms deep, and there are many anchoring places and good harbours. All the mainland opposite this island, comprising New Georgia, New Hanover, and New Albion, is claimed by the United States, and generally goes by the name of the Western Territory. See Western Territory.
