NEMESIUS, a Greek philosopher who embraced Christianity, and was made bishop of Emesa, in Phoenicia, his birthplace. He flourished in the beginning of the fifth century. There is a work of his extant, entitled De Natura Hominis, in which he refutes the fatality of the Stoics, as well as the errors of the Manicheans, the Apolinarists, and the Eunomians; but he espouses the opinion of Origen concerning the pre-existence of souls. This treatise was translated by Valla, and printed in the year 1535. Another version of it was afterwards made by Ellebodius, and printed in 1665; it is also inserted in the Bibliotheca Patrum, in Greek and in Latin. Lastly, an edition was published at Oxford in 1671, folio, with a learned preface, in which the editor endeavours to prove, from a passage in this book, that the circulation of the blood was known to Nemesius; an opinion, however, which has since been shown to be a mistake. (See Freind’s History of Physic.)
