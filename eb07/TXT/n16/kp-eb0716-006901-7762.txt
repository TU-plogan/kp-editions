NEATH, a market-town of the hundred of the same name, in the county of Glamorgan, in South Wales, and distant 197 miles from London. The neighbourhood abounds in good coal, which is brought by canals from the pits to the navigable river Neath, and which forms an important branch of its commerce. There are, besides, several extensive works for smelting the copper ore produced on the opposite shore of Cornwall. About half a mile west of the town are the remains of its extensive and picturesque castle, and beyond it the cascade of Mellincourt, where the river Clydaugh precipitates itself over rocks of eighty feet perpendicular height. It is a corporate town, under a portreeve and twelve aldermen, but has never sent members to the House of Commons. It has a well-supplied market on Wednesday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2502, in 1811 to 2740, in 1821 to 2823, and in 1831 to 4043.
