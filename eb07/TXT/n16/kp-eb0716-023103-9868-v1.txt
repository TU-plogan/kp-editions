NINIANS, St, a large village in the parish of the same name in Scotland, about one mile and a quarter distant from Stirling. It has an ancient appearance, and consists of one large narrow street. Many of the houses are of considerable antiquity, and on them are carved the implements employed in the trade of the original proprietor. During the rebellion in 1745-46, the former church of St Ninians was used by the Highlanders as a powder magazine, and was accidentally blown up on their hurried departure for the north. The steeple, however, escaped unscathed from the general destruction, and now stands separated from the new church. Besides the parish church, there is in the village a relief chapel. Between St Ninians and the village of Bannockburn, which is situated at a short distance to the east, was fought the famous battle known by that name. The parish of St Ninians is also celebrated for being the scene of two other battles; that of Stirling, which was fought in 1297, when the Scottish army, under the command of Sir William Wallace, entirely defeated the English; and that of Sauchieburn, where the forces of James III. were defeated by those of his nobility, and the king put to death in a mill not far from the field, to which he had been carried. The inhabitants are chiefly employed in the manufacture of nailsand leather; the former are considered as superior to those made in England. A considerable trade is also carried on in the manufacturing of carpets, tartan, and other stuffs of the same kind, five hundred of the inhabitants being thus employed. The population of the parish amounted in 1821 to 8274, and in 1831 to 9552.
