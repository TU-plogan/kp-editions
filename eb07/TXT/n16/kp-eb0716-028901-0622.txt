NOVATIAN, a priest of Rome, but originally a pagan philosopher. He was baptized in bed when dangerously ill; having recovered, he was afterwards ordained priest through the favour of his bishop, although the clergy and the people were far from being disposed to grant it. He does not appear to have had the good of the church much at heart; for, with his wit, knowledge, and eloquence, he might have been peculiarly serviceable to her, had he not meanly shrunk from his duty when he dreaded persecution. His ambition to be a bishop likewise misled him; and the circumstance which occasioned the apostacy of most of the first heresiarchs also occasioned his. On the death of Fabian, bishop of Rome, Novatian, after writing a letter to St Cyprian, remained quiet whilst the see was vacant; but the promotion of Cornelius excited his envy and jealousy to the highest pitch. The consequence was a separation from the new bishop, and from those who professed to believe, what Novatian strenuously denied, that the church could receive those again who had been guilty of idolatry. He soon got together a number of followers amongst the laity, and some even amongst the clergy. Novatus, a priest of Carthage, was one of his party, and having been opposed to St Cyprian, brought his adherents with him. In an infamous and clandestine manner he got himself consecrated bishop of Rome, by three weak men, whom he had grossly imposed upon; and one of them afterwards did penance for having been concerned in what was so contrary to order, decency, and the rules of the church. His designs, however, in this disgraceful affair did not succeed; for he was not acknowledged as bishop of that diocese, Cornelius being confirmed in it, whilst he was condemned and excommunicated. He still, however, taught his doctrine, and at length became the head of the party which bears his name. St Jerome says he wrote on the Passover, on the Sabbath, on Circumeision, on the high priests, on prayer, on Jewish meals, and on firmness of mind, besides a large treatise on the Trinity. But none of these works appears under his own name, and some are thought not to be his.
