NICETAS, David, a Greek historian, a native, as some relate, of Paphlagonia, who lived about the end of the ninth century. He wrote the Life of St Ignatius, patriarch of Constantinople, which was translated into Latin by Frederic Mutius, bishop of Termoli; and he also composed several panegyrics in honour of the apostles and other saints, which are inserted in the last continuation of the Bibliotheca Patrum by Combesis.

Nicetas, Achominates, a Greek historian of the thirteenth century, called also Choniαtes, from having been born at Chone, or Colossus, in Phrygia. He was employed in several considerable affairs at the court of Constantinople; and when that city was taken by the French in 1204, he withdrew, with a young French captive, whom he afterwards married at Nice, in Bithynia, where he ended his days in 1206. He wrote a History, or Annals, from the death of Alexius Comnenus in the year 1118, to that of Badouin"in 1205; a work of which we have a Latin translation by Jerome Wolf, printed at Basil in 1557, and inserted in the body of the Byzantine Historians, printed at the Louvre.
