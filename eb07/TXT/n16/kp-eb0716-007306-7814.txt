NECTARIUM, from nectar, the fabled drink of the gods, is defined by Linnaeus to be a part of the corolla, or appendage to the petals, appropriated for containing the honey, a species of vegetable salt under a fluid form, which oozes from the plant, and is the principal food of bees and other insects.

But notwithstanding this definition, which seems to consider the nectarium as necessary a part of the corolla as the petals, it is certain that all flowers are not provided with this appendage, neither indeed is it essential to fructification[7:16:74]. There is, besides, a manifest impropriety in terming the nectarium a part of the corolla. Linnaeus might, with equal propriety, have termed it a part or appendage of the stamina, calyx, or pointal, as the appearance in question is confined to no particular part of the flower, but is as various in point of situation as of form. The truth is, the term nectarium is exceedingly vague, and, if any determinate meaning can be affixed to it, is expressive of all the singularities which are observed in the different parts of flowers.

The tube or lower part of flowers with one petal Linnaeus considers as a true nectarium, because it is generally found to contain the sweet liquor formerly mentioned. This liquor Pontedera compares to that called amnios in pregnant animals, which enters the fertile or impregnated seeds; but that this is not at least its sole use, is evident from the circumstance, that the honey or liquor in question is to be found in flowers where there are either no seeds, or such as, from the want of male organs, cannot be impregnated. Thus the male flowers of nettle and willow, the female flowers of sea-side laurel and black bryony, the male and female flowers of clutia, kiggelaria, and butcher’s broom, all abound with the honey or nectar alluded to.

Vaillant was of opinion that the nectarium formed an essential part of the corolla; for which reason he distinguished the singular appearances in fennel flower and columbine by the name of petals. The coloured leaves which are now termed petals he denominated the fiower-cup. That the nectarium, however, is frequently distinct from the petals, is evident both from the well-known examples just mentioned, and likewise from the flowers of monkshood, hellebore, isopyrum, fennel flower of Crete, barrenwort, grass of Parnassus, chocolate nut, cherleria, and sauva-gesia.

These general observations being premised, we proceed to take a nearer and more particular view of the principal diversities, both in form and situation, of this striking appendage of the flower. 1. In many flowers the nectarium is shaped like a spur or horn; and that either in flowers of one petal, as valerian, water milfoil {utriculariap butterwort, and calves-snout; or in such as have more than one, as larkspur, violet, fumitory, balsam, and orchis. 2. In the following plants, the nectarium is properly a part of the corolla, as lying within the substance of the petals: Ranunculus, lily, iris, crown imperial, water-leaf, mousetail, ananas or pine-apple, dog’s-tooth violet, piperidge bush, vallisneria, lιermannia, uvularia, and swertia. 3. The nectarium is frequently placed in a series or row within the petals, though entirely unconnected with their substance. In this situation it often resembles a cup, as in narcissus. A nectarium of this kind is said by Linnaeus to crown the corolla. The following are examples: Daffodil, sea daffodil, campion, viscous campion, swallowwort, stapelia, cynanchum, nepenthes, cherleria, balsamtree, African spiraea, witch-hazel, olax, and passion-flower. 4. In Indian cress, buckler, mustard, Barbadoes cherry, and monotropa, the nectarium is situated upon or makes part of the calyx. 5. The nectarium in bastard flowerfence is seated upon the antherae or tops of the stamina; whence the name adenanthera, or glandular anthera i which has been given to this genus of plants. In the following it is placed upon the filaments: Bean-caper, bay, fraxinella, marvel of Peru, bell-flower, lead-wort, roella, and commelina. 6. In hyacinth, flowering-rush, stock July flower, and rocket, the nectarium is placed upon the seedbud. 7. In honey-flower, orpine, buck-wheat, collinsonia, lathraea, navelwort, mercury, clutia, kiggelaria, sea-side laurel, and African spiraea, it is attached to the common receptacle. Lastly, In ginger, nettle, dyer’s weed, heart-geed, costus, turmeric, grewia, bastard orpine, vanelloe, shew-tree, and willow, the nectarium is of a very singular construction, and cannot properly fall under any of the foregoing heads.

In discriminating the genera, the nectarium often furnishes an essential character.

Plants which have the nectarium distinct from the petals, that is, not lodged within their substance, are affirmed by Linnaeus to be generally poisonous. The following are adduced as examples, viz. monkshood, hellebore, columbine, fennel-flower, grass of Parnassus, barren-wort, oleander, marvel of Peru, bean-caper, succulent swallow-wort, fraxinella, and honey-flower.
