NEWMILLS, a considerable burgh of barony, situated on the right bank of the river Irvine, in the parish of Loudon, Ayrshire. It was erected by royal charter in 1490. The inhabitants are generally weavers. There are about 140 burgesses, who pay a small sum at admission, which is applied in keeping the streets in repair. The whole income of the burgh consists in the customs, public green, and feu-duties, which in all do not yield L.10 per annum. In the town there is the parish church, and a meetinghouse belonging to the United Secession body. A good market is held weekly, and five annual fairs may likewise be held. The burgh is governed by two bailies, a chancellor, treasurer, twelve councillors, and a town-clerk. The population in 1821 amounted to 1543, and in 1831 to 1650.
