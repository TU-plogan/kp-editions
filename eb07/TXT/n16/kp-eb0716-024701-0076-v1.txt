NORIA, an hydraulic machine much used in Spain. It consists of a vertical wheel of twenty feet in diameter, on the circumference of which are fixed a number of little boxes or square buckets, for the purpose of raising the water out of the well, communicating with the canal below, and of emptying it into a reservoir above, which is placed by the side of the wheel. The buckets have a lateral orifice to receive and to discharge the water. The axis of this wheel is embraced by four small beams, which cross each other at right angles, tapering at the extremities, and thus form eight little arms. This wheel is near the centre of the horse walk, contiguous to the vertical axis, into the top of which the horse-beam is fixed; but near the bottom it is embraced by four little beams, forming eight arms similar to those above described, on the axis of the water-wheel. As the mule employed to turn it goes round, these horizontal arms, supplying the place of cogs, take hold, each in succession, of those arms which are fixed upon the axis of the water-wheel, and keep it in rotation.

This machine, than which nothing can well be cheaper, throws up a great quantity of water. Yet it has two serious defects. The first is, that part of the water runs out of the buckets and falls back into the well after it has been raised nearly to the level of the reservoir; and the second is, that a considerable proportion of the water to be discharged is raised higher than the reservoir, and falls into it only at the moment when the bucket is at the highest point of the circle, and ready to descend. But both these defects might be remedied with ease, by leaving the square buckets open at one end, making them swing upon a pivot fixed a little above their centre of gravity, and placing the trough of the reservoir in such a position as to stop their progress whilst perpendicular, make them turn upon their pivot, and so discharge their contents. From the reservoir the water is conveyed by channels to all parts of the garden. These have divisions and subdivisions in beds, some large, and others very small, separated from each other by little channels, into which a boy with his shovel or his hoe directs the water, first into the most distant trenches, and successively to all the rest, until all the beds and trenches have been either covered or filled with water. Mr Townsend thinks, that on account of the extreme simplicity of this machine, it is an invention of the most remote antiquity. By means of it the inhabitants every morning draw as much water from the well as serves throughout the day, and in the evening distribute it to every quarter, according to the nature of their crops. The reservoirs into which they raise the water are about twenty, thirty, or even forty feet square, and three feet in height above the surface of the ground, with a stone cope on the wall, declining to the water, for the women to wash and beat their clothes upon.
