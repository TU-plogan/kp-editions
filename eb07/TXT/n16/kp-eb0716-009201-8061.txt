NEMESIANUS, Aurelius Olympius, a Latin poet who was born at Carthage, and flourished about the year 281 of our era, under the Emperor Carus, and his sons Carinus and Numerian, the last of whom was so fond of poetry that he contested the glory with Nemesianus, who had written a poem upon fishing and maritime affairs. We have still remaining a poem of this author called Cynege-tico, and four eclogues, which were published by Paulus Manutius in 1538, by Barthelet in 1613, and at Leyden in 1653, with the notes of Janus Vlitias. Giraldi has preserved a fragment of Nemesianus, which was communicated to him by Sannazarius, to whom we are indebted for this poetâ€™s works, which, having been found written in Gothic characters, he caused to be converted into the Roman, and then sent to Paulus Manutius. Although this poem has acquired some reputation, it is greatly inferior to those of Oppian and Gratian upon the same subject; yet the style of Nemesianus is natural enough, and has even some degree of elegance. The world was so much possessed with an opinion of his poem in the eighth century, that it was read amongst the classics in the public schools; particularly in the time of Charlemagne, as appears from a letter of the celebrated Hinemar, bishop of Rheims, to his nephew Hinemar of Laon.
