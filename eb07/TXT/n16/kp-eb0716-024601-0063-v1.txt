NORHAM, a township, the capital of the parish of the same name, in the district of Norhamshire, county-palatine of Durham, pleasantly situated on the south side of the river Tweed, nine miles above Berwick. It is celebrated for being the frequent scene of forays during the wars between England and Scotland, probably because one of the principal fords across the-Tweed between Berwick [7:16:247] and Kelso is only at a short distance above the village. Norham, in its present state, appears to have been built from the ruins of the celebrated castle situated at its eastern extremity. It has been much improved, and is now kept free from the filth which was formerly allowed to accumulate on its streets. The cross, which is at the west end of the village, also adds to its appearance. The church of Norham is of very old date, and has for its middle aisle part of the first church, which was built in the year 840. Before the Reformation, it had the privilege of affording sanctuary for thirty-seven days. There is also a Presbyterian meeting-house and an endowed school in the village. Its inhabitants are principally supported by salmon fisheries on the Tweed, shoe-making, and agricultural employment in the neighbourhood. In consequence of the dangerous state of the ford across the Tweed, and from the river being often impassable, even for boats, when it is swollen with rain, it is in contemplation to construct a chain-bridge across the river. The ruins of the castle are situated on a high rock, which overhangs the river Tweed; they are of considerable extent, and consist of the remains of two sides of the tower or keep, many vaults, with the fragments of other edifices, and the remains of the outward walls, which enclose the castle to a considerable extent. There are also traces of field-works, which appear to have been erected by the forces which besieged it, in order to enable them to reduce it. The ruins have a most picturesque appearance. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 901, and in 1831 to 819.
