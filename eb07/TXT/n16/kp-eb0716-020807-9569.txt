NICOTERA, a city of the province of Calabria Ulteriore, in the kingdom of Naples. It stands on the sea-coast, at the mouth of the river Mesina, is the seat of a bishop, and has a cathedral, with several other churches. It suffered by the earthquake of 1783; but has been since restored, and now contains 6250 inhabitants, who follow chiefly the fisheries, and cure large quantities of anchovies and sardinias.
