NOACOTE, an inconsiderable town of Northern Hindustan, situated in a fruitful valley of the same name. Though small, it contains some of the largest and best looking houses in Nepaul, also a celebrated Hindu temple dedicated to Bhavany. Its situation is of importance, as commanding the only entrance into this quarter from Upper as'well as Lower Thibet, and standing close to Mount Dhyboon, by which the Chinese army was obliged to descend in 1792, when they invaded Nepaul. The valley of Noacote, in which the town â€œis situated, is six miles in length by one mile and a quarter in breadth. Long. 85. 30. E. Lat. 27. 43. N.
