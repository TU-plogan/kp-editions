NEWARK, a town of the county of Nottingham, in the hundred of its own name, 121 miles from London. It is situated in a rich district, watered by the river Trent, over which there is a bridge, and an access to it by a fine road constructed on arches, so as to escape those inundations to which that part of the river is liable. Newark is a well-built town, with a fine market-place and a magnificent town-hall. The church is considered as one of the finest in the kingdom, and its spire is lofty and elegant. It was erected by King Henry V. A strong castle was built here by King Stephen, the walls of which arc still to be traced. The town has withstood several sieges, the last of which occurred in the civil wars of the reign of Charles I., when it was taken after a long defence by the forces of the parliament. Newark was incorporated by Charles II. in gratitude for the defence it had made in his father’s cause. It sends two members to parliament. There is a well-supplied market, which is held on Saturday. The population amount [7:16:147] ed in 1801 to 6730, in 1811 to 7236, in 1821 to 8084, and in 1831 to 9557.
