NUX Vomica, a flat, compressed, round fruit, about the breadth of a shilling, brought from the East Indies. It is found to be a certain poison for dogs, cats, and other animals, and it is not to be doubted that it would also prove fatal to man. Its surface is not much corrugated, and its texture is firm like horn, and of a pale grayish-brown colour. It is said to be used as a specific against the bite of a species of water-snake. It is considerably bitter and deleterious; but has been used in doses of from five to ten grains twice a day or so, in intermittents, particularly obstinate quartans, and in contagious dysentery. The strych-nus Ignatii is a tree of the same kind producing gourd-like fruit, the seeds of which are improperly called St Ignatius’s beans. These, as also the woods or roots of some such trees, called lignum colubrinum, or snakewood, are very narcotic bitters, like the nux vomica.
