NOTES, in music, characters which are used, in writing or printing, to mark the pitch and the duration of the sounds of any musical composition. These characters or signs of notation have varied much at different times. Many alterations of those now generally received have been proposed, but not adopted. Numerical and literal methods of expressing musical sounds have been repeatedly proposed; but it seems that these are even more complicated than the signs in common use. A musical shorthand, constructed of alphabetical letters, was proposed many years ago in France, but rejected; although in numerous cases of simple melody and harmony it might be very useful in saving space to publishers of books. As to the notation of music in ancient and modern times, see Padre Martini, Hawkins, and Burney, and especially Mersenne regarding the entablature of some musical instruments now disused. See Music.

Note is likewise used to signify a mark made in a book or writing, where there occurs something remarkable and worthy of particular notice; as also an observation or explication of some passage in an author, added in the margin, at the bottom of the page, or elsewhere. In this sense it stands contradistinguished to text. Note is also a minute, or short writing, containing some article of business. In this sense we say, promissory note, note of hand, bank-note, and the like.
