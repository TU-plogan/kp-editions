NEPEAN Island, in the South Pacific Ocean, is about a quarter of a mile distant from Norfolk Island. The communication, however, is rendered difficult by the mountainous sea which runs between the two islands, and which, during the short period they have been occupied by British settlers, has occasioned numerous fatal accidents. It is uninhabited, and is employed as a place of transportation for refractory convicts, where they are employed in boiling salt.
