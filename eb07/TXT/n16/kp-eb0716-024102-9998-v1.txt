NONA, a city of Dalmatia, now remarkable only for its ruins, but which are so buried by the repeated devastations to which that unhappy city has been exposed, that scarcely any vestige of them appears above ground. “I went thither,” says Fortis in his Travels, “in hopes of finding something worthy of notice, but was disappointed. Nothing is to be seen that indicates the grandeur of the Roman times; neither are there any remains of barbarous magnificence to put one in mind of the ages in which the kingsof the CroatSlavi had their residence there.” Itstands on a small island, surrounded by a harbour, which in former times was capable of receiving large ships, but is now become a fetid pool, by means of a little muddy river that falls into it, after a course of about six miles through the rich abandoned fields of that district. The ancient inhabitants turned this water into another channel, and made it run through the valley of Drasnich into the sea; and the remains of the bank raised by them for that purpose are still to be seen. But, notwithstanding the depopulation of this district, and the dreary situation of Nona in particular, the inhabitants have not lost courage, but, animated by the privileges granted to them, have endeavoured to bring the population and agriculture once more into a flourishing state. Proper drains for the water would not only render that rich territory habitable, but moreover very fertile; and the brackish marsh that surrounds the walls of Nona is well calculated to supply a considerable quantity of fish, especially eels. The government generously granted the investiture to private persons, who have derived no inconsiderable advantage from the fishing; and if they had adopted better methods, they might every year salt many thousands afeels, which would prove highly advantageous as an article af commerce, and save at least a part of the money that goes tut of the country for foreign salt fish. To the left of the fity of Nona appear the walls of some ancient ruinous mildings, which probably in ancient times were situated on he main land, though now surrounded by water. The sea 'orms a narrow channel in this place, which is easily ford-ιble, and at low water the smallest boat can scarcely pass.
