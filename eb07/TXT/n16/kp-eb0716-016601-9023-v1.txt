NEW HAVEN, a city of Connecticut, one of the United States of North America. It lies round the head of a bay, which stretches inwards about four miles from Long Island Sound, seventy-six miles north-east from New York, and stands on a large and beautiful plain, which is bordered on the north partly by eminences called East and West Rock, presenting bold and almost perpendicular columns of bare trap rock from three to four hundred feet in height. Upon the eastern and western sides the city is skirted by small rivers, and extends from east to west three miles, being about two miles in width. It is regularly laid out, and consists of two parts, the old and the new town. The former was originally laid out in one large square, and is divided into several smaller squares. The central square is intersected by a very fine street, in which three handsome churches have been erected; and it also contains a new state-house, built after the model of the Parthenon, and ranking with the best American buildings. The public square and the principal streets are ornamented with trees; and a great part of the dwelling-houses have gardens filled with fruit trees, which give to the city a rural and delightful appearance. New Haven contains eight or nine places of public worship, Congregationalists and Episcopalians being the most numerous sects. There is a jail, an almshouse, a custom-house, a museum, two banks, two insurance offices, an institution for popular lectures, and a number of printing offices, from which five or six newspapers and a few other periodicals are issued. Yale College consists of ten buildings; four halls one hundred feet by forty, and four stories in height, containing thirty-two rooms each for students, a chapel, a medical college, a laboratory, and other necessary apartments. According to the American Almanac for 1837, the state of this institution was as follows:—Instructors, twenty-seven; alumni,4485; ministers, 1297; students, 413; volumes in the college libraries, 10,500; and volumes in the students’ libraries, 15,000. The philosophical and chemical apparatus are good, and the cabinet of minerals is the most valuable in the United States. In connection with this establishment there are theological, medical, and law schools; and the place is celebrated for the number of its boarding schools, there being seldom fewer than one thousand persons who come hither from abroad for the purpose of education. The harbour of New Haven is well defended from winds, but is shallow, and gradually filling up with mud; an evil which has been remedied in part by the construction of a wharf, about a mile in length, extending into the harbour. The maritime commerce of this city is greater than that of any other place in Connecticut, and it owns a considerable amount of shipping. Both the foreign and the coasting trade are extensive, and packets and steam-boats ply regularly between New Haven and New York. It was first settled by the English in the year 1638, and, as the capital of the colony of New Haven, continued distinct from that of Connecticut till the year 1665. The legislature of the state meets alternately here and at Hartford. The population in 1820 amounted to 7147, in 1830 to 10,678, and in 1837 to about 13,000. Long. 72. 57. W. Lat. 4L 18. N.

Newhaven, a town of the county of Sussex, and the hundred of Holmstrough, sixty miles distant from London. It stands at the mouth of the river Ouse, and is the port of Lewes, where the custom-house is established. It was formerly a place of more importance than at present; but the harbour has been neglected, and nearly choked up by sand. It is sometimes called Meeching. The population amounted in 1801 to 584, in 1811 to 755, in 1821 to 927, and in 1831 to 904.

Newhaven, an ancient and considerable fishing village, situated on the Frith of Forth, less than two miles north from Edinburgh, and one mile west from Leith. The village is formed by a street running contiguous with the shore, with several back lanes, and in appearance it has nothing to recommend it to attention. It possesses a low-water pier, which affords shelter to the fishing boats of the station, and accommodation to the ferry and other steamers in the taking up and landing of their passengers and goods. A handsome chapel has lately been erected at the west end of the village, and forms a subsidiary place of worship, or chapel of ease, to North Leith church. The inhabitants are a most industrious race, both sexes being busily employed, the men in procuring the fish, and the females in carrying them to the market. The oyster-bank is valuable, and yields fish of excellent quality. Were it turned to its proper account, it would yield a far greater amount of revenue to the proprietors. At the west end of the village there has been erected within these few years a considerable suburb, called Trinity, consisting chiefly of houses built in the villa style, and cottages for sea-bathing quarters. There is a chain-pier here, built by Captain Brown, from which steamers for various quarters hourly depart. A bill passed last session (1836-37) for constructing a harbour here, in order to accommodate the large class of steamers plying between the English and Scotch capitals. At Granton, about a mile farther west, a harbour is considerably advanced for the same purpose. There is no municipal government in Newhaven, the superiors of the place being the town-council of Edinburgh, who purchased it in the year 1511, with all the privileges and rights with which James IV. had endowed it. Along with Leith, Portobello, Musselburgh, and Fisherrow, it returns a member to Parliament.
