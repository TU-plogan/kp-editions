NEWBURY, a market-town of Berkshire, in the hundred of Faircross, fifty-three miles from London. It is situated in a beautiful valley, through which runs the river Kennet, which being joined by a canal with the Avon, forms a water communication between Bristol and London. The great road to the former city is at the end of this town. It was famous for its woollen trade in the reign of Henry VIII.; and it is related that Jack of Newbury sent one hundred of his clothiers, armed at his own expense, on the expedition which terminated in the battle of Flodden. Several of the public buildings and charitable endowments were founded by the same individual. That trade by which his wealth was gained has disappeared. The town is well built, the streets are wide, and the buildings handsome. The principal trade is that which arises from the transit of goods on the canals and the river Kennet. It was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, and is governed by a mayor or high steward, and aldermen, but has never sent members to parliament. Near this town two battles were fought during the civil war between Charles I. and the parliament. There is a large market, which is held on Thursday. The population amounted in 1801 to 4275, in 1811 to 4898, in 1821 to 5347, and in 1831 to 5959.
