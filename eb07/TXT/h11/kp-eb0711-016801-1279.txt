HATFIELD, a market-town of the county of Hertford, in the hundred of Broadwater, twenty miles from London. It stands on the side of a hill. The church is remarkably neat; but the most remarkable object is the magnificent seat of the Marquis of Salisbury, with the beautiful park in which it stands. It was formerly the palace of the Bishop of Ely, but has been much adorned and improved by the noble family that now possesses it. There is a good market on Thursday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2442, in 1811 to 2677, in 1821 to 3215, and in 1831 to 3593.

Hatfield, a town of the west riding of the county of York, in the wapentake of Strafforth and Tickhill, 167 miles from London. A large chase once belonged to this town, a part of which was drained in the reign of Charles I. An extensive enclosure in 1811 has tended to increase and enrich the inhabitants. The population amounted in 1801 to 1301, in 1811 to 1487, in 1821 to 1948, and in 1831 to 2148.

Hatfield-Broad-Oak, a market-town of the county of Essex, in the hundred of Harlow, twenty-six miles from London. It receives the addition to its name from the great number of spreading oaks around it, in what was formerly a royal domain. The church is a fine old Gothic structure. The town had a market on Thursday, which has gradually decayed. The population amounted in 1801 to 1436, in 1811 to 1321, in 1821 to 1693, and in 1831 to 1825.:
