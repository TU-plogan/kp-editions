HONOUR, a testimony of esteem or submission, expressed by words, actions, and an exterior behaviour, by which we make known the veneration and respect ween-tertain[7:11:553] for any one on account of his dignity or merit. The word honour is also used in general for the esteem due to virtue, glory, and reputation. It is further employed to signify virtue and probity themselves, and an exactness in performing whatever we have promised; and in this last sense we use the term a man of honour. But honour is more particularly applied to two different kinds of virtue; bravery in men .and chastity in women. Virtue and Honour were deified amongst the ancient Greeks * and Romans, and had a joint temple consecrated to them at Rome; but afterwards each of them had separate temples, which were so placed that no one could enter the temple of Honour without passing through that of Virtue; and by this the Romans were continually put in mind that virtue is the only direct path to true glory. Plutarch tells us, that the Romans, contrary to their usual custom, sacrificed to Honour uncovered; perhaps to denote, that wherever honour is, it wants no covering, but shows itself openly to the world.

Honour, or Rank. The degrees of honour which are observed in Britain may be comprehended under these two heads; nobiles majores, and nobiles minores. Those included under the first rank are, archbishops, dukes, mar-quisses, earls, viscounts, bishops, and barons, which are all distinguished by the respective ornaments of their escutcheons; and those of the second are baronets, knights, esquires, and gentlemen. There are some authors who pretend that baronets are the last under the first rank; and their reason is, because this honour is hereditary, and by patent, like that of the nobility.

Honours of War, in one sense, are stipulated terms, which are granted to a vanquished enemy, and by which he is permitted to march out of a town, from a camp or line of intrenchments, with all the pomp and circumstance of military array. In another sense, the honours of war mean the compliments which are paid to great personages or military characters, when they appear before a body of armed men. The former, however, is the most common acceptation; and wjth respect to it we may observe here, that it is extremely difficult to describe the honours of war specifically, as almost every thing depends on the general by whom a capitulation is granted. In some instances the troops of a besieged garrison are permitted to march out with arms shouldered, drums beating, colours flying, and all or part of their baggage; in others, they are only allowed to advance silently in front of their works, ground or pile their arms, face to the right, and return within their intrenchments. To give examples on a matter so plain must be altogether superfluous.

Military Honours. All armies salute crowned heads in the most respectful manner, drums beating a march, colours and standards dropping, and officers saluting. Their guards pay no compliment, except to the princes of the blood, and even that by courtesy, in the absence of crowned heads.

To the commander-in-chief the whole line turns out without arms, and the camp-guards beat a march, and salute. To generals of horse and foot, they beat a march, and salute; to lieutenant-generals, three ruffles, and salute; to major-generals, two ruffles, and salute; to brigadiers, rested arms, one ruffle, and salute; to colonels, rested arms, and no beating. Sentinels rest their arms to all field officers, and shoulder to every officer. All governors who are not general officers, in all places where they are governors, have one ruffle, with rested arms; but for those who have no commission as governors, no drum beats. Lieutenant-governors have the main-guard turned out to them with shouldered arms. The mastergeneral of the ordnance has the same respect and honours paid to him as the generals of cavalry and infantry.

HoNouR-Point, in Heraldry, is that next above the centre of the escutcheon, dividing the upper part into two equal portions. See Heraldry.
