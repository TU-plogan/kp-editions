HOVEDEN, Roger de, descended of an illustrious family, was born in Yorkshire, most probably at the town of that name, some time in the reign of Henry I. After he had received the rudiments of education in his native country, he studied the civil and canon law, Avhich were fashionable and lucrative branches of learning. He became domestic chaplain to Henry II. who employed him to transact several ecclesiastical affairs, in the conduct of which he acquitted himself with honour. He was by profession a laAvyer, but, like other laιvyers of the time, belonged to the church, and also officiated as professor of theology at Oxford. After the death of Henry, he applied himself to history, and composed annals, which commence at the year 731, where Bede’s ecclesiastical history terminates, and extend to the third year of King John, or 1202. These annals Avere first published by Saville, amongst the Historici Anglici, 1595, and were reprinted at Frankfort, 1601, in tAvo books, folio. The style of Hoveden is barbarous, like the age to ιvhich it belongs; but in diligence, knowledge of antiquity, and that fidelity which is the first quality of an historian, he not only surpassed the rude historians of the precediug ages, but left an example Avhich many of his successors, in more enlightened times, failed to imitate. According to Vossius, Ĥovedcn also Avrote a history of the Northumbrian kings, and a life of Thomas à Becket. Edward HI. when endeavouring to ascertain his title to the crown of Scotland, caused a diligent search to be made for the works of Hoveden; a circumstance Avhich shows the estimation in which they Avere held, not only by the monarch himself, but by the age in which he flourished.
