HELSTONE, a town in the county of Cornwall, in the hundred of Kerriar, 276 miles from London. It stands on the river Loe, which forms a harbour near the town. It is one of the chief markets for tin, and has a stannery for affixing a stamp to prove its purity. The tower of the church, ninety feet in height, is a conspicuous sea-mark. It consists of four streets crossing each other at right angles, with a stream of water running through them. It is a borough governed by a mayor and aldermen, and returns one member to the House of Commons, chosen by about 300 voters. It has a good market, which is held on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2248, in 1811 to 2297, in 1821 to 2671, and in 1831 to 3293.
