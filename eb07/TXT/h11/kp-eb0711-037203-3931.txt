HINCKLEY, a town of the hundred of Sparkenhoe, in the county of Leicester, 100 miles from London. It is built on an eminence in a fertile country, and is chiefly inhabited by persons employed in the hosiery trade. There was formerly a castle, now converted into a modern dwelling, and a Benedictine monastery; and the town must once have been of greater extent than it is at present. There is a well-supplied market which is held on Monday. The population amounted in 1801 to 5070, in 1811 to 6058, in 1821 to 6706, and in 1831 to 6468.
