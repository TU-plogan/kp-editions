HARO, a small town of Spain, in Old Castille, on the Ebro, surrounded with walls. Long. 2. 23. W. Lat. 42. 40. N.

Haro, Harou, or Harol, in the Norman customs. C7Î±- [7:11:152]mour de haro is a cry or formula of invoking the assistance of justice against the violence of some offender, who upon hearing the word haro is obliged to desist, on pain of being severely punished for his outrage, and to go with the party before the judge. The word is commonly derived from ha and roul, as being supposed an invocation of the sovereign power, to assist the weak against the strong, because Raoul, first duke of Normandy, rendered himself venerable to his subjects by the severity of his justice, and hence they invoked him even after his death when they suffered any oppression. Some derive it from Harola, king of Denmark, who in the year 826 was made grand conservator of justice at Mentz; and others from the Danish aa rau, signifying help me, a cry raised by the Normans in flying from a king of Denmark named Roux, who made himself duke of Normandy. The. letters of the French chancery formerly bore Nonobstant clameur de haro, &c. The haro had anciently such vast power, that a poor man of the city of Caen named Asselin, in virtue thereof, arrested the corpse of William the Conqueror, in the middle of the funeral procession, till such time as his son Henry had paid the value of the land in question, being that on which the chapel was built in which he was interred.
