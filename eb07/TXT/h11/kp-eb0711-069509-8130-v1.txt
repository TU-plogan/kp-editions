HOSTIA, Host, in Antiquity, a victim offered in sacrifice to a deity.

The word is formed from hostis, enemy, it being the custom to offer up a sacrifice before they joined battle, to render the gods propitious, or, after the battle was over, to return them thanks. Some choose to derive the word from hostio, the same as ferio, I strike. Isidore remarks on this word, that the name hostiae was given to those sacrifices which they offered before they marched to attack an enemy (antiquam ad hostem pergerent) ; in contradistinction to victimae, which were properly those offered after the victory·

Hostia also signified the lesser sorts of sacrifice, and victima the larger. Aulus Gellius says, that every priest, indifferently, might sacrifice the hostia, but that the victima could be offered by none but the conqueror himself. After all, however, we find these two words promiscuously used, one for the other, by ancient writers. We read of many kinds of hostice, as hostiae puree, which were pigs or lambs ten days old; hostiae praecidaneae, sacrifices offered the day before a solemn feast; hostiae bidentes, sacrifices of sheep or other animals of two years old; hostiae eximioe, a sacrifice of the flower of the flock; hostiae succedaneae, sacrifices offered after others which had exhibited some ill omen; hostiae ambarvales, victims sacrificed after having been solemnly led round the fields at the ambarvalia ; hostiae amburbiales, victims slain after the amburbium ; hostiae cancares or caviares, victims sacrificed every fifth year by the college of pontiffs, in which they offered the part of the tail called caviar ; hostiae prodigiae, sacrifices in which the fire consumed all, and left nothing for the priests; hostiae piaculares, expiatory sacrifices; hostiae ambegnae or ambiegnae, sacrifices of cows or sheep that had brought forth twins; hostiae harugae, victims offered to predict future events from; hostiae mediales, black victims offered at noon.
