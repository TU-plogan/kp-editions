HERMAPHRODITE is generally understood to signify a human creature possessed of both sexes, or who has the parts of generation of both male and female. The term however is also applied to other animals, and even to plants. The word is formed from the Greek ’ Egμapgo-δ∕roς, a compound of ’ Egμης, Mercury, and Apgoð/rrç, Venus; a mixture of Mercury and Venus, or of male and female. Hermaphroditus was originally a proper name applied by the heathen mythologists to a fabulous deity, whom some represent as a son of Hermes, Mercury, and Aphrodite, Venus, and who, being desperately in love with the nymph Salamis, obtained permission of the god to have his body and hers united into one. But others say, that the god Hermaphroditus was conceived as a composition of Mercury and Venus; to exhibit the union between eloquence, or rather commerce, of which Mercury was god, with pleasure, of which Venus was the proper deity. Lastly, others think this junction intended to show that Venus or pleasure was of both sexes.

In a treatise by Mr Hunter, in the sixty-ninth volume of the Philosophical Transactions, hermaphrodites are divided into natural, and unnatural or monstrous. The first belongs to the more simple orders of animals, of which there are a much greater number than of the more perfect. The unnatural takes place in every tribe of animals having distinct sexes, but is more common in some than in others. The human species, our author imagines, has the fewest; but amongst horses, sheep, and black cattle, they are very frequent.

Hermaphrodite Flowers, in Botany. These are so called by the sexualists, on account of their containing both the antherae and stigma, the supposed organs of generation, within the same calyx and petals. Of this kind are the flowers of all the classes in Linnaeus’s sexual method, except the classes monoecia and dioecia ; in the former of which, male and female flowers are produced on the same root; in the latter, in distinct plants from the same seed. In the class polygamia, there are always hermaphrodite flowers mixed with male or female, or both, either on the same or distinct roots. In the plantain-tree the flowers are all hermaphrodite; in some, however, the antherae or male organ, in others the stigma or female organ, proves abortive. The flowers in the former class are styled female hermaphrodites ; in the latter, male hermaphrodites. Hermaphrodites are thus as frequent in the vegetable kingdom as they are rare and scarce in the animal one.
