HAVERCAMP, Sigibert, one of the most celebrated philologists of the eighteenth century, was born√¢t Utrecht in 1683. In the prosecution of his studies he greatly distinguished himself, and, by the time he left the university, deserved to be classed amongst the learned men who then illustrated Holland. He was soon afterwards appointed professor of Greek in the academy of Leyden; and when this chair was joined to those of eloquence and history, he filled all the three with distinction. He was excessively laborious; and the duties of his situation did not prevent him from applying himself to the preparation of important works, which succeeded one another with inconceivable rapidity. Having availed himself of a short interval of leisure to visit Italy, Havercamp, during his sojourn in that beautiful country, acquired a taste for medals, of which he afterwards formed a valuable cabinet. But the labours of this accomplished and indefatigable scholar were terminated by death on the 28th April 1742, at the age of fifty-eight, when much might still have been expected from his pen. Havercamp published, 1. Editions of the Apologetica of Tertulian, 1718, in 8vo; of Lucretius, 1725, in two vols. 4to; of the History of Josephus, 1726, in two vols. folio; of Eutropius, 1729, in 8vo; of Orosius, 1738, in 4to; of Sallust, 1742, in two vols. 4to; and, lastly, of Censorinus, 1743, in 8vo. 2. Dissertationes de Alexandri Magni numismate quo quatuor summa orbis terrarum imperia continentur, ut de nummis contomiatis, Leyden, 1722, in4to. 3. Thesaurus Morellianus, Amsterdam, in two vols. folio. 4. Universal History explained by Medals, in Dutch, Leyden, 1736, in five vols. folio, incomplete. 5. Sylloge Scriptorum qui de Linguae Graecae vera et recta pronunciatione Commentaria reliquerunt, Leyden, 1736-1740, in two vols. 8vo. 6. Introductio in historiam patriae a primis Hollandiae comitibus usque ad pacem, Ultraject. et Radstad (1714), Leyden, 1739, in 8vo. 7. Introductio in Antiquitates Romanas, ibid. 1740, in 8vo. 8. Museum Wildianum in duas partes divisum, Amsterdam, 1740, in 8vo. 9. Museum Vilebrochianum, ibid. 1741, in 8vo. 10. Bronze Medals, large and small, in the Cabinet of Queen Christina, Hague, 1742, in folio. All that Havercamp left on the subject of Numismatics is now held in little estimation; the precipitation with which he piled volume on volume leaving him no time to bestow the requisite pains, or to employ the necessary criticism.

Lastly, he published, in conjunction with Preyger, the Sententiae of Seneca and Syrus, with a commentary of Gruter which had remained inedited, and might, without any loss, have been left so; and he translated into Dutch verse Sabinus, a tragedy of Richer. (a.)
