HIDAGE (JIidagium) was an extraordinary tax payable to the kings of England for every hide of land. This tax was levied not only in money, but in provision, armour, and other articles; and when the Danes landed in Sandwich in 994, King Ethelred taxed all his lands by hides, so that every three hundred and ten hides found one ship furnished, and every eight hides furnished one jack and one saddle, to arm for the defence of the kingdom. Sometimes the word hidage was used to signify being quit of that tax, which was also called hidegild, and interpreted, from the Saxon, a price or ransom paid to save oneâ€™s skin or hide from beating.
