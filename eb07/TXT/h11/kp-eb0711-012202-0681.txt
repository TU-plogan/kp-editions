HAMBLEDON, or Hambledown, a town in the county of Hants, in the division of Portsdown, sixty-four miles from London. It has a small market for corn, which is held on Mondays. As it is at the foot of the Southdown hills, the climate is considered as favourable for pulmonary patients. TheÂ· population amounted in 1801 to 1358, in 1811 to 1495, in 1821 to 1886, and in 1831 to 2026.
