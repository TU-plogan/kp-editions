HARIHARA, a town and fortress of Southern Hindustan, in the Balaghaut ceded territories, and province of Bejàpore, situated on the south-east bank of the Toombuddra river. In the fort there is a celebrated temple of Vishnu, and among the inhabitants there are many of low caste. In this vicinity the inhabitants are poor, and never marry, owing to the expense of the ceremony. Not many of the women, however, live in a state of celibacy. The practice of polygamy is common amongst the rich. The inhabitants in the neighbourhood are said to be noted for their stupidity, in which reproach the Brahmins are included; and many ridiculous anecdotes are related concerning them. The place being situated on the confines of two countries, has often changed masters. After the defeat of Ram Rajah, and the destruction of the Bijanagur sovereignty, it became subject to the Adil Shahee dynasty of Bejàpore. On the destruction of the dynasty by the Moguls, it fell into the hands of the nabob of Śavanoor, from whom it was afterwards taken by the rajah of Ikery, who was expelled by the Mahrattas; and these, after a period of fifteen years, were driven out by Hyder. On the death of Tippoo, and the division of his country, it was one of the districts ceded to the British, and is now included in the collectorship of Bellary. Long. 75. 48. E. Lat. 14. 24. N.
