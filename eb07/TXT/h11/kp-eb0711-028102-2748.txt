HERRNHUTH, a town of the kingdom of Saxony, in the circle of Voightland, at the foot of the mountain Huts-berg, but 1054 feet above the level of the sea. It is the place from which the religious sect known in England as Moravians has received the name of Herrnhutters, by which they are commonly distinguished on the Continent. It was built by Count Zinzendorf in 1722, for the reception of the refugees of the sect driven by persecution from Moravia. It contains 100 houses, and about 1400 inhabitants, who are occupied in various manufactures upon a small scale. It is considered as the point of union for the scattered members of the sect in Europe and America.
