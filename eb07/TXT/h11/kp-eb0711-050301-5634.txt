HOFFMANNISTS, in Ecclesiastical History, are those sectaries who espoused the sentiments of Daniel Hoffmann, professor in the university of Helmstadt, who maintained that philosophy was a mortal enemy to religion, and that what was true in philosophy was false in theology. These absurd and pernicious tenets occasioned a warm controversy; but Hoffmann was at length compelled by Julius duke of Brunswick to retract his invectives against philosophy, and to acknowledge, in the most open manner, the harmony and union of sound philosophy with true and genuine theology.
