HELMUND, Heermund, or Hirmund, a river of Khorassan, and the largest of any in that country, has its rise to the west of Cabul, in the hill called Kohi Baba. It runs south-west through the Hazara country, and passing southward, it crosses the great roads from Candahar to Herat at Greeshk, a distance of 260 miles, and its course is through very high and steep hills. It falls into the lake of Seestan, after a course of 360 miles. It is a very large river in summer, from the melting of the snows; and it is a common practice with the inhabitants to try to shoot arrows across, or to sling stones, which they are not able to accomplish. In the cold weather it is only breast deep. There are two boats at the Grceshk Pass, but for the greater part of the year the river is fordable. Its stream is swelled by several considerable tributaries.
