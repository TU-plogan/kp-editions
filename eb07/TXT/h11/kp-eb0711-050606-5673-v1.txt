HOHENSTEIN, a city of the kingdom of Saxony, in the circle of Freyburg, formerly the capital of the mediatized principality of the same name. It stands on the side of a remarkable mountain, in which are veins of gold, silver, and arsenic. It contains 450 houses, and 3400 inhabitants, some employed in the mines, but more in spinning and weaving cotton goods.

HOHENZOLLERN-Hechingen, a sovereign principality in the ancient division of· Suabia, in Germany. It is surrounded by the kingdom of Wurtemberg, except towards the south, where it is bounded by the principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. It extends over 120 square miles, and comprehends one town and fourteen parishes, with 14,900 inhabitants. It is generally a hilly country, some of the most lofty points being 2600 feet above the sea. It is moderately fertile, but a part is covered with woods. It is watered by only small brooks, some of which run to the Danube, and others to the Neckar. The revenue amounts to about L. 12,000 annually, and die debt is heavy, which the prince is lessening by contracting the expenditure. The chief products of the land are wood, potatoes, flax, hemp, and more especially gentian. The people find some employment in making wooden toys and articles of household furniture. The military contingent to the German confederation is 145 men.

Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a sovereign principality in the south of Germany. Except on the north side, where it is bounded by Hohenzollern-Hechingen, it is surrounded by the kingdom of Wurtemberg and the duchy of Baden. It is 400 square miles in extent, and contains four cities, seven market-towns, and seventy villages and hamlets, formed into forty parishes. It contains 7100 houses, and 38,000 inhabitants. The land is mountainous and woody, and the soil mixed with many stones; but the valleys afford good pasture and dairy land, especially on the banks of the rivers. The Danube, here a small stream, receives the waters of all the brooks and rivulets, excepting two, which run to the Neckar. The produce of corn, aided by potatoes, is greater than the consumption; but the excess consists more of winter barley than of wheat. Some portions of the land yield excellent flax. The chief articles to be exchanged for foreign articles are wood, corn, flax, yarn, potashes, and some glass and iron goods. The latter are fabricated from some mines of that metal within the territory. Excepting a few Jews, the inhabitants are all Catholics; and in no part of Germany is education in so backward a state. The revenues of the principality amount to about L.30,000 annually, one third of which arises from the patrimonial estates of the sovereign. There are no military except a small body guard. The contingent to be furnished to the German confederation is 370 men. The capital is Sigmaringen, a fortified town, with 1340 inhabitants.
