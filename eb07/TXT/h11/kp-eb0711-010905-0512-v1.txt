HALBERT, or Halbard, in war, a well-known weapon, formerly carried by the serjeants of foot and dragoons. It was a sort of spear, the shaft of which was about five feet long, and made of ash or other wood. Its head was armed with a steel point, not unlike the point of a two-edged sword. Besides this sharp point, which was in a line with the shaft, there was a cross piece of steel, flat, and pointed at both ends, but generally with a cutting edge at one extremity, and a bent sharp point at the other; so that it served equally to cut down or to push withal. It was also useful in determining the ground between the ranks, and adjusting the files of a battalion. The word is formed from the German 7zαZ, hall, and bard, an hatchet. Vossius derives it from the German hallebaert, a compound of hel, clarus, splendens, and baert, axe. The halbert was anciently a common weapon in the army, where there were companies of halberdiers. It is said to have been used by the Amazons, and afterwards by the Rhaetians and Vinđe-licians about the year 570. It was called the Danish axe, because the Danes carried a halbert on the left shoulder. From the Danes it passed to the Scotch, from the Scotch to the English Saxons, and from them to the French.
