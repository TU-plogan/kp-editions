HORIZONTAL, something which relates to the horizon, or is taken in the horizon, or on a level with the horizon. Thus we say, a horizontal plane, a horizontal line, and the like.

Horizontal Dial is that which is drawn on a parallel to the horizon, having its gnomon or style elevated according to the altitude of the pole of the place for which it is designed. Horizontal dials are, of all others, the most simple and easy. The manner of describing them may be seen under the article Dialling. Horizontal Line, in Perspective,'^ a right line drawn through the principal point, parallel to the horizon; or it is the intersection of the horizontal and perspective planes. See Perspective. Horizontal Plane is that which is parallel to the horizon of the place, or nothing inclined thereto. The business of levelling is to find whether two points be in the horizontal plane, or bow much is the deviation between them.

Horizontal Plane, in Perspective, is a plane parallel to the horizon, passing through the eye, and cutting the perspective plane at right angles.

Horizontal Hange, or Level Range, of a piece of ordnance, is the line it describes when directed parallel to the horizon or horizontal line.
