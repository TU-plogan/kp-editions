HOANGHO, or Yellow River, a great river of China, which has its rise in the unknown and mountainous regions of Thibet, probably the loftiest portion of the Asiatic continent. The Hoangho, after entering China, turns to the north, and flows even beyond the limits of the empire. But after winding for a short time, it re-crosses the frontier, and spreads fertility over some of the finest provinces of China. It falls into the Yellow Sea about the thirty-fourth degree of north latitude, at no very great distance from the Yang-tse-Kiang or Blue River, another of the vast streams by which China is watered. The course of the Hoangho is estimated, though with some uncertainty, to be in length about 1800 British miles. Though broad and rapid, it is in many places so shallow as to be unfavourable for navigation. It is also liable to overflow its banks; and it has been found necessary, in consequence, to protect the surrounding country against its inroads, by means of dikes and mounds.
