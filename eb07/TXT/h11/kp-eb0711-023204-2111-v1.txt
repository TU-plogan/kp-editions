HENOTICUM ('Eιm⅛, union, from εις, ενας, one), in Ecclesiastical History, a famous edict of the Emperor Zeno, published a. d. 482, and intended to reconcile and reunite the Eutychians with the Catholics. It was procured from the emperor by means of Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople, with the assistance of the friends of Peter Mongusand Peter Trullo. The sting of this edict consists in this, that it repeats and confirms all that had been enacted in the councils of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, against the Arians, Nestorians, and Eutychians, without making any particular mention of the council of Chalcedon. It is in form of a letter, addressed by Zeno to the bishops, priests, monks, and people of Egypt and Libya. It was opposed by the Catholics, and condemned in form by Pope Felix II.
