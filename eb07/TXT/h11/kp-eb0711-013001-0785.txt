HAMPSTEAD, a large parish of the hundred of Ossulton, in the county of Middlesex, four miles from London. It stands on one of those hills which command a view of the metropolis from the north. From its situation the air is deemed remarkably pure, and convalescents in great numbers repair to it to recruit their strength. It is chiefly composed of respectable houses, the owners of which are engaged in active pursuits during the busy part of the day, and repair to their families after their fatigue is ended. There are in the vicinity, however, several magnificent houses, especially that of Lord Mansfield, called Caen Wood. There are two churches, and several chapels for the various classes of dissenters. The population amounted in 1801 to 4343, in 1811 to 5483, in 1821 to 7263, and in 1831 to 8588.
