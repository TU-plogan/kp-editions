HOLLAND, Dr Philemon, a noted translator, was descended of an ancient family in Lancashire, and educated in the university of Cambridge. He was for many years a schoolmaster at Coventry, where he also practised physic. He translated into English, Livy, Pliny’s Natural History, Plutarch’s Morals, Suetonius, Ammianus Marcellinus, Xenophon’s Cyropoedia, and Camden’s Britannia i and into Latin the geographical part of Speed s Theatre of Great Britain, and the French Pharmacopoeia of Brice Bauderon. But the Britannia, to which he made many useful additions, was the most valuable of his works. It is surprising that a man of two professions could find time to translate so much; but it appears, from the date of the Cyropwdia, that he continued to translate till he was eighty years of age. He died on the 9th of February 1636, at the advanced age of eighty-five.
