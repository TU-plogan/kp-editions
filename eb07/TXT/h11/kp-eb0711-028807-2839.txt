HETEROGENEOUS, or Heterogeneal, literally [7:11:289]imports something of a different nature, or which consists of parts of different or dissimilar kinds; in opposition to homogeneous. Heterogeneous Light was defined by Sir Isaac Newton to be that which consists of rays of different degrees of resrangibility. Thus the common light of the sun or clouds is heterogeneous, being a mixture of all sorts of rays.

Heterogeneous Nouns, one of the three variations in irregular nouns, or such as are of one gender in the singular number, and of another in the plural. Heterogeneous nouns, under which are comprehended mixed nouns, are sixfold: 1. Those which are of the masculine gender in the singular number, and neuter in the plural; aSjÅżc Tartarus, haec Tartara : 2. Those which are masculine in the singular number, but masculine and neuter in the plural; as, hie locus, hi loci et haec loca : 3. Such as are feminine in the singular number, but neuter in the plural; as, haec carbasus, et haec carbasa : 4. Such nouns as are neuter in the singular number, but masculine in the plural; as, hoc coelum, hi coeli: 5. Such as are neuter in the singular, but neuter and masculine in the plural; as, hoc rostrum, hi rastri, et haec rastra ; And, 6. Such as are neuter in the singular, but feminine in the plural number; as, hoc epulum, hae epulae. Heterogeneous Quantities are those which are of such different kind that one of them, taken any number of times, never equals or exceeds the other.

Heterogeneous Surds are such as have different radical signs: as √αa, and 3 √δZ>; 0 √9, and 7 √19.
