HUNTINGDON, a market-town, the capital of the county of that name, sixty-four miles from London by Buckden, and fifty-nine by Royston. It stands on a level plain on the river Ouse, which is navigable for barges to Bedford, and by which a supply of coals and other heavy articles is conveyed. It contains two parish churches, and a good county-hall, where the assizes are held; and it has a good market, especially for corn, on Saturday. It is governed by a mayor, twelve aidermen, and a common council, and returns two members to parliament by about 380 voters. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2035, in 1811 to 2397, in 1821 to 2806, and in 1831 to 3267.
