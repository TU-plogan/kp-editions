HERIURA, a town of Hindustan, in the south of India, and province of Mysore, situated on the east side of the river Vedawati. During the government of the Chittledroog rajahs it was a place of great consequence, and contained 2000 houses, with an outer and inner fort. It was twice sacked by the Mahrattas in the reign of Hyder; and has since fallen into great decay, owing partly to a dreadful famine which followed, and swept away most of the inhabitants. Under its present mild government the town is gradually reviving. Long. 76. 37. E. Lat. 13. 46. N.
