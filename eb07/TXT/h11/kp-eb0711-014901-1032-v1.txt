HARMODIUS and Aristogeiťon, two Athenians, whose names are connected with one of the brightest and most celebrated deeds of Grecian story. The noble qualities of Pisistratus, and the mildness of his government, seem to have reconciled the Athenians to the loss of their independence, and enabled that prince to transmit his power unimpaired to his two sons Hippias and Hipparchus. It would appear that at first these young princes wisely followed the footsteps of their father, and that all classes hailed with joy their ascent to the throne. But this feeling did not long continue; for the possession of unrestrained power soon perverted the minds of the princes, and their tyrannical conduct excited conspiracies against them. The one of which we have the most circumstantial account is that headed by Harmodius and Aristogeiton; but the cause of its breaking out is variously stated by different authors. According to Aelian, the refusal of Hipparchus to admit the sister of Harmodius to the Panathenaic festival was the reason; whilst Plato states one of a less honourable kind. But be this as it may, Harmodius slew Hipparchus, 514 b. c., in the midst of his guards, and was himself cut to pieces on the spot. Aristogeiton was seized by Hippias, and torture applied, with the view of discovering his associates. Aristogeiton accused all the friends of Hippias, and when they had been put to death, informed the tyrant of the stratagem which he had employed (Polyaen. Strat. i. 22; Senec. de Iva, ii. 23). Statues were afterwards erected to their honour, which were still in existence in the time of Pausanias, a. d. 174 (Pausan. i. 8, 5), and a law was passed which forbade a slave to receive either of their names. (Gell. ix. 2.)
