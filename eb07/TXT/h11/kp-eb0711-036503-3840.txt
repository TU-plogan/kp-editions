HIEROPHANTES, or Hierophanta (from ∕⅛oς, holy, and φaiwμaι, 1 appear), a priest amongst the Athenians. The hierophantes was properly the chief person who officiated in the Eleusinian mysteries. This office was first executed by Eumolpus, and continued in his family for about twelve hundred years, though when any person was appointed to this dignity he was required always to live in celibacy.
