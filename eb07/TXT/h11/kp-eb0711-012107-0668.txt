HAMAH, a flourishing town of Syria, situated on the Orontes, and generally supposed by some to be the ancient Apamea; but, according to Dr Pococke, the ancient Epiphania. The celebrated Arabic historian Abulfeda was formerly prince of Hamah. The sheiks of the town still enjoy high consideration, and inhabit a splendid palace. It is the only market for the Arabs, who roam over the desert between it and Tadmor; and it derives great [7:11:122] advantage from this trade. It is 62 miles south-southwest of Aleppo. Long. 37. 10. E. Lat. 34. 45. N.
