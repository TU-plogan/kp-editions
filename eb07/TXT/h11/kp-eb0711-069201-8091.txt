HOSANNA, in the Hebrew ceremonies, a prayer which was rehearsed on the several days of the feast of tabernacles. It was so called, because in it was frequently repeated the word xapanrÏ„, serva nunc, or serva precor, save us now; or, save us, we pray. There were different hosannas, called by the Jews hoschannoth, that is, the hosannas. Some were rehearsed on the first day, others on the second, and so on, and they were called hosanna of the first day, hosanna of the second day, and so of the others.

Hosanna Rabba, or Grand Hosanna, is a name given to the feast of tabernacles, which lasted eight days, during the course of which they frequently invoked the assistance of God, the forgiveness of their sins, and his blessing on the new year, and for this purpose made great use of the hoschannoth, or prayers above mentioned. The Jews also applied the term hosanna rabba, in a more peculiar manner, to the seventh day of the feast of tabernacles, because on that day they in an especial manner invoked the divine blessing.
