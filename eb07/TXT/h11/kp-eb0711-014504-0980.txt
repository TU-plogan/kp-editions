HARBOROUGH Market, a town of the county of Leicester, within the hundred of Gastre, and eighty-three miles from London. It consists of one long and well-built street, in which is to be seen a great number of carriages passing between London and the northern parts of the kingdom. There was, till within a few years, a considerable quantity of thin worsted goods made in this town, but the trade has nearly all proceeded farther north. There is a market on Tuesday, which is well attended. The population amounted in 1801 to 1716, in 1811 to 1754, in 1821 to 1873, and in 1831 to 2272.
