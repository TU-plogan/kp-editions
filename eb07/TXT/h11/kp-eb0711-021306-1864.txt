HELIOMETER, formed of ifKιος, sun, and μiτ^ω, I measure, the name of an instrument, called also astrometer, invented by Μ. Bouguer in 1747, for measuring with particular exactness the diameters of the stars, and especially those of the sun and moon.

This instrumentis a kind of telescope, consisting of two object-glasses of equal focal distance, placed one by the side of the other, so that the same eye-glass serves for both. The tube of this instrument is of a conical form, larger at the upper end, which receives the two object-glasses, than at the lower, which is furnished with an eye-glass and a micrometer. By the construction of this instrument two distinct images of an object are formed in the focus of the eye-glass, whose distance, depending upon that of the two object-glasses from one another, may be measured with great accuracy. Nor is it necessary that the whole disc of the sun or moon should come within the field of view, since, if the images of only a small part of the disc be formed by each object-glass, the whole ‘diameter may be easily computed by their position with respect to one another. For, if the object be large, the images will approach, or perhaps even lie over each other, and the object-glasses being moveable, the two images may always be brought exactly to touch one another, and the diameter may be computed from the known distance of the centres of the two glasses. Besides, as this instrument has a common micrometer in the focus of the eye-glass, when the two images of the sun or moon are made in part to cover one [7:11:214]another, that part which is common to both the images may be measured with great exactness, as being viewed upon a ground that is only one half less luminous than itself; whereas, in general, the heavenly bodies are viewed upon a dark ground, and on that account are imagined to be larger than they really are. By a small addition to this instrument, provided it be of a moderate length, Μ. Bouguer thought it possible to measure angles of three or four degrees, which is of particular consequence in taking the distance of stars from the moon. By means of this instrument Μ. Bouguer found, by repeated observation, that the sun’s vertical diameter, though somewhat diminished by the astronomical refraction, is longer than the horizontal diameter; and, in ascertaining this phenomenon, he also found, that the upper and lower edges of the sun’s disc are not so equally defined as the other parts, on which account his image appears somewhat extended in the vertical direction. This is owing to the decomposition of light, which is known to consist of rays differently refrangible in their passage through our atmosphere. Thus the blue and violet rays, which proceed from the upper part of the disc at the same time with those of other colours, are somewhat more refracted than the others, and therefore seem to us to have proceeded from a higher point; whereas, on the contrary, the red rays proceeding from the lower edge of the disc, being less refracted than the others, seem to proceed from a lower point; so that the vertical diameter is extended, or appears longer, than the horizontal diameter.
