HELOS, in Ancient Geography, a maritime town of Laconia, situated between Trinasus and Acriae. In Pausanias’s time it was in ruins. This district was called Helo-tea, and the people Helotes, Helotae, Helei, and Heleatae, by Stephanus, and Ilotae by Livy. Being subdued by the Lacedaemonians, they were all reduced to a state of public slavery, or made the slaves of the public, on the condition that they could neither recover their liberty nor be sold out of the territory of Sparta. Hence the term g∕λωrsusiv, in Haipocration, for being in a state of slavery; and hence also the Lacedaemonians called the slaves of all nations whatsoever helotes. The epithet is Heloticus.
