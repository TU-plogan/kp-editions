HARLOT, a woman given to incontinency. The word is supposed by some to be the diminutive whorelet, but others derive it from Arietta, mistress to Robert duke of Normandy, and mother to William the Conqueror. Camden, however, derives it from Arlotha, concubine to William the Conqueror. Harlots were tolerated amongst Jews, Greeks, and Romans. Fornication indeed was prohibited amongst the Jews, under severe penalties; but those they explained as extending only to women of their own nation. The public stews were therefore stocked with foreign prostitutes, who seem to have been taken under the protection of government. This appears to be the reason why the expression strange women is often found to signify a harlot. At Athens the prostitutes were generally strangers; and such as debauched an Athenian female were liable to a severe penalty. Corinth was a remarkable nursery of loose women, and gave birth to the noted Lais. Their accomplishments were oftentimes great, extending to philosophy, dancing, singing, rhetoric, and other acquisitions. Aspasia, the mistress of Pericles, was admired by Socrates for her learning. The more accomplished females of this description frequently amassed large fortunes. A remarkable instance of this we have in Phryne, who offered to rebuild the walls of Thebes, when destroyed by Alexander, on condition that they would perpetuate her memory and profession by an inscription.
