HOHNSTEIN, a small province of the kingdom of Hanover, formerly belonging to the Counts of Stolberg; but being sequestrated, it was, in 1777, transferred to Hanover, which assumed the debts upon it, amounting to about L.30,000 sterling. It lies between the Prussian province of Saxony and the duchy of Brunswick. It extends over 132 square miles, comprehends two towns, twenty-one villages, and 1220 houses, with 7360 inhabitants. A great part of the province consists of mountain and wood. Its agriculture is insignificant, but it contains mines of copper, iron, cobalt, manganese, and coal, though but slightly worked. The chief town is Ilefeld.
