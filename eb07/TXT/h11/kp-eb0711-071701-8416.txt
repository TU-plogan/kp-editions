HUE and Cry, in Law, the pursuit of a person who has committed felony on the highway. Of this custom, which is of British origin, the following deduction is given by Mr Whitaker. “When it was requisite for the Britons to call out their warriors into the field, they used a method that was particularly marked by its expeditiousness and decisiveness, and remains partially among us to this moment. They raised a cry, which was immediately caught by others, and in an instant transmitted from mouth to mouth through all the region. And, as the notice passed along, the warriors snatched their arms, and hurried away to the rendezvous. We have a remarkable description of the fact in Caesar, and there see the alarm propagated in sixteen or seventeen hours through a hundred and sixty miles in a line. And the same practice has been retained by the Highlanders almost till our own time. When the lord of a clan received intelligence of an enemy’s approach, he immediately killed a goat with his own sword, dipped the end of a half-burnt stick in the blood, and then gave it and the notice of the rendezvous to be carried to the next hamlet. This was called the cross-tarric, or fiery cross. It symbolically threatened fire and sword to all his followers that did not instantly repair to the rendezvous. The notice was despatched from hamlet to hamlet with the utmost expedition, and in three or four hours the whole clan was in arms, and assembled at the place appointed. This was the ordinary mode by which the chieftains assembled their followers for war. The first person who received the notice set out with it at full speed, delivered it to the next he met, who instantly set out with the same speed, and handed it to a third. In the rebellion of 1745 it was sent by an unknown hand through the region of Breadalbane; and flying as expeditiously as the Gallic signal in Caesar, traversed a tract of thirty-two miles in three hours. This quick method of giving a diffusive alarm is even preserved among ourselves to the present day; but is applied, as it seems from Caesar’s account above to have been equally applied among the Celtae, to the better purposes of civil polity. The hutesium and clamour of our laws, and the hue and cry of our own times, is a well-known and powerful process for spreading the notice and continuing the pursuit of any fugitive felons. The cry, like the clamour of the Gauls or the summons of the Highlanders, is taken from town to town and from county to county; and a chain of communication is speedily carried from one end of the kingdom to the other.”
