HYBLA, in Ancient Geography, called also Megara, which last name it took from the Megareans, who led thither a colony. In Strabo’s time Megara was extinct; but the name Hybla remained on account of the excellent honey which takes its name from this place. It was situated upon the east coast of Sicily, between Syracuse and the Leontines. The Hyblaei colies, small eminences at the springs of the Alabus, near this place, were famous for their variety of flowers, and especially thyme; the honey gathered from which was by the ancients reckoned the best in the world, excepting that of Hymettus in Attica.
