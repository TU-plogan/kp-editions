HARBOUR, a general name given to any sea-port or haven, and also to any place convenient for mooring shipping. The qualities requisite in a good harbour are, that the bottom be entirely free from rocks or shallows; that the opening be of sufficient extent to admit without difficulty the entrance or departure of large ships; that it should have good anchorage ground, and be easy of access; that it should be well defended from the violence of the wind and sea; that it should have room and convenience to receive the shipping of different nations, and those which are laden with different merchandises; that it should be furnished with a good light-house, and have a variety of proper rings, posts, moorings, and the like, in order to remove or secure the vessels contained therein; and, finally, that it should have plenty of wood, and other materials for fuel, besides hemp, iron, mariners, and so forth.
