HERMOPOLIS, in Ancient Geography, the name of several cities in Egypt, dedicated, as the name imports, to Hermes or Mercury. Near one of these cities, probably Hermopolis Magna, was situated a most magnificent temple, of which the porticoonly remains. It was visited by Denon, who accompanied the French army in their expedition to Egypt in 1799, and who describes it as a most beautiful monument of ancient architecture, a splendid relic of the highest antiquity. Amongst the hillocks within three hundred or four hundred yards of the portico enormous blocks of stone are seen buried in sand, and regular architecture beneath, which appears part of an edifice containing columns of granite, just rising above the present level of the soil. Every part of this edifice is covered with hieroglyphics. Connected with the scattered fragments of the great temple, a mosque has been built, in which is a number of columns of cipoline marble. Near this is the village of Aschmunein, containing about 5000 inhabitants.
