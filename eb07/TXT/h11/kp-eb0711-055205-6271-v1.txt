HONITON, a market-town of the hundred of Axminster, in the county of Devon, 159 miles from London. It consists of one long street, on the great road from the metropolis to Exeter. It has suffered by frequent fires, and good houses have been constructed instead of those which were burned. The parish church is half a mile from the town, but there is a chapel of ease within it. It is an ancient burgh, and still returns two members to parliament, who are chosen by about five hundred voters. It had formerly considerable trade in making serges, but that has of late years greatly declined. Some employment for females is provided, by making thread lace; and none is more highly esteemed than that which bears the name of this place. There is here a well-attended market on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2377, in 1811 to 2735, in 1821 to 3296, and in 1831 to 3509.
