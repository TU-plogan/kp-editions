HARLECH, a market-town of Merionethshire, in North Wales, within the hundred of Ardudwy. It is situated on the Irish Channel, with an ancient castle in good preservation, originally built by King Edward I., which was the last fortress that surrendered to the parliamentary forces in the civil wars of Charles I. There is a small market held on Saturdays.
