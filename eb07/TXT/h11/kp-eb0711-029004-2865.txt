HEYLIN, Dr Peter, an English divine, was born at Burford, Oxfordshire, on the 29th of November 1600. He studied at Oxford, where he took his degrees in arts and divinity, and became a geographer and an historian. He was appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to King Charles L, was presented to the rectory of Hemingford in Huntingdonshire, made a prebendary of Westminster, and presented with several other livings; but of these he was deprived by the parliament, who also sequestrated his estate, by which means he and his family were reduced to want. On the restoration, however, he recovered his spiritualities; but never rose higher than subdean of Westminster. He died in 1662, and was interred in St Peterâ€™s Church in Westminster. His principal writings are, 1. Microcosmus, or a Description of the World, 1621; 2. Cosmographia; 3. The history of St George of Cappadocia, 1631; 4. Ecclesia Vindicata, or the Church of England Justified; 5. Historical and Miscellaneous Pieces.
