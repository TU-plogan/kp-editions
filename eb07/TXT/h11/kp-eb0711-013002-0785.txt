HAMPTON, a village of the hundred of Spelthorne, in the county of Middlesex, twelve miles from London. It is situated on the north bank of the Thames, opposite to where the river Mole pours its stream into that river. It is the residence of many families of distinction, but chiefly remarkable for the royal palace of Hampton Court, its gardens, and Bushy Park adjoining. The palace consists of two parts, the elder built by Cardinal Wolsey, the later by William III. after a design by Sir Christopher Wren. It is a heavy pile of building, excepting the front to the river, which is 330 feet in length, and relieved by a noble portico The interior contains a valuable collection of paintings from the best ancient masters, but especially the cartoons of Raphael. This palace was occupied by Charles I., and of late years by the father of the present king of Holland, then Prince of Orange. The gardens are laid out magnificently, but rather too much in the Dutch style. The graping is a very striking object, on account of the vast quantity of fruit produced from a single vine. The population of the parish amounted in 1801 to 1722, in 1811 to 1984, in 1821 to 2288, and in 1831 to 2529.
