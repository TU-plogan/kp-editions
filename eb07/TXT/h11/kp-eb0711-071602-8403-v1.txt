HUAHEINE, or Aheine, signifying, in the native language of the South Sea Islands, woman, the easternmost of the group called the Society Islands by Captain Cook. It is twenty-four miles in circumference, and is divided into two peninsulas by an isthmus overflowed at high water. It has a very narrow stripe of fertile low land next the shore, and the hills are in some places highly cultivated. The productions are similar to those of Otaheite, but they are about a month earlier. The inhabitants are larger made and stouter, and the women are in general more handsome. This island has been visited by many navigators since the time of Captain Cook, but their information throws no new light on the productions of the island or the manners of the people. Long. 150. 58. W. Lat. 16. 43. S.
