HIGHAM-FERRERS, a town of the county of Northampton, which gives name to the hundred in which it stands, and is sixty-four miles from London. It is an ancient borough, formerly returning one member to parliament, but disfranchised by the law of 1832. There is a small market on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 726, in 1811 to 823, in 1821 to 877, and in 1831 to 965.
