HOLINESS, or Sanctity, a quality which constitutes or denominates a person or thing holy, that is, pure, or exempt from sin. The word is also used in respect of persons and things that are sacred, or, in other words, set apart to the service of God, and the uses of religion.

Holiness is also a title of quality attributed to the pope, as that of majesty is to kings. Even kings, when writing to the pope, address him under the venerable appellation of Your Holiness, or Holy Father; in Latin, Sanctissime or Beatissimo Pater. Anciently the same title was given to all bishops. The Greek emperors also were addressed under the title of Holiness, on account of their being anointed with holy oil at their coronation. Du Cange adds, that some of the kings of England have had the same attribute; and that the orientals have frequently refused it to the pope.
