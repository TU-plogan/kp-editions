HUSSARS, a term which originally signified the national cavalry of Hungary and Croatia, a species of light horse, which acted as irregular troops, and in that capacity were found highly serviceable. Hussars were first introduced into the French service in 1692, when they were formed on the model of the Hungarian cavalry, which had been subsidised by France before the reign of Louis XIII. In all the European armies of the present day, hussars are light horse, and differ from light dragoons only in some peculiarities of dress and equipment.
