HANAU, one of the provinces of the principality of Hesse-Cassel. It was anciently a sovereignty of two branches, which, becoming extinct in 1736, devolved on the then landgrave of Hesse. It extends over 452 square miles, and comprehends sixteen cities and towns, 101 villages and hamlets, with 9608 houses, and 61,700 inhabitants. It is divided into nine bailiwicks, besides the capital. It is a district of better agriculture than any other of the principality, and especially for the growth of edible vegetables and fruit, with which it chiefly supplies the city of Frankfort. It yields some wine; and there are within it some salt springs, and some iron mines in active work. The capital is in part a well-built city, which stands near the river Maine, about twelve miles from Frankfort, on a well-cultivated plain. It contains 1460 houses, and 12,750 inhabitants. There is a high school belonging to the Lutherans, It is divided into the old and new town, each of which has its distinct municipality. It contains several manufactories, especially of carriages, of hats, gloves, linen, and other articles. Long. 8. 46. E. Lat. 50. 31. N.
