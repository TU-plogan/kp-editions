HERCYNIA Silva, in Ancient Geography, the largest of forests. Its breadth was a journey of nine days to the best traveller. Taking its rise at the limits of the Helvetii, Nemetes, and Rauraci, it extended along the Dauube to the borders of the Daci and Anartes, a length of sixty daysâ€™ journey, according to Caesar, who appears to have been well acquainted with its true breadth, seeing it occupied all Lower Germany. It may therefore be considered as covering the whole of Germany; and most of the other forests may be considered as parts of it, though distinguished by particular names; consequently the Hartz, in the duchy of Brunswick, which gave name to the whole, may be considered as one of its parts. The name Hartz denotes resinous, or pine-trees. By the Greeks it is called C)rcynius, as a name common to all the forests in Germany; in the same manner as Hercynius was the name given by the Romans. Both are derived from the German Hartz.
