HAVERFORDWEST, a town of the county of Pembroke, in South Wales, 264 miles from London. It is the capital of the county, where the assizes and elections are held. It is situated on the side of a hill overlooking the navigable river Dungleddy, on whose bank is a good wharf. In the upper part of the town the English language is spoken, and in the lower portion Welsh. Each of these divisions has its market; that in the upper town is held on Tuesday, frequented by English peasants; that of the lower town, on Saturday, is attended by the Welsh farmers. The English spoken here is said to be remarkably pure. Haverfordwest is a town and county of itself, governed by a mayor and common-councilmen; and the mayor is admiral, coroner, and escheator. It contains three parish churches, and several places of worship for dissenters. There are no considerable manufactures carried on, but a few cotton goods are made. The houses in the upper town are generally well built, but those in the lower are otherwise. The population amounted in 1801 to 2880, in 1811 to 3093, in 1821 to 4055, and in 1831 to 3915. The town returns one member to the House of Commons, who is chosen by about 540 voters.
