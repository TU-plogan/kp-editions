HOLYHEAD, a sea-port town in the island of Anglesey, in North Wales. It is situated on a peninsula at the western side of the island, and of late some great improvements have been made on the harbour, on one side of which is a light-house, on Salt Island, and another to the north-east, giving additional guidance to vessels in the night time. There is a good market on Saturday, and an ample supply of fish when the weather is favourable for taking them. The trade of the place depends chiefly on this being the greatest point of intercourse between England and Ireland, and it has been greatly advanced by the magnificent roads through North Wales, and the finishing of the suspension bridge over the Menai passage. The mails from the capital and from the northern counties arrive every morning at an early hour, and the letters and passengers are embarked immediately in steam-boats, which reach Dublin, in favourable weather, in eight hours. The inhabitants amounted in ]801 to 2132, in 1811 to 3005, m 1821 t 0 4071, and in 1831 to 4282.
