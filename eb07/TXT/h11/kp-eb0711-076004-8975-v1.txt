HURD WAR, or Harľdwara, a town of Hindustan, province of Delhi, a great mart of commerce, and a celebrated place of Hindu pilgrimage, situated on the west side of the Ganges, where it issues from the northern hills. The town is not large, having only one street about fifteen feet in breadth, and one furlong and a half in length. Pilgrims of both sexes resort annually thither from all parts of India to perform their ablutions in the sacred Ganges. The month of April is the time appointed for this concourse of pilgrims; and great numbers of merchants also attending, one of 'the largest fairs known in Hindustan is held here. It is calculated that in general about 300,000 persons are collected on this occasion; but once in twelve years, when particular ceremonies are observed, the number is increased to a million. In April 1809, it was computed that two millions of strangers were assembled. The chief articles brought thitherfor sale are horses, mules, camels, tobacco, antimony, assafoetida; dried fruits from Cabul, Candahar, Moul tan, and the Punjab; shawls, cloaks, &c. from Cashmere and Amritsir; spotted turbans, looking glasses, toys, with various manufactures in brass and ivory, from Jeypoor; shields from Rohilcund, Lucknow, and Silhet; bows and arrows from Moultan and the Doab; rock-salt from Lahore; baftąs and piece-goods from Rahn, a large city in the Punjab; many camels, and a species of flannel, from the Marwar country; and from the Company’s provinces Kharwa muslins, sarsnet, cocoa nuts, and woollen cloths of a coarse quality. The merchants who frequent this fair travel in large caravans, and are frequently infested on the roads by freebooters, who watch their opportunity and cut off stragglers. During the Mahratta dominion, a poll tax and heavy duties were imposed on all the cattle. But these have all been repealed by the British, and every encouragement is now held out to merchants. In such a vast concourse of people from all quarters, disputes were formerly very frequent. But, owing to the strict police maintained by the British, these fairs have lately ended without bloodshed, to the surprise and satisfaction of the vast multitude, who were accustomed to see bloody quarrels at the Hurd war fair. The stream divides itself into three channels at Hurdwar, the principal of which is on the western side, running along a bank named Chand-nee Ghaut. At the foot of the pass into the mountains is a Goorkah fort, belonging to Nepaul, to which many hundreds of slaves are annually brought down from the hills and exposed to sale. The travelling distance from Calcutta by Moorshedabad is 1080 miles, by Birbhoom 975 miles, from Delhi 117 miles, and from Lucknow 311 miles. Long. 78. 2. E. Lat. 29. 57. N.

HURLY-Burly, in vulgar language, denotes confusion or tumult, and is said to owe its origin to two neighbouring families, Hurleigh and Burleigh, which filled their part of the kingdom with contest and violence.
