HULK, an old ship of war, fitted with an apparatus to fix or take out the masts of ships of the royal navy, as occasion requires.

Hulk is also a name bestowed on any old vessel laid up as unfit for further service. It is probably derived from the cλxα3sg, or vessels of burthen, of the ancient Grecians.
