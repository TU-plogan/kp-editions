HARWICH, a town in the hundred of Tenđring, in the county of Essex, seventy-three miles from London. It is a seaport, situated at the junction of the river Stour and Orwell, which enter the German Ocean. It was once fortified, but the works were demolished in the civil wars of Charles I.; but towards the sea it is defended by a battery. From this place the packets depart for Holland twice every week. There are good dock-yards for building and repairing ships; and some fisheries are carried on in the North Sea. It is governed by a mayor, eight aldermen, a recorder, and some burgesses; and it returns two members to the House of Commons. There are now about 200 voters. The mayor is empowered to hold an admiralty court. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2761, in 1811 to 3732, in 1821 to 4010, and in 1831 to 4297.
