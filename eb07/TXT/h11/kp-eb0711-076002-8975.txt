HURDLE is the name of a sledge used to draw traitors to the place of execution. The Romans had a kind of military execution for mutineers, called putting to death under the hurdle. The manner of it was this: The criminal was laid at his length in shallow water, under an hurdle, upon which were heaped stones, and so pressed down until he was drowned.
