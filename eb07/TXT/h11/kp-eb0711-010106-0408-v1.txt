HACKNEY, a large parish of the hundred of Osulton, in the county of Middlesex. It is one of those villages which, from a collection of scattered hamlets and a few houses round the parish church, have, in the course of a century, so increased as to be more than equal to many continental cities, and even to several capitals. Being within three miles of London, the more wealthy of the middle class of traders have fixed their residences in it. It comprehends several hamlets, as they are still called, though they have also become towns. These are Upper and Lower Clapton, Dalston, Shackelwill, and Homerton. A new parish church of appropriate size has been built; and there are several chapels belonging to the established church, and places of worship for almost every description of the sectaries of the kingdom. By the increase of buildings in both directions, Hackney nearly joins the parish of Shoreditch and of Spitalfields, so as to be in appearance part of the capital. The schools of various kinds, from the classical to those for elementary instruction of the lowest grade, are very numerous. The most remarkable object is a nursery ground botanically arranged upon a large scale, which contains a stupendous building covered with glass and filled with all the forest trees of the tropical climates, in full growth. The population of this parish amounted in 1801 to 12,730, in 1811 to 16,771, in 1821 to 22,494, and in 1831 to 31,047.

Hackney Coaches, those exposed in the streets of London, and some other great cities, to be hired at rates fixed by authority. Sec Coach.
