HUBELY, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapoor. It is large and populous, defended by a mud rampart and ditch, and has for many years carried on an extensive trade, particularly with Goa, to which are sent sandal wood and elephants’ teeth, and in return raw silk, cottons, woollens, and rice are received. There are also manufactures of raw silk and cotton, great quantities of which are sold for the dresses of the country people. It is a wealthy place, the residence of many rich bankers, who, by means of their agents, extend their commercial intercourse to Surat, Hyderabad, Seringapatam, and even to more distant places on which bills of exchange can be negotiated, and who regulate the standard of the currency in all the adorning countries. The English East India Company for-nerly had a factory here, which was plundered by the Üahrattas in 1673, when the Company sustained a great loss. In 1685 it was taken by the Mogul troops of Aurungzebe, and soon after the death of that monarch in 1707 it was again taken by the Mahrattas, and still continues in their possession. Long. 75. 10. E. Lat. 15.
