HARVEY, Dr William, an illustrious English physician, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, was born in Kent on the 2d of April 1569. After six years of study in Caius College, Cambridge, he travelled through France, Germany, and Italy, and was created a doctor of physic in the University of Padua, where he studied for some time. After his return to London, he was incorporated doctor of physic in Cambridge, afterwards admitted into the College of Physicians in London, and, lastly a [7:11:158]appointed lecturer of anatomy and surgery in that college. In these lectures he disclosed his discovery relative to the circulation of the blood, which, after a variety of experiments, he communicated to the world in his Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis. He was physician to James I. and to Charles I., and adhered to the royal cause in the reign of the latter. His works have immortalised his memory. In 1651 he published his Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium. In 1654 he was chosen president of the College of Physicians in his absence; but his age and weakness were so great, that he found himself unable to discharge the duty of the office, and therefore desired the college^ to choose Dr Pringle. As he had no children, he settled his paternal estate upon the college. He had three years previously built a combination-room, a library, and a museum; and in 1656 he brought the deeds of his estate, and presented them to the college. He was also present at the first festival, instituted by himself, and to be continued annually, together with a commemoration speech in Latin, to be spoken on the 18th of October, in honour of the benefactors to the college. He appointed a handsome stipend for the orator, and also for the keeper of the library and museum, which are still called by his name. This great physician, who died in 1657, had the happiness, in his lifetime, to find the clamours of ignorance, envy, and prejudice, against his doctrine, totally silenced, and to see it universally established. Dr Harvey was not only a great, but a truly excellent man; his modesty, candour, and piety, were equal to his knowledge; and the farther he penetrated into the wonders of nature, the more he felt disposed to venerate its great author.
