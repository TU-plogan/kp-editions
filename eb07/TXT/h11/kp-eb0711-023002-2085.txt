HEMISPHERE (Hemisphoerium, compounded of ⅛u,∕oυς, half, and ffφα ∣ ξa, sphere), in Geometry, is one half of a globe or sphere, when divided by a plane passing through its centre.

Hemisphere, in Astronomy, is particularly used for one half of the mundane sphere. The equator divides the sphere into two equal parts, called the northern and southern hemispheres. The horizon also divides the sphere into two parts, called the upper and the lower hemispheres. Hemisphere is also used for a map or projection of half the terrestrial globe, or half the celestial sphere, on a plane. Hemispheres are frequently called plamspheres.
