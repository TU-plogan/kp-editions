HAYES, Charles, a very singular person, whose great erudition was so concealed by his modesty, that his name is known to few, though his publications are familiar to many. He was born in 1678, and became distinguished in 1704 by a Treatise of Fluxions, in folio, the only work to which he ever set his name. In 1710, he published a small quarto pamphlet of nineteen pages, entitled A New and Easy Method to find out the Longitude, from observing the Altitudes of the Celestial Bodies; and in 1723, The Moon, a Philosophical Dialogue, tending to show that the moon is not an opaque body, but has original light of her own. During a long course of years, the management of the Royal African Company was, in a manner, wholly committed to Mr Hayes, who was annually chosen either sub-governor or deputygovernor, notwithstanding which, he continued his pursuit of general knowledge. To considerable skill in the Greek and Latin, as well as modern languages, he added a knowledge of the Hebrew; and published several pieces relating to the translation and chronology of the Scriptures. The African Company being dissolved in 1752, he retired to Down in Kent, where he gave himself up to study. In 1753, he began to compile in Latin his Chronographiα Asiatica et Eggptiaea, which he lived to finish, but not to publish. The work, however, was afterwards published. In 1758, he left his house in Kent, and took chambers in Gray’s-Inn, where he died on the 18th of December 1760, in his eighty-second year.
