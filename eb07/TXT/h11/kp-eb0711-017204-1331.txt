HAVRE-DE-GRACE, a city of the north of France, in the department of the Lower Seine, and the capital of an arrondissement of its own name. It is strongly fortified on both the land and sea sides, and has a citadel. It stands on the right bank of the river Seine, which is of the breadth of more than three miles. There is a naval arsenal, where frigates and corvettes are built, and a marine school. By the river on which it stands communicating with the capital of the kingdom, it is the depot of much foreign merchandise to supply Paris; and there are abundant stores for all kinds of goods, especially sugar, coffee, cotton, and other tropical commodities, as well as for the naval stores produced in the north of Europe. There are manufactures of sugar, soap, tobacco, pottery, beer, and twine; and many of the inhabitants subsist by the sea fisheries. The port is generally crowded with vessels from the French colonies, and from the United States of America; but from all other countries many repair to it, though it is by no means very secure as a harbour. The town is well built, with streets at right angles crossing each other, and has vastly improved since the return of peace. It contains 1640 houses, and 22,100 inhabitants. Long. 0. 6. E. Lat. 49. 29. 14. N.
