HOLYWELL, a considerable town in the hundred of Mold, of the county of Flint, in North Wales, 207 miles from London. It derives its name from a spring to which numerous pilgrimages were formerly made, and which is still visited by some devout Catholics, who pay their devotions at the place once filled by the image of the patroness, St Winifred. The spring yields a regular and prodigious supply of water; according to one experiment, a hundred tons in a minute. Doubts are entertained of the accuracy of this experiment; but it certainly turns a mill close to the well. In the vicinity of this town are valuable mines of lead, calamine, and copper; and within it are appropriate establishments for rendering these minerals available to the purposes of subsequent manufactures. There are also cotton spinning-mills established upon the stream which issues from the well, between its source and its falling into the Dee. The cotton twist spun at Holywell has a great reputation from its singular evenness. The town is finely situated, the air pure, and the market on Friday well supplied. There is a modern-built parish-church, and four places of worship for Catholic and Protestant dissenters. The population amounted in 1801 to 5567, in 1811 to 6394, in 1821 to 8309, and in 1831 to 8969. Long. 3. 13. W. Lat. 53. 16. N.
