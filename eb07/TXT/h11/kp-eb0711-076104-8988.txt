HUSSITES, in Ecclesiastical History, a party of reformers, the followers of John Huss. The person from whom the Hussites take their name was born in a little village in Bohemia, called Huss, and lived at Prague in the highest reputation, both on account of the sanctity of his manners and the purity of his doctrine. He was distinguished by his uncommon erudition and eloquence, and discharged at the same time the functions of professor of divinity in the university, and of ordinary pastor in the church of that city. He adopted the sentiments of Wickliffe, and the Waldenses; and in the year 1407 began openly to oppose and preach against various errors in doctrine, as well as corruptions in point of discipline, which then prevailed in the church. Huss likewise endeavoured to the utmost of his power to withdraw the university of Prague from the jurisdiction of Gregory XII., whom the kingdom of Bohemia had hitherto acknowledged as the true and lawful head of the church. This occasioned a violent quarrel between the incensed Archbishop of Prague and the zealous reformer, which the latter inflamed and augmented from day to day by his pathetic exclamations against the court of Rome, and the corruptions that prevailed amongst the sacerdotal order.

But there were other circumstances which contributed to inflame the resentment of the clergy against him. He adopted the philosophical opinions of the realists, and vehemently opposed and even persecuted the nominalists, whose number and influence were considerable in the university of Prague. In the year 1408 he also increased the bitterness of his enemies, by procuring a sentence in favour of the Bohemians, who had disputed with the Germans concerning the number of suffrages which their respective nations were entitled to in all matters that were carried by election in this university. In consequence of a decree obtained in favour of the former, which restored them to their constitutional right of three suffrages, usurped by the latter, the Germans withdrew from Prague, and, in the year 1409, founded a new"academy at Leipsic. This event had no sooner happened than Huss began to inveigh with greater freedom than he had before done against the vices and corruptions of the clergy, and to recommend, in a public manner, the writings and opinions of Wickliffe, as far as these related to the papal hierarchy, the despotism of the court of Rome, and the corruption of the clergy. Hence, in the year 1410, an accusation was brought against him before the tribunal of John XXIII. ’ by whom he was solemnly expelled from the communion of the church. Notwithstanding this sentence of excommunication, he proceeded to expose the errors and vices of the Roman Ca [7:11:762]tholic church, with a fortitude and zeal that were almost universally applauded.

This eminent man, whose piety was equally sincere and fervent, though his zeal was perhaps too violent, and his prudence not always circumspect, was summoned to appear before the council of Constance. Secured, as he apprehended, from the rage of his enemies by the safe-conduct granted him by the Emperor Sigismund for his journey to Constance, his residence in that place, and his return to his own country, John Huss obeyed the order of the council, and appeared before it to demonstrate his innocence, and to prove that the charge of his having deserted the church of Rome was entirely groundless. However, his enemies so far prevailed, that by a scandalous breach of public faith he was cast into prison, declared a heretic because he refused to plead guilty, in obedience to the orders of the council, and burned alive in 1415; a punishment which he endured with unparalleled magnanimity and resignation.

The same unhappy fate was reserved for another reformer, Jerome of Prague, his intimate companion, who attended the council in order to support his persecuted friend. Jerome, indeed, was terrified into temporary submission; but he afterwards recovered his fortitude, and maintained the opinions, which he had for a while deserted through fear, amidst the flames, in which he expired in 1416.

The disciples of Huss adhered to their master’s doctrine after his death with a zeal which broke out into an open war, that was carried on with the most unparalleled barbarity. John Ziska, a Bohemian knight, in 1420 put himself at the head of the Hussites, who had now become a considerable party, and threw off the yoke of Sigismund, who had treated their brethren in the most cruel and barbarous manner. In the year 1424, Ziska was succeeded by Procopius. The acts of barbarity committed on both sides were shocking and horrible; for notwithstanding the irreconcilable opposition between the religious sentiments of the contending parties, they both agreed in this one detestable principle, that it was innocent and lawful to extirpate by fire and sword the enemies of the true religion; and as such they reciprocally considered each other. But, by the interference of the council of Basil, in the year 1433, these commotions in a great measure subsided, and peace was at length restored. The Hussites, who were divided into two parties, viz. the Calixtines and Taborites, spread over all Bohemia and Hungary, and even Silesia and Poland; and some remains of them still subsist in those parts.
