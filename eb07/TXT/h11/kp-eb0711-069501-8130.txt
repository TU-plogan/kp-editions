HOSPITALLERS, Hospitalarii, an order of religious knights, who built at Jerusalem an hospital, in which pilgrims were received. To these Pope Clement V. transferred the effects and revenues of the Templars, whom, by a council held at Vienne, he suppressed for their numerous and flagrant misdemeanours. These hospitallers, otherwise called knights of St John of Jerusalem, are the same with those who were latterly called knights of Malta.
