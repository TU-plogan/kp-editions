HIDJELLEE, a town and district of Hindustan, in the province of Bengal, situated upon the west bank of the Hooghly river. It is the first town which is seen after entering the river. Here ships formerly used to anchor, but they now run up to Kedjeree or Diamond Harbour. There is here an extensive salt manufactory belonging to government. This place is very unhealthy. It was to Hidjellee that the English retreated in 1687, after escaping from, the Hooghly. They fortified the island, and held possession of it for three months, against all the efforts of Aurungzebe, till peace was concluded. The vicinity abounds with tigers, and the creeks with sharks and alligators. Long. 88. 10. E. Lat. 21. 50. N. The district is bounded on the east by the Hooghly, and on the south by the sea. Some of the land is good, and produces a great quantity of rice, cocoa-nuts, the betel nut, and other things. It is principally valuable on account of the lands which are overflowed by the spring tides, and on which salt is made. Its chief towns are Hidjellee and Contai.
