HOSPITAL, popularly Spittal, a place or building erected, out of charity, for the reception and support of the poor, aged, infirm, sick, and otherwise helpless. The word is formed from the Latin hospes, host, stranger. See Host.

In the early ages of the church, the bishop had the immediate charge of all the poor, both healthy and diseased, as also of widows, orphans, strangers, and others. When the churches came to have fixed revenues allotted to them, it was decreed that at least one fourth part of these should go to the relief of the poor; and to provide for them the more commodious]y, houses of charity were built, which were afterwards denominated hospitals. They were governed wholly by the priests and deacons, under the inspection of the bishop. But in course of time, separate revenues were assigned for the hospitals; and particular persons, from motives of piety and charity, gave lands and money for erecting hospitals. When the church discipline began to relax, the priests, who till then had been the administrators of hospitals, converted them into a sort of benefices, which they held at pleasure, without accounting to any body, reserving the greater part of the income to their own use, so that the intentions of the founders were in a great measure frustrated. To remove this abuse, the council of Vienne expressly prohibited the giving any hospital to secular priests in the way of a benefice; and directed the administration of these establishments to be committed to sufficient and responsible laymen, who should take an oath, like that of tutors, for the faithful discharge of its duties, and be accountable to the ordinaries. This decree was executed and confirmed by the council of Trent.

In Britain hospitals are buildings properly endowed, or otherwise supported by charitable contributions, for the reception and support of the poor, aged, infirm, sick, or helpless.
