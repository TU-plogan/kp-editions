HALLIAR, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Gujerat, extending along the eastern shore of the Gulf of Cutch. The general characteristic of this district is barrenness, with particular spots in a high state of cultivation. The ruler of the country has lately given orders to the zemindars to plant annually a certain number of mango and other trees, in order to improve the appearance of the country. The princes themselves breed a number of horses and camels. The inhabitants never shoe their horses, yet they gallop at full speed over the worst ground; and by such training their hoofs become as hard as the rocks over which they tread. The natives of this country have a practice of suspending rags on trees, which example being followed by others, the tree, according to the popular superstition, becomes consecrated, and is styled the Chintra Peer, or Ragged Saint. The country is possessed by independent native chiefs, who claim descent from Rawul, the youngest son of Rai Humeer, the sovereign of Cutch. This prince usurped the throne of his father, but was afterwards compelled to resign it to his brother, and leave the country. He crossed the Runn at Mallia, and finally established his headquarters at a village where Noanagur now stands. His followers in the course of a few years added to their possession two villages, which received the name of Ha√¨liar, an appellation it still retains.
