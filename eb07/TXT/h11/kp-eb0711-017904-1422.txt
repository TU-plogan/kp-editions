HEALTH is a right disposition of the body, and of all its parts. The Greeks and Romans deified Health, representing it under the figure of a woman, whom they supposed to be the daughter of Aesculapius. We find the name of the Goddess Salus, or Health, on many medals of the Roman emperors, with different inscriptions; as, Salus Publica, Salus Reipublicae, Salus Augusti, and so on.
