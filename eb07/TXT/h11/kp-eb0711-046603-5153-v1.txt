HINZUAN, oneofthe Comora Islands, situated between Madagascar and the continent of Africa, and otherwise called Anzuame, Anjuan, Juanny, and Johanna.

Hinzuan resembles, according to Sir William Jones’s description of it, a vast amphitheatre, of which a general notion may be formed by conceiving a multitude of hills infinitely diversified in figure and magnitude, and thrown together with artless symmetry in all conceivable positions. A series of mountains forms the background. One of these is pointed, about half a mile above the level of the sea, afιd not more than three miles from the shore; and the whole are richly clothed with fruit trees of exquisite verdure. Beyond this there is another range, partly barren and partly verdant. Nearer the shore there is a vast multitude of cliffs, which push their verdure almost to the water’s edge. The rows of palm trees with which it abounds give an enchanting beauty and variety to the scene, and almost appear to have been planted by design. The north side of the island shoots out into two points, which are twenty-six miles distant from each other, with a large bay between them. It is justly considered as a proper place of refreshment for vessels bound to and from the East Indies, yielding limes, lemons, oranges, and many other valuable antiscorbutics.
