HOORN, a city of the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland, and the capital of a circle of its own name. It is situated on the Zuyder Zee, is surrounded with ancient walls, and has a good harbour, with docks, and accommodations for ship-building. It contains ten churches, 2640 houses, and (in 1834) 10,200 inhabitants. The district around it is celebrated for the quantity of cheese it produces, more than four million pounds having been exported in some years. It was the place where that mode of curing herrings which has contributed much to the wealth of the country, was first practised. It was the birthplace of the navigator Schonten, who discovered the southernmost cape of America, which still universally bears the name of his native city. It was taken by the English and Russians in September 1799, but was speedily abandoned, from being too far in advance of the line of operations. Long. 4. 54. E. Lat. 52. 38. N.

Lat. 15. S.
