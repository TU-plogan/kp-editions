HERAULT, a department of France, formed out of a part of the ancient province of Lower Languedoc. On the southern side it is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea, and on the other sides by French departments. Its extent is 2926 square miles, or, according to the Royal Almanac, 630,935 hectares. It is divided into four arrondissements, and these into thirty-six cantons and 333 communes; and it contains 346,207 inhabitants, of whom about 50,000 are Protestants, and the rest adhere to the Church of Rome. They speak a patois, that is, a mixture of Celtic, Arabic, Latin, and French, of which three fifths of the words are Latin. Of late years, however, especially in the towns, the peculiar dialect has been giving way to pure French. The northern division of the department consists of mountains, with valleys between them, which gradually decline in height as they approach the coast, where they expand into a level and fertile plain. The soil on the higher parts is commonly stony, chalky, and barren; but on the plain on the coast, though marshy, extremely fruitful. The corn raised in the department is of less importance than those vegetable substances which are the produce of southern climates. The chief attention is paid to the vines, and the wines are highly esteemed, especially those called Muscatel, Frontignac, and Lunel; but a very large proportion of the grapes are distilled, and yield brandy and spirits of wine for the foreign trade. Many olive trees are planted, and the oil which they afford is said to be equal to that of Provence. Silk worms are extensively bred, but chiefly in the district of the Cevennes. The country abounds in mines, which were once extensively worked; but at present all are abandoned except some of coals, which yield annually about 90,000 tons, and serve as fuel where wood is beginning to become scarce. Some salt is made by natural evaporation on the sea-coast; but not more than 6000 tons, though it would be very easy to procure a much larger quantity. The fishing for sardinias gives employment to numerous persons on the sea-shore. There are manufactures of woollen and cotton goods, and some of silk; and there are establishments for preparing chemical articles, perfumery, and dyers’ colours. The chief exports consist of wine, brandy, vinegar, spirits of wine, rosins, figs, almonds, capers, cork, oil, honey, wax, soap, and perfumery. The capital is the city of Montpellier, whose salubrity is much celebrated.

’ HERB, in Botany, a name by which Linnaeus denominates that portion of every vegetable which arises from the root, and is terminated by the fructification. It comprehends, 1. the trunk, stalk, or stem; 2. the leaves; 3. those minute external parts called by the same author the fulcra or supports of plants; and, 4. the buds, or, as he also terms them, the winter-quarters, of the future vegetable.
