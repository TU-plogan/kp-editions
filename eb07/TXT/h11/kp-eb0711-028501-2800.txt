HERTHA, or Herthus, in Mythology, a deity worshipped by the ancient Germans, and mentioned by Tacitus, in his book De Moribus Germanorum (c. 40). Vossius conjectures, that this goddess was Cybele; but she was more probably Terra, or the Earth, because the Germans still use the word lÎ¹ert for the earth, whence also the English word earth.
