HAGUE, a large city, formerly denominated a village, in the province of Holland, in the Netherlands, about ten miles from Leyden, and thirty from Amsterdam, and three miles from the sea-shore. It is the chief seat of government, the residence of the king, and the place of assembly for the states-general and the several boards of the executive administration. It is situated amongst rich meadows, intersected by canals, used both as roads and for the conveyance of heavy goods. The streets are straight, broad, and clean, the public buildings magnificent, and the private houses commodious and handsome. It has a few squares, and a beautiful park joined to the city, with groves of trees and excellent promenades. Within the town the canals have lime trees on their banks. The royal palace is a handsome old building, and in the stadthouse there is a very fine collection of paintings. It contains fourteen churches, two synagogues, a poor-house and orphan-house, and other institutions of beneficence, with about (in 1831) 56,105 inhabitants. It is not a place of trade beyond the preparation of gold and silver articles and jewellery, and of such other articles as the luxury of a capital requires. Long. 4. 11. 20. E. Lat. 52. 3. 5. N.
