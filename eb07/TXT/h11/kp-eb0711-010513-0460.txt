HAFAR, a considerable river-canal in the province of Irak Arabi. It proceeds from the river Karo√∂n, which, after its confluence with the Abzal at Bandikeel, and before its separation, contains a greater body of waters than either the Tigris or the Euphrates. On its arrival at [7:11:106]Sabla, a ruined village, thirty miles east of Bassora, it disunites, and the largest division, taking the name of Hafar, after a course of fourteen or fifteen miles, again separates. The greater proportion of the waters continue their course in an oblique direction to the east; but the name of Hafar is still given to a canal which flows westward, and joins the Euphrates by an artificial cut three miles in length. This canal is of sufficient depth to admit vessels of any size to pass at high water
