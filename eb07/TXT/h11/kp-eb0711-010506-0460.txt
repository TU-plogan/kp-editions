HADLEIGH, a market-town of the county of Suffolk, in the hundred of Cosford, sixty-five miles from London. It was formerly a borough and a trading place, but it has lost its charter; and the trade, which was chiefly in spinning, has given way to machinery. It has a market, which is held on Monday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2332, in 1811 to 2592, in 1821 to 2929, and in 1831 to 3425.
