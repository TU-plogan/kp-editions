HERSE, in Fortification, a lattice, or portcullis, in the form of a harrow, beset with iron spikes. The word herse is French, and literally signifies harrow ; being formed of the Latin herpex or irpex, which denotes the same thing. It is usually suspended by a rope fastened to a moulinet, to be cut, in case of surprise, or when the first gate is broken with a petard, that the herse may fall, and stop up the passage of the gate or other entrance of a fortress.
