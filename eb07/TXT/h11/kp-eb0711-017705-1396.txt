HAZARD, a game on dice, without tables. It is played with only two dice; and as many may play at it as can stand round the largest round table.
[7:11:178]

Two things are chiefly to be observed, main and chance; the latter belonging to the caster, and the former, or main, to the other gamesters. There can be no main throw above , nine, nor under five; so that five, six, seven, eight, and nine, are the only mains thrown at hazard. Chances and nicks are from four to ten. Thus four is a chance to nine, five to eight, six to seven, seven to six, eight to five, and nine and ten a chance to five, six, seven, and eight; in short, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten, are chances to any main, if any of these nick it not. Now nicks are either when the chance is the same with the main, as five and five, or six and twelve, seven and eleven, eight and twelve. Observe, however, that twelve is out to nine, seven, and five; eleven is out to nine, eight, six, and five; and ames-ace, and deuce-ace, are out to all mains whatever.
