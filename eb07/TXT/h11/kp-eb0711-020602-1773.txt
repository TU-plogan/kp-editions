HEIDELBURG, a city of the duchy of Baden, in Germany, in the circle of the Neckar, and capital of the bailiwick which takes its name from the city. It is situated on the river Neckar, over which is a bridge 700 feet in length. It is in a most romantic situation, the interest of which is heightened by a number of antique buildings and ruins in its vicinity, the most striking of which are the Geisberg with its lofty cupola, the Kaiserstahle on the right bank of the Neckar, the Heiligenburg, with the ruins of the castle and of the monastery, and Schloss in which is the celebrated wine cask, now in a dilapidated state. The city is walled, has a good high street, and four open places or markets; contains two Lutheran, one Reformed, and one Catholic church, a synagogue, four hospitals, and, including the suburbs, 1192 houses, with 10,500 inhabitants. It is the seat of a most respectable university, with forty-five teachers of different branches, and 600 pupils, to which belongs a library of 30,000 volumes; and several institutions for professional branches of education. It is not a place of much commerce; but some linen and woollen goods are made, and various kinds of leather are prepared. It has several breweries, and some builders of barges and boats, and a considerable fishing, especially of white fish, whose scales are valued as being formed here into artificial pearls.
