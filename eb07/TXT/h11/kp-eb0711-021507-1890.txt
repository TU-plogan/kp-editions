HELLESPONT, a narrow strait between Asia and Europe, connecting the Mediterranean with the Propontis. It received its name from Helle, who was drowned there in her voyage to Colchis. It is celebrated for the love and death of Leander, and for the bridge of boats which Xerxes built over it when he invaded Greece. It is now called the Dardanelles. This strait is about thirty-three miles in length, and, in the broadest parts, the Asiatic coast is about one mile and a half distant from the European, and only half a mile in the narrowest.
