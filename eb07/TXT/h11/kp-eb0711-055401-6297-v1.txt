HOOK, in Angling. See Angling. Hooks of a Ship, are all those forked timbers which are placed directly upon the keel, as well in her run as in her rake.

Can-Hooκs, those which being made fast to the end of a rope with a noose, like that which brewers use to sling or carry their barrels on, are made use of for slings.

Foot-Hooκs, in a ship, the same with futtocks.

Loof-Hooκs, a tackle with two hooks, one to hitch into a cringle of the main or foresail, in the bolt-rope at the leech of the sail by the clew, and the other is to hitch into a strap, which is spliced to the chess-tree. Their use is to pull down the sail, and succour the tackles in a large sail and stiff gale, that all the stress may not bear upon the tack. It is also used when the tack is to be seized more secure, and to take off or put on a bonnet or drabler.

Hook Pins, in Architecture, are taper iron pins, only with a hook-head, to pin together the frame of a roof or floor.
