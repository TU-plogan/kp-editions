HARTLEPOOL, a market-town and sea-port in the ward of Stockton, of the county of Durham. It is an incorporated town, with a mayor and aidermen; but the [7:11:157]trade is inconsiderable, consisting chiefly of the export of coals. It is frequented in the months of summer as a sea-bathing place. The population amounted in 1801 to 993, in 1811 to 1047, in 1821 to 1249, and in 1831 to 1330.
