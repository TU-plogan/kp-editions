HERMIANI, or Hermiatitae, a sect of heretics in the second century, so called from their leader Hermias. They were also denominated Seleuciani. One of their distinguishing tenets was, that God is corporeal; and another, that Jesus Christ did not ascend into heaven with his body, but left it in the sun.
