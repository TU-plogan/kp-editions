HIGHGATE, a populous village, four miles from London, on the great north road. It is situated on a hill over-lookingthe metropolis, and commanding extensive views to the south beyond it. It is the residence of several of the opulent merchants and traders of the city, some of whose houses are of great elegance. It is partly in the parish of Hornsey and partly in that of Paneras, but has a church or chapel of ease. It was designed a few years ago to form a tunnel and a roadway through the hill; but that plan has yielded to an archway, which has lightened the labour of horses.
