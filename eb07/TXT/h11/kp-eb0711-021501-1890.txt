HELLAS, in Ancient Geography, an appellation comprehending, according to the more ancient Greeks and Romans, Achaia and Peloponnesus, but afterwards restricted to Achaia. It was bounded on the west by the river Achelous, on the north by Mounts Othrys and Oeta, on the east by the Aegean Sea, and on the south by the Saronic and Corinthian Bays, and by the isthmus which joins it to Peloponnesus. It was called Hellas, from Hellen, the son of Deucalion, or from Hellas, a district of Thessaly; and hence Hellenes, the gentilitious name, denoting Greeks.
