HEALFANG, Healsfang, or Halsfang, in our ancient customs, signifies collistrigium, or the punishment of the pillory. The word is compounded of two Saxon words, halp, neck, and pangen, to contain: Poena scilicet qua alicui collum stringatur. The healfang, however, cannot signify a pillory in the charter of Canutus, De Porestis (cap. xiv.): Et pro culpa solvat regi duos solidos, quos Dani vocant halfehang.

Healfang is also taken for a pecuniary mulct in commutation of the punishment of the pillory; and is to be paid either to the king or the chief lord. Qui falsum testimonium dedit, reddat regi vel terree domino healfang.
