HIEROCLES, a violent promoter of the persecution of the Christians under Diocletian, flourished in the year 302. He wrote against the Christian religion some books, in which he pretends to expose inconsistencies in the Holy Scriptures, and compares the miracles of Apollonius Tyanaeus with those of Jesus Christ. He was refuted by Lactantius and Eusebius. The remains of his works were collected into one volume octavo by Bishop Pearson, and published in 1654, with a learned dissertation prefixed to the work.

Hierocles, a Platonic philosopher of the fifth century, who taught at Alexandria, and was admired for his eloquence. He wrote seven books upon Providence and Fate, and dedicated them to Olympiodorus, who by his embassies did the Romans good service under the emperors Honorius and Theodosius the younger. But these books are now lost, and we only know them by the extracts in Photius. He wrote also a Commentary, which is still extant, upon the golden verses of Pythagoras.
