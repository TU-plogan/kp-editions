HORATH, three Roman brothers, who, under the reign of Tullus Hostilius, fought against the three Curiatii, belonging to the Alban army. Two of the Horatii were killed; but the third, by his address, successively slew the three wounded Curiatii, and by this victory rendered the city of Alba subject to the Romans.
