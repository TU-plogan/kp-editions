HABERGION, or Haubergeon, Habergetum, a [7:11:101]coat of mail, or ancient piece of defensive armour, in form of a coat, descending from the neck to the middle, and formed of little iron rings, or meshes, linked into each other. It is also written haberge, hauberge, haubere, haubert, hautber, hautbert, and hauberk. Spelman derives it from the ancient French hault, high, and berg, armour or covering; as serving to defend the upper part of the body. Du Cange and Skinner derive it from the Belgic hals, or Teutonic hnltz, neck, and bergen, to cover; that is, a defence for the neck. Others conceive that it is formed of al, alia, meaning all, and bergen, to cover; as importing a cover for the whole body. In Scripture it seems to signify an offensive weapon. “The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold; the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.” (Job, xli. 26.)
