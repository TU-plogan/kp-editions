HIGH, a term or relation, importing that one thing is superior to or above another. Thus we say a high mountain, the high court of parliament, high relief, and the like.

High, in Music, is sometimes used in the same sense with loud, and sometimes in the same sense with acute. High Places were eminences upon which the heathens used to worship their gods, and which were chosen for that purpose as being supposed to be nearer heaven, their constant residence. The Jews are frequently blamed for their attachment to high places, after the manner of the Gentiles; and their proseuchoe wore frequently upon mountains, with groves planted round them. Where high places are reprobated in Scripture, therefore, we should understand them as places abused and prostituted to idolatrous purposes.

High Way, a free passage for the king’s subjects; on which account it is called the hing s high way. High -Way-Men are robbers on the high way, for the apprehending and taking of whom a reward of L.40 is promised by the statute 4 and 5 W. and Μ. to be paid within a month after eonviction by the sheriff of the county; to which the statute 8 Geo. II. cap 6 superadds L.10 to be paid by the hundred indemnified by such capture.
