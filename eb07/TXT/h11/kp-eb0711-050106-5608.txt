HOCHHEIM, a market-town of the duchy of Nassau, in Germany, the capital of a bailiwick of the same name. It stands on an elevated spot, at the junction of the Nidda with the Maine. It contains a church, and 440 houses, with 1Î²50 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is celebrated for producing the best wines of the Rhine, which have generally been known in England by the name of Hock. That of peculiar excellence is, however, the growth of a particular vineyard, which is not more than ten acres in extent, and sells, even when new, at a very high price.
