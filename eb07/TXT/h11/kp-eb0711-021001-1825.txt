HEIR, in Law, signifies the person who succeeds another by descent.

HÎ•in-Apparent is a person so called in the lifetime of his ancestor, at whose death he is heir-at-law.

IlEiR-Presumptive, is one who, if the ancestor should die immediately, would, in the present circumstances of things, be his heir; but whose right of inheritance may be defeated by the contingency of some nearer heir being born.
