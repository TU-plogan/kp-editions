HUSTINGS (from the Saxon word hustinge, meaning concilium or curia), a court held in Guildhall before the lord mayor and aidermen of London. This court is very ancient, as appears by the laws of Edward the Confessor. Some other cities have likewise had a court bearing the same name, as Winchester and York. But this term is now applied to those temporary structures where the business of elections is conducted.
