HERB, in Botany, a name by which Linnaeus denominates that portion of every vegetable which arises from the root, and is terminated by the fructification. It comprehends, 1. the trunk, stalk, or stem; 2. the leaves; 3. those minute external parts called by the same author the fulcra or supports of plants; and, 4. the buds, or, as he also terms them, the winter-quarters, of the future vegetable.
