HEPHAeSTIO, one of the chief favourites of Alexander the Great, was the son of Amyntor of Pella, the capital of Macedonia. He accompanied Alexander in his expedition against the Persians; and yet it is not a little surprising that he held no military command till after the battle of Arbela, b. c. 331, when he was appointed leader of a squadron of horse. (Arrian, iii. 15.) From this time his advancement to superior command was rapid, for we find him next year, b. c. 330, in the expedition against the [7:11:240] Parthians and Hyrcanìans, hipparchos, or colonel, of a regiment. (iii. 27.) In the campaign against the inhabitants of Sogdiana, he was appointed to the command of a brigade, and was then sent with Perdiccas into the country of Peucelastis, on the banks of the Indus, where he took the chief town. (iv. 16, 22, 23.) After the battle in which Porus was defeated on the banks of the Hydaspes, b. c. 327, Hephaestio was sent with a body of troops against another Porus, who reigned over the country along the banks of the Hydraotes. (v. 21; Diodor, xvii. 21.) As a reward for his services, he received from his royal friend Drypetis, the daughter of Darius, last king of Persia. (Arrian, vii. 4.) But he did not long survive the successful termination of Alexander’s exploits; for being taken ill at Ecbatana, where all had assembled to return thanks to the gods with more than ordinary solemnity for their success, Hephaestio suddenly died, to the inconsolable grief of Alexander. (vii. 14; Diodor. Sic. xvii. 114, 115.)

Hephaestio, a grammarian of Alexandria, in Egypt, who lived a. D. 150, and is supposed to have been one of the preceptors of Aelius Verus, mentioned by Julius Capitolinus in his life of that emperor. ( Vit. Veri, c. 2.) Suidas states that he was a voluminous writer, though chiefly on grammar and metres; but, of all his works, nothing has been preserved except an Elementary Treatise on Metres. (Eγχεiξiδιοv mp μiroωv κα∕ ποιημάτων.) Though this work is by no means complete, nor always correct, still it is valuable as being the only one on that subject which has reached us. It has been illustrated by numerous scholia; and there is an introduction to it (πξθλsγoμsva), ascribed to the celebrated Longinus, which was first published by Hudson in the preface to his edition of the work (⅞r≡g∕ ύψους), Oxford, 1710. The principal editions of this work of Hephaestio are, Florent, ap. Junt. 1526; Par. ap. Turne-bum, with scholia, 1553; Trajecti ad Rhenum, ap. Pauw, 1726; but the best is by Gaisford, Oxford, 1810.
