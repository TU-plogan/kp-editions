HEREFORD, a city, the capital of the county of the same name, situated on the river Wye. It was built before 823, where the first church was erected, and afterwards, in 1015, converted into a cathedral. The present cathedral was begun by the second bishop, on the model of the church at Aix-la-Chapelle. The city is composed of six parishes, though there are only four churches now in existence. A part of the cathedral fell down in 1786, but has been since rebuilt. The streets are wide and clean, and the buildings generally handsome. In the market-place or square is the county hall, a good building, in which the assizes and sessions are held. As Herefordshire is the nearest English county to Wales, much legal business is brought to the city from that principality. The government of the city is in the hands of a corporate body, consisting of a mayor, six aidermen, a recorder, and a common council. Two members are returned to the House of Commons by the freemen and householders, about 1100 in number. The air of the vicinity is considered peculiarly salubrious. There are well-supplied markets on Wednesday and Saturday, at which provisions of all kinds are moderate. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 6828, in 1811 to 7306, in 1821 to 9090, and in 1831 to 10,280.
