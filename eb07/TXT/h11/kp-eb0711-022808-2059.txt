HELSINGFORS, a circle of the Russian government of Finland, on the Gulf of Bothnia, extending over 6808 square miles, and comprehending three cities or towns, 6692 villages or farms, 21,952 families, and a population of 175,000 persons. The northern part is mountainous; but the southern is low and level, and produces sufficient corn for the demand of the inhabitants. It yields for exportation some hemp and flax, and a little iron for home use. The capital, of the same name, is situated on the sea-shore, and, since it has come under the Russian dominion, has been regularly fortified. The harbour is deep, safe, and spacious, and is frequented by foreign ships, as well as by those belonging to the city. The chief trade consists in the export of planks, masts, spars, corn, and salted fish. It contains three churches, 1100 houses, and 9105 inhabitants. Long. 26. 55. E. Lat. 60. 5. N.
