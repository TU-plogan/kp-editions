HAM, or Cham, in Ancient Geography, the country of the Zuzims (Gen. xiv. 5), the situation of which is not known.

Ham, the youngest son of Noah, was the father of Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan, each of whom had the several countries peopled by them. With respect to Ham, it is believed that he had all Africa for his inheritance, and that he peopled it with his children. As for himself, it is thought by some that he dwelt in Egypt; but Basnage is of opinion that neither Ham nor Mizraim ever were in Egypt, but that their posterity settled in that country, and called it by the name of their ancestors. And as to Ham’s being worshipped as a god, and called Jupiter Hammon, he thinks people may have been led into this mistake by the similitude of names; and that Jupiter Hammon or Ammon was the sun, to which divine honours were at all times paid in Egypt. However this may be, Africa is called the land of Ham in several places of the Psalms (Psal. lxxvii. 51, civ. 23, cv. 22). In Plutarch, Egypt is called Chemia ; and there are some traces of the name of Ham or Cham observed in Psochemmis and Psittachemmis, which are cantons of Egypt.

Ham, a Saxon word, used to signify a place of dwelling, a village or town; and hence the termination of some of our towns, Nottingham, Buckingham, and the like. A home, close, or little narrow meadow, is also denominated a ham. Ham is likewise part of the leg of an animal, being the inner or hind part of the knee, or the ply or angle in which the leg and thigh, when bent, incline to each other.

Ham, in Commerce, means a leg or thigh of pork, dried, seasoned, and prepared, to make it keep, and to give it a brisk agreeable flavour.
