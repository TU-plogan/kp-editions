HERALDUS, Desiderius, in French Hérault, a counsellor of the parliament of Paris, who in different works gave proofs of uncommon learning. His Adversaria appeared in the year 1599; but if the Scaligerana may be credited, he repented having published it. His notes on Tertullian’s Apology, on Minutius Felix, and on Arnobius, are esteemed; and he also wrote notes on Martial’s Epigrams. He disguised himself under the name of David Leidhresserus, to write a political dissertation on the independence of kings, some time after th⅛ death of Henry IV. He had a controversy with Salmasius, De Jure Attico αc Romano ; but did not live to finish what he had written on the subject. What he had executed, however, was printed in 1650. He died in June 1649. Guy Patin says that he was looked upon as a very learned man, both in the civil law and in polite literature, and that he wrote with great facility on any subject he pitched on.
