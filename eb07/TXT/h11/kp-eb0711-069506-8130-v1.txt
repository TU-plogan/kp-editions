HOSSO-DURGA j a stnall town of Hindustan, in the province of South Cahara. It possesses a fort and a temple, which is served by a few Puttar Brahmins, the chief inhabitants of the place. The fort is large and well built, with round bastions, which render it more defensible than the forts in India with square bastions generally are. The surrounding country is overgrown with wood, and but thinly inhabited, consisting, like the rest of Malabar, of low hills and narrow valleys alternately.
