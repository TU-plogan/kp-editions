HYACINTHUS, a son of Amyclas and of Diomede (Apollodor. iii. 10, 3), or of Pierus and of Clio (i. 3, 3), beloved by Apollo and. Zephyrus. He gave the preference to the former, and whilst they were amusing themselves at quoit, Zephyrus in revenge blew the quoit which Apollo had thrown, on the forehead of Hyacinthus, and he was killed by the blow. Apollo was so disconsolate at the loss of Hyacinthus that he changed his blood into a flower of the same name, and on the petals engraved the exclamation Aâˆ•, alas. (Paus. iii. 19, 1.)
