HUMOUR, from the Latin humor, in its original signification, stands for moisture in general; and hence it has been restricted to signify the moisture of animal bodies, or those fluids which circulate through them. As the temper of the mind has been supposed to depend upon the state of the fluids in the body, humour came to be synonymous with temper and disposition.

Humour is often made use of to express a particular species or modification of wit. See Wit.
