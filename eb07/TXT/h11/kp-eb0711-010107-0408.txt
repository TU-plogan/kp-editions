HADDINGTON, a royal burgh of Scotland, and capital of the county of the same name. It is situated on the left bank of the river Tyne, on the great road between Edinburgh and London, about sixteen and a hall miles from the former capital. Haddington is a place of considerable antiquity, but the exact date of its origin is unknown. In records which belong to the twelfth century, it comes into notice as a demesne of David I., who occupied it as his burgh, with a church, a mill, and other apurtenants of a manor. Ada, the wife of Henry, son and hen [7:11:102]of this monarch, came into possession of the town, and was very attentive to its interests, founding here in 1178 a convent of Cistertian nuns, which she endowed with the lands of Clerkington. Other lands, and several churches, likewise belonged to the nuns of this place; but these were of course confiscated at the reformation. There was also a monastery of Franciscan or Grey Friars at Haddington. The choir of the church, which is now in ruins, was anciently called the Lamp of Lothian (^Lucerna LaudonicT) i because of its beautiful structure, and from its being kept constantly lighted, and thus rendered visible by night at a considerable distance. Oh the east of what is called the Nungate are the ruins of a chapel dedicated to St Martin. After the death of Ada above mentioned, the town became the property of her son William the Lion, whose son Alexander II. was born here. For some time Haddington seems to have been exempt from the miseries of war; but in 1216 it was burned by king John of England. In 1244, and again about two hundred years ago, it suffered a similar fate; but these were accidental occurrences. By the overflowings of the Tyne, it has likewise been repeatedly inundated. So late as 1775, the suburb of the Nungate was overwhelmed, and the whole town was submerged beneath the waters of the river, which had risen to seventeen feet above their ordinary level. Haddington was formerly surrounded by strong walls, which were provided with gates and ports, and also fortified. It was taken possession of by the English after the battle of Pinkie, arid in the year following endured a siege by the Scotch, which makes some figure in history. Little, however, now remains of the ancient defences of this place; and although, as we have said, it was a royal residence, the only relics which tradition points to as those of a palace or castle, are found at a short distance from the western port of Haddington, within the walls, on the site of which the county buildings or court-house was recently erected. The town at present consists of a main or High Street, which stretches in a direction from cast to west, and forms a portion of the road from London to Edinburgh. It is a spacious and handsome street, and possesses some elegant buildings. Parallel to it, on the north, runs the Back Street, having two cross streets at their eastern extremity. The town-house is a respectable fabric, provided with a handsome spire 150 feet in height. Connected with this edifice are the departments used as a jail for the town and county. The town is connected with the ancient suburb of Nungate, by a bridge of four arches thrown over the Tyne. The old Franciscan church is a fine Gothic building, although partly dilapidated. It is 210 feet in length, and is surmounted by a square tower ninety feet in height, and of handsome architecture. Some years ago the chancel, or west end of the cross, was repaired, and now forms a handsome parish church. Haddington, being situated in the midst of a rich and populous agricultural district, serves as the depot of inland trade, and by this means its prosperity has been greatly advanced. The market, which is held on Friday, is a favourite place of resort for the sale and purchase of grain by the East Lothian farmers, and corn-dealers from different quarters. The town possesses no manufactories of any importance, if we except a few tan-works; and there are two distilleries and two breweries; but a number of extensive trades are also carried on. For facilitating business, branches of two banking establishments are here settled. As a royal burgh, the civic government of Haddington is vested in a provost, two merchant-bailies, a trades-bailie, a dean of guild, a treasurer, and twelve councillors. Since the passing of the burgh reform act, the deacons no longer sit as councillors, the distinction between merchant and trades-councillors having ceased to exist. The county courts of the sheriff are held here every Thursday during session time, and a sheriff small debt court every alternate Thursday. There is also a justice of peace court held at various times during the year. Haddington is the seat of a presbytery; and, besides the parish church, there are several chapels and meeting-houses, where dissenting bodies assemble. There is here an excellent academy, under the patronage of the magistrates, a parochial school, and several private educational establishments. There is also a school of arts institution, connected with which is a library, and a collection of philosophical apparatus. Besides a number of benefit and friendly societies, there have been recently established in Haddington The United Agricultural Society of East Lothian, and the East Lothian Horticultural Society. The population of the burgh and parish of Haddington amounted in 1821 to 5255, and in 1831 to 5883.
