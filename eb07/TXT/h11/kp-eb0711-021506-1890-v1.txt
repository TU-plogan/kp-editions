HELLENODICAe, 'Ελλί^οδ/χαι, va Antiquity, the directors of the Olympian games. At first there was only one, but afterwards the number was increased to two, to three, and at length to nine. They assembled in a place called ’ Eλλ>jvoδ∕κα∕ov, in the Elean forum, where they were obliged to reside ten months before the celebration of the games, to take care that such as offered themselves to contend performed their <iιoοrpoμvMμaτa, or preparatory exercises, and were instructed in all the laws of games by certain men called w 1 αo^υλακsς, or keepers of the laws. And the better to prevent all unjust practices, they were further obliged to take an oath that they would act impartially, take no bribes, nor discover the reason for which they disliked or approved of any of the competitors. At the solemnity they sat naked, having before them the victor’s crown till the exercises were finished, and then it was presented to whomsoever they adjudged it. Nevertheless, there lay an appeal from the Hellenodicae to the Olympian senate.
