HAARLEM, or Haerlem, a city of the Netherlands, the capital of the province, and of a circle of the same name. It lies about four miles from the sea-shore, on an extensive lake of fresh water, which it is now under consideration to drain and convert into meadows. It is a well-built town, with a fine market-place; but some of the streets, though well built and paved, are narrow. It is the seat of a Catholic bishop, who officiates in a cathedral; but the largest church, called the Dome Church, is occupied by the Protestants. It has one of the most powerful and best-toned organs in Europe, with 8000 pipes, some thirty-two feet in length. It contains, besides these, seven Catholic, five Calvinist, and one Lutheran church, and chapels for some smaller sects. The houses are about 8000, and the inhabitants amounted in 1831 to 21,667.

The trade and manufactures are extensive. The water is deemed peculiarly adapted for bleaching, and many fine linens made in Germany and Holland are sent here to receive the desired whiteness. There are printed cottons well executed; and vast quantities of small wares, such as thread, tapes, bobbins, and Dutch lace, still made, though the rivalry of England has diminished the sale for them. One great trade of Haarlem is in flower seeds, flowers, and bulbs, which are sent on a large scale from beautifully arranged and ornamented gardens around the city. Near it are some magnificent country houses, especially that of the Hopes, occupied by Louis Buonaparte whilst king of Holland. In the market is a statue of Coster, who in Haerlem is contended to have been the inventor of printing. Long. 4. 29. 25. E. Lat. 52. 22. 16. N.
