HAWICK, a town of Scotland, in the county of Roxburgh, fifty-two miles from Edinburgh, on the Carlisle road, partly in the parish of Wilton, but chiefly in the parish of Hawick, is conveniently situated on the south bank of the Teviot, and transversely divided into two nearly equal portions by the confluent stream of Slitte-rick. The antiquity of the place appears from a singular conical mount called the Mote, supposed to be the spot where courts of justice were formerly held. In the border wars Hawick makes a considerable figure under its munificent patrons, the barons of Drumlanrig, from whom its charter, dated 1537, is derived; and in 1545, for its hospitality towards the unfortunate Mary, it received from her a royal confirmation of all its corporate rights. The town is governed by its own magistrates, independently of the superior, and has all the privileges of a royal burgh, parliamentary representation excepted. Two bailies, chosen annually by the burgesses, are assisted by a council, consisting of two representatives from each of the seven incorporated but now chiefly decayed trades, and fifteen burgesses, adopted into their number, as councillors for life. The municipal possessions, though mutilated by the ungenerous and rashly admitted claims of neighbouring proprietors, still yield a clear revenue of L.400 per annum. The town has greatly improved within these thirty years. The thatched roofs which disfigured it are disappearing, and more attention is paid to elegance in modern structures. The whole is well paved, and, with the shops, manufactories, and many of the private houses, illuminated with gas. An ample supply of excellent water is brought, at the expense of the corporation, from the neighbouring heights. The principal street, running east and west, is spacious and regular. The town-house, with a spire and clock, is small and inadequate. Beautifully situated on a commanding eminence near the centre of the town, stands the parish church, a clumsy edifice, and every way deficient in accommodation. There is also the parish church of Wilton, and four other public places of worship, viz. two Secession, one Relief, and one Friends’ meeting-house. Hawick has long been the principal seat of the manufacture of lamb’s wool hose in Scotland. The spinning-mills are all driven by water. Of these, the number would be greater, but for the policy of the Buccleuch family, whose domains surround the town, and which they decline to feu for building purposes. The trade of the town is nevertheless rapidly on the increase. The staple articles, besides hose, are blankets, flannels, plaidings, shawls, and woollen yarn; of which last large quantities are sold to Scotch and English manufacturers. Thongs and whips are also manufactured to a considerable extent. There is a weekly market held on Thursday, principally for grain. Branches of the British Linen Company, Commercial, and National Banks, assist the trade of the place. There are two good public libraries, two reading-rooms well supported, and a farmer’s club, which meets monthly. 'The banks of the Tiviot are well wooded, and finely studded with gentlemen’s seats, though these are considerably restricted by the large entailed estates of Buccleuch. The [7:11:173]approach to the town on the east and west is embellished by extensive nurseries; and the picturesque line along the Tiviot is generally admired. The population of the town, including the suburb of Wilton, amounted in 1831 to 5340; and it is still on the increase.
