HESYCHIUS, the most celebrated of all the ancient Greek grammarians whose works are now extant, was a Christian; and, according to some, the same with Hesychius, patriarch of Jerusalem, who died in the year 609. He wrote a Greek lexico, which, in the opinion of Casaubon, is the most learned and useful work of that kind produced by the ancients. Schrevelius published a good edition of it in 1668, in 4to, with notes; but the best is that of John Alberti, printed at Leyden in 1746, in two vols. folio.
