HEPTARCHY (compounded of the Greek ⅛rα, septem, seven, and v⅛γy, imperium, government), a government composed of seven persons, or a country governed by seven persons, or divided into seven kingdoms. The Saxon heptarchy included all England, which was cantoned out into seven petty independent kingdoms. See Britain.
