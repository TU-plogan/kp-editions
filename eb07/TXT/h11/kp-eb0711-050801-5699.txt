HOLDSWORTH, Edward, a polite and elegant scholar, was born about the year 1688, and educated at Winchester school. He was thence elected demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in July 1705; took the degree of master of arts in April 1711; and then became a collegetutor, and had many pupils. In 1715, when about to be chosen to a fellowship, he resigned his demyship and left the college, because he felt unwilling to take the oath of allegiance to the new government. The remainder of his life was spent in travelling as tutor with young noblemen and gentlemen, in which capacity he visited Rome in 1741 and 1744. He died of a fever at Lord Digby’s house at Coleshill in Warwickshire, on the 30th of December 1747. He was the author of the Muscipula, a poem, esteemed a masterpiece of its kind, and of which there is a good English translation by Dr John Hoadly, in Dodsley’s Miscellanies (vol. v.). He was also the author of a dissertation entitled Pharsalia and Philippi, or the two Philippi in Virgil’s Georgies attempted to be explained and reconciled to History, 1741, in 4to; and of Remarks and Dissertations on Virgil; besides some other classical observations, published with several notes and additional remarks by Mr Spence, 1768, in 4to. Mr Spence speaks of him in his Polymetis, as one who more thoroughly understood Virgil than any person he ever knew.
