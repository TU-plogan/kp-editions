HORATIUS, surnamed Cocles, from his losing an eye in combat, was nephew of the consul Horatius Pulvillus, and descended from one of the three brothers who fought against the Curiatii. Porsenna having laid siege to Rome, drove the Romans from Janiculum, and pursued them to the wooden bridge over the Tiber, which joined the city to Janiculum. Largius, Herminius, and Horatius Cocles, sustained the shock of the enemy at the bridge, and prevented them entering the city with the Romans; but Largius and Herminius having passed the bridge, Horatius Cocles was left alone, and repulsed the enemy till the bridge was broken down under him, when he threw himself armed into the [7:11:562] Tiber, swam across the river, and entered Rome in triumph.
