HAUL, an expression peculiar to seamen, signifying to pull a single rope, without the assistance of blocks or other such mechanical powers. When a rope is otherwise pulled, as by the application of tackles, or connection with blocks, the term is changed into bowsing. To Haul the Wind is to direct the ship’s course nearer to that point of the compass from which the wind blows.
