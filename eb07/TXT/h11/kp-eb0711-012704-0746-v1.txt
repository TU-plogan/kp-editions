HAMMERSMITH, a large village, a part of the parish of Fulham, in the hundred of Ossulton, in the county of Middlesex. It is about three or four miles from the capital; but from thence to the end of it are continued streets, which make it a kind of prolongation of the metropolis. It stands on the Thames, on whose banks, within this district, are many beautiful villas and splendid houses. There is an establishment for the education of young ladies of the Roman Catholic church, amongst whom are some professed nuns. There are also a great number of other boarding schools of various classes. There is a chapel in the centre of the village, of the established religion, and several for both Catholic and Protestant dissenters. The population amounted in 1801 to 5600, in 1811 to 7393, in 1821 to 8809, and in 1831 to 10,222.
