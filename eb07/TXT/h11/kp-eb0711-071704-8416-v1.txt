+=====================================================================+


HUET, Peter Daniel, bishop of Avranches, was born at Caen on the 8th of February 1630, and early distinguished for his love of letters and philosophy. His parents having died whilst he was yet an infant, Huet fell into the [7:11:718] hands of guardians who neglected him; but his invincible love of learning enabled him to surmount every disadvantage, and he finished his studies in the belles-lettres before he had completed his thirteenth year. He studied philosophy under Father Mambrun, a Jesuit, who, in imitation of Plato, directed him to commence by learning geometry; and Huet contracted such a relish for the mathematics, that he applied himself to almost every branch of the exact sciences, and maintained public theses thereon at Caen. But he was withdrawn from this pursuit by the Principles of Descartes on the one hand, and the Sacred Geography of Bochart on the other. Of Descartes, then in all his vogue, Huet was a warm admirer, and, for many years, adhered to his philosophy, which, however, he at length saw reason to abandon as visionary. But the work of Bochart, who, like himself, was a native of Caen, made a more lasting impression upon his mind, and inspired him with that taste for erudition by which he was afterwards so much distinguished. In 1652 Huet accompanied Bochart in a visit to Sweden, w here he met with a most gracious reception from the queen, Christina. In undertaking this journey he had two objects in view; one was, to see Christina, who was then occupied in regulating and improving her states; and the other to become acquainted with the learned men by whom that princess was surrounded, and to examine the ancient manuscripts in her possession, particularly one of the works of Origen. He returned with literary treasures of more than one kind, which in due time he communicated to the public. Scarcely had he revisited his native city, when, in conjunction with some friends, he formed there an academy for the encouragement of learning, which, we believe, is still in existence. The reputation and merit of Huet, however, had not procured him any solid recompense, w hen, in 1670, he was united as sub-preceptor with Bossuet, who had just been appointed to superintend the education of the Dauphin. It was at this period that he took occasion to embark in a work which suited him perfectly, and in which he was engaged nearly twenty years. In conformity with a suggestion of the Duke of Montausier, he formed the plan of those editions of the Latin classics, ad usurn Delphini, destined for the instruction of his illustrious pupil; and it was he who directed the execution of the undertaking. In 1674 he was received into the French Academy; and it may be remarked that, in his inaugural discourse, he complained that ancient learning was then held in little estimation, being almost banished from the commerce of the polite world, and buried in the dust and obscurity of a few cabinets. Fléchier, who was then director of the academy, spoke in reply, and dwelt upon the protracted and useful studies which had been the delight of the Abbé Huet in his early youth, and which formed the sole occupation, as well as passion, of his more mature years. His duties as sub-preceptor did not prevent him from satisfying his ardent taste for the most difficult languages, and the most ancient books. Leaving court in the evening, he occasionally passed entire nights in the libraries of Paris, whence he derived the information which he could not obtain from his own. In 1678 Louis XIV. granted him, as a recompense for his zeal and services, the abbey of Avenay, near Caen, where he composed the greater part of his works. In 1685 he was appointed to the bishopric of Soissons, of which, however, he did not take possession; he had not, in fact, received the bulls in 1689, when Μ. Brûlart de Śillery, nominated for the bishopric of Avranches, proposed to him an exchange. This latter see was much more acceptable to Huet, because it fixed him at no great distance from his native city and his abbey; but he was not consecrated until 1692, by reason of some differences which had arisen between the court of France and that of Rome. Huet did not neglect his episcopal duties; but when these were discharged, he indulged his love of learning with so much ardour, and passed so much time in his library, that men of the world, and even ecclesiastics, who had business to transact with him, could scarcely obtain access to the studious prelate. An individual who had often been told, when he called, that the bishop could not be seen, because he was occupied among his books, withdrew one day, much dissatisfied; “why,” said he, “has the king sent us a bishop who has not yet completed his studies.” Huet, however, did not long retain his preferment. Sensible of growing infirmities, and finding that he could not reconcile his tastes with his duties, he resigned his bishopric, and received in exchange the abbey of Fontenay, situated at the gates of Caen. Some time afterwards he repaired „to Paris; established himself in the Jesuits’ College there, to which he presented his fine library; and, during twenty years, divided his time between prayer and study, for which he preserved his taste to the last. Zealous for the glory of that religion which, in more than one work, he had ably defended, he closed his long and honourable career on the 26th January 1721, at the advanced age of about ninety-one. The works of Huet, the greater part of which continue to be held in high estimation, are, 1.
