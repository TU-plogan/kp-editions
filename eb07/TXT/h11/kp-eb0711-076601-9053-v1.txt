HUYSUM, the name of several Dutch painters. The most celebrated of these was John, whose subjects were flowers, fruit, and landscapes. He was born at Amsterdam in 1682, and was a disciple of Justus van Huysum, his father. He set out in his profession with a most commendable principle, not so much to paint for the acquisition of money, as of fame; and therefore he did not aim at expedition, but at delicacy, and strove, if possible, to arrive at perfection in his art. Having studied the pictures of Mignon, and all other artists of distinction who had painted in his own style, he tried which manner would soonest lead him to imitate the beauties of each flower, fruit, or plant, and then fixed upon a manner peculiar to himself, and which seems almost inimitable. His pictures are finished with inconceivable truth; for he painted every thing after nature, and was so singularly exact as to watch even the hour of the day in which his model appeared in its greatest perfection. By some persons he was thought to paint with greater freedom than Mignon or Breughel; with more tenderness and nature than Mario da Fiori, Michel Angelo di Campidoglio, or Segers; with more mellowness than De Heem; and with greater force of colouring than Baptist. At length his reputation rose so high, that he fixed immoderate prices on his works; so that none but princes, or those possessed of princely fortunes, could pretend to become purchasers. The large sums which Van Huysum received for his works caused him to redouble his endeavours to excel; no person was admitted into his room whilst he was painting, not even his.brothers; and his method of mixing the tints, and preserving the lustre of his colours, he kept an mpenetrable secret. From the same principle, he would never take any disciples, excepting one lady, named Haverman; and he even grew envious of her merit. By several domestic disquiets his temper became changed, and he grew morose, fretful, and apt to withdraw himself from society. There were many who envied his fame, but he continued to work, and his reputation never diminished. It is universally agreed that he excelled all who painted fruit and flowers before him, by the superiority of his touch, the delicacy of his pencil, and an amazing skill in finishing; nor does it appear probable that any future artist will ever become his competitor. Besides his merit as a painter of flowers, he also painted landscapes with great applause. They are well composed; and althoug∏ he had never seen Rome, he adorned his scenes with the noble remains of ancient magnificence preserved in that city. His pictures in this style are well coloured, and every tree is distinguished by a touch that is proper for the leafing. The grounds are well broken, and disposed with taste and judgment; the figures are designed in the manner of Lairesse, highly finished, and touched with a great deal of spirit; and through the whole composition the scene represents Italy, in the trees, the clouds, and the skies. He died in 1749, at the age of sixty-seven.
