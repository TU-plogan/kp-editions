HERACLIDAE, the descendants of Hercules, who at the time of their father’s death were residing with Ceyx, king of Trachis, who generously protected them till he was forced by the threats of Eurystheus to refuse them any longer refuge. They fled to Athens, where they received the protection of Theseus, dwelt in the Tetrapolis, and, together with the Athenians under the command of Hyllus and Iolaus, fought a battle against" Eurystheus at the pass of Sciron. The Argive king fell, and the result of this battle was the possession by the Heraclidae of the whole Peloponnesus, where they ruled for one year, at the expiration of which a pestilence drove them back again to Attica. They were succeeded by the Pelopidae, against whom the expeditions of the Heraclidae were now directed. Hyllus again collected his forces, and met the Arcadians, Ionians, and Achaeans at the isthmus, where he fell in single combat with Echemus, the son of Aëropus, prince of Tegea; upon which the Heraclidae promised not to renew the attempt for fifty, or some say a hundred years. They made two unsuccessful attempts under Cleodaeus and Aristoma-chus; but at last, led by Temenus, they met the united force of the Peloponnesus, under the command of Tisamenus, the grandson of Agamemnon, and completely defeated it, 1104 B. c. This event, which is said to have happened eighty years after the fall of Troy, and 328 years before the first Olympiad, gave the Heraclidae, along with the Dorians, entire possession of the country. (Diod. iv. 57,58. Apollodor. ii. 8, ad fin. Herod, ix. 26. Paus. ii. 13, 18; iii. 1; iv. 2; v. 3; Müller’s Dorians.)
