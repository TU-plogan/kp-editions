HITCHEN, a town in the county of Hertford, which gives its name to the hundred, thirty-four miles from London. It was once of some note for its manufactures, but none is left except that of making malt. It is a well-built town, with a good market held on Tuesday, at which much corn is sold. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3161, in 1811 to 3608, in 1821 to 4486, and in 1831 to 5211.
