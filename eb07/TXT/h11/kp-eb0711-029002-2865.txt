HEXHAM, a market-town of the county of Northumberland, in the ward of Tindal, 286 miles from London. It stands at the head of a beautiful valley, at the junction of the North with the South Tyne. The church, formerly a cathedral, is ancient and spacious, and the interior highly ornamented; and adjoining to it are some venerable appendages. The streets are narrow, but clean. It is not a place of much trade. The chief occupations are tanning leather, and making shoes and gloves. It has well-attended markets on Tuesday and Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 4565, in 1811 to 4846, in 1821 to 5436, and in 1831 to 6042.
