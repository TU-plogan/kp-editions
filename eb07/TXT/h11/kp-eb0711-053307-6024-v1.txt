HOLOFERNES, lieutenant-general of the armies of Nebuchadonosor, king of Assyria, who having in a remarkable encounter overcome Arphaxad, king of the Medes, sent to all the neighbouring nations with an intention of obliging them to submit to his empire, pretending that there was no power capable of resisting him. At the same time Holofernes, at the head of a powerful army, passed the Euphrates, entered Cilicia and Syria, and subdued almost all the people of these provinces.

Being resolved to make a conquest of Egypt, he advanced towards Judaea, little expecting to meet with any resistance from the Jews. In the mean time, he was informed that they were preparing to oppose him; and [7:11:534] Achior, the commander of the Ammonites, who had already submitted to Holofernes, and joined his army with some auxiliary troops, represented to him that the Hebrews were a people protected in a particular manner by Almighty God, as long as they were obedient to him; and therefore that he should not flatter himself with expectations of overcoming them, unless they had committed some offence against God, and thereby become unworthy of his protection. ’ Holofernes, disregarding this advice, commanded Achior to be conveyed within sight of the walls of Bethulia, tied to a tree, and left there; but the Jews came thither and unbound him.

In the mean time Holofernes formed the siege of Bethulia; and having cut off the water which supplied the city, and set guards at the only fountain which the besieged had near the walls, the inhabitants were soon reduced to extremity, and resolved to surrender if God did not send them succour in five days. Judith, informed of their resolution, conceived the design of killing Holofernes in his tent. She took her finest clothes, went out of Bethulia with her maid-seŗvant, and being brought to the general, pretended that she could no longer endure the sins and excesses of the Jews, and that God had inspired her with the design of surrendering herself to him. As soon as Holofernes saw her, he was taken with her beauty, and some days afterwards invited her to a great feast which he had prepared for the principal officers of his army. But he drank so much wine, that drunkenness, and its immediate consequence, sleep, prevented him from satisfying his passion. Judith, who in the night was left alone in his tent, cut off his head with his own sword, and departing with her servant from the camp, returned to Bethulia with the head of Holofernes. As soon as it was day, the besieged made a sally upon their enemies, who going into their general’s tent, found his headless carcass besmeared with its own blood. They then discerned that Judith had deceived them, and fled with precipitation, leaving the camp abounding with rich spoils. The Jews pursued them, killed a great number, and returned loaded with booty.

There is a considerable diversity of opinion as to the time when this war between Holofernes and the Jews happened. Some date it from the captivity of Babylon, in the reign of Manasseh, and pontificate of Eliakim the high priest; others place it some time after the captivity; and some doubt the truth of the whole transaction.
