HARPOCRATION, a grammarian of Alexandria, in Egypt, respecting whose personal history we are entirely ignorant, and even the period during which he flourished is not clearly ascertained. Some have considered him to be the Greek instructor of the Emperor Lucius Verus, mentioned by Julius Capitolinus (Life of Verus, c. 2), whilst others have made him live so late as a. d. 360, because several passages are found in his work taken from Athenaeus, who is supposed to have flourished about a. d. 300. But however this may be, we are indebted to him for a very useful, though not very complete Dictionary on the ten chief Attic Orators. It contains, though not in strictly alphabetical arrangement, historical notices of more or less known persons or circumstances, as also explanations of phrases derived from common life, and of legal terms. Its value perhaps has been enhanced by the accidental circumstance of all the dictionaries on the Greek orators, of which the ancients possessed many, being lost. Suidas and the author of the Etymologicum Magnum have both borrowed from this work. He is also the author of a work entitled ’Aiŵļ¢av Sυvαyωyιj, a collection of beautiful passages from various authors. The first edition was published along with Ulpian’s Scholia to thePhilippics of Demosthenes, by Aldus, Ven. 1503. Perhaps the best edition is that of Diudorf, Leipsic, 1824, 2 vols.; but a later edition has been published by Bekker, Berlin, 1833.
