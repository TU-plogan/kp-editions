HANSY, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Delhi, and district of Hissar Ferosch, situated on the edge of the canal, now in ruins, cut from the river Jumna about the year 1353, by Sultan Feroy. It is a very ancient town, and contains the tomb of a Mahommedan saint called Sheikh Jemmal. It was taken by the Mahommedans early in 1035, and has experienced many revolutions. Towards the end of the eighteenth century it was the capital of the short-lived principality erected by the adventurer George Thomas, and is now possessed by independent native chiefs.
