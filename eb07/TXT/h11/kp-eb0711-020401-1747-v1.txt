HEBRON, a town of Palestine, so named from a very remote antiquity. It is a place of great resort for pilgrims, both Mahommeđan and Christian. Its situation is on a hill, near the plain of Mamre, which is fertile, and planted with excellent vineyards. Here Constantine built a church, of which the walls still remain. It is twenty-seven miles south-west of Jerusalem.
