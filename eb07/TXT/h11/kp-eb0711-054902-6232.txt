HOMILY, in ecclesiastical writers, a sermon or discourse upon some point of religion, delivered in a plain manner, so as to be easily understood by the common people. The word is Greek, i>μιλιa, formed from o∕z,∕λog, coetus, assembly or council.

The Greek homily signified a familiar discourse, like the Latin sermo ; and discourses delivered in the church took these denominations, to intimate that they ivere not harangues or matters of ostentation and flourish, like those of profane orators, but familiar and useful discourses, such as those of a master to his disciples, or of a father to his children.

All the homilies of the Greek and Latin fathers were composed by bishops. We have none of Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, and many other learned persons, because, in the first ages, bishops alone were admitted to preach. The privilege was not ordinarily allowed to priests till towards the fifth century. St Chrysostom was the first presbyter who preached regularly. Origen and St Augustin also preached, but it was by a peculiar license or privilege.

Photius distinguishes a homily from a sermon by this, that the homily was performed in a more familiar manner, the prelate interrogating and talking to the people, and they in their turn answering and interrogating him, so that it was properly a conversation; whilst the sermon was delivered with more form, and in the pulpit, after the manner of the orators.

The practice of compiling homilies, which were to be committed to memory, and recited by ignorant or indolent priests, commenced towards the close of the eighth century, when Charlemagne ordered Paulus Diaconus and Alcuin to form homilies or discourses upon the Gospels and Epistles, from the ancient doctors of the church. This gave rise to the famous collection entitled the Homilarùim of Charlemagne, which being followed as a model in many productions of the same kind, composed by private persons, from a principle of pious zeal, contributed much, according to Mosheim, to nourish the indolence and to perpetuate the ignorance of a worthless clergy.

There are still extant several fine homilies, composed by the ancient fathers, particularly by St Chrysostom and St Gregory.

Clementine Homilies, in Ecclesiastical History, are nineteen homilies in Greek, published by Cotelerius, with two letters prefixed; one of them written in the name of Peter, the other in the name of Clement, to James bishop of Jerusalem, in which last they are entitled Clement’s Epitome of the Preaching and Travels of Peter. According to Leclerc, these homilies were composed by an Ebionite in the second century; but Montfoucon supposes that they were forged long after the age of Athanasius. Dr Lardner apprehends that the Clementine homilies were the original or first edition of the Recognitions; and that they are the same with the work censured by Eusebius under the title of Dialogues of Peter and Appian.
