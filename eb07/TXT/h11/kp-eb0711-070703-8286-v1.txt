HOURS, Horae, in the ancient mythology, were certain goddesses, the daughters of Jupiter and Themis. At first they were only three in number, Eunomia, Dice, and Irene; but to these were afterwards added two more, Carpo and Thallote. Homer makes them the doorkeepers of heaven, and Ovid allots them the employment of harnessing the horses of the sun.

Hours, Horae, in the Roman Catholic church, are certain prayers performed at stated times of the day, as matins, vespers, lauds, and the like. The lesser hours are, prime, tierce, sixth, and none, and they are called canonical hours, as being prescribed by the canons of the church in commemoration of the mysteries accomplished at those hours. These hours were anciently called course, cursus ; and Mabillon has written a dissertation on them, entitled De Cursu Gallicano. The first constitution enjoining the observation of the canonical hours is dated in the ninth century; being found in a capitular of Heito, bishop of Basil, directed to his curates, importing that the priests shall never be absent at the canonical hours either by day or by night.

Hour- Glass, a popular kind of chronometer or clepsydra, serving to measure the flux of time by the descent or running of sand out of one glass vessel into another.
