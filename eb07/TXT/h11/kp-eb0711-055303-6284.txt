HOOGHLY, anextensivedistrictin the province of Bengal, formerly called Saatgong, situated principally between the 21st and 22d degrees of north latitude, and extending a considerable distance along both sides of the river Hooghly. It is bounded on the north by the districts of Burdwan and Kishenagur, on the south by the sea, on the east by Jessore and the Sunderbunds, and on the west by Midnapoor. This district consists of low flat land, very fertile; but that part which is nearest to the sea is very thinly inhabited; it is called the Sunderbund, is swampy, covered with wood, and remarkably unhealthy. It is intersected in every direction by rivers and their branches, which afford great facilities for internal navigation; but these waters are unfortunately infested by gang-robbers or river pirates, who are a most ferocious banditti, robbing in gangs, and often using torture to extort from their victims the disclosure of their hidden treasures. Along the shores of the ocean salt of an excellent quality is manufactured on account of the government. Although this district is so near Calcutta, which affords a ready and constant market for its produce, the greater part of the country lies in a completely desert state, infested by alligators, tigers, and a countless variety of vermin and reptiles.

Hooghly, an ancient and formerly a large town in the province of Bengal, situated on the western bank of the Hooghly, nearly twenty-six miles above Calcutta, and supposed to have been founded by the Portuguese about the year 1538. During the Mogul government, it was a town of great consequence, being the port of the western arm of the Ganges, where the duties on merchandise are collected. It very soon drew away all the trade from Saatgong, which had been before the government port of Bengal. During the prevalence of the Portuguese dominion in India, Hooghly was fortified, and continued to flourish till the year 1632, when it was attacked by order of the emperor Shah Jehan, and, after a siege of three months and a half, was taken by the Mogul troops, a thousand of the Portuguese being killed, and four thousand four hundred men, women, and children taken prisoners. From this period Hooghly became the imperial port. All the officers of the government were ordered to remove thither, and it was placed under the jurisdiction of a special governor. In the year 1642, the English, and soon afterwards the Dutch, obtained the permission of the native government to erect factories. After this period, every encouragement was given to commerce; and Hooghly, which was called Bukh-shy Bunder, became a great commercial emporium between Europe, Persia, Arabia, and India. In 1686 hostilities commenced between the English and the nabob. An action [7:11:554]ensued, in which the nabob’s troops were defeated; and at the same time the town of Hooghly was cannonaded, and five hundred houses burned. The result, however, was a disgraceful peace; an amicable arrangement was made by the military superintendent of the district. But in consequence of Calcutta being an open town, the agent and council retired to that place. Long. 88. 28. E. Lat. 22.

Hooghly River, properly the Bhagirutty, a river of Bengal, formed by the junction of the two westernmost branches of the Ganges, the Cossimbazar, and the Jellinghy. This is thθ port of Calcutta, being the only branch of the Ganges that is navigated by large vessels; yet the entrance to the river is rendered extremely dangerous and difficult, by reason of numerous sand banks in it, which are frequently shifting. The shoals are very numerous where the Ganges is joined by the Roopmarain; and as this river directly faces the approach from the sea, whilst Hooghly turns to the right, it occasions the loss of many vessels, which are carried up the Roopmarain by the force of the tide. The spring-tides run up with great violence, advancing at the rate of fifteen miles an hour. This is what is called by the Europeans the Bore, which commences at Hooghly Point, where the river first contracts itself, and is perceptible above Hooghly town; and though the distance is above seventy miles, it traverses this space in about four hours, running along the opposite bank to the Calcutta side, whence it crosses at Chitpoor, about four miles above Fort William, and rushes with great violence past Barna-gore, Duckinsore, &c., frequently oversetting boats and driving ships from their anchorage. At Calcutta it sometimes occasions an instantaneous rise of five feet. The tide does not rise more than thirty miles above Calcutta; and during the rainy season its influence is checked by the large body of water that comes down the river. The Hooghly contains several kinds of good fish, particularly the cockup, sable mangoe fish, and prawns; and it abounds also in crocodiles and sharks. It is about three quarters of a mile broad at Calcutta, and eight or ten miles wide at the mouth. It is only navigable for ships as high as the tide reaches, and the upper part of it is nearly dry during the hot season; yet there are few rivers that can boast of a more extensive commerce, all the towns belonging to European nations, and several others by the natives, standing on its banks. It is esteemed to be the most sacred branch of the Ganges by the Hindus, and it is on this account that those who cannot afford to bury their dead throw them into the Hooghly.
