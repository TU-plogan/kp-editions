HARLEIAN Collection, a most valuable collection of useful and curious manuscripts, commenced about the end of the seventeenth century, by Robert Harley of Brampton Bryan, in Herefordshire, afterwards Earl of Oxford, and Lord High Treasurer. He procured his first considerable collection in August 1705, and in less than ten years he got together nearly two thousand five hundred rare and curious manuscripts. Soon after this, Dr George Hickes, Mr Anstis, Bishop Nicholson, and many other eminent antiquaries, not only offered him their assistance in procuring manuscripts, but presented him with several very valuable ones. Being thus encouraged to persevere by the success he met with, he kept - many persons employed abroad in purchasing manuscripts for him, and furnished them with written instructions for their guidance. By these means the collection was, in the year İ721, increased to near six thousand books, fourteen thousand original charters, and five hundred rolls. On the 2Ist of May 1724 Lord Oxford died; but his son Edward, who succeeded to his honours and estate, still further enlarged the collection; so that when he died on the 16th of June 1741, it consisted of eight thousand volumes, several of them containing distinct and independent treatises, besides many loose papers which have since been arranged and bound up in volumes, and above forty thousand original rolls, charters, letters-patent, grants, and other deeds and instruments of great antiquity. The principal design of making this collection was the establishment of a manuscript English historical library, and the rescuing from destruction such national records as had eluded the diligence of preceding collectors. But Lord Oxford’s plan was more extensive; for his collection also abounds with curious manuscripts in every science. This collection was purchased by government, and deposited in the British Museum. There is a printed catalogue of its contents.
