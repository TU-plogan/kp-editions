HENDON, a village of the hundred of Gore, in the county of Middlesex, on the river Brent, seven miles from London. Within the parish are many elegant villas, and a public classical school for the education of independent dissenters. The population amounted in 1801 to 1955, in 1811 to 2589, in 1821 to 3100, and in 1831 to 3110.

HENED-Penny, in our old writers, a customary payment of money, instead of hens, at Christmas. Du Cange is of opinion that it may be hen-penny, gallinagium, or a composition for eggs; but Cowel thinks it is misprinted hened-penny for heved-penny or head-penny.
