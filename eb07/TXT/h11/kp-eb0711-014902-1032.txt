HARMONIA, in fabulous history, the wife of Cadmus, was, according to some, daughter of Jupiter and Electra, but according to others, of Mars and Venus. Her marriage was a remarkable event in Grecian fable, and rivalled in magnificence those of Perseus, Pirithous, and Peleus. The gods honoured it with their presence, and from them she received a magnificent robe (peplun√¨) and necklace, the workmanship of Vulcan. But these divine gifts afterwards proved .the cause of many catastrophes. (See Alemaeon, Eriphyle.) Harmonia had four daughters, Semele, Ino, Agave, and Autonoe, and a son Polydorus. When every species of calamity overwhelmed the race of Cadmus at Thebes, she attended her husband to Epirus, and was changed into a serpent. (Apollodor. iii. 4, 5; Diodor. Sic. iv. 66, v. 49; Eustath.; Dionys. Peri. 391.)
