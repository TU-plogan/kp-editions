HIPPOLYTUS, a son of Theseus and Hippolyte, and celebrated in fabulous history for his virtue and his misfortunes. His stepmother Phaedra fell in love with him, and when he refused to pollute his father’s bed, she accused him to Theseus of offering violence to her person. Fier accusation was readily believed, and Theseus entreated Neptune to punish the incontinence of his son. Hippolytus fled from the resentment of his father; and as he [7:11:468] pursued his way along the sea shore, his horses were so frightened at the noise of sea calves, which Neptune had purposely sent there, that they ran amongst the rocks, in consequence of which his chariot was broken and his body torn in pieces. Temples were raised to his memory, particularly at Troezen, where he received divine honours. According to some accounts, Diana restored Hippolytus to life.
