HOSEA, the first in number of the minor Hebrew prophets, as arranged in the Hebrew and Greek Bibles, although probably the third in chronological order. He was the son of Beeri; but it is uncertain to what tribe he belonged. He prophesied in the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the time of Jeroboam, king of Israel. If he uttered predictions during sixty-six years, that is, between 790 and 724 before Christ, then he discharged the office of a sacred seer eight years during the reign of Jeroboam II. thirty-three in that of Uzziah, during the entire reigns of Jotham and Ahaz, and three years under the reign of Hezekiah; but he could not have survived the taking of Samaria. He reproved the vices of kings as well as their subjects, mixing threatenings of divine vengeance with promises of pardon in case of repentance. His style is concise and sententious, and his comparisons are short and lively. He is sometimes distinguished by great force of expression, has many beautiful passages, and in some parts is truly sublime. Dr Newcome was of opinion that the chief difficulty in understanding this prophet is owing to the corrupt readings which disfigure the printed text; and these he freely corrected from the collations of Dr Kennicot. On the other hand, Dr Horsley protests earnestly against Dr Newcomeâ€™s opinion, declaring that the corruptions can be no cause of obscurity; but we must leave it to our readers to determine which of these great men is in the tight, from an attentive perusal of their own works, assured that they will decide in favour of him who furnishes the best helps for understanding the prophet.
