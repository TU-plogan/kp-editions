HALESWORTH, a town of the county of Suffolk, in the hundred of Blything. It is situated on the river Blyth, 101 miles from London, and has a good market for corn on Tuesday, and a navigable canal to the sea at Southwold, about nine miles distant. Near to it is a mineral spring frequented by patients afflicted with diseases of the eyes. Halesworth had some trade in spinning wool, which has nearly disappeared. It is a place of considerable antiquity, but of unknown date. The population amounted in 1801 to 1676, in 1811 to 1810, in 1821 to 2166, and in 1831 to 2473.
