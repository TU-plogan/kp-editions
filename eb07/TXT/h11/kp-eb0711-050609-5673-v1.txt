HOISTING signifies the operation of drawing up any body by the assistance of one or more tackles. Hoisting is never applied to the act of pulling up any body by the help of a single block, except in extending the sails by drawing them upwards along the masts or stays, to which it is invariably applied.

HOKE-Day, Hocκ-Day, or Hοcκ-Tuesday, in our ancient customs, the second Tuesday after Easter week; a solemn festival celebrated for many ages in England, in memory of the great slaughter of the Danes in the time of King Ethelred, when they were almost all destroyed in one day in different parts of the kingdom, and principally by women. This is still observed in some counties; and the women bear the principal part in the observance, stopping all passengers with ropes and chains, and exacting some small matter from them to make merry withal. This day was very remarkable in former times, inasmuch as to be, like Michaelmas, a general term or time of account. We find leases without date reserving so much rent payable αu duos anni terminos, silicet, ad le hoke-đay, et ad festu fli sancti Michaelis. In the account of Magdalen College, Oxford, there is yearly an allowance pro mulieribus hοe- [7:11:507] hantibus of some manors in Hampshire, where the men hock the women on Mondays, and the women hock the men on Tuesdays. The meaning of this is, that on that day the women in merriment stopped the way with ropes, and pulled passengers to them, desiring something to be laid out for pious uses.

Hoke-Z><7∕∕ Money, or Hohe- Tuesday Money, a tribute anciently paid to the landlord for giving his tenants and bondsmen leave to celebrate hock-day, or hoke-day, in memory of the explusĩon of the Danes.
