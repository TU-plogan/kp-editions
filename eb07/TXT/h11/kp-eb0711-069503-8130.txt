HOSPODAR, a title borne by the princes of Moldavia and Wallachia, who used to receive the investiture of their principalities from the grand seignior. He gave them a vest and standard; they were under his protection, and obliged to serve him; and he even sometimes deposed them; but in other respects they were absolute sovereigns within their own dominions. But since the treaty of Adrianople, concluded between Russia and Turkey in 1829, the former power has acquired an ascendency in these principalities, and obtained a complete control over the nomination of the hospodars.
