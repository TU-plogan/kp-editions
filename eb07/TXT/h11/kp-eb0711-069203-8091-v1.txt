HOSPINIAN, Rodolphus, one of the greatest writers that Switzerland has given birth to. He was born in 1547, at Altorf, near Zurich, obtained the freedom of Zurich, and was made provisor of the abbey-school. Notwithstanding this employment, he undertook a work of vast extent, being a History of the Errors of Popery. Though he could net complete this work according to the plan which he had formed, he published a considerable part of it; whilst his treatise on the Eucharist, and another work called Concordia Discors, exceedingly exasperated the Lutherans. He did not reply to them; but turning his arms against the Jesuits, published Historia Jesuitica. These writings gained him preferment; he was appointed archdeacon of Caroline church, and then minister of the abbey-church. He died in 1626; and an edition of his works was published at Geneva, 1681, in seven volumes folio.
