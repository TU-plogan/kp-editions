HIEROMNEMON, amongst the ancient Greeks, signified a delegate chosen by lot, and sent to the great council of the Amphictyons, where it was his business to take care of all that concerned religion. The hieromne-monies were reekoned more honourable than the other members of that assembly, the general meetings of which were always summoned by them, whilst their names were prefixed to the decrees enacted by the council.

Hieromnemon (composed of iεgoς, sacred, and μνημών, one who reminds of ), an officer in the ancient Greek church, whose principal function was to stand behind the patriarch at the sacraments and ceremonies, and show him the prayers and psalms, which he was to rehearse. He also clothed the patriarch in his pontifical robes, and assigned the places of all those who had a right to be around him when seated on his throne, just as the master of the ceremonies now does to the pope.
