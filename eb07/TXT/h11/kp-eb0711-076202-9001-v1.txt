HUSTNAPORE, or Hustinagara, formerly one of the most ancient and famous cities of Hindustan, in the province of Delhi, and for ages the capital of a powerful Hindu dynasty, of which the remote history is involved in obscurity. It was founded by Rajah Hasti, and is much celebrated in the Hindu mythological poems. This city has long been in ruins, and is now covered with large ant-hills. It is about twenty miles south-west from Daranagur, on a branch of the Ganges, formerly the bed of that river. Long. 77. 56. E. Lat. 29. 7. N.
