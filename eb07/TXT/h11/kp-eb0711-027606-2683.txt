HERMETIC, or Hermerical Art, a name given to chemistry, on the supposition that Hermes Trismegistus was the inventor of that science, or that he excelled therein.

Hermetical Philosophy is that which undertakes to solve and explain all the phenomena of nature from the three chemical principles, salt, sulphur, and mercury.

Hermetical Physic, or Medicine, is that system or hypothesis in the art of healing, which explains the causes of diseases, and the operations of medicine, on the principles of the hermetical philosophy.

Hzrmeticai, Seal, a manner of stopping or closing glass vessels, for chemical operations, so very accurately, that nothing can. exhale or escape, not even the most subtile spirits. It is performed by heating the neck of the vessel in the flame of a lamp till it be ready to melt, and then with a pair of pincers twisting it close together. This they call putting on Hermesâ€™s seal.
