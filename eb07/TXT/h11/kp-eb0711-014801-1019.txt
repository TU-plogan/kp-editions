HARLINGEN, a city of the Netherlands, in the province of Friesland. It is strongly fortified, stands on the Zuyder Zee, at the mouth of the river Blies, and is surrounded by a fertile district. It has a good harbour, but large ships must be lightened before they can enter it. It contains five churches, a very fine admiralty, and about 1000 houses, with (in 1831) 7537 inhabitants. The streets are broad, straight, and clean. There are many manufactures carried on, especially of cloth, half linen half cotton, and of sailcloth. There is also much trade in bricks and tiles, and in timber of all kinds. Long. 5. 36. 30. E. Lat. 53. 17. 20. N.
