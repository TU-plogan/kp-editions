HECUBA, the daughter of Dymas (Hom. II. ii. 718), or of Cisseus (Eurip.), or of the river Sangarius and Metope (Apollodor. iii. 12, 5), married Priam, and had by him nineteen sons and a great number of daughters. Of the sons, the most celebrated were Hector, Paris, Deiphobus, Helenus, Polydorus, Troilus; and of the daughters, Polyxena, Cassandra, Creüsa, and Laodice. When Hecuba was pregnant of Paris, she dreamed that she had brought into the world a burning torch, which reduced her husband’s palace and all Troy to ashes. This drcam was interpreted to mean that the son she should bring into the world would prove the destruction of bis country. To avoid this, she exposed Paris as soon as he was born; but he was saved by shepherds, and afterwards acknowledged by his parents. During the Trojan war she witnessed the death of nearly all her children, and at last saw her husband murdered before her eyes. ( Virg. Aen. ii.) When Troy was taken, Hecuba fell to the lot of Ulysses, who was not particularly satisfied with his share of the booty. They set sail and landed in the Thracian Chersonnesus, where Hecuba learned that her son Polydorus had been murdered by Polymnestor, the ancient friend of the Trojans, to whom Priam had sent him. She proceeded with some Trojan women to the house of Polymnestor, and having torn out his eyes, put to death two of his sens. Having been deprived of her senses, Hecuba traversed the whole of Thrace, and made it resound with her fury and despair. In pity for her misfortunes, the gods changed her into a bitch. (Hygin. iii.; Ovid. Net.') Some, however, say that she was carried to Lycia by Apollo. (Paus. x. 27.)
