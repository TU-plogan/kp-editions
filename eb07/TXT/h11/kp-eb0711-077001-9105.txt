HYDERABAD, an extensive province of Hindustan, in the Deccan, which is situated principally between the 16th and 19th degrees of north latitude. The name is now-applied generally to all the territories of the nizam, so that it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain its exact limits. This territory composed a considerable portion of the ancient Se-lingana. The country is hilly, but not mountainous, being for the most part an elevated table-land, in consequence of which the climate is colder than might be expected from the latitude. During three months of the year the thermometer at the city of Hyderabad, and in the country to the north, is often as low as45°, 40°, and even 35° of Fahrenheit. The country is fertile, and, under proper management, would yield abundantly. But the whole territory is principally rented to powerful zemindars, or is granted in jaghires to the officers of government. This distribution of the landed property, which, with the exception of some portions set aside for charitable purposes, and the estates of the nizam and the different branches of his family, is in the hands of a few individuals, is supposed to be injurious to agriculture, and of course to the interests of the revenue. The cultivators are wretchedly poor, and are much oppressed by their superiors the holders, who are subject to little or no restraint from their nominal sovereign. Where they are properly cultivated, the fields yield excellent crops of wheat, which is transported by the inland carriers to the sea-coast, whence [7:11:771]salt is brought in return. The districts acquired by the nizam are particularly rich and fertile. But as agriculture is discouraged by the oppression of the cultivators, commerce is obstructed by heavy and injudicious internal taxes. In 1801 the custom-duties on importation amounted to 15 per cent., which formed the principal revenue of the state; and when the British remonstrated against the impolicy of these internal duties, the nizam evinced the most decided aversion to reduce them, and still more to abolish them, which was the counsel of the British government. It was at length agreed that the tax should be reduced to two and a half per cent. But even the levying of this duty was attended with such oppressions and vexation, that it greatly impeded commerce. At present, the principal trade carried on between the nizam’s dominions and those under the British government, consists in the exportation of cotton to Berar and to the Northern Circars, and also to the markets at Vellore, Arnee, and the vicinity. They bring back salt and salted fish, cloths manufactured in the Northern Cirears, Arnee muslins, and European manufactures; the latter principally for the supply of the British forces subsidised by the nizam, and for clothing his army. The chief towns of this kingdom are Hyderabad, Golcondah, Warangole, Aurungabad, Beder, and Ellichpore. The majority of the people are Hindus; but having been long the seat of a Mahommedan government, a considerable portion of the inhabitants are of that religion.

This country was formerly subject to the rajahs of Telingana and Bijanagur; but being afterwards conquered by the Mahommedans, was formed into a separate kingdom in the year 1512, under the name of Golcondah, by Mahommed Kooly, originally a Turkish adventurer. In 1687, it was brought under the dominion of Aurungzebe, and was converted into one of the provinces of the Mogul empire, and, with the other five southern provinces, was formed into a viceroyalty, under an officer appointed by the court of Delhi, called the soobahdar of the Deccan. In 1719, a Mogul officer, Cheen Khili; Khan, being appointed to this government, with the title of Nizam al Moolk, or superintendent of the kingdom, collected a large army, and ’got possession of all the strongholds of the Deccan; and setting up for independence, he overawed the emperor Mahommed Shah and his ministers. After the invasion of Nadir Shah in 1739, he left to the Mogul nothing but the name of sovereign; and having made Aurungabad his capital, he died at Boorhanpore in the year 1748, aged 104 years. He was succeeded by his second son, who was assassinated in 1750, and succeeded by his nephew Muzuffer Jung, who was assassinated the following year, and succeeded by his cousin Salabut Jung. He had been confined for ten years by his brother Nizam Ali, who for nearly twenty years was engaged in wars with Hyder Ali, the British, and the Mahrattas, during which his territories were greatly contracted. On the 12th of October 1800, he concluded a treaty offensive and defensive, by which he became a dependent and ally of the British. He agreed to receive into his territories a British force of 8000 infantry and 1000 cavalry; to relinquish to the British the management of all his foreign relations; and, for the regular payment of the troops stationed in his country, to cede certain portions of territory to the British. By a commercial treaty concluded in 1802 with the British, it was agreed, in lieu of all local duties, that a duty of five per cent, should be levied on all articles respectively imported into the territories of each. In 1804, after the conclusion of the war with Scindia and the rajah of Nagpoor, the nizam acquired a large accession of territory. At present the nizam’s dominions comprehend the greater part of Berar, the whole of Hyderabad, Nandere, and Beeder, and part of Aurungabad and Bejapoor.

Towards the Nagpoor territories their limits are marked by the course of the Wurda river, and on the one side of the British by the Krishna and Toombuddra. This territory may be estimated in length at 420 by 220 miles, and contains 8,000,000 of inhabitants.

Hyderabad, the capital of the above-mentioned province of Hyderabad, and of the nizam’s dominions. It is situated on the south side of the Musa river, which runs rapidly during the rains, but in the dry season has scarcely two feet of water. It is said to have been founded about the year 1586 by Sultan Mahommed Kootub Shah, who, thinking the air of Golcondah did not agree with his constitution, gave orders for building a new city, which continued to be the residence of the Kootub Shah dynasty till the year 1687, when it was taken by Aurungzebe. The late Nizam Ali was the first of the nizams who made it his residence, and he spent considerable sums in improving it. It is now a large and populous place, about seven miles in circumference, and is surrounded by a stone wall, with towers at the angles and gates, which, though incapable of defence against artillery, is a good protection against the incursions of cavalry. It contains two palaces and some elegant mosques, this having long been the seat of Mahommedanism in the Deccan; and between it and Golcondah there are some handsome tombs. This city possesses large magazines, in which are deposited the presents received at various times from the different native and European powers, consisting of bales of woollen, casés of glass, glass-ware, China-ware, clocks, watches, &c. of European manufacture. These presents have accumulated during a course of seventy or eighty years, having been received by the father and grandfather of the present nizam as far back as the time of Dupleix and Bussy. Since the late Nizam Ali transferred his residence to Hyderabad, it has experienced no disturbance; and being the residence of the court, has rapidly increased in wealth and population. At present it is estimated to contain 120,000 inhabitants, including the suburbs. The travelling distance from Calcutta by the Northern Circars is 902 miles, by Nagpoor 1043 miles, from Madras 352, from Bombay 480, from Delhi 923, from Poonah 387, from Seringapatam 406.

Hyderabad, a city of Hindustan, in the province of Sinde, of which it is the capital. The fortress of Hyderabad, which is appropriated solely to the residence of the princes and their families, is situated on a rock the foot of which is washed by a branch of the river Indus, here named the Fulalee. It is of an irregular pentagonal figure, suited to the natural form of the rock, and is defended by round towers, and a high brick wall perforated with loop-holes. The situation is remarkably strong; the sides of the hill being in many places so steep as to render the ascent to the fortress difficult, even though a breach were made in the walls. The weakest point is towards the south-east, opposite a break in the rock from the Fulalee. A dry ditch twelve feet broad protects the northern side. The position is good, and the fortifications adequate to resist any attack of native tooops, though it would not stand a siege of three days against Europeans. There is a good bazar and several handsome mosques within the fort; and although little encouragement is given to industry, the artisans are numerous and skilful. The Ameers, as mentioned by Dr Burnes, who went on a mission to Hyderabad in 1828, pride themselves greatly in the brilliant collection which they possess of jewels and armour. A great part of their treasure consists in rubies, diamonds, pearls, and emeralds, with which their daggers, swords, and matchlocks are adorned, and many of which they wear as rings and clasps on different parts of their dresses. The arts connected with this pursuit are encouraged by [7:11:772]them. One or two Persian goldsmiths are engaged at court, where they work in enamel, and contrive expedients to display the jewellery of their masters. They have brought to great perfection the art of inlaying letters of gold on steel. They acknowledge the superiority of the English in the manufacture of gun-locks; and the dress of their princes and nobles consists partly of English cloths.^[1. See Vist to the Court of Sinde, by J. Burnes, p. 92. ] Hyderabad is situated 130 miles from the sea, on the eastern side of the main stream of the Indus, with which it is connected by the Fulalee at the distance of three miles. The country around Hyderabad rises into hills, although it is level till within a few miles of that city. The Indus is a perpetual source of fertility, affording an inexhaustible supply of water for the irrigation of the fields. The flat country of Sinde is intersected by branches from the main stream, and by canals; and the transition from the parched deserts of Cutch to such a scene of fertility is described by Dr Burnes as affording a very striking contrast. The Fulalee in the month of August is from two and a half to three fathoms deep at Hyderabad, and is covered with boats laden with heavy goods. The population is 20,000. Long. 68. 41. E. Lat. 25. 22.
