HAVANNAH, or Havana, the capital of the island of Cuba, in the λVest Indies. It is situated on the north coast, and is one of the most flourishing cities of the New World, carrying on about two thirds of the commerce of the island, which is extensive. It possesses a noble harbour, which, though narrow at the entrance, is without any bar or other obstruction, and within it expands into a capacious bay, capable of accommodating a thousand vessels of the largest size. The water is of sufficient depth to admit of their coming close up to the quay. Havannah has strong fortifications; the castles of Moro and Punto being remarkably so. The former is situated on the east, and the latter on the west side of the harbour, of which they completely command the entrance. The citadel is also a place of great strength; and the neighbouring heights are fortified so as to protect the city or port. Havannah stretches along the entrance to, and on the west side of the bay; and on the opposite side is the suburb called Regia. The city presents a splendid appearance from the sea, its numerous spires being intermingled with lofty and luxuriant trees. The churches are handsome, and richly ornamented; and several óf the private mansions are built on a magnificent scale. The streets, however, are narrow, inconvenient, and not kept in good repair; but those of the suburbs, now as extensive as the city, are wider and better laid out. The arsenal and dock-yard, which are on a large scale, lie towards the western angle of the bay, to the south of the city. From its position, which commands both inlets to the Gulf of Mexico, its great strength, and excellent harbour, Havannah is, in a political point of view, by far the most important maritime station in the West Indies. Of late years the commerce of Havannah has rapidly extended, which has been ascribed to the freedom it now enjoys, as well as to the great increase of wealth and population in the city. The principal exports are, sugar, coffee, tobacco, and molasses; the imports consist of all those articles which an opulent community, in a tropical climate, and without manufactures, requires. In 1828, the trade of Havannah amounted to 15,807,395 dollars of imports, and 9,202,485 dollars of exports. During the same year, the exportation of sugar alone amounted to 107,434,400 pounds, and in 1832 it had risen to 111,978,800 pounds. In 1831 there entered the port of Havannah 990 ships of 157,146 tons burden, and there cleared out of it 1002 ships of 150,679 tons burden. The population, exclusive of troops and strangers, which may amount to 25,000, has been estimated at about 115,000. Havannah possesses several patriotic and literary societies, and there are seven journals published, one of which is in English. The Moro Castle, according to Humboldt, is situated in latitude 23. 8. 15. N. longitude 82. 22. 45. W. For further particulars regarding this city, see the article Cuba.
