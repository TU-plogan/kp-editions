HALCYON, the ancient name of the alcedo or kingâ€™s fisher.

Halcyon Days, in Antiquity, a name given to seven days before and as many after the winter solstice; because, at this season, the halcyon, invited by the calmness of the weather, laid its eggs in nests built in the rocks, close by the brink of the sea; and hence halcyon days is a phrase expressive of times of peace and tranquillity.
