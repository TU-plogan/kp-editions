HELEPOLIS, in the ancient art of war, a machine for battering down the walls of a place besieged, the invention of which is ascribed to Demetrius Poliorcetes. Diodorus Siculus says, that each side of the Helcpolis was 405 cubits in breadth and ninety in height; that it had nine stages, and was carried on four strong solid wheels eight cubits in diameter; that it was armed with large battering rams, and had two roofs capable of supporting them; that in the lower stages there were several sorts of engines for casting stones, and in the middle they had large catapultas for discharging arrows, and smaller ones in those above, with a number of expert men for working all these machines.
