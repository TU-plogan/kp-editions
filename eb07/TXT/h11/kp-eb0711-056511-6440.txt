HORROR strictly signifies such an excess of fear as makes a person tremble.

Horror of a Vacuum, was an imaginary principle amongst the ancient philosophers, to which they ascribed the ascent of water in pumps, and other similar phenomena, which are known to be occasioned by the simple weight or pressure of the atmosphere.
[7:11:566]
