HINDU Coosh, or Kosh, a portion of the Himalaya range of mountains, in Afghanistan. They form the north-west boundary of the province of Caubul, separating it from Balk and Buduckshan. The range of mountains so denominated extends in a south-westerly direction as far as the snowy peak of Hindu Coosh, nearly north of Caubul. These mountains are covered with snow the greater part of the year, and void of verdure at the summit, but are well wooded at the base. They form the Caucasus range of the ancients. From the peak of Hindu Coosh the height diminishes; it no longer bears perpetual snow; and it is soon afterwards lost in a group of mountains which stretch in length from Caubul to Herat in Persia, and occupy more than two degrees of latitude in their breadth. Through these mountains there are seven passages; the principal of which are at Bajaruch, Anderab, Tool, Bamian, and Abderah.
