HIRTIUS, Aulus, a noble Roman who attended on Caesar in his wars against the Gauls, and, when he returned to Rome, became the devoted friend of Cicero. He accompanied him to Tusculum, where he studied the art of declamation under that accomplished orator (Cic. Fam. v ü· 33); and when Caesar returned from his successful expedition against his enemies in Africa, he was employed by Cicero to make his peace with the conqueror.
