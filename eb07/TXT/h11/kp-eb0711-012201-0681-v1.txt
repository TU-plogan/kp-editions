HAMAXOB Π, Hamaxobians, in the ancient geography, a people who had no houses, but lived in carriages. The word is formed from aμaζpο, a carriage or chariot, and ∕3∕βς, life. The Hamaxobii, called also Hamaxobitae, were an ancient people of Sarmatia Europaea, who inhabited the southern part of Muscovy, and instead of houses, had a sort of tents made of leather, and fixed on carriages, to be ready for shifting and travel.
