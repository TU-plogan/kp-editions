HALI-BEIGH, first dragoman or interpreter at the Grand Signior’s court in the seventeenth century, was born of Christian parents in Poland; but having been taken by the Tartars when young, they sold him to the Turks, who brought him up in the Mahommedan religion in the seraglio. His name, in his native country, was Bobowski. He learned many languages, and Sir Paul Ricant owns that he was indebted to him for several things which he relates in his Present State of the Ottoman Empire. He maintained a correspondence with the English, who persuaded him to translate some books into the Turkish language; and he proposed to return into the bosom of the Christian church, but died before he could accomplish the design. Dr Hyde published his book Of the Liturgy of the Turks, their Pilgrimages to Mecca, their Circumcision and Visiting of the Sick. He translated the catechism of the church of England and the bible into the Turkish language. The manuscript is lodged in the library of Leyden. He wrote likewise a Turkish grammar and dictionary.
