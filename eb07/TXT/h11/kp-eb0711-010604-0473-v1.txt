HAGGAI, the tenth of the small prophets, was supposed to have been born at Babylon in the year of the world 3457, and to have returned thence with Zerubbabel. It was this prophet who by the command of God (Ezra, v. 1, 2, &c.) exhorted the Jews, after their return from the captivity, to finish the rebuilding of the temple, which they had intermitted for fourteen years. His remonstrances had the desired effect; and to encourage them to proceed in the work, he assured them from God, that the glory of this latter house should be greater than the glory of the former; which was accordingly fulfilled when Christ honoured it with his presence. We know nothing certain of Haggai’s death. The Jews pretend that he died in the last year of the reign of Darius, at the same time with the prophets Zechariah and Malachi, and that thereupon the spirit of prophecy ceased amongst the children of Israel. Epiphanias affirms that he was buried at Jerusalem amongst the priests. The Greeks keep his festival on the 16th of December, and the Latins on the 4th of July.
