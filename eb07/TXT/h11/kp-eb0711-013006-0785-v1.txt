HAND, a part or member of the body of man, forming the extremity of the arm. The mechanism of the hand is very curious, indeed excellently contrived to fit it for the various uses and occasions we have for it, and the great number of arts and manufactures it is to be employed in. It consists of a compages of nerves, and little bones joined into each other, which give it a great degree of strength, and at the same time an unusual flexibility, to enable it to handle adjacent bodies, lay hold of them, and grasp them, in order either to draw them towards us or thrust them off.

In Scripture the word hand is variously applied. To pour water upon any one’s hand signifies to serve him. To wash the hands was a ceremony made use of to denote innocence of murder or manslaughter. To kiss the hand was an act of adoration. To fill the hand signifies taking possession of the priesthood, and performing its functions. To lean upon any one’s hand was a mark of familiarity and superiority. To give the hand signifies to grant peace, swear friendship, promise security, or make alliance. The right hand was the emblem of honour and respect. Amongst the Greeks and Romans it was customary for inferiors to walk on the left hand of superiors, that their right hand might be ready to afford protection and defence to their left side, which was, on account of the awkwardness of the left hand, more exposed to danger.

Imposition, or laying on of Hands, signifies the conferring of holy orders; a ceremony in which the hands are laid on the head of a person as a sign of a mission, or of a power given him to exercise the functions of the ministry belonging to the order. The apostles began to appoint missionaries by the imposition of hands.
[7:11:131]

Hand, in falconry, is used to indicate the foot of the hawk. To have a clean, strong, slender, glutinous hand, well clawed, is amongst the good qualities of a hawk or falcon.

Hand, in the manège, sometimes stands for the forefoot of a horse. It is also used to signify a division of the horse into two parts with respect to the rider’s hand. The fore-hand includes the head, neck, and fore-quarters; the hind-hand is all the rest of the horse.

Hand is likewise used for a measure of four inches, or of a clenched fist, by which the height of a horse is computed.

Hands are borne in coat-armour, dexter and sinister, that is, right and left, expanded or open; and also in other manners. A bloody hand in the centre of the escutcheon is the badge of a baronet of Great Britain.
