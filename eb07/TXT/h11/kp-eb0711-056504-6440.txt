HORNPIPE, a common instrument of music in Wales, consisting of a wooden pipe, with holes at stated distances, and a horn at each end; the one to collect the wind blown into it by the mouth, and the other to carry off the sound as modulated by the performer.

Hornpipe is also the name of an English air, probably derived from the above instrument. The measure of this air is triple time, with six crotchets in a bar, four of which are to. be beat with the hand down, and two up.
