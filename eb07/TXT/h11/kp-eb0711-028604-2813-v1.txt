HESIONE, a daughter of Laomedon, king of Troy, who was exposed to a sea monster which had been sent by Neptune to ravage the coast of Troy, as a punishment to the king for having defrauded the god of his stipulated reward. Hercules, who was then accompanying the Argonauts, delivered the princess, slew the monster, and received as a reward six beautiful horses. Besides, Hesione from gratitude agreed to follow him. He left the princess and the horses with Laomedon till he should return from the expedition. When Hercules sent his friend Telamon to reclaim his property, Laomedon refused to give them up. Incensed at this treachery, the hero laid siege to Troy, killed the perjured king, carried off Hesione, and gave her in marriage to Telamon.
