HOLDER, William, an English divine, was born in Nottinghamshire, educated in Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and appointed rector of Blechingdon of Oxford in 1642. In 1660 he received the degree of doctor in divinity, and afterwards became canon of Ely, fellow of the Royal Society, canon of St Paul’s, sub-dean of the chapel royal, and sub-almoner to his majesty. Dr Holder was an accomplished scholar, and distinguished himself by teaching a young gentleman of rank who was born deaf and dumb, to speak. This gentleman’s name was Alexander Popham, son of Colonel Edward Popham, who was for some time an admiral in the service of the Long Parliament. The cure was performed by him at Blechingdon in 1659; but Popham losing what he had been taught by Holder after he returned home to his friends, was sent to Dr Wallis, under [7:11:508] whom he recovered the use of speech. Holder published a book entitled the Elements of Speech, being an inquiry into the natural production of letters, with an appendix concerning persons who are deaf and dumb, 1669, 8vo. In the appendix he relates how soon, and by what methods, he brought Popham to speak. In 1678, he published a Supplement to the Philosophical Transactions of July 1670, with some reflections on Dr Wallis’s letter there inserted, in 4to. This was written to vindicate the merit of having taught Popham to speak, which W τ allis in the letter referred to had claimed to himself; but Dr Wallis soon afterwards published a Defence of the Royal Society, and the Philosophical Transactions, particularly those of July 1670, in answer to the Cavils of Dr W r illiam Holder, 1678, in 4to. Holder was skilled in the theory and practice of music, and wrote a treatise on the Natural Grounds and Principles of Harmony, 1694, 8vo. He also wrote a Discourse concerning Time, with application of the natural day, lunar month, and solar year, &c. 1694, in 8vo. He died at Amen Corner in London, on the 24th of January 1696, and was buried in St Paul’s.
