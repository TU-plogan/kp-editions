HEATH, James, an English historian, was bom in 1629, at London, where his father, who was the king’s cutler, then lived. He was educated at Westminster school, and became a student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1616. In 1648 he was ejected by the parliamentary visitors, for his adherence to the royal cause; lived upon his patrimony till it was almost spent; then married, and was obliged to write books and correct the press in order to maintain his family. He died of a consumption and dropsy at London in August 1664, and left several children to the parish. His principal publications were, 1. A brief Chronicle of the late Intestine War in the Three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1661, 8vo, afterwards enlarged by the author, and completed from 1637 to 1663, in four parts, 1663, in 8vo; 2. Flagellum, or The Life and Death, Birth and Burial, of Oliver Cromwell, the late Usurper, 1663; 3. A new Book of Loyal English Martyrs and Confessors, who have endured the Pains and Terrors of Death, Arraignment, &c. for the Maintenance of the just and legal Government of these Kingdoms both in Church and State, 1663, 12mo.
