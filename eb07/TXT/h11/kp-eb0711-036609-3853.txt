HILDESHEIM, a province of the kingdom of Hanover, formerly an ecclesiastical state, but secularized and transferred to Prussia in 1803, and in 1805 delivered over, with Goslar, to the Hanoverian government. It is bounded on the north by Luneburg, on the east by Brunswick, on the south-east by Saxon Prussia, on the south by the Hartz and Brunswick, and on the west by Calenburg. It extends over 683 square miles, and comprehends nine cities, four market-towns, 240 villages and hamlets, formed into 135 parishes, with 18,803 houses, and a population in 1812 amounting to 121,816, now estimated to have since increased one fifth. The greater part of the inhabitants are Lutherans, but one sixth are Catholics, with a few Jews, and some Protestant sects. It is for the most part a level district, but towards the south there are some lofty mountains. A considerable portion of the land is covered with wood, and the rest yields moderate crops of rye, barley, flax, and potatoes, with some little wheat. It produces feathers, honey, and wax. The females spin much flax, and the yarn is an article of export; as are also wool, hops, rape-oil, and timber. The province is well watered by the rivers Innerste, which rises in the Hartz, by the Ecker, the Radau, and several small streams, which all finally terminate by the Leine, in the Weser. The province is governed by its own assembly of states, and has still its [7:11:367]bishop, who has only ecclesiastical authority over the Catholics.

Hildesheim, a city of Hanover, the capital of the province of that name. It is situated on the river Innerste, and surrounded with walls and ditches, which have been converted into promenades. It contains an ancient cathedral, containing, amongst other antiquities, a pillar called the Irmin-Saule, said to have been constructed by the Saxons in honour of Arminius, who defeated the Roman army under Quintilius Varus. There are three other Catholic and four Lutheran churches, with 1874 dwelling houses, and 13,820 inhabitants. It contains a Catholic seminary called Josephâ€™s Gymnasium, with eleven professors, and several schools for elementary instruction. It has some manufactures of ironmongery, linens, leather, soap, starch, snuff, and yarn. Near to it is the Zwergshohle, a saline spring, from which some Glauber salts are prepared. Long. 9. 48.28. E.
