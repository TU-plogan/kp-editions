HELMONT, John Baptist Van, a famous Brabançon physician, and leader of distinction in the chemical school of medicine, was born at Brussels in the year 1577, and descended of a noble family. At Louvain and other places he studied medicine with so much avidity, that he had perused Hippocrates, Galen, and the Greek and Arabian physicians at a very early period of life. When not more than seventeen years of age, he read public lectures at Louvain, and was created doctor of physic in the year 1599, when only twenty-two. Having, in 1609, married a wife who was both rich and noble, he retired with her to Vil-forđe, where he practised as a physician, without taking any fees. He was accustomed to boast of the thousands whom he cured every year; but his success in his own family was by no means great, for his eldest daughter died of a leprosy, and he lost two sons by the plague. He published a variety of works, by which he acquired great re putation. He was invited to the court of Vienna by the Emperor Rodolph, but he declined accepting the invitation. He died in the year 1644, in the sixty-eighth year of his age. Van Helmont was a man of acute genius, clear-sighted in detecting the mistakes of others, and extremely fond of forming hypotheses of his own, which were not always supported by conclusive arguments. He affirmed with great boldness, evinced extreme credulity, and showed excessive fondness for narrations, however extravagant, which seemed to favour his own preconceived opinions. Perhaps his greatest foible was the liberal manner in which he praised himself, in reference to his own pretended nostrums and specifics. His ideas were far from being perspicuous, chiefly owing to his habit of employing terms and phrases which he had not properly defined. He added much, however, to the stock of chemical facts at that time known, and paved the way to more interesting discoveries; and he contributed more than any of his predecessors to subvert the Galenical theory of humours and qualities, which he certainly combated with many forcible arguments. His theory of ferments was in a great measure espoused by Sylvius. His son Francis Mercury published a collected edition of his works, Amsterdam, 1648, in 4to, which has often been reprinted since, under the title of Opera Omnia, and has been [7:11:228] translated into Dutch, French, and English. Of all his productions, the most curious are, 1. Febrium Doctrina inaudita, Antwerp, 1614, in 8vo; and, 2. De Magnetica Vulnerum naturali ct legitima Curatione, contra Ĵoh. Roberti, Soc. Jesu, Paris, 1621, in 8vo.
