HOOKAH, amongst the Arabs and other nations of the East, is a pipe of a singularly-complicated construction, through which tobacco is smoked. Out of a small vessel of a globular form, and nearly full of water, issue two tubes, one perpendicularly, on which is placed the tobacco, the other obliquely from the side of the vessel, and to that the person who smokes applies his mouth; and the smoke by this means being drawn through water, is cooled in its passage, and rendered more grateful. One takes a whiff draws up a large quantity of smoke, puffs it out of his nose and mouth in a dense cloud, and passes the hookah to his neighbour; and thus it goes round the whole circle. The hookah is known and used throughout the East; but in those parts where the refinements of life prevail, every one has his hookah sacred to himself; and it is frequently an implement of a costly nature, being of silver, and set with precious stones. In the better kind, that tube which is applied to the mouth is very long and pliant; and for this reason it is termed the snake. People who use it in a luxurious manner fill the vessel through which the smoke is drawn with rose-water, and the fume thereby receives some of the fragrant quality of that liquid.
