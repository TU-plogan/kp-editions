HETEROCLITE, in Grammar, an irregular or anomalous word, which, either in declension, conjugation, or regimen, deviates from the ordinary rules of grammar. The word is Greek, ŝrífoxX/rov, formed from tτtζoς, alter, another, different, and κλ∕vω, I decline. Heteroclite is more peculiarly applied to nouns which vary or are irregular in point of declension.
