KORDOFAN, a country of Central Africa, situated between the kingdoms of Darfoor and Sennaar. Little can be said of it, except that from time immemorial an inveterate animosity has subsisted between the Foorians and Kor-dofanese, arising principally from mercantile jealousy, as the country of the latter lies in the route to Sennaar and Suakem, the most direct line of communication with Mecca. The governors of Kordofan had for a long time been deputed by the Mek of Sennaar; but, in consequence of the weakness and dissensions of the latter kingdom, the power was usurped by the Foorian sultan. But the enterprising ruler of Egypt having reduced all the provinces of Africa as far as Sennaar, both Kordofan and Darfoor were enumerated among the kingdoms which now acknowledge by a tribute the conqueror of Egypt and Arabia. The country is of an arid character, destitute of any thing like a river or lake. The tropical rains, however, which fall at a certain season with great violence, inundate a considerable portion of the country, and thus, affording moisture to vegetation, agricultural operations are carried on. These are sufficient to produce wheat, and doku, a species of millet. The king enjoys absolute authority, but policy compels him to court his warriors, who, like those of Bornou, are invested in chain armour. What the number of inhabitants occupying this rude tract of country may be, it is impossible to say.
