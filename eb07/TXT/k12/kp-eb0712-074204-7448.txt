KITSINGEN, a city of Bavaria, and the capital of the bailiwick of the same name, in the circle of the Upper Maine. It stands on the right bank of the Maine, over which is a bridge 1000 feet long, connecting it with the suburb Etwashausen, both of which are surrounded with walls and ditches, and flanked by towers. It contains four churches, a convent, and hospital, and 784 houses, with 3850 inhabitants. It is one of the chief trading places on the river, with good wharfs and cranes. It has some manufactures of cotton, but its chief commerce is wood, wine, corn, and other productions of the soil.

„ <KITTOOR, a town and district in the peshwa’s territories, in the province of Bejapoor, twenty miles southeast from Merritch. In 1804 the renter of the district complained that it was wasted by the neighbouring feudatories, and also by the peshwa’s own deputy; when, by the interference of the British, these grievances were redressed. The country is fertile.
