It is situated on a rock 700 feet in perpendicular height, and so remarkably bare and steep that it has never been taken, except by surprise.

KISTNAH,oγKrisπn ah, a celebra ted river in the south of India, which has its source in the Western Ghauts, not far from Sattarah, in the province of Bejapoor, which is only fifty mile? in a direct line from the western sea-coast. It proceeds from hence in a south-westerly direction until it reaches Merritch, when its bulk is greatly increased by the junction of the river Worrah, formed by a variety of streamlets that fall from the Ghauts. During its course eastward it is joined by the Malpurba, Gutpurba, Beemah, and Toombuddra rivers; and pours itsprodigiousvolumeof waters by various mouths into the Bay of Bengal, at or a little to the southward of Masulipatam, where it forms the northern boundary of the Guntoor Circars. Its course, including its windings, may be estimated at 650 miles in length; and its waters fertilize the provinces of Bejapoor, Beeder, Hyderabad, and the districts of Paulnaud, [7:12:742] Guntoor, and Condapilly. ∙ The term Krishna signifies black or dark blue, and is the name of the favourite deity of the Hindus, an incarnatiön of the preserving power of Vishnu.
