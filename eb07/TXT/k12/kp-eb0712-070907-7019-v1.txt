KIANGSEE, a fine province of China, consisting chiefly of lofty and precipitous mountains, with fertile valleys interposed. It extends southwards from Kiangnan to Quangtong, and yields in abundance both rice and silk. Its mountains also contain various metals and minerals, and it has an uninterrupted navigation from north to south, forming part of the great line of water communication which reaches across the empire. A very extensive manufacture of porcelain is carried on in this province.
