KOSTROMA, a province of European Russia, to the eastward of Jaraslow, extending over 39,710 square miles. It comprehends seventeen cities or towns, and 851 parishes, whose population amounts to 1,422,000 souls. The nobility are numerous, and hold two thirds of the land, and of the peasants who work upon it. It is a level district, with a few elevations near the banks of the rivers; and it is in many parts covered with forests, which yield excellent timber. The Wolga is the chief river, and is navigable, as are the Kostroma and the Unscha. The soil is by no means fertile, but it produces sufficient corn for the inhabitants, and is enabled to grow good flax and hemp. The pastures maintain cattle, which furnish hides and tallow. The rivers abound with salmon, sturgeon, and other fish. The females spin yarn in most of the cottages, and it is woven and bleached within the province. The several branches of industry enable an exportable surplus of hemp, flax, tallow, hides, dressed leather, fish, mats, bark, tar, soap, and some iron. The navigation of the Wolga is a source of commerce. The city of Kostroma, the capital of the province, and of the circle of its own name, is at the junction of the Kostroma with the Wolga. It is the seat of an archbishop, and of the boards of revenue and law; is surrounded with walls, lately converted into promenades; and contains fifty churches, including the cathedral, an ecclesiastical seminary, a gymnasium, several hospitals, and 1057 houses, with 8200 inhabitants. The leather made here is celebrated throughout Europe, and occupies eighteen considerable tanneries in preparing it. There is also a trade in sailcloth and other linen. Long. 41. 7. 31. E.
