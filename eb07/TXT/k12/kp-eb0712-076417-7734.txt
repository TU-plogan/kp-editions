KRUMAU, a city of the circle of Budweis, in the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia. It is on the river Moldau, is fortified, and, with about 300 villages around it, forms a dukedom belonging to the Schwarzenburg family. The castle and part of the duchy is near the city, which contains 696 houses, and 4291 inhabitants, some of whom are stocking-makers, and others cloth and paper manufacturers. Near to it are the baths of Umlowitz, much frequented in summer; and some mines of silver, but feebly worked.
