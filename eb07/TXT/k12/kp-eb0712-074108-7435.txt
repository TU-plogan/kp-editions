It is situated on a rock 700 feet in perpendicular height, and so remarkably bare and steep that it has never been taken, except by surprise.

It proceeds from hence in a south-westerly direction until it reaches Merritch, when its bulk is greatly increased by the junction of the river Worrah, formed by a variety of streamlets that fall from the Ghauts. During its course eastward it is joined by the Malpurba, Gutpurba, Beemah, and Toombuddra rivers; and pours itsprodigiousvolumeof waters by various mouths into the Bay of Bengal, at or a little to the southward of Masulipatam, where it forms the northern boundary of the Guntoor Circars. Its course, including its windings, may be estimated at 650 miles in length; and its waters fertilize the provinces of Bejapoor, Beeder, Hyderabad, and the districts of Paulnaud, [7:12:742] Guntoor, and Condapilly. ∙ The term Krishna signifies black or dark blue, and is the name of the favourite deity of the Hindus, an incarnatiön of the preserving power of Vishnu.
