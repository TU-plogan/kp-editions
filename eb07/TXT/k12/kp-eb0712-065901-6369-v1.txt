KAFFA, a city of the Russian empire, in Europe, in the Crimea. It was formerly the capital of that peninsula, and the residence of the khan; and, from the end of the thirteenth till the middle of the fifteenth century, it maintained, by its flourishing trade, which was chiefly with Genoa, a population of 100,000. It was taken by the Turks in 1474, since which time its trade has vastly declined. It was taken by the Russians in 1770, and given back again to the khan in 1774. But it was, with the whole of the Crimea, given up to Russia in 1783, which cession was confirmed by the treaty of 1792, concluded at Jassy, between Turkey and Russia. It stands on a bay of the Black Sea, on the side of a hill. It was declared a free port by the Russians in 1798. It is the seat of the provincial government, has some trade in the products of the soil of the peninsula, and contains 5000 inhabitants. There is a Greek theatre, a botanic garden, and a museum of antiquities, established in the neighbourhood. It is sometimes called by the Russians Feodosia.
