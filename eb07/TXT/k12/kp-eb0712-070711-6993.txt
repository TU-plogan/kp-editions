KHOEE, a town of Azerbijan, in Persia, and capital of a rich and extensive district, situated on the borders of the lake Urumea. There is no town in Persia more beautiful and better built; the walls are in good repair; the streets regular, and shaded with avenues of trees; and the ceilings of many of the houses tastefully painted and embellished. These paintings are not modern; and as the immediate predecessors of Shah Ismael frequently held their court in this city, they were probably executed about that period. It is the emporium of a considerable trade carried on between Turkey and Persia. The population amounts to 25,000. The plain in which it is situated is famous for a battle fought in 1514, between Shah Ismael and Selim I., in which 30,000 Persians encountered 300,000 Turks.
