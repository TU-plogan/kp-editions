+=====================================================================+


KELLY, Hugh, an author of some repute, was born cn the banks of the lake of Killarney, in Ireland, in 1739. His father, a gentleman of good family, having reduced his fortune by a series of unforeseen reverses, was obliged to repair to Dublin that he might endeavour to support himself by his personal industry. A tolerable school education was all he could afford to give his son, who was bound apprentice to a stay-maker, and served the whole of his time with diligence and fidelity. At the expiration of his indentures he set out for London to procure a livelihood by his business, and there encountered all the difficulties a poor and friendless person might be expected to meet with on his first arrival in town. Happening, however, to become acquainted with an attorney, he was employed by him in copying and transcribing. He prosecuted this occupation with so much assiduity, that he is said to have earned about three guineas a week, an ineome w hich, compared to his former gains, might be deemed affluent. Tired, however, of this drudgery, he soon afterwards (about 1762) commenced author, and w as intrusted w ith the management of the Lady’s Museum, the Court Magazine, the [7:12:687] Public Ledger, the Royal Chronicle, Owen’s Weekly Post, and some other periodical publications, in which he wrote many original essays and pieces of poetry, which extended his reputation, and procured the means of subsistence for himself, his wife, and a growing family. For several years after this period, he continued writing upon a variety of subjects, as the accidents of the times chanced to call for the assistance of his pen; and he employed himself in composing many pamphlets on the important questions then agitated, the greater part of which are now buried in oblivion. Amongst these productions, was a Vindication of Mr Pitt’s Administration, which Lord Chesterfield makes honourable mention of in the second volume of his Letters. In 1767, the Babbler appeared in two pocket volumes, which had at first been inserted in Owen’s Weekly Chronicle, in single papers; as did also the Memoirs of a Magdalene, under the title of Louisa Mildmay. About 1767, he was tempted, by the success of Churchill’s Rosciad, to write sonic strictures on the performers of both theatres, in two pamphlets, entitled Thespis, which gave great offence to some of the principal persons at each house. The talents for satire which he displayed in this work recommended him to the notice of Mr Garrick, who, in the next year, caused his first play of False Delicacy to be acted at Drury Lane. It was received with great applause; and from this time he continued to write for the stage with profit and success, until the last period of his life. As his reputation increased, he began to turn his thoughts to some mode of supporting his family less precarious than by writing, and for that purpose entered himself a member of the Middle Temple. After the. regular steps had been taken, he was called to the bar in 1774, and his proficiency in the study of the law afforded promising hopes that he might make a distinguished figure in that profession. But his sedentary course of life had by this time injured his health, and subjected him to much affliction. Early in 1777, an abscess formed in his side, which, after a few days’ illness, put a period to his life. He was theauthor of six plays besides that above mentioned.
