KASAN, one of the eastern provinces of the Russian empire, which extends beyond the boundaries assigned to Europe by.many geographical authorities. It has obtained the name of a kingdom. It was formerly inhabited by a people of the Finnish race, a branch of which, called the Viarmiers, in the most prosperous time of the western Roman empire, had founded a great commercial city at Perm, which flourished till about the year 1236, when this country was conquered by Ghengis Khan. FIis successors were driven but by some southern Tartars, who, constantly carrying on hostile operations with the Russians, under four different khans, denominated by the names of their respective capitals, Kasan, Astrakan, Kapts-chak, and Krim. Unfavourable events induced the khans of Kasan and of Astrakan to make submission, at the end of the fifteenth century, to the Czar Iwan Basilijw 1.; and the Russians from that period obtained great influence in the choice of khans over the other two districts. Peace was constantly interrupted between the Tartars and the Russians; and at length the Czar Iwan Basilijw II. conquered, in 1552, the city of Kasan, and in 1554 the city of Astrakan, and the other two were taken possession of by the Russians. The semblance of the Tartar rule was preserved under khans nominated by the czars till 1714, when Peter the Great erected his own government in the city of Kasan, and subjected to it the waywodeships of Simbirsk, Wiatka, Perm, and Pensa. These now form what is called the kingdom of Kasan; but each of the six has its separate government under a stadtholder. The whole extent is given, by authority, at 251,140 square miles, and the population as 5,867,000 persons.

Kasan, a stadtholdership or government of the Russian kingdom of the same name. It extends in north latitude from 54. 13. to 56. 44. and in east longitude from 47. 12. to 51. 39. It is bounded on the north by Wiatka, on the east by Orenburg, on the south by Simbirsk, and on the west by Nishegorod, and is divided into twelve circles or local governments. The whole extent is 22,960 square miles.

The face of the country is undulatory, not hilly, except that, in the south-east, some of the projections of the Ural Mountains enter the province; and on the right bank of the λ∖olga there are some calcareous bills, more remarkable for the extensive and. lofty natural caverns in them than for their height. Being watered by two great rivers and a vast number of brooks and rivulets, and interspersed with woods, meadows, and corn-fields, it has a cheerful aspect, in spite of some districts which are covered with sand or wild heaths. The river Wolga, which runs through the whole province, receives the other streams, and conveys their water to the Black Sea. It is navigable throughout its whole extent, and abounds with fish, particularly with sturgeon, which produce much isinglass and caviare, and form an important part of food for home consumption, as well as for exportation to other districts, though chiefly to Moscow.

The number of inhabitants is 1,293,250, the greater portion of whom are of the Russian race; but there are still many of the Tartar family, and, what appears singular, they are represented as being better instructed than the Russian peasantry. They live in villages by themselves, and have been provided by the government with schoolmasters and books. They mostly practise agriculture, but some engage in handicraft employments, and they are generally peaceable and industrious. The Russians all adhere to the orthodox Greek church, and many of the Tartars have been converted to the same faith; but others of the latter yet retain their profession of Mahommedanism. There are still some remains of the Finnish race, who are a wretched set of people, without information, and generally indolent. There are but few nobles. There are 9200 small proprietors of land, and near 300,000 slaves, the property of the crown.

The husbandry is conducted upon the same plan as in most parts of the Continent, the rotation being a fallow succeeded by rye or wheat in the second year, and these crops by oats or barley in the third year, when the same course is repeated. The corn scarcely yields five times the quantity sown; but enough is raised for bread, as well as for distillation, and some is exported. A large quantity of hemp is grown, and some flax. The woods produce much excellent timber. They mostly belong to the crown, but some of them to private proprietors. There are manufactures both of linen and woollen goods, mostly of a coarse kind, but suited to the climate and the condition of the people. The meadows raise numerous herds of cattle, where hides and tallow are the most valuable of the exports. There are mines yielding copper, and others iron, and from the latter much steel is made. A large quantity of potash is made, and forms a material article of export. The river Wolga is the chief means of transport, and a certain source of commercial occupation and wealth.
