KEDARNATH, a celebrated place of Hindu pilgrimage, in Northern Hindustan, situated in the mountains of Serinagur. Those who perform this difficult pilgrimage have to travel over the most steep and inaccessible roads, which, during half the year, are blocked up with snow. The place lies about fourteen or fifteen miles of direct distance west-north-west of Bhadrinath. The ceremonies observed here are nearly the same as at other places of Hindu ablution. The most peculiar of these is that of the widows shaving their heads, having previously bathed and purified themselves in the Ganges, which is here a narrow stream. Long. 79. 19. E. Lat. 32. N.
