KIDWELLEY, a market-town of South Wales, in the county of Carmarthen, 226 miles from London. It is built on both sides the river Gwendraeth, which is navigable from Carmarthen Bay. It was formerly surrounded with walls, and there are still the ruins of an ancient castle. The neighbourhood abounds with coals, the export of which forms the principal trade; and for promoting which, excellent mechanical contrivances have been adopted for the most economical mode of trans-shipping them from the barges to the sea-bound vessels. Near the town is an iron foundery, and also a manufactory of tin plates. The town forms part of the duchy of Lancaster, but is governed by its own mayor and aidermen. There is a tolerable market on Friday, and three annual fairs. The population amounted in 1801 to 1488, in 1811 to 1441, in 1821 to 1733, and in 1831 to 1631.
