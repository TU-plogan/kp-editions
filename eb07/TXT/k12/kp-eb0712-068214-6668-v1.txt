KAYOR, or Cayor, a kingdom of Western Africa, situated on the coast between the rivers Gambia and Senegal. As is the case with many other kingdoms of Africa, correct or recent information regarding Kayor is very limited. According to Golberry, its western limits are the last five leagues of the left bank of the Senegal, adjoining to the mouth of that river, and all the extent of coast comprised between the bar of the Senegal and Point Serene, situated in lat. 14. 44. N. It is bounded on the north by the territory of Wai or Brack, eastward by the dominions of the Bourb Yolof, and on the south by the petty states of Sin and Salum. Extending 150 miles from north to south, by an average breadth of 120 miles, it thus comprises a surface of about 6000 square miles, which is thinly peopled by not more than 180,000 inhabitants. The ground rises imperceptibly from the seacoast eastward, but without high mountains. The soil is sandy, but fruitful, and bears a number of those immense trees called bacbab. At the little island of Goree, on this coast, the French have established the capital of all their African settlements. Its advantages consist solely in its almost inaccessible situation on a rock, three sides of which are perpendicular, and the fourth very steep. The rock is fortified, and the town contains about 7000 inhabitants. It is a bustling place, being the entrepôt of all the trade with the opposite coast, and also a place of refreshment for French ships on their way to India. The capital of Kayor bears the same name, and is only a large village, situated about 120 miles from Goree. The sovereign of the country is called Darnel, and the government is feudal. The inhabitants are Jalofs or Yolofs, which people are described as the handsomest negroes of Western Africa, being tall and plump, with finely turned limbs, short curling hair, and shining jet-black skin. They are a domestic people, little known beyond [7:12:683] their own territories, and recognise amongst themselves the distinction of caste.
