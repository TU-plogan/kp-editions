KAOLIN, the name of an earth which is used as one of the two ingredients in oriental porcelain. A quantity of this earth was brought from China, and examined by Μ. Reaumur. He found that it was perfectly infusible by tire, and believed that it was a talky earth; but Μ. Macquer conceives that it is more probably of an argillaceous nature, from its forming a tenacious paste with the other ingredient, called petuntse, which has no tenacity. Μ. Bomare says, that by analyzing some Chinese kaolin, he found it to be acompound earth, consisting of clay, to which it owed its tenacity; of calcareous earth, which gave it a rneally appearance; of sparkling crystals of mica; and of small gravel, or particles of quartz crystals. He says that he has found a similar earth upon a stratum of granite, and conjectures that it may be a decomposed granite. This conjecture is the more probable, as kaolins are frequently found in the neighbourhood of granites.
