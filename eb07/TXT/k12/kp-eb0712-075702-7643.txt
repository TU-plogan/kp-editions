KONIGSTEIN, a small city of the kingdom of Saxony, in the bailiwick of Pirna and province of Meissen, situated on the left bank of the Elbe, and containing 190 houses, with 1450 inhabitants. It is in that part of the kingdom commonly called Saxon Switzerland, and is remarkable for the impregnable fortress adjoining to it. The mountain castle overlooks the town, on a rock whose perpendicular face towards the Elbe is about 900 feet. It includes, on the top of the rock, within its walls, fields, gardens, meadows, and a wood, and a well abounding with water, 900 feet deep, so that sufficient provision for the garrison can be grown within itself; but there are large storehouses on the rock, for provisions, ammunition, and all necessaries; amongst others, two great casks of wine, capable of containing 1000 hogsheads. The casernes are bomb-proof, and, from the nature of the rock, the castle can neither be assailed by traverses nor by mines. In this fortress, the jewels, money, curiosities, and archives of the crown have been deposited in time of war, and were secure when the capital and its palaces were occupied by Frederick of Prussia, as well as at a more recent period, when Dresden was the head-quarters of the French army, and assailed by the allied forces of Russia, Austria, Prussia, and Sweden. The castle contains also the state-prison. On the opposite side of the Elbe is the fortress of Lillienstein, on a sandy rock 1080 feet above the river. It is now dilapidated, but was occupied by the French in 1813, who added to the works.
