KLAGENFURT, a circle of the Austrian government of Illyria, bounded on the north and the east by Steyermark, on the south by Laybach, and on the west by Villach. It extends over 1944 square miles, and comprehends, nine cities with their suburbs, fourteen markettowns, and 1626 villages and hamlets, having 27,337 houses, and 163,759 inhabitants. It is generally a mountainous district, containing very lofty peaks and ridges, but having between them many valleys beautifully picturesque and highly fertile. The chief place is the city which gives its name to the circle. Near to it is a lake whose waters form the river Gian, on whose bank it is built, and whence the northern canal is supplied with its water. It is an open town, well built, containing seven churches, two hospitals, an ursuline convent, and orphan house, besides an established lyceum and gymnasium, with schools for education in law and physic. It contains 778 houses, and 9840 inhabitants, of whom some are employed in manufactures of fine cloth, cotton goods, silks, and white lead. Long. 13. 55. 57. E. Lat. 46. 12. N.
