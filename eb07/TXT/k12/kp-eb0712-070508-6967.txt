KETCH, a vessel equipped with two masts, namely, a main-mast and mizen-mast, and usually from 100 to 250 tons burden. They are principally used as yachts, or as bomb-vessels.

Ketcn-Hissar, a town of Asia Minor, in Caramania, beautifully situated amidst plantations of fruit-trees. It contains many ancient ruins, which extend over a space of seven or eight miles. There is particularly in this place a beautiful aqueduct of granite; and the massy foundations of several large edifices are to be seen in different parts of the town; and shafts, pillars, and pedestals lie buried under ground. It is supposed by Mr Kinneir that this place is the ancient Tyana, described by Strabo as one of the oldest cities in Cappadocia. The whole neighbourhood is impregnated with nitre, which supplies materials for a large manufactory of gunpowder. It is eighty-five miles south-west of Kaisariéh. *∙∙
