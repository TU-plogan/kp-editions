KLEIST, Edward Chrlstiaden, a German poet, and a soldier of distinguished bravery, was born at Zeblin, in Pomerania,*in 1715. At nine years of age he was sent to pursue his studies at Cron, in Poland; and he afterwards studied at Dantzic and Königsberg. Having finished 1 ∣his studies, he went to visit his relations in Denmark, who invited him to settle there; and having in vain endeavoured to obtain preferment in the law, at twenty-one years of age he accepted of a post in the Danish army. He then applied himself to the study of all the sciences that have a relation to military affairs, with the same assiduity as he had before studied civil law. In 1740, at the beginning of the reign of Frederick king of Prussia, Mr de Kleist went to Berlin, and was presented to his majesty, who made him lieutenant of his brother Prince Henry’s regiment; and he was in all the campaigns which distinguished the first five years of the king of Prussia’s reign. In 1749 he obtained the post of captain; and in that year he published his poem on the Spring. Before the breaking out of the war, the king chose him, with some other officers at Potsdam, as companions to the young prince Frederic William of Prussia, and to eat at his table. In the first campaign, in 1756, he was nominated major of Hausen’s regiment, which being in garrison at Leipsic, he had time to finish several new poems. After the battle of Rosbach, the king gave him, by an order in his own hand-writing, the inspection of the great hospital established at Leipsic. On this occasion his humanity was celebrated by the sick and wounded of both parties, and his disinterestedness was equally admired by all the inhabitants of that city. In 1758, Prince Henry coming to Leipsic, Mr de Kleist desired to serve in his army with the regiment of Hausen, which was readily granted. Opportunities of distinguishing himself could not be wanting under that great officer, and he always communicated his courage to the battalion under his command. He also served that prince∣at the beginning of the campaign of 1759, when he was with him in Franconia, and in all the expeditions of that army, till he was detached with the troops under General de Fink to join the king’s army. On the 12th of August was fought the bloody battle of Kunnersdorf, in which he fell. His poems, which are greatly admired, are printed in the German tongue, in two volumes 8vo.
