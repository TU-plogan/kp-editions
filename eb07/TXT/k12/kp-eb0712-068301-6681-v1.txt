KAZAMEEN, a town of Asia, in the pashalik of Bagdad, on the western bank of the Tigris. It contains about 8000 inhabitants, Persians, who have been induced to settle here on account of its being the burying-place of two noted saints, to the memory of whom a noble mosque has been erected. The town is ornamented with two gilded cupolas, supported by the contributions of pilgrims. It has a tolerable bazar, fifteen coffee-houses, three humums, and a caravanserai; and opposite to the town is a tomb of another Mahommedan saint. Nine miles south-west of the town, and at some distance from the river, is the very extraordinary structure which has received the name of the tower of Babel from Europeans, Nimrood from the natives of Bagdad, and Agerkuf from the Arabians. It is 190 feet in height, 100 in diameter; and, from its appearance, Mr Kinneir judged it to be coeval with the remains of ancient Babylon, being built of the same materials, namely, square bricks dried in the sun, cemented with slime and layers of reeds. It is three miles north of Bagdad.
