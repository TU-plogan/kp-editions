KUR, the ancient Cyrus, the most considerable river of Georgia, in Asia. It has its rise, according to Sir R. Kerr Porter, in a branch of the Caucasian Mountains, from which issue several rivulets, which, uniting in one channel, take the name of Kur; and flowing thence through part of the Turkish dominions, gradually augments its stream by the reception of minor rivers in its [7:12:766]course. From this point the Kur takes a south-east di" recti on, fertilizing a country of as much beauty as grandeur. Its most considerable tributaries in this part of its course are, the Aluzan from the north-east, and the Araxes from the south, which falls into the Kur about seventy miles from its mouth. After this junction, the breadth and depth of the Kur are so much increased, that it immediately becomes navigable for larger boats. At fifty miles lower down, it divides itself into two noble branches, and so flows onward, through the province of Maghan, to the north-west coast of the Caspian, whence, by these double channels, it unites its waters with the sea. The banks are very high, and wooded.
