KISHTEWAR, a district of Hindustan, in the northeastern extremity of the province of Lahore, situated principally between the 33d and 34th degrees of N. lat. It is bounded on the north-west by the southern range of the Cashmere Hills. The country is in general hilly and covered with wood, and but thinly inhabited. It is also very cold during the winter season, and presenting few temptations to invaders, has probably on that account retained its independence. It is intersected by the river Chunaub, over which there are no bridges; and at the village of Nausman, where it is seventy yards wide, it is crossed by means of a large basket slung to a tight rope, which reaches from side to side, and along which it is pulled. Kishtewar, the capital, which is the residence of a Mahommedan chief, is situated close under the southern range of the Cashmere Mountains. Long. 75. 20. E. Lat. 34. 7. N.
