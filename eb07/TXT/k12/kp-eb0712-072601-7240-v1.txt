KING’S County, an inland county of the province of Leinster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the county of Westmeath, on the east by the county of Kildare, on the south by the Queen’s county and Tipperary, and on the west by the counties of Tipperary, Galway, and Roscommon. In its greatest length from south-west to north-east it measures upwards of fifty miles, and forty-two in its greatest breadth from east to west, but the irregularity of its shape prevents the deduction of any practical inference as to its dimensions from these premises. Its actual extent is 528,166 acres, of which 394,569 are capable of cultivation, 133,349 are unprofitable mountain or bog, and not more than 248 are under water.

In the earliest periods of Irish history, this county formed part of the territory of Hy-Falgia, and was also known, by the name of Hy-Laoighis, a denomination that comprehended also the Queen’s county and some other districts. The southern part of it afterwards obtained the name of Ely O’Carroll. It was also known by that of the kingdom of Offaly. In the reign of Philip and Mary it was reduced into shire ground, and assumed the title it still retains, when its assize-town also took its name from [7:12:727] the above-named king. At that time the heads of the principal clans were, the O’Conor-Falies, the O’Carrolls of Ely O’Carroll, the M ζ Egans, the O’Delanys, and the O’Meaghers. It is now divided into the twelve baronies of Ballyboy, Ballycowan, Ballybritt, Clonlisk. Coolestown, Eglish or Fircal, Garrycastle, Geashill, Kilcoursey, Upper and Lower Philipstown, and Warrenstown. These are again subdivided into forty-four parishes, besides seven parts of parishes, the remaining parts of which are in some of the adjoining counties.

According to former ecclesiastical arrangements of Ireland, this county comprehended parts of the dioceses of Kildare, Meath, Killaloe, Ossory, and Clonfert; but under the new distribution of the dioceses it is comprehended in those of Dublin, Meath, Killaloe, and Ferns.

The surface of the country is for the most part level and uninteresting; the great field of floetz limestone, that forms so much of the soil of Ireland, spreading itself over all but its southern portion. Beds of foliated limestone, of a greenish hue and a large granular texture, adapted for various useful purposes, are found at Tullamore. In the south-east, the Slieve Bloom Mountains extend in a direction from north-east to south-west for twenty miles, forming the line of demarcation between the King’s and Queen’s counties. They are steep and craggy, and have but one opening by which they can be crossed, called the Gap of Glandine. They consist of a nucleus of clay, surrounded by sandstone, with tracts of irreclaimable bog at their base. Pure white clay, of a quartzose nature, is found in them. Croghan Hill, in the northern extremity of the county, rises above the surrounding level to the height of more than five hundred feet, clothed with verdure to its summit. It is composed of trap, conglomerate, and floetz limestone. On those parts of its surface the basis of which is lime, the soil is extremely barren; whilst on the other parts it is peculiarly fertile, producing, from time immemorial, good crops of oats and potatoes, without manure. The difference is so marked, that the line of junction of the two formations can be traced by the verdure on the surface. Another elevation of the country, but less remarkable than that of Croghan, is the hill of Cloghan, between the river Brosna and the Slieve Bloom Mountains. Numerous and abundant springs gush from it on all sides. The minerals found here are iron in small quantities, manganese, ochre, chalk, and potters’ clay. The only river that can strictly be considered as belonging to the county is the Brosna, which rises in the county of Westmeath, and discharges itself into the Shannon. This latter river forms a considerable part of the western boundary of the county. The Barrow is its boundary to the south-east, and the Boyne skirts a small portion of its north-eastern extremity. The Lesser Brosna, also a branch of the Shannon, divides the county from Tipperary. The only lake within the county is Lough Pallis, of inconsiderable dimensions. The divisional line which separates the Queen’s county passes through the middle of Lough Annagh, the northern portion of which is therefore considered as belonging to the King’s^county. It is of inconsiderable size, not covering more than 315 acres. Lough Boura, containing 175 acres, is so shallow that it may be safely forded in summer-time.

The soil is in general either a deep moor or a shallow gravelly loam; the former is the more productive in dry seasons, the latter in moist. Limestone is abundant in most parts. The pastures, though not luxuriant, form good sheep walks; that on the more mountainous tracts has proved excellent for young cattle. In reclaimed bog, corn crops are some weeks later in ripening than elsewhere, although the natural vegetation is earlier than in the upland pastures. A considerable portion of the great bog of Allen is in this county.

The latest return of the population gives an average of one soul to every four acres, or of about one to every acres of cultivated land. The returns of the number of inhabitants at various periods are as follow :—

1760, De Burgo 45,618

1792, Beaufort 74,500

1813, Parliamentary census 113,226

1821, Ditto 131,088

1831, Ditto 144,029

The proportion of Protestants to Catholics is about one to four; the number of dissenters is inconsiderable.

The county was represented in the Irish parliament by six members; two for the county at large, and two for each of the boroughs of Philipstown and Banagher. The boroughs were deprived of the right of returning members at the union; and as the reform act has introduced no change into the arrangements then made, the county is now represented only by two members. The state of the constituency, as affected by the various changes made since the year 1829, is shown in the following table, exhibiting the number of electors of the different rates of franchise :—

Years. L.50. L.20. L.10. 40s. Total.

1st Jan. 1829, 842 95 — 1083 2020

1st Jan. 1830, 858 127 154 — 1078

1st May 1832, 346 225 739 — 1310

The peace of the county is maintained by a constabulary force, consisting of five chief constables, forty-eight constables, and 144 sub-constables, total 197, at an expense of L.9124 per annum, being an average of forty-seven pounds each man nearly.

The number of children receiving education in public schools was, in

Bate. Boys. Girls. Sexŋnascer-Total. j tamed.

1821, 5531 2601 — 8,132

1824-26, 5787 3929 423 10,139

Of the numbers stated in the latter return, 2064 were of the established church, 7959 Roman Catholics, twenty-two dissenters, and ninety-four whose religious persuasion was not ascertained. The total number of schools was 254, thirty of which, containing 1854 pupils, were supported by grants of public money; twenty-four, containing 1404 pupils, by voluntary subscriptions; and the remaining 200, containing 6881 pupils, were maintained by the fees of those instructed.

The crops usually raised are, wheat, oats, barley, and potatoes. Oxen are frequently employed in field labour; a mode of yoking them by the horns is much approved by some intelligent farmers, as being less irritating to the animal, and giving a better direction to its powers. Green crops are very general; rye-grass is much encouraged for early feeding. Great attention is paid to the rearing of horses, in consequence of which the county can boast of a fine breed. The uplands and moors are chiefly employed in feeding young cattle and sheep. The wool of these latter is highly esteemed at Ballinasloe. In the northern baronies there are many dairies, in some of which cheese of a good quality is made. Lime, and limestone gravel, either by itself or formed into a compost with the gatherings of the farm refuse, constitute the general manure. The gravel burned in heaps, with the parings of the moors, produces very heavy crops. Bog stuff is also often used for manure.

There is every reason to suppose that the greater portion of this county was once an uninterrupted forest. Wherever the timber is protected it grows up to great size and beauty. The parts bordering upon Tipperary are richly wooded. Alder is indigenous. The ash grown here is preferred to any other by the Dublin workmen. The bogs furnish an inexhaustible supply of fuel, not only [7:12:728] from their own peculiar vegetation, but from the trunks and roots of trees raised from them, which produce a quick and lively fire. Notwithstanding the great prevalence of bog, the general surface of the land is of considerable elevation, affording great facilities for conducting the superfluous moisture to the rivers which intersect the country in all directions. The fences are generally of white thorn, which thrives remarkably well here.

The condition of the peasantry, though more comfortable than in some other parts of Ireland, is notwithstanding low in comparison with that of the English of the same class. The houses arc small and poor, mostly covered with thatch, and seldom weatherproof. Earthen walls and straw roofs are preferred by most, not only from habit, but as being warmer than stone and slate. Fuel is everywhere plentiful, the bogs furnishing an inexhaustible supply of excellent quality. The food, in general, is potatoes and oatmeal; bearmeal is used in some parts. In Kilcoursey, most of the cottiers’ families consume a bacon pig annually. The peasantry are industrious when excited by what they deem adequate remuneration. The young men frequently leave home in quest of employment, rather than work for wages w hich they consider as too low. The women are remarkable for their industry, insomuch that youths of provident habits who reside elsewhere, frequently come hither in quest of wives. Besides their household occupations, the women prepare the materials for the manufacturer. The desire for education is sufficiently indicated by the number of small schools. Irish and English are indifferently spoken, though, in the intercourse of the lower classes with each other, the former is preferred.

The only manufactures carried on are those of wool and linen; but the quantities wrought are merely sufficient for the home consumption. The Grand Canal, which crosses the county from east to west, affords a cheap and expeditious mode of conveying its superabundant produce to other parts. Breweries and distilleries absorb most of the grain raised in the county.

Remains of antiquity of very remote date are frequent. In the Slieve Bloom Mountains there is a large pyramid of white stones, called the Temple of the Sun, or the White Obelisk. Of Danish raths, which are numerous, the most remarkable is that in Fιnglas parish. A chain of moats, chiefly situated at the passes of the bogs, may be traced throughout the county. At Clonmacnois are two round towers and several stone-crosses. This sequestered spot was the site of several places of religious observance, whence its name of the Seven Churches. It was also a bishop’s see, which merged in that of Meath in 1568. There were three religious houses at Killeigh. Monas-teroris Monastery, founded by one of the Bermingham family, in the district called Thotmoy, was a place df great repute. Durrow was also the site of an extensive abbey. The remains of military antiquities are still more numerous. Rathmore Castle, the area of which comprehended two acres, is looked upon as the oldest in the county. At Banagher are the remains of a fortress which commanded an important pass over the Shannon. Birr or Parsonstown Castle, formerly the residence of the O’Carrols, having fallen into the hands of the Parsons family, is now the residence of Lord Ross. Cangor Castle, in Clonlisk barony, is noted for its defence against the Irish, by whom it was ultimately taken and burned, and its garrison put to the sword.

The population is mostly rural. The towns are few and small. Philipstown, where the assizes are held, had but 1454 inhabitants at the period of the census of 1831. It is a market and post town, and is situated on the line of the Grand Canal, though it has not derived any commercial advantage from its proximity to that line of com-municatiβn. The town was visited by Philip ∏. king of Spain, who lodged in Forth Castle, now a gentleman’s seat. It is well built and paved. Its public edifices are, a church, a Roman Catholic chapel, court-house, jail, and barracks, as also a school on the foundation of Erasmus Smith. The place was formerly the site of Dingan Castle, the residence of the O’Conors, who were driven from it in 1546 by Sir William Bellingham, and forced to fly to Connaught. The town was taken and burned by King James’s forces in 1690.

ParsonStown has lately risen from an obscure village to the rank of a populous, well-built, and thriving town, the resort of many families of respectability. The church is an elegant modern building of the Gothic style. In the town is a pedestrian statue of the Duke of Cumberland, who commanded the English army in 1745. Its population is 6594. The numbers of inhabitants in each of the other towns whose population exceeds 1000 souls are as follow: Banagher 2641, Shinrone 1287, Edenderry 1283, Clara 1149, and Frankfort 1112. Tullamore, on the river Clodagh, owes its present improved condition chiefly to the spirit of the inhabitants, who have taken advantage of the Grand Canal, which passes by it, in order to make it an emporium of considerable inland trade; but also in some degree to a conflagration which destroyed most of the mean and ruinous huts of which before it chiefly consisted. Its principal building is the parish church, an elegant modern structure. It contains 6342 inhabitants.
