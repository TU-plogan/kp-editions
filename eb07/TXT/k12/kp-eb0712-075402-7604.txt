KODIAK, an island on the west coast of North America, about fifty miles from the entrance into Cook’s Inlet. It is about sixty miles in length, and, along with the smaller island of Atognak, is separated from the continent by the Straits of Cheligoff. The natives are robust, active, and well skilled in all the arts connected with fishery. They have an ingenious manner of constructing their boats, which are almost entirely covered with leather. The port of St Paul’s on this island was long the chief seat of the trade of the Russians with north-western America. The natives having been found extremely serviceable, were removed in great numbers to the other Russian settlements along the coast.
