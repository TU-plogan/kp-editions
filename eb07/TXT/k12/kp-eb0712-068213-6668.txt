KAYNS, Kiayns, or Carianers, a singular tribe who inhabit that mountainous and woody tract which lies between Bengal, Aracan, Ava proper, and the province of Munipoor or Cassay. They arc represented as a simple, innocent race, speaking a language distinct from that of the Burmans, and entertaining rude notions of religion. Their habits are altogether pastoral, and they are the most industrious subjects of the state. Their villages form a select community, fro r m which they exclude all other sects, and in no case reside in any city, or marry or intermingle with strangers. They profess and practise the doctrine of universal peace, never engaging in war, nor taking any part in contests for dominion. They devote themselves to agriculture, the care of cattle, and the raising of poultry. Almost all the provisions used in the country are raised by this tribe, and they particularly excel in gardening. They have of late years been oppressed and heavily taxed by the great Burman landholders, and have in consequence withdrawn into the mountains of Aracan. They have no written laws, but are guided by immemorial custom, which stands in the place of law. Some learn to speak the Burman tongue, and a few can read and write it imperfectly. They arc (says Symes, in his account of his embassy to A va) timorous, honest, mild in their manners, and exceedingly hospitable to strangers.
