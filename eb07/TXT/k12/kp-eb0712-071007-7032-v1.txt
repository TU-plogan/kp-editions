KIEW, a province or government of European Russia, in the division formerly called Little Russia. It is situated between 28. 30. and 32. 20. east longitude, and 48. 26. and 51. 34. north latitude. It extends over 15,466 square miles, com-preh ending sixty-eight cities and towns, and 1304 parishes, with several villages and hamlets in each. The inhabitants are 994,830. It is divided into twelve circles, receiving the name of the chief towns in it. It is generally a level district, with undulations of hills proceeding from the Carpathian Mountains, whose elevations in this province are inconsiderable. There are many pleasant spots, though none very striking; but the whole face of the country has a monotonous appearance. The soil is generally favourable to cultivation, and yields corn more than sufficient for consumption, so as to have 1,000,000 quarters annually for the supply of less productive districts. It yields abundant crops of hemp, flax, and tobacco. The cattle are numerous, and many are sold to Germany, Austria, and the internal provinces, to improve the breed. There are no mines. Much spirit is distilled from grain, which, with coarse cloth, soap, and leather, forms the chief branch of trade. The principal river, the Dnieper, receives the waters of the smaller rivers, and conveys them to the Black Sea. The capital, Kiew, is on the Dnieper, is the seat of an archbishop, and has a cathedral, twenty-five other churches, an ecclesiastical seminary or college, and other public institutions. It contains 3728 houses, in narrow and winding streets, and about 40,000 inhabitants. Long. 30. 22. 25. E. Lat. 50. 26. 19. N.
