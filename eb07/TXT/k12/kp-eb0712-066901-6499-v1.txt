KALENDAR, a distribution of time, accommodated to the uses of life. See Calendar. Kalendλr, Kalendarium, originally denoted, amongst the Romans, a book containing an account of monies at interest, which became due upon the kalends of January, the usual time when the Roman usurers let out their money.

Kalendar Months, the solar months, as they stand in the kalendar, beginning with January.

Astronomical Kalendar, an instrument engraved upon copper-plates, printed on paper, and pasted on board, with a brass slider which carries a hair, and shows by inspection the sun’s meridian altitude, right ascension, declination, rising, setting, amplitude, &c. to a greater exactness than our common globes will show.

Kalendar Brothers, a sort of devout fraternities, composed of ecclesiastics as well as laymen, whose chief business it was to procure masses to be said, and alms distributed, for the souls of such members as were deceased. They were also denominated kalend-brothers, because they usually met upon the kalends of each month, though in some places only once a quarter.
