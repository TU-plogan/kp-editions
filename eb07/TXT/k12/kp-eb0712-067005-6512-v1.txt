KALMUCKS, a tribe of those wandering Tartars who, in the thirteenth century, under Jenghis Khan, subdued and desolated the whole breadth of Asia. The Kalmucks (See Asia) are distinguished from the other nations of Asia by their peculiar physiognomy. They are in general of the middle size, powerfully and well made, except in their thighs and legs, which are somewhat bent. A large head, round face, dark olive complexion, high and prominent cheek bones, sparkling black eyes punctured in the head, and widely separated from each other, a flat broad nose scarcely rising above the level of the face, and turned up, with two immense nostrils, thick and fleshy lips, and exceedingly white teeth, a short chin, and a thin scanty beard, with black coarse hair, complete the portrait of a Kalmuck face. In many of the women, however, these harsh features are softened, and they have agreeable countenances, with very delicate complexions, which are set off by fine black hair; so that some of the higher classes would even be considered as beauties by the Europeans. They are, like all barbarians, coarse, filthy, and disgusting in their habits; they are covered with grease and vermin, and slovenly and dirty in the extreme. Nor do their moral qualities make amends for these defects. Morality is indeed amongst all nations upon a level with their intelligence, and amongst barbarians is generally at a low ebb. The Kalmucks are accordingly represented as being addicted to lying and cheating, though travellers report that robberies are rare amongst them, and that a murder is almost unknown. They pay great respect to old age; and, though hot in their temperament, and fierce when irritated, they in general live amicably together. Whoever receives a present of meat or drink divides it faithfully amongst his companions; and if a relative has lost his flocks or other substance by war or accident, he is sure to be liberally rewarded. According to Pallas, a Kalmuck provided with a horse, with arms, and equipage, mayΥamble from one place to another for three months together, without taking with him money or provisions. His friends and relatives, however distant, receive him with all that hospitality which distinguishes barbarous nations; and wherever he goes he meets with the kindest reception, and is entertained in the best manner that their circumstances afford. And a stranger, from whatever country he comes, is sure to be well received by the Kalmucks. His property is faithfully kept for him the moment he puts himself under the protection of his host, it being considered as a crime of the deepest dye to rob any one who is a guest. These tribes, from the prince to the peasant, dwell in tents, which are their only habitations, and are all of a circular form, with a conical roof, and a hole at the top. They are covered with felt made of camels’ hair or wool, and are constructed of cane or wood. One of their encampments presents the appearance of a city, with regular streets, sometimes extending a mile in length, and containing numerous shops, where several of the more refined arts are carried on. Here are artificers in copper, brass, and iron; also goldsmiths, who make trinkets for their women, idols of gold and silver, and vessels for their altars; also others who are expert at inlaid work and enamelling. Dr Clarke asserts that these oriental tribes of Kalmucks have, from time immemorial, possessed the art of making gunpowder. The riches of the Kalmucks consist entirely in their flocks. Their habits are wholly r pastoral; and they never think of cultivating the ground, though they inhabit extensive tracts of luxuriant meadows, which are of peculiar fertility. Like all pastoral tribes, they emigrate with the seasons, residing with their flocks in the mountains during the summer, and descending in the winter to the verdant plains. They have few camels, these being delicate and difficult to rear; and they are chiefly possessed by priestsand by the richer classes. Their horses are small but very swift, and are capable of enduring great fatigue, galloping for several hours Successively without injury, or passing a whole day without drinking. Their horned cattle arc of a beautiful shape; and their sheep are the same as those which are found throughout Great Tartary. They are exceedingly fat, with large tails and broad and pendent ears; but their wool is so coarse that it can only be used in the manufacture of felt. They live on the milk and flesh of their cattle, and have no objection to [7:12:671] horse flesh. They make a fermented liquor from mare’s milk, from which they distil a spirit called koumiss, of which they are very fond. They are also extremely partial to tobacco and tea. Their principal amusements are hunting, wrestling, archery, and horse-racing. They are expert horsemen, being trained to it from their infancy; and the women are equally skilful with the men. They are, like all barbarous tribes, passionately addicted to gaming; and often lose at cards all that they possess, even to their very clothes. They have also chess, draughts, and backgammon; and the youth of both sexes amuse themselves with singing and dancing to the two-stringed lute. Their most common diseases are malignant fevers, which are greatly aggravated by their gross diet and want of cleanliness. The itch, and other cutaneous diseases, are also common amongst them. Their religion is pagan, and their priests, as amongst every ignorant and superstitious people, are treated with the most extraordinary respect. Their commerce consists entirely in the exchange of their horses and cattle for com, woollen cloths, linens, copper, pewter, kitchen utensils, knives, and spoons; and great numbers of them visit Astrakan for this purpose. They never deal in slaves; but such prisoners as they take in war are naturalized, and adopted into the tribe.

This powerful tribe, like all the other pastoral states of Asia, has been greatly reduced, both in numbers and extent of territory, by the increasing power of the civilized nations by whom they are surrounded. Before their subjugation or dispersion, they were divided into three principal branches; the Soonganes, the Coschotes, and the Torgots. Of these, the first were engaged in almost perpetual hostilities with the Mongols and Chinese. The Coschotes, on the conquest of Thibet, became subject to the Chinese; and still continue under the protection of that power, except a smaller part which had retired to the Irtish, and fell under the dominion of the Soonganes. The Torgots, who had separated themselves from the Soonganes, settled at an early period amongst the steppes on the Volga; but many of them, disgusted with the tyranny of Russia, returned in great numbers in'] 770 and 1771, over the river Ural, on the ice, and across the Kirgusian steppes into Soongaria. It was in 1720 that the Kalmucks were driven from Thibet; and about forty years afterwards, by the extension of Kiang Long’s conquests, such as refused to submit to his authority were compelled to seek for new settlements towards the west. Many of them accordingly dispersed themselves in the interior parts of Asia, and amongst the cities of the Usbeck Tartars; others took refuge in Russia, and some thousands fled to Siberia, but the greater number submitted to the Chinese sovereignty. At present the most numerous and powerful tribes of the Kalmucks inhabit the country lying between the Caspian Sea, Muscovy, Samarcand, and Cashgar. Others occupy with their flocks and herds both banks of the Volga, between the Irghis and the Caspian, and extend their excursions on both sides of the Don and the Ural. . . (f.)
