KISHM, Kishmee, or Jezira Derawz (Long Island). This is the largest island in the Persian Gulf, which extends sixty mile« along the Persian shore, and is in no place more than twelve miles in breadth. The channel by which it is separated from the continent, which is from threeįto eight miles wide at the northern point of the island, is navigable for the largest vessels. This island has a most desolate and unpromising aspect; from whatever quarter it is seen, it presents nothing but light-gray rocks of shells or calcareous stone or brown sand, entirely devoid of verdure. The inhabitants, who amount to .about 10,000, including the population of Kishmee, the capital, live chiefly by fishing and agriculture; and there are a few productive spots on the island, which yield a small supply of dates, as well as of wheat and barley. They also breed cattle and sheep, and the latter are said to thrive well. But this island, though now barren and deserted, is said at one time to have presented a very different appearance. It contained, we are informed, 360 well-inhabited villages, with date and fruit tree gardens·; and from Ormuz, when it was in the height of its glory, were sent supplies of fruit, vegetables, and many descriptions of provisions. Since that period it has been the scene of great disturbance and rapine; pirates having of late years made descents upon it, plundering and destroying every thing within their reach, and wantonly cutting down the date and fruit trees, so that it can hardly supply the few remaining families with the food which they require. The fear of these descents drove the greater part of the inhabitants into the town of Kishmee, which is walled, and prepared for defence, and contains 8000 inhabitants, though Fraser, by whom it was visited in 1821, considers· the number as rather exaggerated. The harbour or roadstead is not very safe, being open on the north-east to the deep channel that lies between it and Goπιberoon; so that during the prevalence of the north-east winds, which blow violently from November to February, boats cannot land for many days together, on account of the surf. For eight months of the year, however, the roadstead maybe considered as safe, since it has good bolding ground. The island is afflicted with a scarcity of water, and with great heats, which are extremely distressing, from the excessive dryness, and the great glare reflected from the rocks. The thermometer is frequently at 110° in the shade. Upon this parched and dreary spot a British force, consisting of Sepoys and Europeans, was landed from India, in order to overcome the Arab piratical powers who molested the navigation of these seas. But they suffered severely from the united influence of the sultry climate and the want of shelter and of food and water. The island is at present under the rule of an independent Arab scheik, who pays homage to the imaums of Muscat. The town is situated close to the sea, in lat. 26. 57. 30. N.
