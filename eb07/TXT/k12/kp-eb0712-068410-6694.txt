KEEL, the principal piece of timber in a ship, which is usually first laid on the blocks in building.

Keel is also a name given to a low, flat-bottomed vessel, used in the river Tyne, to bring the coals down from Newcastle and the adjacent parts, in order to load the colliers for transportation.

Keel- Hauling was a punishment inflicted for various offences in the Dutch navy. It was performed by plunging the delinquent repeatedly under the shipâ€™s bottom on one side, and hoisting him up on the other, after having passed under the keel.
