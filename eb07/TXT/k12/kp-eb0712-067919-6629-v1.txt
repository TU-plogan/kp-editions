KARICAL, a town of Hindustan, on the sea-coast of the province of Tanjore, fifty miles east by north from the province of Tanjore. The surrounding territory produces rice and salt. Karical was granted to the French by the rajah of Travancore in 1739. The fort is built upon one of [7:12:680] the branches of the Cavcry, the mouth of which is so choked by a bank of sand, that it is only navigable for boats. In 1760, Karical was taken from the French by Colonel Monson. It has been frequently taken and retaken since that period by the contending parties, and was ceded to the French at the conclusion of the last war. Long. 79. 54. E. Lat. 10. 55. N.
