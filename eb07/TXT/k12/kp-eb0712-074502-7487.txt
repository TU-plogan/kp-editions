KNARESBOROUGH, a town of the west riding of the county of York, in the wapentake of Claro, 215 miles from London by Nottingham, and 202 by York. It is situated on the side of a hill, almost surrounded by the river Nidd. It was formerly fortified, and had a castle built in the reign of William the Conqueror. It was a burgage tenure borough, and sent two members to parliament, who are now chosen by the ten-pound house-keepers. The chief trade is the linen manufacture, which is extensive. Near the town are some mineral springs of medicinal virtue, but they are not much resorted to. A dropping well, with great petrifying power, is a curiosity, about a mile from the town. There is a market on Wednesday, which is well attended; and there are eight fairs, at which much business is transacted. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3388, in 1811 to 4234, in 1821 to 5283, and in 1831 to 5296.
