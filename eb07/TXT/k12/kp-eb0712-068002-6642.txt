KARLSBAD. This is one of the most celebrated bathing places in Europe. It is situated in Bohemia, on the northern boundary towards Saxony. It is in a narrow and deep valley in a mountainous district, abounding with many most romantic prospects, and stands on both sides of the river Tepel. The springs are said to have been discovered in the year 1358, by the emperor of Germany, Charles IV., whilst hunting; and, the virtues of the water having been ascertained, he built a castle on the spot, around which other edifices were subsequently erected, and thus formed a city. It now contains about 500 housps, with 3000 resident inhabitants; but, in the summer, the number of occasional visitors far exceeds this. It has a neat and well-built church, an elegant theatre, and several spacious halls for assemblies collected for music, dancing, or promenading. The company to be found at this place is of the most promiscuous kind; and monarchs, nobles, and the most distinguished persons on the continent, mix here with the other guests with no observable parade or ceremony. The walks that have been laid out display much taste, and, from several points in them, the prospects are very striking; whilst the number of retreats, where refreshments are furnished, are appropriate, and at very moderate rates. The warm springs are of various names, viz. the Old and New Sprudel, the New Well, the Mill Well, the Bernharts Well, and the Theresa Well. All of these nearly resemble each other in taste, and the patients take very large doses of them. The cures in dyspepsia are much celebrated; and gouty, rheumatic, and scrofulous diseases are frequently cured by the use of the water. The resident inhabitants make many curious articles in iron, steel, tin, and wood, of which most of the visitors become the purchasers.
