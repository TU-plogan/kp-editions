KELAT, a city of Asia, the capital of Beloochistan, and thence called Kelat, or the city. Its situation is elevated on the western side of a well-cultivated plain or valley, about eight miles in length and two or three in breadth, the greater part of which is laid out in gardens and other enclosures. The town is built in the form of an oblong square; three sides of it are encompassed by a mud wall eighteen or twenty feet high, flanked at intervals of 250 paces by bastions, which, as well as the wall itself, are pierced with numberless loop-holes for matchlock men; but no cannon are now mounted. The defence of the fourth side of the city is formed by the western face of the hill on which it is built, being cut away perpendicularly. There are within the walls 2500 houses, without the wall 1250. They are built of half-burnt brick or wooden frames, and plastered over with mud or mortar; the streets are broader than those of native towns, and have mostly a raised pathway on either side for foot passengers, and an uncovered kennel in the centre, which is a recipient for all filth, and dirt, and stagnant water. The upper stories of the houses also stretching across the streets, render the part beneath them gloomy and damp. The palace of the chief of Kelat stands on the summit of the hill on which the city is built. Viewed from the outside, it appears an irregular heap of common mud buildings, with flat roofs, forming terraces, protected by low parapet walls pierced with loop-holes. The quarter on which the khanâ€™s residence is erceted has been enclosed by a mud wall with bastions. The bazar of Kclat is extensive, and well furnished with every kind of goods, and with provisions of all sorts, which can be procured at a moderate rate. The town is also supplied with delicious water, from a spring in the face of a hill on the opposite side of the plain, whence it meanders through the centre of it. The inhabitants of Kelat may be divided into four classes, namely, the Beloches or Brahooes, Hindus, Afghans, and Dehwars. The latter are the principal merchants of the place, and are therefore encouraged by the chief. Long. 67. 57. E. Lat. 29. 6. N.

Kelat, or the fortress, is a singular valley in the province of Khorassan, in Persia, which extends, in a direction nearly east and w est, from fifty to sixty miles in length, and from twelve to fifteen in breadth, situated amongst the hills that divide the plain of Mushed from the desert. It is surrounded by mountains so steep and difficult by nature as to be almost impassable, and they have been rendered completely so by art. The rocks, says Fraser, are scarped in the outside, presenting a mural appearance, so that there is no possibility of sealing them; and beyond these is a lesser range, with a hollow between, which the natives call the ditch. Not less care has been taken in the inside to increase every natural difficulty, so as to render a descent into or an escape from the valley equally impracticable. There are two openings in this valley, one at the western and one at the eastern extremity. These openings, which are both narrow and intricate, are called the gates of the fortress, and have been built up* and fortified in such a manner that it is impossible to force an entrance. On these fortified gateways there are towers where watchmen are continually posted to give warning of all who approach, and none are admitted except those who have passed from the end of the valley. In this valley there is a great deal of cultivation, and its population amounts to 2000 families. It was in this stronghold that Nadir Shah intended to deposit his vast treasure. Futch Allee Khan was placed in command of the fortress by Allee Shah, after the death of Nadir, and was killed in a brawl which subsequently took place. His son succeeded in putting the murderer to death, and he has ever since retained possession of the fortress. He is an independent chieftain, possessed of 1000 horse and 2000 foot, and can considerably increase the number by arming his villagers. As he is besides on good terms with the Toorkomans of the desert, he can always command a large force of their cavalry.

Kelat, a town and strong fortress of Afghanistan, in the province of Candahar. It was taken by the Emperor Baber in the year 1506; but, upon the decline of the Mogul empire, it fell again into the hands of the Afghans. Mr Foster, who passed it in 1783, describes it as a fort situated on an eminence, surrounded by a desert country. It is sixty miles east-north-east of the city of Candahar.
