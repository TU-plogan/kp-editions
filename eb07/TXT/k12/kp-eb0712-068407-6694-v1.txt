KEDGE, a small anchor used to keep a ship steady whilst she rides in a harbour or river, particularly at the turn of the tide, when she might otherwise drive over her principal anebor, and entangle the stock or flukes with her slack cable, so as to loosen it from the ground. This is accordingly prevented by a kedge rope that hinders her from approaching it. The kedges are particularly useful in transporting a ship; that is, removing her from one part of the harbour to another, by means of ropes which are fastened to these anchors. They are generally furnished with an iron stock, which is easily displaced for the convenience of stowing them.
