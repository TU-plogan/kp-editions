KINCARDINE, a considerable and thriving town in the southern part of Perthshire, situated on the shore of the Frith of Forth, at the distance of five miles east from Alloa, four west from Culross, ten from Dunfermline, and twenty-two from Perth. Formerly there were a number of salt-works here, and at one time this place was called West Pans; but the manufactories are now gone, and the name is out of use. The bouses of Kincardine are well built, but the streets are narrow and irregular. The seaport is one of the most thriving on the Forth, having now a good quay and harbour, and there being a considerable trade in the building of vessels, chiefly for coasting. There are upwards of fifty ship-owners, amongst whom a company has been formed for mutual insurance of their vessels, thus affording protection against individual loss at sea. In the town there are works for making sails and ropes, and a brewery. Distillation is carried on at Tulliallan, in the neighbourhood. Kincardine is a burgh of barony, under the government of several bailies. A fair is held here on the last Friday of July. The established church is at Tulliallan, but there is a dissenting meeting-house in the town. The population in 1821 amounted to 2500, and in 1831 to 1887.
