KÃ–NIG, George Matthias, a learned German, born at Altorf, in Franconia, in 1616. He became professor of poetry and of the Greek tongue there, and librarian to the university; in which last office he succeeded his father. He gave several public specimens of his learning, but is principally known for a biographical dictionary, entitled Bibliotheca Vetus et Nova, 4to, Altorf, 1674; which, though it is very defective, is still useful to biographers. He died in 1699.
