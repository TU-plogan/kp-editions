KOTTERUS, Christopher, was one of the three fanatics whose visions were published at Amsterdam in 1657, with the title of Lux in tenebris. He lived at Sprotta, in Silesia, and his visions began in 1616. He fancied he saw an angel under the form of a man, who commanded him to go and declare to the magistrates, that, unless the people repented, the wrath of God would make dreadful havock. The elector palatine, whom the Protestants had declared king of Bohemia, was introduced in these visions. Kotterus waited on him at Breslau in December 1620, and informed him of his commission. He went to several other places, and at last to the court of Brandenburg. As most of these predictions promised felicity to the elector palatine, and unhappiness to his imperial majesty, the emperor’s fiscal in Silesia and Lusatia got him seized, set on the pillory, and banished the emperor’s dominions. Upon this he went to Lusatia, and there lived unmolested till his death, which happened in 1647.
