KESWICK, a market-town of the county of Cumberland, in the parish of Crossthwaite, in Allerdale ward. It stands in a deep valley, on the celebrated lake of the same name, or, as it is sometimes called, the Derwent Water. It consists of a single narrow, long street, with no attractive objects. It is protected from the cold winds of the north by the lofty mountain of Skiddaw, which rises to the height of nearly 3000 feet. In the summer it is visited by numerous parties, who make it their head-quarters whilst enjoying the scenery of the lakes and mountains in its vicinity. Keswick is a place of little trade, but there is a market held on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1350, in 1811 to 1683, in 1821 to 1901, and in 1831 to 2159.
