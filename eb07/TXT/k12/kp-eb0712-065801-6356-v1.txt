K.

K the tenth letter, and seventh consonant, of our alj phabet, being formed by a guttural expression of the breath through the mouth, together with a depression of the lower jaw, and an opening of the teeth. Its sound is much the same with that of the hard c, or qu, and it is used for the most part only before e, ?, and n, in the beginning of words, as hen, kill, know, and the like. It used formerly to be always joined with c at the end of words, but is atĵpresent very properly omitted, at least in words derived from the Latin. Thus, for publick, musick, we now say public, music, and so on. However, in monosyllables it is still retained, as jack, block, mock, and the like.

K was borrowed from the, Greek kappa, and was but little used amongst the Latins. Priscian looked on it as a superfluous letter, and says that it was never to be used except in words borrowed from the Greek. Dausquius, after Sallust, observes that it was unknown to the ancient Romans. Indeed we seldom find it in any Latin authors, excepting in the word kalendae, where it sometimes stands instead of c. Carthage, however, is frequently spelt on medals with a K, salvis aug. et caes. fel. kart.; and sometimes the letter K alone stood for Carthage. Μ. Berger has observed, that a capital K, on the reverse of the medals of the emperors of Constantinople, signified K0nsta7ι- tinus ; and that on the Greek medals it signified ΚΟΙΛΗ SYPIA, Coele-Syria. Quintilian tells us, that in his time, some people had a mistaken notion, that wherever the letters c and a occurred at the beginning of a word, k ought to be used instead of the c. Lipsius observes, that K was a stigma anciently marked on the foreheads of criminals with a red-hot iron.

The letter K has various significations in old charters and diplomas; for instance, KR. stood for chorus ; KR. C. for cara civitas ; KRM. for carmen·, KR. AM. N. ĩm carus amicus noster; KS. chaos; KT. capite tonsus, &c. The French never use the letter k excepting in a few terms of art and proper names borrowed from other languages. Ablancourt, in his dialogue of the letters, introduces K as complaining that he has been often in a fair way of being banished from the French alphabet, and confined to the countries of the north.

K is also a numeral letter, signifying 250, according to the verse,

K quoque ducentos et quinquaginta tenebit.

When it had a stroke above it, κ, this letter stood for 250,000. K on the French coinage denotes money coined at Bordeaux.
