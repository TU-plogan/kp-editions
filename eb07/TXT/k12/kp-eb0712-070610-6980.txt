KEYSLER, John George, a learned German antiquary, was born at Thournex in the year 1689. After studying at the university of Halle, he was appointed preceptor to Charles Maximilian and Christian Charles, the young counts of Giech-Buchau, with whom he travelled through the chief cities of Germany, France, and the Netherlands, gaining great reputation amongst the learned as he went along, [7:12:707]by illustrating several monuments of antiquity, particularly some fragments of Celtic idols discovered in the cathedral of Paris. Having acquitted himself of this charge with great honour, he was, in 1716, appointed to superintend the education of two grandsons of Baron Bernstorff, first minister of state to his Britannic majesty as elector of Brunswick-Lunenburg. However, having in 1718 obtained leave to visit England, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, for a learned essay de Dea Nehelennia, numine veterum WalaÄ‡horum topico He also gave an explanation of the ancient monument on Salisbury Plain called Stonehenge, with a dissertation.on the consecrated misletoe of the Druids. These detached essays, with others of the same kind, he published on his return to Hanover, under the title of Antiquitates selectae Septentrionales et Celticae. He afterwards made the grand tour with the young barons, and to this we owe the publication of his travels, which were translated into English, and published in 1756, in four vols. 4to. Mr Keysler, on his return, spent the remainder of his life under the patronage of his noble pupils, who committed their fine library and museum to his care, with a handsome income. He died in 1743.
