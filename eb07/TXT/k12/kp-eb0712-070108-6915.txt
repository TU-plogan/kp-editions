KERKOOK, a town of Asiatic Turkey, and the largest of Lower Kurdistan. It is the ancient Demetrias of Strabo, and the Corcura of Ptolemy. It is in the direct road from Bagdad to Mosul, fifty-nine furlongs from the former, and forty-one from the latter. The city is situated on a commanding eminence, nearly perpendicular on all sides, below which is an extensive suburb; and it still retains the appearance of a Roman fortress. A nearer examination of the town, however, disclosing the narrowness and filth of the streets, together with the meanness of the houses, leaves no doubt as to the character and habits of the people. The city is defended by a mud wall, and has two gates, seven mosques, fourteen coffee-houses, a museum, a caravanserai, an Armenian church, and twelve pieces of useless artillery on the bastions. In the suburbs are five mosques, nine small caravanserais, thirteen coffee-houses, three convents, and three catholic churches. The surrounding country is unequal in its surface, and on the north side is a low range of barren and rocky mountains.â€œThe population of Kerkook is estimated at 18,000, though Mr Kinneir does not think it can exceed 13,000. These consist of Turks, Armenians, Nestorians, and Kurds. Long. 43. 42. E. Lat. 35. 29. N.
