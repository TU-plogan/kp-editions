KESCH, or Kech, a town, and capital of a district, in Great Buckharia. It was a favourite city of Timur, whose first appointment was as governor of this place. He here erected a splendid palace, on which the traveller Clavijo found workmen employed who had been labouring here for thirty years. It contained a university for the study of law and the sciences, and had also annexed to it gardens and meadows. It is thirty miles south of Sarnarcand.
