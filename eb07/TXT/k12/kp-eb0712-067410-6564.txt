KANKHO, or Kankiang-ho, a large river of China, in the province of Kiangsi. Its course is from north to south, and it falls into the Poyang Lake, forming the termination of the great water communication reaching from Pekin southwards for upwards of 1000 miles. It has a rocky bed, and the navigation is sometimes dangerous.
