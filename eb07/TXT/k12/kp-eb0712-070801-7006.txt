KHOZDAR, a town of Beloochistan, the residence of Meer Murad Ali, one of the principal Beloochee ameers of the Kumburanee tribe. It is situated in a small romantic valley of the same name, between two tremendous ridges of bare rocky mountains, tolerably well cultivated, and watered by a stream flowing through the centre. The town is walled, and has a good bazar. It is a Mahommedan town, though the Hindus are held in great esteem. The climate is severe; and at the approach of winter the richer classes retire to Cutch Gundava, to avoid the intense cold of the mountain air. It is distant from Kelat, the chief town of Beloochistan or Baloochistan, three daysâ€™ journey. Its situation is not exactly ascertained, but is nearly in latitude 36. 30. N. and long. 67. E.
