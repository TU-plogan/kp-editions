KHEROO, a town of Thibet, situated on the north of the great Himalaya ridge of mountains, formerly a large, but now an inconsiderable place, having been laid waste, prior to 1790, by an incursion of the Tartars, who occupy the country to the north of Joongale. A considerable trade is carried on between Nepaul and this place.
