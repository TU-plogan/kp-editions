KUMBALIA, a town of Hindustan, in the Gujerat peninsula, situated about five miles from the Gulf of Cutch, and subject to the chief of Nooanager. It is a populous and well-built town, surrounded by a stone wall, with round bastions, and four gates, which are sufficient to keep the surrounding country in awe. This place is the resort of the Gogia Brahmins, who are attendants on Ranchor, an incarnation of Vishnu and Dwarea. Having accumulated fortunes from the offerings of the pilgrims resorting to the pagoda, they have retired to Kumbalia, which is well adapted for commerce, to which they are much inclined. The port of this place is Sirreyah, at which vessels anchor, and send up their cargoes in boats. Long. 69. 45. E. Lat. 22. 15. N.
