KHYVAH, an independent territory of Asia, which extends on or near the banks of the Oxus a distance of between 100 and 200 miles, and on all quarters is surrounded by the desert. The town of Khyvah, the capital, is about fifteen miles from the Oxus, or 240 miles from Mungushluc, a bay upon the banks of the Caspian Sea. This tract of country, however confined and unpromising, was at one time the seat of the Khaurezmian sovereigns, who maintained a very flourishing empire, well known in the annals of the East. This empire embraced the principal part of Western Asia, and the country around was populous and prosperous. But all is now changed. The country has been ruined by the invasions of different conquerors; and the city of Khaurezm or Ourguπge, like the most celebrated cities of the East, has become a ruin; and the seat of the petty power that now exists has been transferred to the mean and modern town of Khyvah. The modern city of Khyvah was totally ruined by Nadir Shah, at the time when he overran all Turkestan, on his return from India; its youth were enlisted in his armies, a great many were put to death, and numbers were transported to distant parts. The Usbeck Tartars at length obtained the ascendency in this country, and maintained on the throne a prince said to be of the race of Ghenghis. A chief from one of their tribes still rules in the country.
