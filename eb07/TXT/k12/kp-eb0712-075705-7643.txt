KOOKIES, a singular race of people, who inhabit the mountains to the north-east of the Chittagong district, in the province of Bengal. They are little known to the inhabitants of the plain, and are seldom seen except when they visit the markets on the borders of the jungles in the Rungancah and Aurungabad divisions, to purchase salt, dried fish, and tobacco. The Kookies are a stout, muscular race, but not tall, and have the peculiar Tartar features of the Asiatics in the east, namely, the flat nose, small eye, and broad, round face. They are divided into a number of distinct communities independent of each other, and are all hunters and warriors. Their arms are bows and arrows, clubs and spears; and, by way of defence, they build their villages, which generally contain from 500 to 2000 inhabitants, on the most inaccessible hills. They are much addicted to war, in which they are almost constantly engaged; and, like most savages, they prefer ambuscades and surprises to regular battle. They are vindictive in their dispositions, and always shed blood on a principle of retaliation. They use an intoxicating liquor distilled from rice, which they drink at marriages, these being attended with much feasting. They have an idea of rewards and punishments in a future state, and they have also a saint or angel which they worship as the mediator between them and the Deity. They have no regular priests, and the master of each family instructs the children in the religious knowledge which he thinks necessary. They sometimes engage in war with the Choomeas; but being in great dread of fire-arms, they are quickly driven back to their native mountains. They are, however, a great terror to the inhabitants on the borders of the Chittagong district, especially to the wood-cutters, on whom they frequently make inroads. They subsist partly by the chase: and they have no religious prejudice against any animal. An elephant is considered as a great prize by them, as it affords so great a quantity of food. Their domestic animals are gagals, goats, hogs, dogs, and fowls.
