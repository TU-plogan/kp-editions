KIZLAR, a fortified town and capital of a district of the government of Caucasus, in Asiatic Russia. It is situated on the Terek, near its entrance into the Caspian Sea. It carries on a considerable trade, being a sort of entrep√¥t for the commerce of Astrakan with Persia and the interior of the Caucasus. It exports considerable quantities of wine, brandy, and silk; also the oil of sesamus, which answers the same purpose as the oil of olives. It was built in 1736, and is always garrisoned by two battalions, composed of the tribes who wander over the immense steppe between Kizlar and Astrakan. They are chiefly Nogays, Troukhmen, and Kalmucks. Long. 46. 29. E. Lat. 43. 31. N.
