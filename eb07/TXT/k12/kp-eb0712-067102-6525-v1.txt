KALUGA, a government or province of Russia in Europe, extending over 13,142 square miles. It contains twelve cities, twelve market-towns, and 2061 villages and hamlets, of which 351, with the people in them, belong to the crown. The whole number of inhabitants are 1,159,600. It is divided into eleven circles. It is generally a level country, the most fertile and the best cultivated of any in the Russian empire, and is the chief source of the supply of provisions to the ancient capital, Moscow. It is estimated to produce 1,600,000 quarters of corn yearly, besides other vegetables for food, and a large quantity of hemp, flax, and fat cattle. The woods are extensive, and yield more fuel than the internal consumption requires. The chief employment, besides agriculture, consists in spinning flax and hemp. It is well watered by the navigable rivers Oka and Shisdra, and by many smaller streams that empty their waters into them. The climate is deemed the most healthy in Russia, and it is certainly the mildest. The city of Kaluga is the capital of the province, as well as of a circle of the same name, which comprehends in it 795 square miles, one city, and 160 villages, with 72,198 inhabitants. It stands on the river Oka, where the Kainschka falls into it. The w'alls have been recently converted into promenades. It is the see of a bishop, who has a handsome palace. It contains twenty-four churches, 3827 houses mostly of wood, and 24,500 inhabitants, wdιose chief employment is making sail-cloth and other linen goods, and who, besides, carry on cotton, paper, and china manufactures, and distilleries, sugar refineries, and breweries, all of which render it a flourishing place.
