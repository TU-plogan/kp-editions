KAROON, a river of Persia, which has its rise about thirty-five miles south-west of Ispahan, at a place called Correng, at the foot of the same hill where the Zeindrood or Ispahan river has its source. After receiving a number of tributary streams in the mountains of Lauristan, it flows through the city of Shuster, to a small village twelve miles to the south of that city, where it meets the Abzal. It then flows with a southerly course as far as lat. 30. 32. N., and thirty miles east of Bassorah. Here it divides itself into two branches, one of which disembogues itself into the s?a at Goban; and the other, taking the name of Hafur, after a course of about fourteen miles, again separates, one division passing through an artificial canal three miles in length, into the Shat-ul-Arab, and the other entering the sea by the name of Bamishire. “The Karoon,” says Mr Kinneir, “is a noble river, being in many parts upwards of 300 yards in breadth, and navigable for boats of twenty-five tons burden as far as Kish-tibund, four miles from Shuster.
