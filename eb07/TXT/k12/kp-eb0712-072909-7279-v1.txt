KINGSTON, the capital of Jamaica. See Jamaica. Kingston, a town of Upper Canada, is advantageously situated on the northern bank of Lake Ontario, at the head of the river St Lawrence, and is separated from Points Frederick and Henry by a bay which extends a considerable distance to the north-west beyond the town, where it receives the waters of a river flowing from the interior. Point Frederick is a long, narrow peninsula, extending about half a mile into the lake in a south-easterly direction, distant from Kingston about three quarters of a mile, on the opposite side of its bay. This peninsula forms the western side of a narrow and deep inlet, called Navy Bay, from its being the chief harbour of the British navy on Lake Ontario. The extremity of the point has a strong battery, and there is a dock-yard with storehouses, and the like. Point Henry, forming the eastern side of Navy Bay, is a high, narrow, rocky ridge, extending into the lake, and crowned by a fort built on its extremity. The dock-yard, storehouses, slips for building ships of war, naval barracks, wharfs, and the like, are on an extensive scale, and in a very short period of time a formidable fleet could be equipped at this place. Next to Quebec and Halifax, Kingston is the strongest town in British America; and, with the exception of the former city and Montreal, it is the first in commercial importance. It has risen rapidly of late years, by becoming, through the means of the Rideau Canal, the main entrepôt between the trade in the lower province and all the settlements on the great lakes to the westward; and, from the measures now in progress to render the St Lawrence navigable between Montreal and Lake Ontario, it may be expected to increase yet more rapidly. The town is regularly laid out, whilst many of the houses are built of stone, and are both spacious and commodious. The public buildings are, a court-house, a government∙Jιouse, a jail, an hospital, and several churches, besides the garrison, naval depot, and other places already mentioned. The harbour, which is one of the best on the lake, is well sheltered and convenient; and here, from the commencement of spring till the latter end of autumn, great activity prevails. In 1828 the population of Kingston was 3528, and in 1834 it had risen to nearly 6000.
