KEJ, a town of Persia, and the present capital of the province of Mekran. Being situated on the high road from Candahar, Kelat, Shikrapoor, Khozdar, Bayla, &c. to the sea-port towns of Guatter and Chobar, it is a town of considerable importance, and an emporium of trade. The town encircles a fort, which is built on a high precipice, under which a river runs; and, from its natural strength, it is considered as impregnable by the natives. The governor or naib of Kej holds the city and district under the nominal authority of Mahmood Khan of Kelat, though he does not acknowledge his authority by the payment of tribute. The revenues are trifling, and the governor, who formerly supported 4000 or 5000 men, has only a small number of Arabs in his pay. The country in the immediate vicinity is described as a flat and arid tract of waste land, extending northward as far as the sea-coast, and in some spots producing great quantities of dates. 1 he flat is in some places intersected by ranges of hills and bare rocky mountains running north and south, but not advancing to the sea-shore.
