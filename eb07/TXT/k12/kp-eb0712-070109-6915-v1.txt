KERMANSHAW, a handsome and flourishing town of Persia, in the western part of the province of Irak. It is situated on the south-western slope of a range of mountains, at the extremity of a large plain, through the centre of which runs the Kerah or Karasu. It has the appearance of a handsome city, exhibiting the glittering domes of mosques within, and the battlements and towers of lofty walls without. The present shah has made it the capital of the district, over which he has constituted his eldest son, Mahmoud Ali Mirza, the governor. This prince is daily adding to its importance, by the construction of modern defensive works, and the erection of various public edifices. The bazar was rebuilt on an extensive plan in 1818, when it was visited by Sir R. K. Porter; a magnificent palace was also finished at the same time. Kermanshaw is famous for a manufactory of fire-arms, and the villages in its vicinity for carpets of the most beautiful colours and fabric. Luxurious gardens surround the town, abounding in fruits of all kinds, but particularly in grapes of a delicious muscatel flavour. The population amounts to 15,000 families, amongst whom there are a few Christians and Jews. It is 140 miles north-east from Bagdad. Long. 46. 30. E. Lat. 34. 20. N.
