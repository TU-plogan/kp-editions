KINGSTON, a town of the hundred of the same name, in the county of Surrey, ten miles from London. It is sometimes called, to distinguish it, Kingston-on-Thames, as it is situated on the right bank of that river, over which there is a handsome bridge, lately erected. It is one of the three county towns of Surrey. The spring assizes are held at it, as well as the sessions; and there is a large county jail. It is a corporate town, governed by bailiffs, a recorder, and justices. Formerly two members were returned to parliament. This place is supposed to have been the residence of one of the Saxon kings, and to have derived its name from that circumstance. There is but little trade except that of making malt, but there is a good market on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3793, in 1811 to 4144, in 1821 to 4908, and in 1831 to 5989.
