KNIEPHAUSEN, a district, formerly an independent sovereign state, but now a part of the grand duchy of Oldenburg, in Germany. During the late war the greater number of Dutch vessels were rendered neutral by the count of this district, and under the colours of Kniephausen were received in the English ports. It contains two parishes, with three churches, a strong castle, and 590 houses, with 3800 inhabitants. Though ceded to Oldenburg when mediatised, Count Bentick, the sovereign, has protested against the cession, and still maintains his claim to the dominion.
