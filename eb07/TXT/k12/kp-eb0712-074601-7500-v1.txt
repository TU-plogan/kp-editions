KNIGHTHOOD, a military order or honour, or a mark or degree of ancient nobility, or reward of personal virtue and merit. There are four kinds of knighthood; military, regular, honorary, and social.

Military Knighthood is that of the ancient knights, who acquired it by high feats of arms. They are called milites in ancient charters and titles, by which they were distinguished from mere bachelors, and others. These knights were girt with a sword, and wore a pair of gilt spurs; whence they were called equites aurati. Knighthood is not hereditary, but acquired. It does not come into the world with a man, like nobility, nor can it be revoked.

Regular Knighthood is applied to all military orders which profess to wear some particular habit. Such were the knights templars, and such also the knights of Malta.

Honorary Knighthood is that which princes confer on other princes, and even on their own great ministers and favourites; such are knights of the Garter, Bath, St Patrick, Nova Scotia, Thistle, and the like.

Social Knighthood is that which is not fixed or confirmed by any formal institution, nor regulated by any lasting statutes; of which kind many orders have been erected on occasion of factions, of tilts and tournaments, masquerades, and the like.
