KEHL, a town of the bailiwick of Kork, in the duehy of Baden. It is situated on the right bank of the Rhine, opposite to Strasburg, and during the revolutionary wars was celebrated for the strength of its fortress, which commanded the passage of the river, and stood on an island of the Rhine. The works have been neglected since 1815, and are now in ruins, though some of the more substantial buildings remain. There is a bridge connecting Kehl with Strasburg. The population has increased lately, and is said to exceed 2000.
