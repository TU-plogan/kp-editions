KIZILOZIEN, or golden stream, a considerable river or Persia, which is the natural boundary between the provinces of Irak and Azerbijan. According to Rennell, it is the Gozan of the Scripture, and has its source eight or nine miles to the north-west of Sennah in Kurdistan. It runs along the north-west frontier of Irak, and passes under the Kafatan Koh, or mountain of tigers, when it is met a few miles to the east of Meanna by the Karanku, •which takes its rise to the westward of that town, in the mountains of Sahund. These two rivers combined force a passage through the great range of the Caucasus, and during their course form a junction with the Shahrood, a river formed by two streams, one of which comes from the vicinity of Cazween, and the other from the mountain of Elburz, behind Teheran. The collective waters, under the designation of Sifeed Rood, or White River, so named from the foam occasioned by the rapidity of its current, flows in a meandering course through Ghilan to the Caspian Sea.
