KAIRWAN, a city of Africa, in the province of Tunis, the first seat of Saracenic empire in Barbary, and still ranking second only to Tunis in trade and population. It is a walled town, situated in a barren sandy plain, and dependent for its supply of water upon a capacious reservoir, filled by the rains, and a pond which becomes nearly dry in summer, when it exhales a noxious effluvium. The situation is undoubtedly ill chosen, yet it appears to occupy an ancient site, and it derives importance from its situation. Shaw,inhis Travels, gives the following account of it. “We have at Kairwan several fragments of ancient architecture; and the great mosque, which is accounted to be the most magnificent, as well as the most sacred, in Barbary, is supported by an almost incredible number of pillars. The inhabitants told me (for a Christian is not permitted in Barbary to enter the mosques) that there are no fewer than five hundred. Yet among the great variety of columns, and other ancient materials, that were employed in this large and beautiful structure, I could not be informed of one single inscription.” The name which it bears seems to be the same with caravan, and might therefore originally designate the place where the Arabs had their principal station in subduing this portion of Africa. It was founded by Hucba or Akbar, in the fiftieth year of the hejira, “under the modest title,” says Gibbon, “of the station of a caravan.” The population is said to amount to above 50,000.
