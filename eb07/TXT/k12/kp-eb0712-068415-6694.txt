KEEPER of the Great Seal, is a lord by his office, and styled Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of Great Britain. He is always one of the privy council. All grants, charters, and commissions of the king under the great seal pass through the hands of the lord keeper.

Keeper of the Privy Seal is also a lord by his office, and through his hands all grants, pardons, and* the like, pass before they come to the great seal; and even some things go through his hands which do not pass the great seal at all. This officer is also one of the privy council, yet was anciently called clerk of the privy seal.
