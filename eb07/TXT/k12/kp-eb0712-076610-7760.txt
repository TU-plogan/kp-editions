KUTUBDEA, an island in the bay of Bengal, thirteen miles in length by four in breadth, adjacent to the district of Chittagong, being separated from it by a narrow strait two miles broad, into which a vessel, in case of distress, may safely run. In its vicinity are some valuable oysterbeds: the oysters are of an excellent quality, and are sent for sale to the Europeans at Dacca and Calcutta.
