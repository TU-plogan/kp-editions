KANGRAH, ealledalso Catochin, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Lahore. It is bounded on the north and north-west by Hurreepoor, on the east by Chambay, on the south by Calour, and on the west by the Punjab, being situated to the south-west of the - Himalaya Mountains, between the Beyah and the Rauvy Rivers. The country is covered with wood. The fortress of Kangrah, which is situated in the northern part of the province, has long been celebrated. It was taken, a. d. 1010, by the famous Mahmoud of Ghizni, who plundered it of immense riches. It was retaken by the rajah of Delhi in 1043; and afterwards by the Emperor Akbar, after a very long siege, who conferred it on one of his officers, with the adjoining district. From him the present possessors of the lands boast their descent. It is situated on the top of a steep mountain, is well supplied with water, and contains ample space for raising supplies to feed a numerous garrison. Like all the other hill-forts in India, it is very unhealthy. Long. 75. 50. E. Lat. 32. 20. N.
