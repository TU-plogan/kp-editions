KIDDLE, or Kidel (Kidellus'),' a dam or weir in a river, with a narrow cut in it, for the laying of pots or other engines to catch fish. The word is ancient, for in Magna Charta (cap. 24) we read Omnes kidelli deponantur per Thamesiam et Medweyam, et per totam Angliam, nisi per costeram maris; and, by King John’s charter, power was granted to the city of London de kidellis amovendis per Thamesiam et Medweyam. A survey was ordered to be made of the weirs, mills, stanks, and kiddles, in the great rivers of England, by 1 Hen, IV. Fishermen corruptly call these dams kettles; and they are much used in Wales and on the sea-coasts of Kent.
