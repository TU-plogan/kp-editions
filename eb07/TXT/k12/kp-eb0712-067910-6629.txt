KARAKALPACS, a people of Tartary, who inhabit that tract of country which lies to the east of the Aral, and to the north of the Sihon or Jaxartes. They profess the Mahommedan faith, and are chiefly employed in agriculture, the soil of the country possessing a considerable degree of fertility. The country is under the dominion of khans; but the Seits, the supposed descendants of Mahommed, receive more respect than their princes. The Russians protect them against the incursions of their neigh·· hours the Kirghises.
