KINSALE, a town of Ireland, in the county of Cork, is situated on a bay at the mouth of the river Bandon, which forms a fine harbour called the harbour of Kinsale. The town, being built upon the side of a hill, presents a fine prospect; but, on entering it, the streets are found to be narrow, and the communications difficult, from the steepness of its declivities. It was much more frequented than Cork by the early English monarchs, who bestowed on the place extensive privileges, and viewed it as the key of southern Ireland. It has now, however, sunk under the superior importance of its neighbour. Its port is comparatively little frequented, except as a watering place; but a considerable fishing trade is carried on. Kinsale underwent two sieges, one in the time of Elizabeth, and another in that of William. James II. also landed here on his arrival to recover his throne. The town gives the title of baron to the head of the De Courcy family, who enjoys the singular right of appearing covered in the presence of royalty. The population amounts to 7688.
