KANOGE, a town and district of Hindustan, in the province of Agra. The district extends akmg the east side [7:12:675] of the Ganges, and is generally of a sandy soil, though well cultivated. The town is of great antiquity and celebrity, about two miles distant from the Ganges, with which it communicates by a canal. It was in former times of much greater extent and magnificence; and, for an extent of about six miles, the small pieces of brick which are seen on the spot, and the occasional traces of building, mark out the site of the ancient capital of Hindustan. The town at present consists of but one street; there are no buildings of any consequence; and the brick walls, which appear of no great antiquity, are going rapidly to decay. The adjacent plain is covered with ruined temples and tombs, and everywhere broken images are seen lying under the trees. The most curious remains of antiquity are often found amongst the ruins, such as ancient coins, inscribed with Sanscrit characters, and sometimes with the figure of a Hindu deity on one side. Kanoge was the capital of a powerful empire which existed at the period of the Mahommedan invasion. It was conquered, though not permanently retained, by Mahmoud of Ghizni, a. d. 1018. The travelling distance from Agra is 217 miles; from Lucknow, seventy-five miles; from Delhi, 214; and from Calcutta, 719. Long. 79. 52. E. Lat. 27. 5. N.
