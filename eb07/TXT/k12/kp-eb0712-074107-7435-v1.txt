KISSING, by way of salutation, or as a token of respect, has been practised in all nations. The Roman emperors saluted their principal officers by a kiss. Kissing the mouth or the eyes was the usual compliment upon any promotion or happy event. Soldiers kissed the general’s hand when he quitted his office. Fathers, amongst the Romans, had so much delicacy, that they never embraced their wives in the presence of their daughters. Near relations were allowed to kiss their female kindred on the mouth. Slaves kissed their master’s hand, who used to hold it out to them for that purpose. Kissing was a customary ni ode of salutation amongst the Jews, as we may collect from the circumstance of Judas approaching his Master with a kiss. Relations used to kiss their kindred u hen dying, and when dead; when dying, out of a strange opinion that they would imbibe the departing soul; and when dead, by way of valedictory ceremony. They even kissed the corpse after it was conveyed to the pile, when it had been seven or eight days dead.
