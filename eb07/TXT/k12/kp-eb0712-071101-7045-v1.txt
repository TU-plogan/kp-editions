KILDA, St, or Kirta, a solitary isle in the Atlantic Ocean, belonging to the range of the Hebrides, but removed to a considerable distance from the main cluster. The nearest land to it is Harris, from which it is distant sixty miles in a west-south-west direction; and it is about one hundred and forty miles from the nearest point of the mainland of Scotland. It is about three miles long from east to west, and two miles from north to south, and consists of a lofty and uneven ridge, fenced round on all sides by one continued perpendicular mass of rock, of great height except at a part where is the bay or landing place, and even there the rocks have a considerable elevation. The surface of the island is rocky, rising into four eminences, the highest of which, called Conachan, is 1380 feet above the level of the sea. The general surface of the ground is a black loam, six or eight inches deep, and presents a nearly uniform, smooth, and green surface. Excepting some imperfect peat upon the highest point, the whole is covered by a thick turf of the finest and freshest verdure. The island contains three principal springs, one of which gives rise to a considerable stream. Excepting a small tract in the vicinity of the little village in which the inhabitants live, the whole island is in pasture. The soil would admit of cultivation to any extent, but the violence of the west winds limits the agriculture to the south-east declivity, where there is most shelter. This tract is held conjointly by all the village, on the system of run-rig, the ridges being interchanged after three years; and the work is performed by the spade and hand-plough. The produce consists chiefly of bear, which is considered as very fine. The oats are of very inferior quality, and are scantily cultivated; nor arc potatoes raised to nearly the extent which is usual in Highland farming. A few horses are kept, together with some goats; but the pasture is chiefly occupied by sheep and black cattle. The breed of the former is Norwegian, and the wool which these animals produce is both thin and coarse. The cattle are small, and both the ewes and cow’s are milked. The cheese, which is made from a mixture of these milks, is much esteemed. This article, along with wool and feathers, constitutes the exports of the island. The St Kilda style of husbandry is somewhat primitive and peculiar to the island. The soil is rendered extremely fertile by the laborious industry of the inhabitants, who manure it with great care. The inhabitants are all congregated in a village about a quarter of a mile from the bay on the south-east. It consists of two rows of houses, with a pavement in the middle; and the habitations, like those of oriental countries, are nearly flat in the roof, in order to avoid injury from the storms which sweep over the island. The walls of the cottages are built of coarse free-stone, without lime or mortar, but consolidated by alternate layers of turf. All the houses arc divided into two apartments, the interior one being for the family, and the other, nearest the door, being reserved for sheltering the cattle during winter. From their insulated situation, it is probable that the inhabitants of St Kilda have maintained the same manners, customs, and general style of life, for centuries. Previously to the reformation, there appears to have been three religious buildings on the island; but after that event took place, the inhabitants continued for ages unsolaced by the blessings of religion, being only connected with the parish of South Uist by name. These disadvantages are now obviated by the establishment of a missionary and a schoolmaster, under the patronage of the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. The people live much upon the wild sea-fowl with which the precipices abound; and at certain seasons the whole sea is covered, and the very atmosphere is darkened, with feathered animals. Upwards of 20,000 solan geese are annually consumed by the natives, besides an immense number of eggs. St Kilda contains about twenty families, who, remote from the bustle of the busy world, and the luxuries of polished society, pass an easy, and even a comfortable life.
