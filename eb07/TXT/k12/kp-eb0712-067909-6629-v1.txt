KARAK, an island in the Persian Gulf, the greater part of which is rocky; but the eastern part, being somewhat lower than the others, is capable of being cultivated. It was formerly under the Dutch, when it contained from 2000 to 3000 inhabitants. At present it does not contain above 300 or 400. It affords a safe anchorage at all seasons, but more particularly during the severe gales which blow from the north-west, and are the prevailing winds in this sea. In the year 1808, Sir John Malcolm recommended to the British government to occupy this island, as a defensive position, and a good station for trade, which might be securely carried on with the neighbouring coasts of Persia and Arabia. The Persians are in possession of this island at present. A good supply of water may be procured here, and also the best pilots for Bassorah. Lat. 29. 14. N.
