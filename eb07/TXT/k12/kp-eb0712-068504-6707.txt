KEIGHLEY, a market-town and parish in the west riding of the county of York. It is situated in a romantic spot in a valley, through which the river Aire runs, and near the canal which connects the two great trading towns of Leeds and Liverpool. It has thus an easy intercourse with every part of the kingdom, and a great increase of its trade and population has hence arisen. There are in it several large establishments for making woollen, linen, and cotton goods. The church is a large and handsome building, and it has several chapels for the different descriptions of dissenters. There is a well-supplied market on Wednesday. The population amounted in 1801 to 5745, in 1811 to 6864, in 1821 to 9223, and in 1831 to 11,176.
