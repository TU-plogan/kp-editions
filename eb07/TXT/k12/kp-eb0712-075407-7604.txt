KOKAUN, an independent state of Asia, which is se [7:12:755] parated from Buckliaria on the east by steep and inaccessible mountains; on the south it has the mountainous tract which divides it from Bnduckshang and Chitral; on the south-west it is confined by Kurratageen; on the east and north-east by the mountains inhabited by Kirgeesh and Kuzaks, tributary to China; on the north-west by the district of Tashkund, lately reduced under its authority, with mountains and deserts. This kingdom is divided into thirteen districts, all of which contain towns more or less considerable. The river Sihoon or Jaxartes, which takes its rise about four days’ journey south-east of Kokaun, divides the country into two parts. The territory of Kokaun is 200 miles in length by about 150 miles in breadth. The general description of the country is mountainous, divided by valleys and plains, of which those near the river Sihoon and its tributary streams are rich and fertile, and those more removed comparatively arid and sterile. Many villages, and a good deal of cultivated ground, are scattered over its surface; and many places afford rich pasture for the flocks and herds of the tribes who wander over it. The inhabitants are chiefly Uzbecks, who are shepherds, and a few Tanjeks, who live in villages, and are described by Fraser^[1. Narrative of a Journey into Khorassan, Appendix, p. 108. ] as a stout, fat, fair, and high complexioned people, extremely quiet, good humoured, merry, and hospitable. They are fond of active pursuits, such as riding, hunting, hawking, and are more addicted to intemperance. There are many other wandering tribes in Kirgeesh, &c. scattered over the face of the country. The winter is severe, though there is but little snow. The summer is very hot and parching, and there is not much rain till towards the end of autumn. They produce a great deal of silk in the country, which is manufactured into various fabrics. Mulberry trees are planted round all the fields, and cotton is also much cultivated. Willows, poplars, cypresses, with all kinds of fruits known in Europe, are common here. Sycamores are rare, but the hills are covered with lofty pines, poplars, almond, walnut, and pistachio trees. The name of the capital is Kokaun, which was formerly a petty village; but, by becoming the seat of government, it has increased so much that it now contains more than 50,000 houses. It has no wall, and water has been introduced into most of the streets from the river Jaxartes, upon the bank of which it is situated. The women of the towns and villages are concealed, like those in other Mahommedan states, and wear veils from head to foot. A journey was undertaken in 1813 by Μ. Nazaroff, a Russian, who travelled with the tracking caravans, and, crossing the deserts, penetrated as far as Kokaun or Khokand, where he was exposed to danger from the jealousy of the chiefs, and the fanatical hatred of the people. He was at last permitted to return to his own country.
