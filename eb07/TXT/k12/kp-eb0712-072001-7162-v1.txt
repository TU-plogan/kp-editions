KILWINNING, an ancient, and now a considerable and thriving town of Scotland, in the county of Ayr. It is situated on a rising ground about two miles from the sea, three miles north-north-west of Irvine, and three north-east of Saltcoats. Kilwinning consists chiefly of one main street, with several small lanes or alleys, together with a few rows of modern bouses. It depends principally on the weaving and manufacture of gauzes, muslins, and the like, for the Glasgow and Paisley markets. The parish church stands amongst the few remaining fragments of the once splendid abbey from which the town is supposed to have taken its origin. There are, besides, two dissenting meeting-houses. The population may amount to about 1500.
