KNOUT, the name of a punishment inflicted in Russia, with a kind of whip called knout, and made of a long strap of leather prepared for this purpose. With this whip the executioners dexterously carry off a slip of skin from the neck to the bottom of the back, laid bare to the waist, and, repeating their blows, in a little while rend away all the skin of the back in parallel stripes. In the common knout the criminal receives the lashes suspended on the back of one of the executioners; but in the great knout the criminal is raised into the air by means of a pulley fixed to the gallows, and a cord fastened to the two wrists tied together; a piece of wood is placed between his two legs also tied together; and another of a crucial form under his breast. Sometimes his hands are tied behind his back; and when he is pulled up in this position his shoulders are dislocated. The executioners can make this punishment more or less severe; and, it is said, are so dexterous, that when a criminal is condemned to die, they can make him expire at pleasure, either by one or several lashes.
