KANGAROO Island is situated on the south coast of Holland. It was discovered by Captain Flinders, and was so called from the great number of kangaroos found on the island, which were so tame that they suffered themselves to be knocked down with spikes. The soil, as far as it was examined by Captain Flinders, appeared to be fertile, and the country was covered with a thick wood. Long, of Kangaroo Head, 137. 58. E. Lat. 35. 43. S.
