KHANDESH, a province of Hindustan, in the Deccan, situated between the 21st and 23d degrees of north latitude. To the north it is bounded by the Nerbuddah, which separates it from Malwah; to the south by Aurangabad and Berar; on the east by Gundwana and Berar; and on the west by Gujerat. Its limits have never been accurately defined, though they may be estimated at 210 miles in length by eighty in average breadth. Khandesh was one of the small soubahs formed during the reign of Akbar, from conquests made south of the Nerbuddah. The modern subdivisions are, 1. Gaulna; 2. Khandesh proper; 3. Meiwar; 4. Bejagur; 5. Pattnemaur; 6. Hindia. This province is remarkably strong by nature, containing, within one day’s march, nearly twenty fortresses, all in sight in different directions. The country is well watered. The chief rivers are, the Nerbuddah, Tuptee, and other tributary streams; the principal towns, Boorhanpoor, Aseorghur, Hindia, Nundoorbar, and Gaulna. The surface of the province is very irregular, though it is not mountainous. The ridge of the western Ghauts extends along the Tuptee, from which passes descend into the lower country. This river has deep and steep banks, and the adjacent country is curiously intersected with ravines from thirty to forty feet deep, and sometimes winding along for a distance of several miles. As the road frequently leads through these chasms, which are remarkably close and hot, it is not uncommon to see an army on its march through the country disappear in these deep valleys, and afterwards emerge half suffocated with heat and covered with dust. This country was once flourishing and populous; but at present, owing to the devastations of different plundering tribes, such as the Bheels, Pindarrics, and Arabs, joined to the oppressions of its Mahratta rulers, it is now desolate and overgrown with jungle, the towns are in ruins, the villa; ges have been destroyed, and the soil, though fertile and well watered, lies neglected. The population is estimated at two millions, five sixths of whom are Hindus.

Khandesh was governed in the beginning of the fifteenth century by independent sovereigns, who, claiming descent from the Khalif Omar, resided at Aseerghur; but, towards the close of the century, it was subdued, and annexed to the Mogul empire. Since the decline of the Mahratta power, the greater part of the province of Khandesh was taken possession of by Arab colonists, whose soldierlike qualities gave them great influence in India. In 1818 the whole of Éĭolkar’s territories in India were ceded to the British, to whose dominion the Arab colonists evinced a decided aversion; and as it was resolved to re-transport them to their own country, they determined to resist to the last extremity. The last body of these brave adventurers surrendered in December 1818; but many of the Bheel chiefs, trusting to their mountainous and jungly recesses, continued refractory. They were dislodged from many of their retreats by the vigilance of British officers, who were for a long time engaged in this harassing warfare. The province was formerly famous for the manufacture of cotton cloths called baftahs.
