KENDAL, a market-town of the county of Westmoreland, in the ward of the same name, 260 miles from London. It is situated on the river Ken, in a pleasant valley, and, by inland navigation, comes into connection with the sea, and with the rivers Morrey, Dee, Ribble, Ouse, Trent, Severn, Humber, Thames, and Avon. There is much industry applied to manufactures, the principal of which are the inferior kinds of woollen cloths and stuffs. It is a corporate town, under a mayor, twelve aidermen, and twenty-four capital burgesses, but returns no members to parliament. There are guilds or companies for several branches of trade, which now scarcely exist. The church is a large Gothic building, and there are chapels for the various denominations of Protestant dissenters, and for Roman Catholics. It is one of those towns which have been much increased and improved of late years. The population amounted in 1801 to 6892,in 1811 to 7505, in 1821 to 8984, and in 1831 to 10,015.
