KAARTA, one of the many kingdoms into which the western part of Africa is divided, and of which little or nothing is known, excepting that it is of considerable extent, but, from the arenaceous nature of the soil, very scanty in all vegetable productions, with the exception of the lotus. The capital is called Kemmoo; but the king has, besides, two strong fortresses, Joko and Gedingooma, to which he can flee for security when his dominions are invaded by the forces of the neighbouring states. Kasson, formerly an independent country, is now incorporated with Kaarta. It is about fifty miles from north to south, and nearly the same from east to west; but, though small, it is well peopled, and is a beautiful and fertile country. Kasson is likewise considered as rich in gold, silver, and coffee. The capital is called Kooniakary. The commerce of the states in this quarter consists in exchanging gold, ivory, and slaves, for European goods.
