KARNATA, an ancient Hindu geographical division, which comprehended all the high table-land in the south of India, situated above the Ghauts. The name has been transferred to the adjacent provinces on the sea-coasts of India, Carnatic, and Canara. In the remote periods of Hindu history, Karnata existed as a powerful empire, which comprehended great part of the south of India.
