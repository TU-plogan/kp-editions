KURZOLA, an island in the Adriatic Sea, a portion of the Austrian province of Dalmatia. The extent is about 220 square miles. It is well wooded, and affords good ship timber. It yields good wine, and some corn, but is deficient in water. The inhabitants are 6440, of whom 1800 live in the fortified capital of the same name, in a narrow strait on the east end of the island.
