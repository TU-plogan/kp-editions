KOLLBERG, a city of Prussia, in the province of Pomerania, and the circle of Koslin. It is on the river Persante, about one mile from its entrance into the Baltic. It has some foreign trade, and considerable establishments for building ships; and near to it are some extensive saltworks, belonging to the crown. It contains four churches, 780 houses, and 7950 civil inhabitants, besides a garrison. It is chiefly remarkable for the strength of its position, and for its fortifications. It stands on a hill surrounded with morasses; and the broad ditches can be with ease filled with water from the river Persante. A strong citadel commands the city and the entrance from the sea, and it has several strong out-works.

Irom its importance as a landing-place, it has been frequently attacked. The Russians besieged it in 1758, but were repulsed. In 1760, it was attacked by a combined fleet or Russian and Swedish ships and 15,000 land troops, but it was relieved by General Werner. Again, in the next year, it was attacked by the Russian general Romanzoff, with fifty-five ships of war and a powerful land force. It was ably defended during four months, and the Russians lost more than 3000 men in the trenches; but at length, from want of provisions, it capitulated on the 16th December.

The most distinguished defence was that in 1807, when most of the other strong places in Prussia had surrendered to the invading armies of Bonaparte. It was attacked by 18,000 men, commanded by Loisson, and defended by 6000 Prussians, including volunteer inhabitants. After a siege with constant bombarding, in which the greater part of the city was destroyed, it surrendered, having lost 1900 men. General Gniseneau, who commanded on this occasion, first displayed his high military talents. Long. 15. 32. N. Lat. 54. âˆ•. E. b
