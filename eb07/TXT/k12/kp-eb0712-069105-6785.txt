KENNERI, a collection of remarkable caverns excavated in the rocky hills of the island of Salsette, near to Bombay, one of which had been fitted up by the Portuguese as a church, and they consequently thought it their duty to deface all the most pagan-looking sculptures. The fine teak ribs for supporting the roof are almost gone, and the porticois not so elegant as that at Carli. On the sides are two gigantic erect figures, each twenty-five feet in height, with their hands close to their bodies, which resembled the figures of Buddha seen at Ceylon. On each side of the great cave are smaller ones, apparently unfinished. The origin of these singular excavations is lost in obscurity. There is not even the slightest gleam of tradition to guide the antiquarian in his researches into these curious memorials of Hindu or Buddha superstition; and in what age of the world, or by what people, they have been completed, is a question now likely to remain for ever unknown.
