KIUTAIAH, a large city of Asia Minor, and capital of Anatolia. It is situated at the foot and partly up the sides of a cluster of mountains, bounded by a fertile plain on the south. It covers a considerable extent of ground. The houses are large and well furnished, and it contains handsome fountains conveyed from the hills by aqueducts. It is not so populous as it was formerly, but it still contains between 50,000 and 60,000 inhabitants, of which number 10,000 are Armenians, and 5000 Greeks. It contains thirty public baths, fifty mosques, four Armenian and one Greek church, and twenty caravanserais. It occupies the position of the ancient Cotyaeúm, on the site of which there are still the ruins of a castle. Long. 29. 52. E. Lat. 39. 25. N.
