ROMNEY, NEW, a town in the county of Kent, in the Lathe of Sheepway, seventy-two miles from London. It was once a place of much more importance than it is at present. It is surrounded with rich but unhealthy marshes, and is defended against the sea by a strong dyke, called Dunchurch Wall, on which is a good carriage road over the marshes. The population was in 1801, 755; in 1811, 841; in 1821, 962, and in 1831,983.
