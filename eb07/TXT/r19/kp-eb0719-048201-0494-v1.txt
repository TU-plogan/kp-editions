ROSLIN or Rosslyn, a village in the county of Mid-Lothian, Scotland, about seven miles south from Edinburgh, celebrated for the picturesque ruins of its castle, the architectural grace of its chapel, and the sequestered but variegated scenery of the vale in which they are placed. Roslin was formerly a place of some note, being next to Edinburgh and Haddington in importance, and was made a burgh of barony by James II. of Scotland, and privileged by holding fairs and markets. The sole dependence of the inhabitants at the present time is on agriculture and the bleaching of linen. The castle is situated on a peninsular rock, round which the South Esk river pursues its course; and is connected with the adjacent ground by an old narrow bridge thrown over a deep chasm cut in the solid rock. The original castle was most likely erected in the eleventh century. It must have been increased from time to time in after years, as we learn that when the Earls of St Clair were in their glory, the castle was not only a massive and extensive building, but characterized by great splendour in its internal decorations. All that now remain are some high fragments of the walls and battlements, and a triple tier of vaults. Amidst the ruins, and partly above these vaults, was built a more modern house, bearing the date of 1622, which is still inhabited.

The chapel was founded in the year 1446, by William St Clair, prince of Orkney and lord of Rosslyn, for a provost, six prebendaries, and two choristers, and consecrated to St Matthew. Tradition states that the design of the building, which was intended for a large collegiate church, was drawn at Rome; and that the prince employed the best workmen that could be procured, both from the Continent and at home, in the erection. The chapel, which is merely the chancel and part of the transept of the original design, is unique in style, and cannot be said to belong to any order of architecture. It however combines the solidity of the Norman with the elegance and minute profusion of ornament characteristic of the latest species of the Tudor age. The interior is sixty-eight feet in length, thirty-four feet in breadth, and forty feet in height. It is divided into a centre and aisles, by two ranges of clustered pillars, eight feet in height, adorned with sculptured foliage and figures of human beings and animals, of the most exquisite workmanship. The pillars are so arranged that their ceilings are thrown into one, so as to form a continued arch along the centre of the building. One pillar, conspicuous for its elaborate decorations, is called the “prentice pillar,” from its having been sculptured by an apprentice, who is said to have lost his life from having thus excited the professional jealousy of his master. At the reformation in 1688 this chapel was, like many other sacred edifices of taste, defaced by a mob from Edinburgh; but it was repaired in the following century by General St Clair. The present Earl of Rosslyn is judiciously, and with great taste, restoring this venerable structure to its original state. Beneath this chapel lie the barons of Roslin, all of whom were, till the time of James VII., buried in armour. Near tllis was fought, in February 1302, the three celebrated battles of Roslin, where the Scots, under the regent Sir John Cornyn, and Sir Simon Frazer, attacked and defeated three divisions of the English army in one day.
