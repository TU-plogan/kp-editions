RAKE is a well-known instrument with teeth, by which the ground is divided. See Agriculture .

Rake of a Ship is all that part of her hull which hangs over both ends of her keel. That which is before is called the fore-rake or rake forward, and that part which is at the setting on of the stem-post is called the rake-aft or afterward.
