ROSS a market-town of the county of Hereford, in the hundred of Greytree, 115 miles from London. It is finely situated on a hill rising from the river Wye. Its chief trade is in the sale of cider. Pope has immortalized the place by his laudatory description of one of its residents, John [7:19:483]Kyrle, who died in 1724, having spent his income on works of utility and of beneficence. The market is held on Thursday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2347, in 1811 to 2261, in 1821 to 2962, and in 1831 to 3078.

Ross, or Ross Carbery, a town in the county of Cork, Munster, Ireland, is situated on an eminence, at the head of a narrow creek in Ross Bay. It is a place of great antiquity. The town is laid out on a regular plan, and consists of a square, from the four corners of which diverge so many streets. It has an ancient cathedral, embosomed in trees, which, with the wooded banks of the bay, forms a remarkably beautiful feature in the appearance of the town. The harbour is spacious, but of little use, in consequence of being blocked up by the sand. The population amounted in 1831 to 1522.
