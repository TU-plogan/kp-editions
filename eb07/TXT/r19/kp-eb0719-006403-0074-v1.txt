RAMAGIRY a town and fortress of the south of India, and province of Mysore. The fort is situated upon a rock, and is of considerable strength, although it surrendered to the British in 1791 without any resistance. The country in the vicinity is very wild, being overrun with woods, deep jungle, and dreadfully infested with tigers. There is but little cultivation, the peasants being chiefly employed in the breeding of cattle. In this hilly tract there is a very mild race of men, who subsist on game, wild roots, herbs and fruits, and a little grain, which they purchase from the farmers in exchange for drugs, honey, and wax. It is fifty-miles north-east from Seringapatam. Long. 77. 33. E. Lat. 12. 44. N.
