RENTERING in the manufactories, the same with fine drawing. It consists in sewing two pieces of cloth edge to edge, without doubling them, so that the seam scarcely appears; and hence it is denominated fine drawing. It is a French word meaning the same thing, and is derived from the Latin retrahere, compounded of re, in, and trahere, because the seam is drawn in or covered.

Rentering, in tapestry, is the working new warp into a piece of damaged tapestry, whether eaten by the rats or otherwise destroyed, and on this warp restoring the ancient pattern or design. The warp must be of woollen, not linen. Amongst the titles of the French tapestry-makers is included that of renterers. Fine drawing is particularly used for a rent or hole, which happens in dressing or preparing a piece of cloth artfully sewed up or mended with silk. All fine drawings are reckoned defects or blemishes, and should be allowed for in the price of the piece.
