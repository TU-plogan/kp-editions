REGNARD John Fbancis, one of the best French comic writers after Moli√®re, was born at Paris in the year 1647. He had scarcely finished his studies, when an ardent passion for travelling led him to traverse the greater part of Europe. Having settled in his own country, he was made a treasurer of France, and lieutenant of the waters and forests. He wrote a great many comedies; and, though naturally of a lively genius, died of chagrin in the fifty-second year of his age. His works, consisting of comedies and travels, were printed at Rouen, in 1732, in five vols. 12mo.
