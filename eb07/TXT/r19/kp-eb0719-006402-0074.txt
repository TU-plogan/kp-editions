RAMA or Ramla, a considerable town of Palestine, situated in one of the most fertile and extensive districts of the Holy Land; though at the time when Dr Clarke visited the country it was almost deserted, in consequence of the ravages of the plague. It seems doubtful, however, whether this was the ancient city described in Scripture. Some ascribe its origin to the Moslems; yet this can scarcely have been the case, as it is distinctly mentioned by St Jerome. Rama was a splendid city, well fortified, exceedingly populous, adorned with stately buildings, and abounding in all the luxuries of the East, during the time of the Crusaders. It was one of the first cities that fell into the hands of the Crusaders. In its neighbourhood many ancient ruins are still to be seen. It is twenty-five miles west-north-west from Jerusalem.
