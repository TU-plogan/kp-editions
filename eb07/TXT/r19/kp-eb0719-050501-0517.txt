ROTHBURY a small market-town in the county of Northumberland, pleasantly situated on the northern side of the river Coquet, over which there is a handsome stone bridge. The town consists of three wide and airy streets; and as the situation, from being screened by lofty hills from the north and east winds, is favourable to invalids, and the Coquet is well adapted for trout-fishing, many persons resort thither during the summer months, for health and amusement. The rectory is one of the richest livings in the county. The church is an ancient structure. The population in 1831 amounted to 1014.
