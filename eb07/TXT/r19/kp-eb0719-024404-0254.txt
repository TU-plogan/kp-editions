RING an ornament of gold and silver, of a circular figure, and usually worn on the finger. The antiquity of rings is known from Scripture and profane authors. Judah left his ring or signet with Tamar. When Pharaoh committed the government of all Egypt to Joseph, he took his ring from his finger, and gave it to Joseph. After the victory which the Israelites obtained over the Midianites, they offered to the Lord the rings, the bracelets, and the golden necklaces, and the ear-rings, that they had taken from the enemy. The Israelitish women wore rings, not only on their fingers, but also in their nostrils and their ears. St James distinguishes a man of wealth and dignity by the ring of gold that he wore on his finger. At the return of the prodigal son, his father orders him to be dressed in a new suit of clothes, and to have a ring put upon his finger. The ring was used chiefly to seal with. The patents and orders of princes were sealed with their rings or signets; and it was this that secured to them their authority and respect-The Episcopal Ring, which makes a part of the pontifical apparatus, and is esteemed a pledge of the spiritual marriage between the bishop and his church, was used at a remote period. The fourth council of Toledo, held in 633, appoints that a bishop condemned by one council, and found afterwards innocent by a second, shall be restored, by giving him the ring, staff, &c. From bishops, the custom of the ring has passed to cardinals, who are to pay a very great sum pro jure annuli cardinalita.
