RONCESVALLES a valley in Spain, in the province ofNavarne, and district ofSanguessa. It stands at the foot of the Pyrenees, and is the largest valley in the province, but covered with wood. The town of the name is small, but on the great road from France to Madrid, having a church, an Augustin monastery, and an hospital. It has become a place of celebrity from the warlike deeds which the spot has witnessed, both by the defeat of Roland and the twelve peers of France at a remote period, and by the operations under the Duke of Wellington and Marshal Soult.
