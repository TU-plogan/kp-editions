RIASAN a government of Russia, so called from the ancient city of that name. It extends in north latitude from 53. 1. to 55. 4L, and in east longitude from 38. 10. to 4L 14., and is 13,486 square miles. It contains twelve cities or towns, and 833 parishes or communes, with 1,250,000 inhabitants, a very great proportion of whom are in a state of vassalage. The district is an extensive plain watered by the rivers Don, Oka, Osetr, and Prona, and near to them it is highly fertile. In the other parts the soil is as productive as can well be expected in a climate so severe. The land is best in the southern division of the province, but the whole yields more com than is required for domestic consumption. A surplus for exportation is produced of grain, and brandy made from it, of salted meat, of leather, wax, honey, and hops. The forests afford a large supply of timber. The manufactures are confined to clothing, chiefly linen, and to iron implements. The exports proceed through the Oka to the river Wolga. The capital is the city of the same name on the river Trubusch, and is the seat of a bishop. It contains twenty churches, an ecclesiastical seminary, and one for the higher classes, with 760 dwellings, and 5000 inhabitants, chiefly employed in making linens. It is 617 miles from Petersburg. Long. 39.4.58. E. Lat. 54.58.6. N.
