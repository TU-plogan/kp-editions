ROSETO a small city of Italy, of the province of Prin-cipato Ulteriore, and of the kingdom of Naples. It was long celebrated from possessing in its church an image of the Virgin Mary, brought there, according to a legend, in a miraculous manner, which induced many pilgrims from all parts of Europe to resort to it for purposes of devotion, and to present very valuable offerings. It was taken and plundered by the French, and the venerated image having been obtained by a private individual, has been restored to its former place; but the number of votaries has much diminished. The inhabitants amount to about 3000, who subsist principally in making holy trinkets, and from supplying lodging and provisions to the pilgrims who still resort to it.
