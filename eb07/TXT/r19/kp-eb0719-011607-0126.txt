REMONSTRANTS in Ecclesiastical History, a title which was given to the Arminians in consequence of the Remonstrance made by them in the year 1610, to the states of Holland, against the sentence of the synod of Dordrect, which pronounced them heretics. The chief leaders of the Remonstrants were Episcopius and Grotius; and their principles were first openly countenanced in England by Archbishop Laud. In opposition to the representation or remonstrance of the Arminians, the Dutch Calvinists presented an address, which was called a counter-remonstrance; and hence they obtained the denomination of Counter-Remonstrants. A great deal of keen controversy was agitated in this affair by these rival sects.
