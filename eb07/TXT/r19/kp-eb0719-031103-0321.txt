ROGA in Antiquity, a present which the emperors made to the senators, magistrates, and even to the people; and the popes and patriarchs to their clergy. These rogae were distributed by the emperors on the first day of the year, on their birthday, or on the natalis dies of the cities; and by the popes and patriarchs in passion-week. Roga is also used for the common pay of the soldiers.
