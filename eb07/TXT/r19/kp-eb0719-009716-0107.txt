REGENT one who governs a kingdom during the minority or absence of the king.

Regent also signifies a professor of arts and sciences in a college, having pupils under his care; but it is generally restricted to the lower classes, as to rhetoric, logic, &c. those of philosophy being called professors. In the English universities it is applied to masters of arts under five years standing, and to doctors under two, as non-regent is to those above that standing.
