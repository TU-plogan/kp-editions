ROBERVALLIAN Lines, a name given to certain lines used for the transformation of figures, so called from Ro-

berval, the inventor of them.' These lines are the boundaries of lines infinitely extended in length, yet equal to other spaces which are terminated on all sides. It is observed by the Abbé Gallois, that the method of transforming figures which is explained at the end of Roberval's treatise of Indivisibles, was the same with that afterwards published by James Gregory in his Geometria Universalis, and also by Dr Barrow in his Lectiones Geornetricoe; and that it appears from Torricelli’s letter, that Roberval was the inventor of this method of transforming figures, by means of certain lines called by Torricelli, for that reason, Rοbervallian lines. The same author adds, that J. Gregory probably first learned this method at Padua in the year 1668; for the method was known in Italy in 1646, although the book was not published till 1692. David Gregory endeavoured to refute this account, in vindication of bis uncle James. His answer appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1694, and Gallois rejoined in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1703; so that it remains in a state of uncertainty to which of the two we are to ascribe the invention.
