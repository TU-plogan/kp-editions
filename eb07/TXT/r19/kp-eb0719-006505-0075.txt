RAMGUR an extensive district and town of Hindustan, in the province of Bahar. The district is situated about the 24th degree of north latitude, and is one of the most unproductive in India. Its boundaries on the north are the district of Bahar proper; on the south, Nagpoor and Pachete; on the east, Monghir and Pachete; and on the west, Palamow. Other limits, however, are assigned to the modern district, which comprehends a much greater space, and may be considered as belonging to the ancient province of Gund-wana. A great part of the territory is mountainous, the soil is of rock, and a considerable portion of it is overrun with impenetrable woods. The chief produce is a coarse rice. All the hills abound with iron, which is fused by the natives in large quantities, and sold. The chief rivers are the Dummoodah and the Burrahkur; and the principal towns are Ramgur, Chittra, and Muckundgunge. Agreat part of the population consists of Hindus, though it was conquered by the Mahommedans in the middle of the sixteenth century. The capital, of the same name, is situated on the northern bank of the Dummoodah river, and formerly possessed a strong fortress. It is 910 miles north-west from Calcutta. Long. 84. 35. E.
