REPENTANCE in general, means sorrow for anything past. In theology it means such a sorrow for sin as produces a change of life, or such a conviction of the evil and danger of a sinful course as is sufficient to produce shame and sorrow in the review of it, and effectual resolutions of amendment.
[7:19:124]
