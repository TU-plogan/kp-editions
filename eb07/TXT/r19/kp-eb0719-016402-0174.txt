REQUENA a city of Spain, in the province of Cuen√ßa, and the capital of a district of the same name. It stands on a height in a valley watered by the river Magro, which is fertile as regards meadows, and produces great quantities of rich fruits. The city contains three churches, seven monasteries, and 6500 inhabitants, who make silk goods from the worms fed on the mulberries growing in the vicinity.
