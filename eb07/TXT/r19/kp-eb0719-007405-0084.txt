RATAFIA a fine spirituous liquor, prepared from the kernels and other parts of several kinds of fruits, particularly cherries and apricos. Ratafia of cherries is prepared by bruising the cherries, and putting them into a vessel wherein brandy has long been kept; then adding to them the kernels of cherries, with strawberries, sugar, cinnamon, white pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and to twenty pounds of cherries ten quarts of brandy. The vessel is left open ten or twelve days, and then stopped close for two months before it be tapped. Ratafia of apricos is prepared in two ways, namely, either by boiling the apricos in white wine, adding to the liquor an equal quantity of brandy, with sugar, cinnamon, mace, and the kernels of apricos, infusing the whole for eight or ten days, then straining the liquor, and putting it up for use; or by infusing the apricos, cut in pieces, in brandy, for a day or two, passing it through a straining bag, and then putting in the usual ingredients.
