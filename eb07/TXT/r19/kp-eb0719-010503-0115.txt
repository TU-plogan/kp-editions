REICHENBACH one of the three provincial governments of Prussia, into which the province of Silesia is divided. It is composed of the southern part of the ancient lower Silesia, with the addition of the principality of Munsterberg and the county of Glatz. It is bounded on the north-east by Breslau, on the north-west by Leignitz, on the south-east by Oppeln and the Austrian province of Moravia, and on the south-west by Bohemia. In extent it is 2640 square miles, comprehending thirty-six cities and towns, and 905 villages, besides many hamlets. The population, according to the census of 1817, was 644,025, and had increased, at the enumeration of 1826, to 713,936, of which the Catholics and the Protestants were nearly equal in number. Divided into thirteen circles, it is the most densely peopled of any portion of the kingdom of Prussia, and the great district in which was carried on that large manufacture of linen for which Silesia was long celebrated. It is generally a hilly, and in some parts a mountainous district; and the soil, not being of great fertility, scarcely produces sufficient corn for the consumption of the inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, and stands on the river Peilau. It is surrounded with double walls and ditches, and contains two Catholic and three Lutheran churches, 460 houses, with 4350 inhabitants. It has considerable manufactories of linens and woollens, and some of cottons, besides several breweries and distilleries. Long. 16. 31. 7. E. Lat. 50. 59. 15. N.
