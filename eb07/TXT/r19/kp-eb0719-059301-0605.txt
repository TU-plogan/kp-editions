RYACOTTA a town and celebrated fortress of the south of India, added to the Baramuhl district by the Marquis Cornwallis, in virtue of a treaty he concluded with Tip-poo. The fort is very strong by nature, and it has been further fortified by art, as this place is the chief key to Karna-ta. The air is so temperate here, from the elevation of the ground, that even in the hot season the thermometer scarcely ever rises higher than 82Â° of Fahrenheit. Ryacotta was besieged in 1791 by Major Gowdie; and though it was of such strength, yet the garrison were intimidated by the spirited attacks of the besiegers, and surrendered, though amply supplied with guns, ammunition, and provision for its defence. It is ninety-eight miles east by north from Seringapatam. Long. 78. 1. E. Lat. 12. 33. N.
