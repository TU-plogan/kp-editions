ROUEN an arrondissement of the department of the Lower Seine, in France. It extends over 506 square miles, and comprehends fifteen cantons, divided into 155 communes, which, in 1836, contained 238,805 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, situated in a valley on the banks of the Seine, over which there is a bridge of boats leading to the suburb St Sever. The river Robec passes through a part of the city, and falls into the Seine, and in its progress gives power to several mills and other machinery. It is not a well-built town, having many large but antique houses, and others of wood, with narrow and crooked streets. It is the see of an archbishop, whose cathedral, as [7:19:506]well as the church of St Ouen, are noble specimens of Gothic architecture. There is an academy of arts and sciences, with a library of seventy thousand volumes, and institutions for various branches of education. It is the chief seat of the cotton manufacture, and hence has vastly increased since the peace in population and in wealth. There are many other goods made here, such as various kinds of thin stuffs, and other woollens, linen of all qualities, combs, vitriol, aquafortis, tin wares, and porcelain, besides refined sugar. The neighbourhood is celebrated for its apples and pears. It contains above 11,500 houses, and in 1836 the inhabitants amounted to 92,083. Long. 1. 0. 39. E. Lat. 49. 26. 27. N.
