RE-ANIMATION means the reviving or restoring to life those who are apparently dead. Sudden death is dreaded by every human being, and it is one of those evils against which the Church of England prays in her litany. Accidents, however, cannot always be prevented; but, after they have happened, it is often possible to prevent their effects. By the establishment of what has with great propriety been called the Humane Society, this has been abundantly proved; for, in the course of twelve years immediately after its institution, it was the means of saving the lives of 850 persons, who otherwise would in all human probability have been lost to the community. Since that period it has saved many more; and various persons, even in the most distant parts of the kingdom, have done the same by following the directions prescribed. To preserve one human being from premature death, we must consider as of the utmost consequence, both as citizens and Christians; and how much more the preservation of thousands? It appears from the writings of Mead, Winslow, Bruhier, Fothergill, Haller, Lecat, Tissot, Van Engelen, Gummer, and others, that they had prepared the way for institutions similar to the Humane Society; for in their works they have elucidated the principles on which such institutions proceed, and furnished directions for the practice they favour.
