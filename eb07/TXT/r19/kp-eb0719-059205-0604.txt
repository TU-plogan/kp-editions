RUYTER Michael Adrian, a distinguished naval officer, was born at Flushing, a town of Zealand, in the year 1607. He entered on a seafaring life when he was only eleven years old, and was first a cabin-boy. Whilst he advanced successively to the rank of mate, master, and captain, he acquitted himself with ability and honour in all these employments. He repulsed the Irish, who attempted to take [7:19:593]Dublin out of the hands of the English; he made eight voyages to the West Indies, and ten to Brazil; he was then promoted to the rank of rear-admiral, and sent to assist the Portuguese against the Spaniards. When the enemy came in sight, he advanced boldly to meet them, and gave such unquestionable proofs of valour as drew from the Portuguese monarch the warmest applause. His gallantry was still more conspicuous before Salee, a town of Barbary. With a single vessel he sailed through the roads of that place, in defiance of five Algerine corsairs who came to attack him.

In 1653 a squadron of seventy vessels was despatched against the English, under the command of Admiral Van Tromp. Ruyter, who accompanied the admiral in this expedition, seconded him with great skill and bravery in the three battles which the English so gloriously won. He was afterwards stationed in the Mediterranean, where he captured several Turkish vessels. In 1659 he received a commission to join the king of Denmark in his war with the Swedes; and he not only maintained his former reputation, but even raised it higher. As a reward of his services, the king of Denmark ennobled him and gave him a pension. In 1661 he run ashore a vessel belonging to Tunis, released forty Christian slaves, made a treaty with the Tunisians, and reduced the Algerine corsairs to submission. His country, as a testimony of her gratitude for such illustrious services, raised him to the rank of vice-admiral and commander in chief. To the latter dignity, the highest that could be conferred upon him, he was well entitled by the signal victory which he obtained over the combined fleets of France and Spain. This battle was fought in 1672, about the time of the conquest of Holland. The battle was maintained between the English and Dutch with the obstinate bravery of nations which were accustomed to dispute the empire of the ocean. Ruyter having thus made himself master of the sea, conducted a fleet of Indiamen safely into the Texel; thus defending and enriching his country, whilst it had become the prey of hostile invaders. The next year he had three engagements with the fleets of France and England, in which, if possible, his bravery was still more distinguished than ever. D’Estrées, the French vice-admiral, wrote to Colbert, “I would purchase with my life the glory of De Ruyter.” But he did not long enjoy the triumphs which he had so honourably won. In an engagement with the French fleet off the coast of Sicily, he was defeated and received a mortal wound, which in a few days put an end to his life. His corpse was carried to Amsterdam, and a magnificent monument to his memory was there erected by the command of the states-general. The Spanish council had bestowed on him the title of duke, and transmitted a patent investing him with that dignity; but he died before it arrived. When Louis XIV. was congratulated upon De Ruyter’s death, he replied, “Every one must be sorry at the death of so great a man.”
