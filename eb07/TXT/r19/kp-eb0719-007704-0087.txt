RAVEY the ancient Hydraotes, a celebrated river of Hindustan, and the third river of the Punjab. It rises in the eastern mountains of Cashmere, near a famous place of Hindu worship, not far from the sources of the Sutulege, the Chunaub, and the Beyah rivers. It afterwards runs in a south-westerly direction until it passes the city of Lahore, sixty miles above which it is 120 yards broad, and extremely rapid, yet navigable during the rains for boats of a considerable size. It flows in the same direction after passing the city of Lahore, and it is joined about twenty-eight miles above the city of Moultan by the Jhylum and the Chunaub rivers, forming a stream in some places several miles in breadth, and scarcely inferior to the Indus itself. Immediately after their junction it is one mile, one furlong, and eighty-five yards, but lower down the stream is contracted in its breadth to less than 350 yards. Seventy miles below Moultan the Ravey joins the Indus after a course, including its windings, of 500 miles. The water is light and wholesome.
