REGULAR denotes anything that is agreeable to rule. Thus we say, a regular building, a regular verb, and the like.

A regular figure, in geometry, is one the sides, and consequently the angles, of which are equal; and a regular figure with three or four sides is commonly termed an equilateral triangle or square, as all others with more sides are called regular polygons. Regular Body, called also Platonic Body, is a body or solid comprehended by like, equal, and regular plane figures, and the solid angles of which are all equal. The plane figures by which the solid is contained are the faces of the solid; and the sides of the plane figures are the edges or linear sides of the solid.

There are only five regular solids, viz. the tetrahedron, or regular triangular pyramid, having four triangular faces; the hexahedron, or cube, having six square faces; the octahedron, having eight triangular faces; the dodecahedron, having twelve pentagonal faces; and the icosahedron, having twenty triangular faces. Besides these five, there can be no other regular bodies in nature.

Regular, in a monastery, is a person who has taken the vows, and is so called because he is bound to observe the rules of the order he has embraced.
