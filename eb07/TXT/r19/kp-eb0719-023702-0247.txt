RICHELIEU John Armand du Plessis de, cardinal of Richelieu and Fronsac, bishop of Lucon, &c. was born at Paris in 1585. He was possessed of excellent parts; and at the age of twenty-two he had the address to obtain a dispensation to enjoy the bishopric of Lucon. He applied himself in a particular manner to the function of preaching; and his reputation procured him the office of almoner to the queen Mary de’ Medicis. His abilities in the management of affairs advanced him to be secretary of state in 1616; and the king soon gave him the preference to all his other secretaries. The death of the marquis d’Ancre having produced a revolution in state affairs, Richelieu retired to Avignon, where he employed himself in composing books of controversy and piety. The king having recalled him to court, he was made a cardinal in 1622; and, two years after, first minister of state, and grand-master of the navigation. In 1626, the Isle of Rhee was preserved by his care; and in 1628 Rochelle was taken, the haven having been enclosed by the famous dyke which he ordered to be raised. He accompanied the king to the siege of Cazal, and contributed not a little to the raising of it in 1629. He also obliged the Huguenots to the peace at Alets, which proved the ruin of that party. He took Pamerol, and succoured Cazal, besieged by Spinola. In the mean time the [7:19:238]nobles found fault with his conduct, and persuaded the king to discard him. The cardinal, for his part, was unmoved, and by his reasonings overthrew what was thought to be determined against him; so that, instead of being disgraced, he from that moment became more powerful than ever. He punished all his enemies in the same manner as they would have punished him; and the day which produced this event, so glorious to Cardinal de Richelieu, was called the day of dupes. This able minister had from thence forward an ascendency over the king’s mind; and he now resolved to humble the excessive pride of the house of Austria. For that purpose he concluded a treaty with Gustavus Adolphus king of Sweden, for carrying the war into the heart of Germany. He also entered into a league with the duke of Bavaria; secured Lorraine; raised a part of the princes of the empire against the emperor; treated with the Dutch to continue the war against Spain; favoured the Catalans and Portuguese till they shook off the Spanish yoke; and, in short, took so many different measures, that he accomplished his design; and after having carried on the war with success, was thinking of concluding it by a peace, when he died at Paris on the 4th of December 1642, aged fifty-eight. He was interred in the Sorbonne, where a magnificent mausoleum is erected to his memory. This great politician made the arts and sciences flourish; formed the botanical garden at Paris, called the king’s garden; founded the French academy; established the royal printing-house; erected the palace afterwards called Le Palais Royal, which he presented to the king; and rebuilt the Sorbonne with a magnificence that appears truly royal. Besides his books of controversy and piety, there pass under the name of this minister, a Journal, in 2 vols. 12mo; and a Political Testament, in 12mo; all treating of politics and state affairs.

Richelieu, or Sorell, a river of Lower Canada, flowing in a northerly direction from Lake Champlain to the great St Lawrence. It is the principal channel by which the waters of the lake are conveyed to the latter river; and by being made navigable for vessels of large size throughout its whole extent, it would afford a most convenient means of commercial intercourse with the interior of New York, and form a direct chain of communication with the great western republic. This river is remarkable for being much narrower at its embouchure than at the place from which it flows. From its mouth to the basin of Chamblay it is about two hundred and fifty yards wide; thence to the Isle du Portage the breadth is five hundred yards; beyond this it expands to double that size, and continues to enlarge up to St John’s, from which there is a ship-navigation to the towns on Lake Champlain. From Chamblay downwards to the St Lawrence the current is regular and gentle; but from Lake Champlain to the basin it is hurried, in some places violent, and in others broken by rapids. The channel is, however, of great value and importance, and the medium of considerable trade.

Richelieu Islands, a cluster of islands, about a hundred in number, in the river St Lawrence, situated at the southwest entrance of Lake St Peter. They lie low, and are liable to be overflowed in spring, when the lake is swelled by the melting of snow and ice. Some of them afford good pasturage for cattle, and they all abound with wild fowl.
