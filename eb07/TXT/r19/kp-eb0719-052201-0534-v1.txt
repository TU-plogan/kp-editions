RUNGPOOR a town and district of Hindustan, in the north-eastern extremity of Bengal, situated about the twentieth degree of north latitude. The district is bounded on the north by the Bootan Hills, on the south by Mymunsing, on the east by the Brahmapootra, and on the west by Dinagepore. The river Durlah separates it from Couch Bahar. It is an open country, level, and well watered and productive. It yields in abundance silk, rice, indigo, hemp, and tobacco. Some parts of it are equal in fertility to any part of Bengal; but, on the whole, it is not so well cultivated or so populous as the other parts of this province. Besides the Brahmapootra, the principal rivers are the Teestah and the Durlah; and the chief towns Rungpoor, Mungulhaut, and Guzgotta. The tobacco grown here is mostly consumed in the southern and eastern districts of Bengal. The glandular swellings of the throat are very prevalent amongst the inhabitants, although parts of the district are a hundred miles distant from the Alpine region. This district was taken possession of by the Mahommedans early in the thirteenth century, and was always governed by a military collector. It was at first partially wrested from the rajah of Couch Bahar, when it was formed into a circar, and was finally conquered by the generals of Aurungzebe. It is now under a British establishment of a judge, collector, &c. The result of some queries by the Marquis of Wellesley in 1801 gave a population of 400,000. Rungpoor, the capital, is situated on the eastern bank of the Goggot river. It is a regularly-built town, and carries on a considerable trade with Bootan, Assam, and Calcutta. Long. 89. 5. E. Lat.
