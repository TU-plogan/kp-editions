RIESENGEBIRGE a range of mountains in the dominions of Prussia, and in part of Austria, which commences on the northward on the borders of Lusatia, and separates Bohemia from Silesia and Moravia, till it terminates by forming a junction with the Carpathian range to the southward. The loftiest part of the range is that which lies between the sources of the rivers Neisse and Bober. The general height does not much exceed 3000 feet, but several of the peaks attain a much greater elevation. Of these the most remarkable are two; the Schneeberg, which is 5300 feet, and the Sturmhaube, which is 5100 feet in height. The summit of the former commands a prospect of more than sixty miles round, including the city of Breslau to the north, and of Prague to the south. The intersecting valleys are many of them picturesque and mostly fertile; but the higher parts are unfavourable to the growth of corn, from the scarcity of which the inhabitants in most winters suffer severely.
