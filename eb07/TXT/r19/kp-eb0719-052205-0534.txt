RUNNET or Rennet, is the concreted milk found in the stomachs of sucking quadrupeds, which have as yet received no other nourishment than their mother’s milk. In ruminating animals, which have several stomachs, it is generally found in the last, though sometimes in the next to it. If the runnet is dried in the sun, and then kept close, it may be preserved in perfection for years. Not only the runnet itself, but also the stomach in which it is found, curdles milk without any previous preparation. But the common method is, to take the inner membrane of a calf’s stomach, to clean it well, to salt and hang it up in brown paper. When this is used the salt is washed off, then it is macerated in a little watbr during the night, and in the morning the infusion is poured into the milk to curdle it.
