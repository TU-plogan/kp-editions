RASAY one of the Western Islands or Hebrides, is about thirteen miles in length and two in breadth. It has plenty of limestone and freestone, feeds great numbers of black cattle, but has neither deers, hares, nor rabbits. The only appearance of a'harbour in Rasay is at Clachan Bay, where the proprietor of the island resides. Rasay presents a bold shore, which rises to the height of mountains; and here the natives have with incredible labour formed many little cornfields and potato-grounds. These heights decrease at the southern extremity, where there are some farms and a good-looking country.
