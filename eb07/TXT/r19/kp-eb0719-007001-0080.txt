RANK the order or place assigned to a person, suitably to his quality or merit.

Rank is a straight line formed by the soldiers of a battalion or squadron, drawn up side by side. This order was established for the marches, and for regulating the different bodies of troops and officers which compose an army. Rank and Precedence, in the army and navy, are estimated as follows:

Engineers RANK. Chief, as colonel; director, as lieu-tenant-colonel; sub-director, as major; engineer in ordinary, as captain; engineer extraordinary, as captain-lieu-tenant; sub-engineer, as lieutenant; practitioner engineer, as ensign.

Navy RANK. Admiral, or commander-in-chief of his majestyâ€™s fleet, has the rank of a field-marshal; admirals, with their flags on the main-topmast-head, rank with generals of horse and foot; vice-admirals, with lieutenant-generals; rear-admirals, as major-generals; commodores with broad pendants, as brigadier-generals; captains of postships, after three years from the date of their first commission, as colonels; other captains, as commanding post-ships, as lieutenant-colonels; captains not taking post, as majors; lieutenants, as captains.

Rank between the Army, Navy, and Governors.
