RED RIVER is one of the principal confluents of the Mississippi, in North America. Its source is situated at the base of a range of the Rocky Mountains, called the Caous Mountains, near Santa Fe, in Mexico. A great number of streams descend this chain, and, flowing separately for some three or four hundred miles, at length unite and form the Red River. The country through which its upper branches flow is but little known. After the river enters Louisiana, its south bank forms for a great distance the boundary between the United States and Texas. Much of its course lies through noble prairies of a rich red soil covered with grass intermingled with vines, which bear, it is said, excellent grapes. About a hundred miles above Natchitoches the alluvion enlarges to a breadth of twenty or thirty miles, forming a sort of swampy bed through which the river flows in a number of channels. Great quantities of timber, brought down from the upper parts of the river, have for ages been accumulating in these channels, and to such an extent, that in soιpe parts the stream may be crossed on horseback. Hence the name of Raft, which this swampy expansion bears throughout its whole extent. The river finds its way sometimes below these accumulations of timber, sometimes between them. Nearly seventy miles of the river are thus obstructed; and it is of incalculable injury to its navigation, for here small boats only can pass. For nearly a thousand miles above the Raft the soil is extremely rich, and the climate very salubrious; but, until this obstacle be removed, it will form an almost insurmount I able barrier to its proper settlement. Below the Raft the river separates into a number of channels, and expands at intervals into a multitude of sheets of water. Its breadth enlarges as it approaches the Mississippi; but immediately below the Raft the channel becomes narrower than above it. From both sides it receives a vast number of tributaries. The whole length of this noble stream is estimated at 2500 miles, following its meanderings; and it enters the Mississippi in about 31° 15' north latitude. It was supposcd at one time to discharge itself into the Gulf of Mexico without joining the Mississippi. Much of the soil through which the Red River passes in its upper course is of a reddish colour, which is imparted to the waters, and hence the name of the stream. So impregnated is it with this ochreous earth, that at low water at Natchitoches it cannot be used for culinary purposes. The valley of Red River is three or four miles in breadth as far as the Kiamesia, which, following its windings, is about a thousand miles from its mouth. But it widens to from six to eighteen miles as it approaches the Mississippi, and is of an average breadth of twelve miles for a great distance above the confluence of the rivers. This alluvial tract is considered as equal to any in all the vast valley of the Mississippi. The staple production is cotton, of a quality superior to any raised in the United States except Sea Island. Its indigo and tobacco are the best raised in Louisiana; and sugar has been introduced, and found to thrive well. (r. r. r.)

Red River is also the name of a number of other American streams. The most important is that which flows into Lake Winnipeg, in the northern part of North America. It is formed of two branches, the principal of which rises in Red Lake, and flows west by north for a hundred and fifty miles, when it is joined by the other branch. It then changes its direction to east of north, and flows for a hundred and eighty miles below its junction, when it falls into Lake Winnipeg. (R. r. r.)
