RAHDUNPOOR a town of Hindustan, in the province of Gujerat, and district of Werrear, belonging to a Mahom-mcdan chief, who formerly possessed a much more extensive territory. It contains 6000 houses, 1400 of which are inhabited by shroffs or bankers, some of whom are possessed of property, and carry on an extensive commerce. It is well situated for commerce, and forms an emporium for the trade of Merw ur and Cutch 1 though the road has of late years been infested by a tribe of robbers, called Coolies. The valuable caravans formerly travelled by this route; but they are deterred by the danger of the road. The inhabitants are mostly engaged in agriculture, and they have brought the vicinity of the town into a high state of cultivation. They have no manufactories of any consequence, except one of very coarse cloth for the Coolies. This principality was founded by a Balvocky chief who came from Paakur; and Shah Jehan built the wall in order to repress the invasions of the Coolies. When the Gurcowar compelled the father of the present nabob to resign his claims to Pattan and its nine dependent pergun-nahs, he was permitted to retain Rahdunpore, Manjepoor, and Sommee, which formed part of the original possessions of the family. Long. 71. 45. E. Lat. 24. N.
