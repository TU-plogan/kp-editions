RECLAIMING or Reclaming, in our ancient customs, a lord’s pursuing, prosecuting, and recalling his vassal, who had gone to live in another place without his permission.

Reclaiming is also used for the demanding of a person or thing, to be delivered up to the prince or state to which it properly belongs, when, by any irregular means, it has passed into the possession of another.

Reclaiming, in Falconry, is taming a hawk, and making her gentle and familiar.

A partridge is said to reclaim when she calls her young ones together, upon their scattering too much from her.
