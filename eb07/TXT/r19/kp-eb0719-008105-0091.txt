RECENSIO was an account taken by the censors, every lustrum, of all the Roman people. It was a general survey, at which the equites, as well as the rest of the people, were required to appear. New names were now put upon the censorâ€™s list, and old ones cancelled. The recensio, in short, was a more solemn and accurate sort of probatio, and answered the purpose of a review, by showing who were fit for military service.
