RUPPIN a city of Prussia, the capital of a circle of the same name, in the government of Potsdam, which extends over 725 square miles, and comprehends five cities, 97 villages, 84 hamlets, and 54,600 inhabitants. The city is situated on the lake Rhin, whence, by sluices, a stream is carried through it. Although ancient, it is well built, and was formerly fortified. It contains two churches, a gymnasium with six professors, and in 1834 had 800 houses and 7415 inhabitants. By a lake and a canal which joins the river Havel, the trade is extended to the Elbe. The occupations of the citizens chiefly consist in making woollen goods of various kinds, tanning leather, brewing beer, and distilling corn-spirits. Near to it there is much tobacco cultivated.
