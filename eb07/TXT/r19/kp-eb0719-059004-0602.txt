RUSTIC in Architecture, implies a manner of building in imitation of nature, rather than according to the rules of art.

Rustic Gods, or dii rustici, in Antiquity, were the gods of the country, or those who presided over agriculture. Varro invokes the twelve dii consentes, as the principal amongst the rustic gods, viz. Jupiter, Tellus 1 the Sun, Moon, Ceres, Bacchus, Rubigus, Flora, Minerva, Venus, Lympha, and Good Luck. Besides these twelve arch[7:19:591]rustic gods, there were an infinity of lesser ones; as Pales, Vertumnus, Tutelina, FuIgor, Sterculius, Mellona 1 Jugati-i nus, Collinus, Vallonia, Terminus, Sylvanus, and Priapus, i Struvius adds the Satyrs, Fauns, Sileni, Nymphs, and even « Tritons, and gives the empire over all the rustic gods to the god Pan.!

Rustic Work, is where the stones in the face, &c. of a ∣ building, instead of being smooth, are hatched, or picked ∣ with the point of a hammer.
