RHEIMS an arrondissement of the department of the Marne, in France, 692 square miles in extent. It comprehends ten cantons, divided into 181 communes, and in 1836 contained 123,919 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name. It stands in a pleasing district on the river Bisle. It is surrounded with walls, not for defence, but converted into agreeable promenades. It is a city of well-built and large houses, some open places, but in general of narrow streets, well paved. The chief object of attention is the fine Gothic cathedral, in which the kings of France during many generations were crowned. It is 450 feet in length, ninety-five in breadth, and 110 in height. The porticois beautiful, and the interior presents a magnificence in its architecture, which is so combined with simplicity as to produce a wonderful impression on the spectator. It suffered injury during the revolution, but the damages have in some degree been repaired. The palace of the archbishop and some other ecclesiastical buildings are very fine. This city has a lyceum, three hospitals, and 38,359 inhabitants, who carry on considerable manufactures of woollen goods of various kinds, and in shawls of mixed substances. It is also a place of commerce, and is the principal mart for champagne wine. Long. 3.56.3. E. Lat. 49. 15. 16. N.
