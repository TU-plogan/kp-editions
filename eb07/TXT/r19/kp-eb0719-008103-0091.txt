REBUS an enigmatical representation of some name or thing, by using figures or pictures instead of words or parts of words. Camden mentions an instance of this kind of wit in a gallant who expressed his love to a woman named Rose Hill, by painting in the border of his gown a rose, a hill, an eye, a loaf, and a well; which, in the style of the rebus, reads, “Rose Hill I lave well.” This kind of wit was long practised by the great, who took the pains to find devices for their names. It was, however, happily ridiculed by Ben Jonson in the humorous description of AbelDrug-ger’s device in the Alchemist, by the Spectator in the device of Jack of Newberry, at which time the rebus, being raised to sign-posts, was grown out of fashion at court.

Rebus is also used by the chemical writers, sometimes to signify sour milk, and sometimes for what they call the ultimate matter of which all bodies are composed. Rebus, in Heraldry, is a coat of arms which bears an allusion to the name of the person; as three castles for Castleton, three cups for Butler, three conics for Conisby; a kind of bearings which are of great antiquity.
