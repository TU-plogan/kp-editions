RUBY a species of precious stone, belonging to the siliceous genus. The ruby is of various colours, as, of a deep red colour inclining a little to purple, or the carbuncle of Pliny; the spinell, of the colour of a bright corn poppy flower; and the balass or pale red inclining to violet. Tavernier and Dutens inform us that in the East Indies all coloured gems are named rubies, without regard to what their colours may be; and that the particular colour is added to the name of each in order to distinguish them from one another. The spinell rubies are above half the value of diamonds of the same weight; and the balass is valued at thirty shillings per carat. Tavernier mentions one hundred and eight rubies in the throne of the Great Mogul, from one to two hundred carats, and a round one almost two and a half ounces. There is also mention made by other travellers, of rubies exceeding two hundred carats in weight. According to Dutens, a perfect ruby, if it weigh more than three and a half carats, is of greater value than a diamond of the same weight. If it weigh one carat, it is worth ten guineas; if two carats, forty guineas; three carats, a hundred and fifty guineas; if six carats, upwards of a thousand guineas.
