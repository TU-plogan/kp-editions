RAJAMUNDRY an extensive district of Hindustan, in the province of the Northern Circars, bounded on the north by Cicacole, and on the south by Ellore; on the west by the territories of the Nizam, and on the east by the Bay of Bengal. This district is intersected by the Godavery 1 and lies chiefly to the north of that river, though part of it is also to the south. At the distance of about thirty-five miles from the sea, this river divides itself into two great branches, and forms the island of Nagur, comprehending, within a triangular space, 500 square miles, but much greater in value than in extent. The whole district includes an area of 1700 square miles. The island of Nagur is intersected by lesser branches of the Godavery, which, supplying abundance of water, render it very productive, being fertilized by the slimy mould carried down by this great [7:19:62]river of the Deccan. The country produces abundance of sugar, which is cultivated to a great extent in the island of Nagur, and along the banks of the Elyseram River, from the

, abundant flow of whose water during the whole year the sugar-plantations arc watered during the driest seasons; and also a variety of other productions are grown, such as paddy, ginger, turmeric, yams, and chillies. Sugar is also grown in considerable quantities in the delta of the Godavery, where the cultivation might be carried to any amount, and where, during the interval between the crops, leguminous plants are reared. The country, from the commencement of the hills along the banks of the Godavery, to Poloonshah on the frontiers of Commamet, is the seat of extensive forests, where the teak-trees are produced in abundance, there being no other country on the east side of the Bay of Bengal which furnishes this valuable timber. Some attempts have been made to raise pepper, but this valuable product is produced in greater abundance and perfection on the Malabar coast. The principal towns are Rajamundry, Ingeram, Coringa, Bundermalanca, Peddapoor, and Pettipoor; but Coringa is the only port which carries on any considerable export trade. Rajamundry was ceded to the French in 1753 by Salabut Jung, the subahdar of the Deccan, and acquired by the British under Lord Clive in 1765. Many additional dependencies, however, have since been acquired by conquest or policy; and it now constitutes one of the five collectorships into which the Northern Cir-cars were subdivided in 1803.

Rajamundry, the capital of the above-mentioned district, and the residence of the British civil establishment, is situated on the east bank of the Godavery, forty miles from the sea. It formerly possessed a good brick fort, which is now in ruins. Long. 81. 54. E. Lat. 16. 59. N.
