RIPON a city of the west riding of Yorkshire, 222 miles from London. It is situated between two small streams, the Ure and the Skell. A new diocese has been erected, and the first bishop of Ripon, Dr Longley, was consecrated in 1836. The cathedral, formerly the collegiate church, has a dean, a subdean, four prebendaries, and two vicars. It is a fine old building, recently placed in good order. It was once adorned with two steeples, one of which was blown down, and the other has been removed. The market-place is one of the finest in the north of England, and is well attended on Thursdays. Ripon was once celebrated for making spurs, but that trade has vanished. Cotton-mills have been erected, which afford more employment. The municipal government consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors. The population amounted in 1821 to 4563, and in 1831 to 5080. Near to it is the magnificent seat and grounds of Studley Royal.
