RICKMANSWORTH a market-town of the county of Hertford. It is in the hundred of Cashio, seventeen miles from London, and stands at the spot where the river Gade falls into the Colne, which latter forms a part of the Grand Junction Canal. It is also near the course of the railway by which London is connected with Birmingham, and is thus highly favoured with respect to the facilities of communication. The church is a fine large fabric of an ancient date. The town has some trade in straw-hats and in [7:19:239]making thread-lace. There are several mills in the neigh-bourħood occupied in making cotton and silk goods, and many in making paper. It has a weekly market on Saturday, though now but little attended. The population amounted in 1801 to 2073, in 1811 to 3230, in 1821 to 3940, and in 1831 to 4574.
