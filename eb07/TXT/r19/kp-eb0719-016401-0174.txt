REPTON an ancient market-town of the county of Derby, situated in the hundred of Repton cum Gresley, four miles from Burton-on-Trent, and 124 from London. It is a place of great antiquity, having been the residence of the Saxon kings of Mercia during the heptarchy, several of whom are buried in the church, which is still a handsome Gothic building, with a lofty spire. It had once a market, but it is now fallen into neglect. The population amounted in 1801 to 1424, in 1811 to 1648, in 1821 to 1802, and in 1831 to 1758.
