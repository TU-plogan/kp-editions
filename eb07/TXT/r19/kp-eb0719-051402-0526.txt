ROYSTON a market-town on the northern border of the county of Hertford, and partly within the county of Cambridge, thirty-eight miles from London. There was here an ancient priory, said to have been founded in the reign of Henry II. by a lady of the name of Roysia, from whom the town takes its name. The chapel of the priory now serves as the parish church. There is a large market held on Thursday, at which much corn is sold. There are some considerable brewers. The population amounted in 1811 to 1331, in 1821 to 1474, and in 1831 to 1757.
