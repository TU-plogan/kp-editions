REBELLION Rebellio, amongst the Romans, was where those who had been formerly overcome in battle, and yielded to their subjection, made a second resistance. But with us it is generally used for the taking up of arms traitorously against the king, whether by natural subjects or others when once subdued; and the word rebel is sometimes applied to him who wilfidly breaks a law, as also to a villein disobeying his lord.

There is a difference between enemies and rebels. Enemies are those who are out of the king’s allegiance; and therefore subjects of the king, either in open war or rebellion, are not the king’s enemies, but traitors. Thus David prince of Wales, who levied war against Edward L 1 because he was within the allegiance of the king, had sentence pronounced against him as a traitor and a rebel. Private persons may arm themselves to suppress rebels.
