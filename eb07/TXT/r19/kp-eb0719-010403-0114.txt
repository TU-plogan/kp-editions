REGRATOR signifies a person who buys and sells any wares or victuals in the same market or fair; and regrators are particularly described to be those who buy, or get into their hands, in fairs or markets,any grain, fish, butter, cheese, sheep, lambs, calves, swine, pigs, geese, capons, hens, chickens, pigeons, conies, or other dead victuals whatsoever, brought to a fair or market to be sold there, and do sell the same again in the same fair, market, or place, or in some other within four miles thereof.

Regrating is thus a kind of huchstry, by which victuals are made dearer; for every seller must gain something, and this consequently will enhance the price. In ancient times, both the engrosser and regrator were comprehended under the word forestaller. Regrators are punishable by loss and forfeiture of goods, and imprisonment, according to the first, second, or third offence. But the modem science of Political Economy has taught us to view the practices of regrating and forestalling with far other eyes than those of our forefathers.
