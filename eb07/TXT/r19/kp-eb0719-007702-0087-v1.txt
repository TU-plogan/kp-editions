RAVENNA a delegation of the States of the Church, in Italy, in the northern part of the ancient Romagna. It is 935 square miles in extent, and contains four cities, eight market-towns, many villages, and 123,760 inhabitants. It is a level district on the sea-coast, with numerous saline lakes, but towards the west there are some gentle undulations. It is moderately fertile, and is drained by the rivers La-mone, Lanterno, and their tributary streams. The capital is the city of the same name, which is of high antiquity. It was formerly on the sea-shore, but, by the recession of the water, is now three miles from it. It is in a marshy situation, surrounded by walls of no great strength. It is the see of a bishop, has a cathedral, twenty-one parish churches, twelve monasteries, five nunneries, a public library, an hospital, and some schools. It contains in the city 16,000 inhabitants, but, including the suburbs and some adjacent villages, the population amounts to 23,930. It was formerly the capital of the kingdom of the Ostrogoths, and, in later times, of an exarchate. There are now to be seen the remains of some old Gothic castles. Long. 12. 5.31. E. Lat. 44. 25. 5.
