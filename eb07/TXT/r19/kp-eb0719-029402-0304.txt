RIVOLI a city of the kingdom of Sardinia, in Italy, in the province of Piedmont. It is situated at the south foot of the Alps, on the great road over those mountains by way of Mount Cenis. A remarkable castle near it was long the place of residence of King Victor Amadeus, after his abdication of the throne, and he died there in 1732. The prospect from this castle, comprehending a view of the city of Turin, and the beautiful country surrounding it, is peculiarly exciting. The population consists of 6100 inhabitants, who are occupied in the manufactures of silk, linen, and woollen goods, of various kinds.
