ROGER de Hoveden, a learned man of the thirteenth century, was born in Yorkshire, most probably at the town of that name, now called Howden, some time in the reign of Henry I. After he had received the first parts of education in his native country, he studied the civil and canon laws, which were then become the most fashionable and lucrative branches of education. He was appointed domestic chaplain to Henry II. who employed him to transact several ecclesiastical affairs, in which he acquitted himself with honour. But his most meritorious work was, his Annals of England from a. d. 731, when Bedeâ€™s Ecclesiastical History [7:19:312]ends, to a. d. 1202. This work, which is one of the most voluminous of our ancient histories, is more valuable for the sincerity with which it is written, and the great variety of facts which it contains, than for the beauty of its style or the regularity of its arrangement.
