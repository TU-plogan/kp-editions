RAUN a town of some strength, situated upon the river Miza, and remarkable for a bloody skirmish between the Prussians and Austrians, in August 1744. The king of Prussia, intending to get possession of Beraun, sent thither six battalions, with eight cannon, and 800 hussars; but General Festititz being there with a great party of his corps, and M. Luchesi with 1000 horse, they not only repulsed the Prussians, but attacked them in their turn, and, after a warm dispute, obliged them to retire with considerable loss.
