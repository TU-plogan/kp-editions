RAMMISSERAM Isle, an island situated in the straits between the island of Ceylon and the continent; it is eleven miles in length, by six in breadth, and separated from the latter by a narrow strait. It is low, sandy, and uncultivated, and is of little value, except as a seat of Hindu superstition. It possesses a celebrated pagoda, the entrance to which is through a lofty gateway, about a hundred feet in height, covered with carved work to the summit. It contains a town called Panban; but its chief value is derived from a celebrated temple, which is about six hundred feet square, and is one of the finest pieces of architecture in India. The entrance into this temple is by a door forty-six feet in height, placed perpendicularly, with others crossing, and in massiveness of workmanship resembling the Egyptian style of architecture. None is permitted to enter into the inner temples except the attendants of Brahmins, who live in the town, and have their share of the offerings. The expenses of the rajah of Tanjore at this place usually amounted to 60,000 pagodas. No water is used except what is brought all the way from the Ganges, and is poured over the deity every morning, and then sold to the devout, by which a considerable revenue accrues to the temple. The capital is about nine miles distant from the great temple.
