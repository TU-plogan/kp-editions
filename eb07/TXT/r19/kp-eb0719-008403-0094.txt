REDEMPTION in Law, a faculty or right of re-entering upon lands which have been sold and assigned, upon reimbursing the purchase-money with legal costs.

Redemption, in Theology, denotes the recovery of mankind from sin and death, by the obedience and sacrifice of Christ, who on this account is called the Redeemer of the World.
