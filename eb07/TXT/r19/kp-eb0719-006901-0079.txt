RANDOM Shot, in Gunnery, is a shot made when the muzzle of a gun is raised above the horizontal line, and is not designed to shoot directly or point black. The utmost random of any piece is about ten times as far as the bullet will go point blank. The bullet will go farthest when the piece is mounted at an angle of about forty-five degrees above the level range.
