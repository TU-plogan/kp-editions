RUDBECK Olaus, a learned Swedish physician, w r as born of an ancient and noble family in 1630. He became professor of medicine at Upsal, where he acquired great applause by his extensive knowledge, and died in 1702. His principal works are twofold, 1. Exercitatio Anatomica, ex-hibens ductus novos hepaticos aquosos, et vasa glandularum serosa, in 4to; 2. Atlantica, sive Manheim, vera Jopheti posterorum sedes ac patria, four vols. folio. He there endeavours to prove that Sweden was the country whence all the ancient Pagan divinities and our first parents were derived; and that the Germans, English, French, Danes, Greeks, and Romans, with all other nations, originally came from thence. This work, in a complete state, is of the greatest rarity.
