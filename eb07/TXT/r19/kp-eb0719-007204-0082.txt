RAPIN Rene, a Jesuit and eminent French writer, was born at Tours in 1621. He taught polite literature in the society of the Jesuits with great applause, and was justly esteemed one of the best Latin poets and greatest wits of his time. He died at Paris in the year 1687. His principal works were, 1. A great number of Latin poems, which have rendered him famous throughout all Europe, amongst which are his Hortorum Iibri quatuor; 2. Reflections on Eloquence, Poetry, History, and Philosophy; 3. Comparisons between Virgil and Homer, Demosthenes and Cicero, Plato and Aristotle, Thucydides and Titus Livius; 4. The History of Jansenism; and, 5. Several works on religious subjects. The best edition of his Latin poems is that of Paris in 1723, in three vols. 12mo.

Rapin de Thoybas, Paul de, a celebrated historian, was the son of James de Rapin, lord of Thoyras, and was born at Castres in 1661. He was at first educated under a tutor in his father’s house, and afterwards sent to Puylaurens, and thence to Samur. In 1679 he returned to his father, with a design to apply himself to the study of the law , and was admitted an advocate; but some time afterwards, reflecting that his being a Protestant would prevent∙his advancement at the bar, he resolved to quit the profession of the law, and to apply himself to that of the sword. His father, however,

, would not consent to the change. The revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685, and the death of his father, which happened two months afterwards, made him resolve to come to England; but as he had no hopes of any settlement there, his stay was but short. He therefore went to Holland, and enlisted himself in the company of French volunteers at Utrecht, commanded by M. Rapin, his cousin-german. He attended the Prince of Orange into England in 1688; and the following year Lord Kingston made him an ensign in his regiment, with which he proceeded to Ireland, where he gained the esteem of his officers at the siege of Carrickfergus, and soon received a lieutenant’s commission. He was present at the battle of the Boyne, and was shot through the shoulder at the siege of Limerick. He was soon afterwards made captain of the company in which he had been ensign; but, in 1693, he resigned his company to one of his brothers, in order to become tutor to the Earl of Portland’s son. In 1699, he married Marianne Testard; but this marriage neither abated his care of his pupil, nor prevented his accompanying him in his travels. Having finished this employment, he returned to his family, which he had settled at the Hague; and there he continued some years. But as he found his family increase, he resolved to retire to some cheap country; and accordingly removed, in 1707, to Wesel, where he wrote his History of England, and some other works. Though he was of a strong constitution, yet seventeen years , application, for so long was he engaged in composing his great work, entirely ruined his health. He died in 1725.

Rapin wrote, in French, 1. A Dissertation on Ihe Whigs and Tories; 2. His History of England, printed at the Hague in 1726 and 1727, in nine vols. 4to, and reprinted at Trevoux in 1728, in ten vols. 4to. This' last edition is more complete than that of the Hague. It has been translated into English, and improved with notes, by Mr Tindal, in two vols. folio. This performance, although the work of a foreigner, is deservedly esteemed as the fullest and most impartial collection of English political transactions extant.
