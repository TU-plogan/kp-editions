+=====================================================================+


ROOKE Sir George, a gallant naval commander, was born of an ancient and honourable family in Kent in 1650. His merit raised him by regular steps to be vice-admiral of the blue, in which station he served in the battle of La Hogue, on the 22d of May 1692, when it was owing to his vigorous behaviour that the last stroke was given on that important day, which threw the French entirely into confusion. But the next day he obtained still more glory, for he had orders to go into La Hogue, and burn the enemy’s ships as they lay there. There were thirteen large men of war, which had crowded as far up as possible; and the transports, tenders, and ammunition ships, were disposed in such a manner that it was thought impossible to burn them. Besides, the French camp was in sight, with all the French and Irish troops that were to have been employed in the invasion of England; and several batteries were raised on the coast, which were well provided with heavy artillery. The vice-admiral made the necessary preparations for obeying his orders, but found it impossible to carry in the ships of his squadron. He therefore ordered his light frigates to ply in close to the shore; and having manned all his boats, went himself to give directions for the attack, burned that very night six three-decked ships, and the next day six more, from seventy-six to sixty guns, together with most of the transports and ammunition vessels; and this under the fire of all the batteries just mentioned, and in sight of all the French and Irish troops. Yet this bold action cost the lives of no more than ten men. The vice-admiral’s behaviour on this occasion appeared to King William so great, that having no opportunity at that time of promoting him, he settled a pension of L.1000 per annum on him for life; and afterwards going to Portsmouth to view the fleet, went on board Admiral Rooke’s ship, dined with him, and then conferred on him the honour of knighthood, having a little before made him vice-admiral of the red.

In consequence of other services, he was in 1694 raised to the rank of admiral of the blue; towards the close of the next year he became admiral of the white, and was also appointed admiral and commander in chief in the Mediterranean.

During King William’s reign, Sir George was twice elected member for Portsmouth; and upon tile accession of Queen Anne in 1702, he was constituted vice-admiral and lieutenant of the admiralty of England, as also lieutenant of the fleets and seas of this kingdom. Upon the declaration of war against France, he was ordered to command a fleet sent against Cadiz, the Duke of Ormond having the command of the land forces. On his passage home, having received an account that the galleons, under the escort of a strong French squadron, had got into the harbour of Vigo, he resolved to attack them; and on the 11th of October he came before the harbour of Rondon-dello, where the French commander had neglected nothing necessary for putting the place in the best posture of defence. But notwithstanding this, a detachment of fifteen English and ten Dutch men of war, of the line of battle, with all the fire-ships, were ordered in; the frigates and bomb-vessels followed; the great ships moved after them, and the army landed near Rondondello. The whole service was performed under Sir George’s directions, with admirable conduct and bravery; for all the ships were destroyed or taken, prodigious damage was done to the enemy, and vast wealth was acquired by the allies. For this action Sir George received the thanks of the House of Commons, a day of thanksgiving was appointed both by the queen and the states-general, and Sir George was appointed to a seat in the privy-council. Yet notwithstanding this, the House of Lords resolved to inquire into his conduct at Cadiz. But he so fully justified himself, that a vote was passed approving his behaviour.

In the spring of the year 1704, Sir George commanded the ships of war which conveyed King Charles III. of Spain to Lisbon. In July he attacked Gibraltar, when, by the bravery of the English seamen, the place was taken on the 24th, though the town was extremely strong, well furnished with ammunition, and had a hundred guns mounted, all facing the sea and the narrow passes to the land; an action which was conceived and executed in less than a week, though it has since endured sieges of many months’ continuance, and more than once baffled the united forces of France and Spain. This brave officer being at last obliged, by the prevalence of party spirit, to quit the service of his country, retired to his seat in Kent, where he spent the remainder of his days as a private gentleman. He was thrice married; and by his second lady, Mrs Luttrel, left one son.

He died on the 24th of January 1708, in his fifty-eighth year.
