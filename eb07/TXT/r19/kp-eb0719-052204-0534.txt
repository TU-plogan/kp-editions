RUNNER in nautical language, a rope belonging to the garnet and the two bolt-tackles. It is received in a single block joined to the end of a pendant; it has at one end a hook to hitch into any thing, and at the other a double block, into which is reeved the fall of the tackle, or the garnet, by which means it purchases more than the tackle would without it.
