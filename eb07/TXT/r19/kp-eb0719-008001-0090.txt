RE-AGGRAVATION in the Roman ecclesiastical law, the last monitory, published after three admonitions, and before the final excommunication. Previous to fulminating the last excommunication, they publish an aggravation and a re-aggravation. Fevret observes, that in France the minister is not allowed to come to re-aggravation, without the permission of the bishop or official, as well as that of the lay judge.
