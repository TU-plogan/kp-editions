RAMNAD a town and capital of a district of the same name, in the south of India, and province of Marawar. This pollam or zemindary was granted to the ancestors of the present family, on condition of their granting protection to the pilgrims on their road to Rammisseram, and for which protection they were also to pay a tax. The ruler is a lady, styled the rannee, who has a clear revenue of 90,000 pagodas a year, of which she pays one half to the Company, reserving 45,000 for herself. Here is a fort built many years ago by the rannee’s ancestors, but never completed. The palace adjoins it, and is a gloomy building, with lofty walls, and no window on the outside. Near it is the tomb of the rannee’s deceased husband, and a Protestant church of very neat architecture. Betel-nut from Ceylon, and red silk cloths from Bengal, constitute the chief imports; and the exports are piece-goods, cotton, and conch-shells.
