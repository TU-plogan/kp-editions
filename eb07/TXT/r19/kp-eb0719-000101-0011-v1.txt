R or r, a liquid consonant, being the seventeenth letter of our alphabet. Its sound is formed by a guttural extrusion of breath vibrated through the mouth, with a sort of quivering motion of the tongue drawn from the teeth, and canulated with the tip a little elevated towards the palate. In Greek words it is frequently aspirated with an A after it, as in rhapsody, rhetoric, and so forth; otherwise it is always followed by a vowel at the beginning of words and syllables.

In the notes of the ancients, R. or RO. signifies Roma,

R. C. Romana civitas; R. G. C.rei gerendoe causa; R. F. E. D. recte factum et dictum; R. G. F. regis fllius; R. P. res publica, or Romani principes, and R. R. R. F. F. F. res Romana ruet ferro, fame, flamma. Used as a numeral, R anciently stood for 80; and with a dash over it thus κ, for 80,000; but the Greek r, f, with a small mark over it, signified 100; with the same mark under it, it denoted 1000 × 10; thus ρ l signifies 100,000. In the Hebrew numeration 1 denoted 200; and with two horizontal points over it 1000 × 200; thus'S=200,000. Intheprescriptions of physicians, R or R stands for recipe, that is, “take.”
