ROCHEFORT an arrondissement of the department of the Lower Charente, in France, which extends over 295 square miles. It comprises four cantons, divided into forty-two communes, and in 1836 contained 51,727 inhabitants. The capital is a city of the same name, about six miles from the mouth of the river Charente. The harbour is convenient and secure, and constantly contains many men of war. The wharfs are very well contrived, and vessels can take in or discharge the guns and other stores with great facility. It was first made a naval arsenal by Louis XIV. The city is surrounded with walls, and the harbour defended by strong forts. It is a regular, well-built city, with broad streets, containing five churches, a naval hospital, a school of navigation, and fine docks. There were, in 1836, 15,441 inhabitants, besides a garrison in the handsome barracks. There are establishments for making china, for refining sugar, and manufactories of ropes, cables, and sailcloth.
