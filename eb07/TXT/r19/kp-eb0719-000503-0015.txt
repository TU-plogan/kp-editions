RACE in general, signifies running with others in order to obtain a prize, either on foot, or by riding on horseback, in chariots, or otherwise. The race was one of the exercises amongst the ancient Grecian games, which was performed in a course containing one hundred and twenty-five yards; and those who contended in the foot races were Irequently clothed in armour. Chariot and horse races also formed a part of the ancient games. Races were known in England in very early times. Fitzstephen, who wrote in the days of Henry II. mentions the great delight which the citizens of London took in this diversion. From his words, however, it does not appear to have been designed for the purposes of gaming, but merely to have sprung from a generous emulation of showing superior skill in horsemanship. Races appear to have been in vogue in the reign of Elizabeth, and to have been carried to such excess as to injure the fortunes of the nobility. George earl of Cumberland is recorded to have wasted more of his estate than any of his ancestors, and chiefly by his extreme love of horse-races, tiltings, and other expensive diversions.

Race, in genealogy, a lineage or extraction continued from father to son. See Descent.
