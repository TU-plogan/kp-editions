ROWLEY a monk who is said to have flourished at Bristol in the fifteenth century. Of the poems attributed to him various opinions have been entertained, which we have noticed under the article on Chatterton.

Rowley, William, who stands in the third class of dramatic writers, lived in the reign of King Charles I. and received his education at the University of Cambridge; but whether he took any degree there, is not evident, there beng but few particulars preserved in regard to him, except his close intimacy and connection with all the principal wits and poetical geniuses of that age, by whom he was well beloved, and with some of whom he joined in their writings. Wood styles him “the ornament, for wit and ingenuity, of Pembroke Hall in Cambridge.” In a word, he was a very great benefactor to the English stage, having, exclusively of his aid lent to Middleton, Day, Heywood, Webster, and others, left us five plays of his own composition, and one in which even the immortal Shakspeare afforded him some assistance.

Rowley Regis, a town of the parish of Dudley, in Worcestershire, although within the hundred of Seisdon, in Staffordshire, and chiefly inhabited by nail-makers and other workers in iron. The population amounted in 1901 to 5027, in 1811 to 4974, in 1821 to 6062, and in 1831 to 7438.
