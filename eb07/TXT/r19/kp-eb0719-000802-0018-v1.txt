RACK Edmund, a person well known in the literary world by his attachment to, and promotion of, agricultural knowledge. He was a native of Norfolk, and a Quaker. His education was common, and he was originally apprenticed to a shopkeeper. In this situation his society was select, and by improving himself in learning, his conversation was enjoyed by some respectable acquaintance. He wrote many essays, poems, and letters, and some few controversial tracts. His last engagement was the History of Somersetshire, where the parochial surveys were his. This work, in three volumes 4to. was published in 1791, by his colleague, Mr. Collinson. Mr. Rack died of an asthma in February 1787, aged fifty-two.

Rack, an engine of torture, furnished with pulleys, cords, and other means, for extorting confession from criminals. The trial by rack is unknown to the law of England; though once, when the Dukes of Exeter and Suffolk, and other mi-nisters of Henry VI. had formed a design to introduce the civil law into this kingdom as the rule of government, they erected a rack for torture, which was called in derision the Duke of Exeter's Daughter, and still remains in the Tower of London, where it was occasionally used as an engine of state, not of law, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. But when, upon the assassination of Villiers duke of Buckingham, by Felton, it was proposed in the privy council to put the assassin to the rack in order to discover his accomplices, the judges, being consulted, declared unanimously, that no such proceeding was allowable by the laws of England. It seems astonishing that the usage of administering the torture should be said to arise from tenderness to the lives of men; and yet this is the reason assigned for its introduction in the civil law, and its subsequent adoption by the French and other foreign nations, namely, because the laws cannot endure that any man should die upon the evidence of a false or even a single witness, and therefore contrived this method that innocence should manifest itself by a stout denial, or guilt by a plain confession; thus rating a man’s virtue by the hardiness of his constitution, and his guilt by the sensibility of his nerves. The Marquis of Beccaria, in an exquisite piece of raillery, has proposed this problem, with a gravity and precision that are truly mathematical: “The force of the muscles and the sensibility of the nerves of an innocent person being given; it is required to find the degree of pain necessary to make him confess himself guilty of a given crime.”
