ROLLOCK Robert, the first principal of the university of Edinburgh, was the son of David Bollock of Powis, in the vicinity of Stirling. He was born in the year 1555, and was taught the rudiments of the Latin tongue by a per[7:19:315]son then eminent in his profession. From school he was sent to the university of St Andrews, where his progress was so rapid, that he was made professor of philosophy soon after he took the degree of A. M.

The magistrates of Edinburgh having petitioned the king to found a university in that city, they obtained a charter, by which they were allowed all the privileges of a university, which was built in 1582, and Mr Rollock was chosen principal and professor of divinity. He was soon famous in the university on account of his lectures, and among his countrymen at large for his persuasive mode of preaching. In the year 1593, Rollock and others were appointed by parliament to confer with the popish lords; and in the following year he was one of those made choice of by the General Assembly to present his majesty with a paper entitled “The dangers which, through the impunity of excommunicated papists, traffickers with the Spaniards, and other enemies of the religion and state, are imminent to the true religion professed within this realm, his majesty’s person, crown, and liberty of this our native country.” Their zeal against popery was carried to excess, and they seem to have been of opinion, that it was incumbent on the civil magistrate to punish idolatry with death. In the year 1595, he was empowered, along with others, to visit the different universities in Scotland, with a view to inquire into the doctrine and practice of the different masters, the discipline adopted by them, and the state of their rents and living, which they were ordered to report to the next General Assembly.

He was chosen moderator of the General Assembly in the year 1597, at which period he was fortunate enough to obtain the redress of several glaring abuses. The greater part of his life was spent in conducting the affairs of the church, yet Spotswood assures us that he would rather have' preferred retirement and study. Indeed the feebleness of his constitution was not equal to the hurry and bustle of public life, and it led him to prefer the retirement of study. He was very much affected with the stone, the pains of which he bore with the fortitude and resignation of a Christian. He died at Edinburgh on the last day of February 1598, in the forty-third year of his age. Short as his life was, he published many works, of which the following is a catalogue. A Commentary on the first book of Beza’s Questions; on St Paul’s Epistle to the Ephesians; on the prophet Daniel; a Logical Analysis of St Paul’s Epistle to the Romans; some Questions and Answers concerning the Covenant of Grace and the Sacraments; a Treatise of Effectual Calling; a Commentary on the Epistles of Paul to the Thessalonians and Philemon; on fifteen select Psalms; on the Gospel of St John, with a Harmony of the four Evangelists upon theDeath, Resurrection, and Ascension of Jesus Christ; certain Sermons on several places of St Paul’s Epistles; a Commentary on the Epistle to the Colossians; a Logical Analysis of the Epistle to the Hebrews; of the Epistle to the Galatians; a Commentary upon the first two chapters of the first Epistle of St Peter; a Treatise of Justification, and another of Excommunication. AH these, except the Sermons, were written in Latin. Of the pious and learned author, a more particular account may be found in a volume printed under the subsequent title: “De Vita et Morte Roberti Rollok, Academiae Edinburgenae Primarii, Narrationes, auctoribus Georgio Robertson et Henrico Charteris.” Edinb. 1826, 4 to. Robertson’s biographical tract was originally published in 1599. That of Charteris was printed from a manuscript in the public library of the university.
