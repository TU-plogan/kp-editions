RHODE Island, one of the United States of North America, is bounded on the north and east by Massachusetts, on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by Connecticut. It is forty-nine miles in length by twenty-nine in breadth, and contains an area of one thousand three hundred and fifty square miles, which lie between 4L 22. and 42. 3. of north latitude, and longitude 71. 6. and 71. 38. west from Greenwich. This portion of country includes what was formerly known by the name of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, originally constituting two plantations or provinces. Compared with its limited extent, Rhode Island is a very diversified state. In the north-west part the country is hilly and broken, but it becomes gradually level towards the Atlantic Ocean. The state may be divided into three natural sections: the first, constituting four fifths of the whole, is a pretty hilly parallelogram, lying west from Narragansett Bay; the second consists of the delightful islands of Narragansett Bay; and the third section is a small irregular slip lying along Massachusetts, and east from Narragansett This bay extends from north to south through nearly the whole length of the state, and embosoms a number of islands, of which the most important are Rhode Island, Connecticut, Prudence, Patience, Hope, Dyerâ€™s, and Hog Islands. Block Island, in the Atlantic, lying south of the state, is the most southerly land belonging to it. These islands, and the country bordering on the bay, are of great fertility, and are celebrated for their fine cattle, their numerous flocks of sheep, and the abundance and excellence of their butter and cheese. The state generally is better adapted to grazing than tillage. A large portion of the western and northwestern part of it has a thin and lean soil, which affords small crops of New England productions. Cider is made for exportation. Corn, rye, barley, oats, and in some places wheat, are produced in quantities sufficient for home consumption; and the various kinds of grasses, fruits, culinary roots and plants, are in great abundance and perfection. In some parts iron is found in large quantities; copper is also met with; and the state abounds in limestone, particularly the county of Providence. Anthracite coal is wrought on the island which gives name to the state, but itis not held in high estimation. There are several rivers in this state, but their courses are short: the principal are called Pawtucket, Providence, Pawtuxet, Pawcatuc, and Wood Rivers. These, and also the bays, swarm with many varieties of excellent fish. The climate is as salubrious as that of any other part of America, and more temperate than that of the other New England states, particularly on the islands where the ocean breezes have the usual effect of tempering the heat of summer and moderating the cold of winter.

The island called Rhode Island, situated in the bay of Narragansett, and which gives name to the state, is about fifteen miles in length from north to south, and three and a half in breadth. It is divided into three townshlps, Newport, Portsmouth, and Middletown. This island is highly celebrated for its salubrity, and here numbers of invalids resort from southern climates. It is also of great fertility, and noted for its breeds of sheep, neat cattle, and horses. The whole is under high cultivation, and in some months of the year presents so delightful an appearance as to have obtained for it the name of the Eden of America. Long. 71. 20. W. Lat 4L 25. N.

In no state in the Union is so large a proportion of the population and capital employed in manufactures as in Rhode Island. The principal article is cotton goods, for the manufacture of which there are above one hundred mills, many of them extensive establishments. For the year ending September 1836, there were eighty sets of machinery in operation for the manufacture of other kinds of goods, including broad cloths, satinets, jeans, linseys, and the like. The quantity of wool produced was 265,261 pounds, valued at 133,957 dollars. Iron, ardent spirits, and some other articles, are likewise amongst the manufactures of Rhode Island. The exports consist chiefly of flax-seed, lumber, horses, cattle, beef, pork, fish, poultry, and cotton and linen goods. For the year ending September 1836, the exports of domestic produce were to the amount of 212,297 dollars, and of foreign produce 16,123 dollars; the total value of exports being 228,420 dollars, which appears to be considerably less than in some previous years. The value of the imports for the same period was 555,199 dollars. The amount of shipping of this state may be reckoned at about fifty thousand tons; but so rapidly have commerce and manufactures extended, that a period of only a couple of years is sufficient to produce an increase in these branches of industry which could not have been looked for in such a limited space of time. In 1837 the banks were sixty-two in number, having specie to the amount of 243,482 dollars, a circulation of 1,864,132 dollars, and a capital of 9,837,171 dollars.

Amongst the institutions of Rhode Island is Brown University, at Providence, a flourishing seminary. Academies are established in all the principal towns, and the state pays ten thousand dollars per annum for the support of free schools. The most numerous religious sect is that of the Baptists, who have about eighteen churches. There are, besides, the usual religious diversities which characterise a North American state, including many Friends.

Among the public works of this state may be mentioned the New York, Providence, and Boston Railway, extending from Stonington in Connecticut to Providence in Rhode Island. About forty miles of it lie in the latter state. It is connected with another railroad, and forms part of a line from Boston to New York. Other works of the kind are in progress.

The population of Rhode Island in 1839 may be estimated as amounting to at least 125,000. The capital of the state is Providence, an account of which will be found under that head.

Newport, which shares metropolitan honours with the capital, being the seat of government every alternate session, is beautifully situated on the south-west end of the island of Rhode Island, five miles from the sea, and in latitude 4L 29. north, and longitude 71. 21. west. The town lies north and south, upon a gradual ascent east from the water, and exhibits a beautiful view from the harbour and the neighbouring hills. The principal street is more than a mile in length. The harbour, which spreads westward in front of the town, is one of the finest in the world, and spacious enough to allow a large fleet to anchor and ride in perfect security. The entrance is safe and easy, and it is defended by three strong forts. Newport contains a state-house, a jail, several banks and insurance offices, a valuable public library, and houses of worship for most of the religious denominations that are found in New England. A very elegant building is appropriated to the library. This town is famous for the salubrity of its climate, and more noted than any other American town for the variety and excellence of its fresh fish. Newport was first settled in 1636, and before the American revolution had attained to considerable commercial importance. During that war it suffered severely, being for a long time occupied by the British. It maintains some trade with the East Indies, Europe, and Cuba; but the most important branch of its commerce is the coasting trade with the middle and southern states. Its fisheries are very valuable. The population of Newport in 1839 may be estimated at about 10,000.

Pawtucket is a flourishing town, partly situated in that part of this state called North Providence, partly in Massachusetts. It is noted for the number and extent of its manufactories, which are situated near a fine cascade on the river Pawtucket. This town contains several public buildings, two or three banks, more than twelve cotton factories, and as many others of different kinds. This is reckoned one of the most flourishing manufacturing villages in the United States. The population may be about 5000. Bristol is a neat commercial town, situated on the east side of Narragansett Bay. It has a safe and commodious harbour, owns a good deal of shipping, and is a place of considerable trade. The population at present ( 1839) may be about 4000. Warren, South Kingston, East Greenwich, Smithfield, Portsmouth, and Warwick, are the only other places of any note. The last-named town contains above 6000 inhabitants.

The settlement of this state was commenced at Providence in the year 1636, by Roger Williams, a person of some celebrity in the annals of America. He was banished from Massachusetts on account of the religious doctrines which he preached. Two years afterwards the settlement of the island of Rhode Island was begun. In 1643 Williams went to England, and in the following year obtained a charter by which Rhode Island and Providence Plantations were united under one government. This writ continued in force till 1663, when a new charter was granted by Charles II., and this document has ever since formed the basis of the government. This state is the only one in the Union which is without a written constitution, according to the American form of these things. The legislative power is vested in a general assembly, consisting of a senate and a house of representatives. The latter consists of seventy-two members, six from Newport, four from each of the towns of Providence, Portsmouth, and Warwick, and two from each of the other towns in the state. They are elected semi-annually in April and August. The senate consists of ten members, who are elected annually in April. The executive power is vested in a governor; and a lieutenant-governor is elected along with him, on whom the duties of the executive devolve in case of the office of governor being vacated. The other officers of government are a secretary of state, a treasurer, and an attorney-general. The general assembly meets four times a year; at Newport on the first Wednesday in May, at the same place in June; at Providence and South Kingston alternately in October; and in January at East Greenwich, Bristol, or Providence. The judiciary power is vested in a supreme court, and a court of common pleas for each of the five counties. AU the judges are appointed annually by the general assembly. A chief justice and two associate justices preside in the supreme court. Each of the courts of common pleas comprises five judges. Rhode Island has a well-constituted militia force, which is called out for duty twice a year. (r. r. r.)
