RAGUSA. A circle in the Austrian province of Dalmatia, composed of what was formerly the independent state of that name, of the peninsula of Sabioncello, and of several islands on the shores of the Adriatic. It was formerly an aristocratical republic, with the peasants feudatories to the nobles; and its constitution was under the guarantee of the Sultan, of the king of the two Sicilies, and of the republic of Venice. When, in the course of the war, the French took possession of the district, the bondage of the labourers was lightened, and when it was ceded to Austria by the congress of Vienna in 1815, the freedom of all was secured. The circle is 1232 square miles in extent, and contains about 50,000 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, the Rausium of antiquity. It is situated in a small bay which forms an excellent haven, from being protected by the island of St. Locromo. It is surrounded with walls, and the gates which, under the old aristocracy, were only opened a few hours each day, now constantly afford ingress and egress to strangers and inhabitants. There is a fine palace formerly the residence of the chief, the cathedral ot a Catholic archbishop, several monasteries and churches for both Catholics and Greeks, a college, an hospital, 1280 houses, and 7450 inhabitants, who are employed in building ships, in manufacturing silk, and in making soap, snuff, and various cordials. There are belonging to the port more than 300 vessels, of which about thirty’ are equipped for distant voyages. This place is celebrated for having given birth to the celebrated Jesuit and mathematician Boscovich. Lat. 42. 36. 40. Long. 18. 6. 25. E.
