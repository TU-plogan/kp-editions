RE an island on the coast of France, in the department of La V endée, and the arrondissement of Rochelle. It stands about seven miles from the mainland, has a very irregular shape, is eleven miles in length, and in the widest part three miles in breadth. The chief town is St Martins, which has 3000 inhabitants, and is defended by a strong citadel. The soil is fertile, yielding abundance of grapes, which are mostly used to make brandy; and on the shore much salt is made. There are two other towns, called La Flotte and Ars, of more than 3000 inhabitants each; and the whole population of the island amounts to 18,540. It was attacked by the English in the reign of Charles I., after the Duke of Buckingham’s unsuccessful attempt to relieve Rochelle in 1627, but was able to resist. Long. 1. 33. 25. E. Lat. 46. 14. 47. N.
