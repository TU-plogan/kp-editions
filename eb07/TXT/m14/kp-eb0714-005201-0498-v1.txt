MALACHI, or the prophecy of Malachi, a canonical book of the Old Testament, and the last of the twelve lesser [7:14:53] prophets. Malachi prophesied about 300 years ^before Christ, reproving the Jews for their wickedness after their return from Babylon, charging them with rebellion, sacrilege, adultery, profaneness, and infidelity; condemning the priests for being scandalously careless in their ministry; and at the same time not forgetting to encourage the pious few, who, in that corrupt age, had maintained their integrity. This prophet distinctly points at the Messiah, who was suddenly to come to his temple, and to be introduced by Elijah the prophet, that is, John the Baptist, who came in the spirit and power of Elias or Elijah.
