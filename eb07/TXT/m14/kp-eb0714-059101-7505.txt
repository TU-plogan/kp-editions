MERCATOR, Gerard, one of the most celebrated geographers of his time, was born at Ruremonde in 1512. He applied himself with such industry to geography and mathematics, that he is said to have frequently forgotten to eat and drink. The emperor Charles V. had a particular· esteem for him, and the Duke de Juliers made him his cosmographer. He composed a chronology, some geographical tables, and an atlas, having engraved and coloured the maps himself. He died in 1594. His method of laying down charts is still used, and bears the name of Mercator’s charts. Mercator, Nicholas, an eminent mathematician of the seventeenth century, was born at Holstein in Denmark, and came about the time of the Restoration to England, where he lived many years. He was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society, and endeavoured to reduce astrology to rational principles. He published several works, particularly Cosmographia. He also gave the quadrature of the hyperbola by an infinite series, which was the first instance in the learned world of a series of this sort derived from the particular nature of the curve, and that in a manner equally new and refined.

Mercator’s Sailing is that which is performed by Mercator’s chart.
