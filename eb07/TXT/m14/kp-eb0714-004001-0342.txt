MAHON, a city in the island of Minorca, in the Mediterranean Sea, the Portus Magonis of the ancients, said to have derived its name from the Carthaginian general Mago, and now conferring its name on the eldest son of the Earl of Stanhope, whose gallant ancestor took it during the war of the Spanish succession. Before England had obtained possession of Malta, this place, on account of its harbour, was deemed an object of the greatest importance to the maintenance of our naval power in the Mediterranean; and during the late war it was of great use as long as a British fleet was blockading the French port of Toulon. This valuable haven is easily accessible, having a depth of from fourteen fathoms at the entrance to six fathoms at the best anchoring place, which is within two cablesâ€™ length of the town of Mahon. The ground is clear of rocks, and very good for the anchor holding. It is well defended by strong forts at the entrance, and indeed in every part. The city is well and regularly built, with a fine parade ground, where the college of the naval cadets, removed from Madrid in 1808, is situated. In the suburbs are an extensive naval arsenal, a marine hospital capable of receiving 700 sick, and a lazaretto for performing quarantine. The forts constructed by the English, called Fort St Philip and Fort Marlborough, have been demolished. The city stands in longitude 4. 21. east, and in latitude 39. 52. 20. north. Including the suburbs, it contains 6000 inhabitants, who carry on the fishery, and what little trade there is in the island; but it chiefly depends upon the expenditure of the arsenal.
