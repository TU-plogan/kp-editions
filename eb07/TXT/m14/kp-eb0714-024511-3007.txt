MARGARITA, an island off the coast of Colombia, in South America, situated in 64. west longitude and 11. 30. north latitude. It is about thirty-five leagues in circumference, generally of a mountainous nature, little cultivated, and chiefly valued on account of the pearl fisheries on the coast. A ridge of impassable mountains extends through its centre from one extremity to the other, across which there is but one road, cut by the natives, with a drawbridge at the summit of the mountain, which, when let down, admits only a single file of men to pass at a time. The valleys are the only parts cultivated, the rest of the island being extremely barren. The principal productions are the sugar cane, which grows in great abundance, the cotton plant, tobacco, the cassava root, of which a coarse bread is made, maize or Indian corn, and a variety of tropical fruits. Part of the soil is fertile, and affords very good pasturage, but the whole island is destitute of water, which the inhabitants are obliged to transport from the mainland. The natives are a brave and hospitable race, eager to perform any office of kindness to strangers. They are addicted to no excesses, but are hardy, abstemious, and showed great courage in the defence of their country during the war of the revolution. The principal wealth of the island consists in the pearl fisheries, which are worked by negroes. Considerable quantities of turtle are found; and there is an immense number of fish, which are salted, and find a ready market upon the continent. They weave an extremely fine cotton cloth, which is considered as an object of luxury. The principal towns are, Pampatar, situated on the side next the mainland, and Juan Griego, situated on the opposite side. They are of no extent, and are principally inhabited by persons engaged in the fisheries. During the war of independence, this island was considered of great importance as a military station, from its affording a secure rendezvous for either troops or ships. Accordingly many endeavours were made by the Spanish government to recover it. In 1816 General Morillo landed with a force of 17,000 men, but it was so bravely defended[7:14:246] by the inhabitants, that he was obliged to evacuate it, with the loss of upwards of 10,000 men. By these attacks , the population was greatly reduced, but it still amounts to about 15,000.

The Straits of Margarita, or the channel by which the island is separated from Terra Firma, is about twenty-four miles broad. From the rocky island of Coche, lying between it and the mainland, it is not navigable in its whole length, there being left only a narrow pass of about six miles, which, however, is seldom dangerous, owing to the calmness which generally prevails in this part of the Caribbean Sea.
