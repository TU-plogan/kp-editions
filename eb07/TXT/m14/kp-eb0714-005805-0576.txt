MALMSBURY, an ancient town of the county of Wilts, in the hundred of its own name, ninety-five miles from London. It is said to have had, as early as the year 600, a monastic institution for females, which was afterwards converted into a stately abbey, and was richly endowed till the suppression of the religious houses in the reign of Henry VIII. A part of the ancient abbey has been converted into the parish church. The town is almost surrounded by the river Avon, on which there was anciently a castle. It formerly returned two members to parliament, but now elects only one. It has given birth to two celebrated men, William of Malmsbury the historian, and Hobbes the philosopher. There is a market, which is held on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1571, in 1811 to 1746, in 1821 to 2145, and in 1831 to 2293.
