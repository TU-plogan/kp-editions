MESS, in a military sense, implies a number of soldiers, who, by laying up a certain proportion of their pay towards provisions, mess together. Experience proves that nothing contributes more to the health of a soldier than a regular and well chosen diet, and his being obliged every day to boil the pot. It corrects drunkenness, and in a great measure prevents gaming and desertion.
