MALVERN, a parish in the county of Worcester and hundred of Pershore. It is situated on the range of hills of that name, which contains mineral springs, owing to which, together with the purity of the air and the beauty of the prospects, it is much visited. There are in the two parts excellent accommodations, both in private and in public houses. The church of an ancient and magnificent monastery still remains, and is used for parochial worship. The population amounted in 1801 to 819, in 1811 to 1205, in 1821 to 1568, and in 1831 to 2010.
