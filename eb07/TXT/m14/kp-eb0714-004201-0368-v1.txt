MAIDENHEAD, a market-town of the county of Berks and hundred of Cookham, twenty-six miles from London. It is finely situated on the river Thames, over which is a beautiful bridge. The town is not a parish, but stands in two, viz. Bray and Cookham. It was incorporated by James I., and was governed by a mayor and ten aldermen, who acted as justices of the peace; but, by the municipal corporation reform law passed in 1835, these are superseded by four aidermen and twelve councillors, without any justice of the peace. In the vicinity arc many fine seats of the nobility and gentry. There is a well-supplied market on Wednesday. Being on the great western road, there is much travelling through the town, and several good inns. From being in two parishes and two hundreds, the decennial returns do not indicate the population; but the number of inhabitants may amount to about 3100.
