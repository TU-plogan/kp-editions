MARATTI, Carlo, a celebrated painter, was born at Camorano, near Ancona, in 1625. He went a poor boy to Rome when only eleven years of age; and at twelve recommended himself so effectually to Andrea Sacchi, by his drawings after Raffaelle in the Vatican, that he took him into his school, where he continued twenty-five years, that is, until his master’s death. His graceful and beautiful ideas occasioned his being generally employed in painting madonnas and female saints. No man ever painted in a better style, or with greater elegance. From the finest statues and pictures, he made himself master of the most perfect forms, and the finest positions of heads, which he sketched with equal case and grace. He has produced a noble variety of draperies, more artfully managed and more richly ornamented than the best of the moderns. He was inimitable in adorning the heads, in the disposal of the hair, and the elegance of his hands and feet, which are equal to those of Raffaelle himself; and he particularly excelled in gracefulness. In his younger days he etched a few prints with equal spirit and correctness. It would be endless to recount the celebrated paintings executed by this great artist. Yet he did nothing slightly, and often changed his designs, though almost always for the better; whence his pictures were long in hand. In imitation of his master, he made several admirable portraits of popes, cardinals, and other persons of distinction, from whom he received the highest testimonies of esteem, as he likewise did from almost all the monarchs and princes of Europe. This great painter died at Rome in 1713, in the eightyeighth year of his age.
