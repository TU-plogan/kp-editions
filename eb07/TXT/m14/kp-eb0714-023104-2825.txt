MANEGE, the exercise of riding the great horse, or the ground set apart for that purpose, which is sometimes covered for continuing the exercise in bad weather, and sometimes open in order to give more liberty and freedom both to the horseman and horse. The word is borrowed from the French man√®ge, and that from the Italian maneggio, or, as some think, a manu agendo, acting with the hand.
