MENTZ, a considerable town of Germany, in the circle of the Lower Rhine, and capital of the late electorate of the same name, is situated on the Rhine near its confluence with the Maine, twenty miles north-west of Worms, fifteen west of Francfort, and seventy-five east of Triers, in E. long. 8. 20. N. lat.40.51.

Mentz, called by the Germans Mainz or Maynz, and by the French Mayence, is a city in the Rhenish province of Hesse-Darmstadt, but is garrisoned and ruled, as far as regards military affairs, by the German confederation. It is situated on the left bank of the Rhine, over which there is abridge of boats 1720 feet long, connecting it with the fortifications of Cassel. It is one of the most powerful defences of Germany on the side towards France, for besides its walls, it has a citadel and several strong forts, with no less than twenty-seven bastions. It is an ancient city, the Mogun-tium of the Romans; but though well built in some parts, it is in others in a ruinous state· It is the see of a Catholic bishop, whose cathedral is a very striking object, both from its size and the monuments and other antiquities. It contains eleven other churches, and several public buildings remarkable for their antiquity rather than their beauty. The city contains 2165 houses, and about 25,000 civil inhabitants, of whom one-third are said to be in a state of great destitution. There are a few manufactures on a small scale, but a considerable trade in wine, timber, and other goods, is carried on by the Rhine. The vicinity is fruitful in corn, and produces excellent wine.
