MARACAY, a town of Venezuela, in South America. The principal street is more than half a mile in length, and many of the houses are built of stone, and have gardens attached to them. It is situated near the eastern end of the lake of Valencia, but not immediately upon it. Fine plantatione, surround it on every side, and there is about it an airâ€™of prosperity and activity, which is said to arise from work being here chiefly performed by free labourers, the use of slaves being little known. The population has been estimated at 10,000.
