MAHE, a town of Hindustan, on the sea-coast of the Malabar province, and the principal French settlement on the coast. It is situated at a short distance from Tellicherry, on the banks of a river, which is navigable for large boats a considerable way up the country. Small vessels can also cross the bar, where there is a secure harbour. The town was formerly neat, and contained many good houses; but it had been long in a decaying condition, until the British commercial residency was removed to it from Tellicherry. The principal export is pepper, which is produced in abundance in the surrounding country. It was taken possession of by the French in 1722, but was retaken by the British in 1761. It was restored at the peace of Paris in 1763, but was again taken in 1793, and has since been retained. It is situated in long. 75. 38. E. and lat. 11. 42. N.
