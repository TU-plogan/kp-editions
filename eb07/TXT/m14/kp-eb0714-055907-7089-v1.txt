MENEHOUD, St., an arrondisement of the department of the Marne in France. It extends over 476 square miles, and contains 32,500 inhabitants. It is divided into three cantons, and subdivided into fifty-two communes. The capital, of the same name, stands on an island of the river Aisme, where the smaller river Auve falls into it. It contains 750 houses and 3600 inhabitants, who make some thread lace, and trade extensively in fire-wood. This place has become celebrated from its being the spot where the united armies of Austria and Prussia received the first check, when invading France m the autumn of the year 1792.
