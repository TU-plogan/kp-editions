MASSUAH, a town of Egypt, situated on an island of the Red Sea, not more than three quarters of a mile in length. The houses are built chiefly of wooden poles and thatch; but a few are composed of a kind of stone, in which shells are embedded. When the commerce with India flowed through this channel, the trade of Massuah was very extensive; but it declined, and the town fell into decay, when the Turks, who had subjugated it, established there an arbitrary and barbarous government. It has since rapidly declined in importance; but its situation necessarily enables it to command some trade, by rendering it the only mart for the commodities which Abyssinia produces. Its intercourse is almost entirely with Mocha and Jidda, on the opposite coast; and from these ports it brings India cotton, wool, and piece-goods, European iron, copper, and manufactured articles, to the amount of about 400,000 dollars annually. The exports are the usual African staples, rhinocerosâ€™horns, gold, ivory, honey, slaves, and wax. Massuah is governed by a naybe, who has now acquired an almost independent authority, and levies ten per cent, ad valorem on all goods which pass through the place.
