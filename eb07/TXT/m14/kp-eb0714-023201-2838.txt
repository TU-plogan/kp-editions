MANFREDONIA, a city and sea-port of the kingdom of Naples, in the province of Capitanata, situated on the bay of the same name in the Adriatic. The harbour is protected by a mole, but is fit only for small vessels. It is the seat of an archbishop, whose cathedral is near the city, upon the site of the ancient Sipontum. The city is well built, with broad streets and good houses, and contains 5169 inhabitants, who cultivate and export both corn and wine.
