MELINDA, a kingdom on the east coast of Africa, situated, according to some, between the third and fourth degree of south latitude; though there is great disagreement amongst geographers as to its extent. It is allowed by all, however, that the coasts are very dangerous; being full of rocks and shelves, and the sea at some seasons very liable to tempests. The kingdom of Melinda is for the most part rich and fertile; producing almost all the necessaries of life except wheat and rice, both which are brought thither from Cambaya and other parts; and those who cannot purchase them make use of potatoes in their stead, which are here fine, large, and plentiful. They likewise abound with great variety of fruit trees, roots, plants, and other esculents, and with melons of exquisite flavour. They have also great plenty of venison, game, oxen, sheep, hens, geese, and other poultry, and one breed of sheep, whose tails weigh between thirty and forty pounds. The capital city is also called Melinda.
