MEMEL, a city of the province of East Prussia, in the government of Königsberg. It is the capital of a circle of the same name, which extends over 621 square miles, and contains, besides the city, five parishes, with 33,600 inhabitants. The city is situated on a peninsula at the mouth of the Curish Haff, on the river Dange, which empties itself into the Baltic Sea. The harbour is partly in the river and partly in an extensive basin, and both are capable of receiving more than 700 large ships, such as are required for the timber trade, which is the principal commerce of the [7:14:556]place, and for which it is advantageously situated. The city is strongly fortified, and forms the chief defence of the frontier towards Russia. It is divided into the old city, the , Fredrick’s city, and the suburbs. It has a citadel, two Lutheran churches, one reformed, and one Catholic, an hospital and school of industry, and 680 houses, mostly large, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Besides the trade in timber already noticed, much com, flax, hemp, and potash is exported. There are some linen and several leather manufactories, several breweries and distilleries, and many mills for sawing timber. The chief exports are to England and Holland, whence are derived the supplies of sugar and other colonial articles. Lat. 55.42.15. N. Long. 21.1. 0. E.
