MANNHEIM, a city in the grand duchy of Baden, in the circle of the Neckar. It stands at the influx of that river into the Rhine, and has a bridge of boats over the latter river, the joint property of the states of Bavaria and Baden. It was formerly fortified, but the walls and ditches have, since 1796, been converted into pleasing promenades. It is well and regularly built, the streets crossing each other at right angles; and it is better paved than most of the continental towns. Being a second capital of the duchy, it has a fine palace, fronting to the Rhine, 750 feet in length, with a corps de logis of elegance, and a pavilion of five stories. Within this building is a splendid collection of antique and modern statuary, of casts in plaster of Paris, of copperplates, drawings, autographs, and a part of the ducal library, still amounting to 70,000 volumes. The building next to tire palace in magnificence is the college formerly belonging to the Jesuits, now occupied by secular priests. There are several public edifices, churches, hospitals, the council-house, the mint, the exchange, and others, which attest the former magnificence rather than the present prosperity of the city. In 1816, it contained 1526 dwelling-houses, and about 18,000 civil with 2500 military inhabitants; but they are said to have decreased since that period. There are various manufactures, such as are to be found in a capital, chiefly of articles of luxury. Gold and silver ware, jewellery, engravers, musical-instrument makers, and booksellers, are the most prominent. This city has some shipping trade on the Rhine, and has several large fairs, but its commerce is inconsiderable. It is in long. 8. 27. 34. E. and lat. 49. 29. N.
