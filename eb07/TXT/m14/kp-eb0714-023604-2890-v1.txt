MANSOURA, a large town of Lower Egypt, built by the Saracens as a bulwark against the invasion of the Christians during the wars of the Crusades. Dr Pococke supposes it to be the Zoan or Tanis of the ancients. It is celebrated in the history of the Crusades for two great battles fought near it, in one of which St Louis was defeated and taken prisoner. Mansoura is beautifully situated on a somewhat high bank of the Nile, and adorned with numerous mosques. Though of considerable extent, it is now unfortified, and a fourth part of it is in ruins. The houses are built of brick, and the streets are narrow. The trade is chiefly carried on by Syrian Christians, who export the fine rice which grows round Lake Menzaleh, and sal-ammoniac. Mansoura lies twenty-four miles southsouth-west of Damietta.
