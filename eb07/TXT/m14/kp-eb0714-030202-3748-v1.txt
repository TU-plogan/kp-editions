MASSACHUSETTS, oneofthe United StatesofNorth America, is bounded on the north by New Hampshire and Vermont, on the south by Connecticut and Rhode Island, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by the state of New York. It extends from long. 69. 50. to 73. 10. and from lat. 41. 23. to 43. 52. being 180 miles in length from east to west, and ninety-six miles in breadth from north to south. The mean width is about fifty miles, and the area about 7500 square miles. This state presents a surface pleasantly undulated with hills and valleys, and is naturally divided into three distinct zones. The first, stretching along the sea-shore, and extending twenty miles into the interior, is a belt of marine alluvium, little elevated above the ocean, and naturally fertile only at intervals. This plain is succeeded by a fine hilly tract, which crosses the state from north to south, and from which rivers are poured in every direction. The second or middle zone includes part of the beautiful valley of Connecticut, and is followed by the mountainous but highly fertile county of Berkshire, which comprises the whole western part of the state. The soil of Massachusetts is exceedingly various, comprising every description, from the most sterile to the most productive. In the eastern and south-eastern parts it is in general light and sandy, interspersed, however, with numerous fertile tracts. Towards the sea-coast ôn the north it is of better quality, though not distinguished for fertility. By careful cultivation, however, both this and other parts of the state have been rendered highly productive. The middle and western regions have for the most part a strong, rich soil, excellent for grazing, and suited to most other agricultural purposes. Viewed at a glance, the surface of this state swells from the Atlantic Ocean to the hills, then sinks into the richly decorated valley of Connecticut, and again rises into the mountainous region of Berkshire. The principal mountains are a part of the Green Mountain range, which stretches from north to south through the western part of the state. The most elevated summits of this ridge are Saddle Mountain, near the north-western angle of the state, and Tahconick on the western border. These mountains present a great variety of beautiful and impressive scenery, noble elevations alternating with dark green forests and pleasant well-sheltered valleys. Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke, near the Connecticut River, are remarkable elevations, which from their summits afford a beautiful prospect of the surrounding country. A second ridge passes through the state near its centre. The greatest elevation of this ridge is that of Wachuset, in the town of Princeton. The state abounds in small lakes, which are generally called ponds. The largest of these are the Assa-wapset and Long Ponds in Middleburgh, Podunk and Quabang Ponds in Brookfield, and the Naukeag Ponds in Ashburnham. The last named are situated more than 1100 feet above the level of the sea, and several other ponds in the western part of the state have a still higher elevation. Massachusetts has no very large rivers wholly within its bounds. The Connecticut traverses it from north to south, and is navigable by steam-boats of small draught. The Merrimac passes out of New Hampshire into the northern division of the state, and empties itself into the sea at Newburyport. The Housatonic, Charles, Ipswich, Concord, Blackstone, Miller’s, Chickopee, Deerfield, Westfield, Neponset, and Taunton, though they have short courses, are pleasant streams. Indeed no country is better provided with rivers and streams which flow in all directions, and afford abundance of water for every necessary purpose. The rivers abound in falls, admirably adapted for mill-sites appropriated to manufacturing operations.

Every product which the northern states furnish, and much that is not indigenous to the soil and climate, have been naturalized in Massachusetts by skill and careful cultivation. The principal productions are Indian corn, rye, wheat, oats, barley, peas, beans, buck-wheat, potatoes, hops, [7:14:303] flax, and hemp. Beef, pork, butter, and cheese, are abundant in most parts of the state, and of excellent quality; the county of Berkshire in particular is distinguished for its extensive dairies. This state is particularly celebrated for its orchards, where the finest fruits are produced in abundance. Those principally cultivated are apples, peaches, pears, quinces, plums, cherries, and currants. Great quantities of cider are annually made, and this constitutes the common beverage of the inhabitants. There are several valuable mines in Massachusetts. Bog-iron ore is found in several parts, and there are numerous establishments for working it. There is a lead mine in Southampton county, to which a subterranean passage of one thousand feet has been opened, chiefly through solid rock; but the cheapness of lead from Missouri and Illinois has suspended operations in this mine. There are inexhaustible quarries of marble and limestone, and an abundance of granite of the best description for building. Soapstone, slate, ochre, and other mineral productions, are also to be met with in various parts.

There are a greater number of individuals engaged in commerce in this than in any other state in the Union. It shares in the greater proportion of the bank and whale fisheries of the United States. This pursuit employs many thousands of men, furnishes one of the most important items in these parts of the states, and trains vast numbers of intrepid and experienced mariners. The shipping is more extensive than that of any other state; and, in the extent of its foreign commerce, Massachusetts is second only to New York. The principal articles of export are fish, beef, pork, lumber, ardent spirits, flax-seed, whale oil, spermaceti, and various manufactures. The latter are numerous, the principal being those of cotton cloths, boots and shoes, ardent spirits, leather, cordage, wrought and cast iron, nails, woollens, straw bonnets, hats, cabinet-work, paper, oil, and muskets There is an extensive national establishment for the manufacture of arms at Springfield.

There being no large rivers in Massachusetts to facilitate intercourse with the interior country, a number of artificial channels of communication have been constructed The Middlesex Canal leaves the Merrimac Canal above its lower falls, and terminates at Charlestown, opposite Boston, being about twenty-seven miles in length. Concord River crosses the line of the canal on the summit-level, twenty-two miles from Charlestown, and five from the junction of the canal with the Merrimac, thus affording an ample supply of water and lockage in both directions. Round the falls in Connecticut River, at South Hadley, there is a canal cut through the solid rock, more than forty feet deep, and three hundred feet long. There are other falls on the Connecticut, above and below South Hadley, which have been overcome by canals, dams, and ι other improvements, so that the river is now navigable for boats through the whole of its course in this state, and as high as Bath in New Hampshire. The Blackstone Canal is about forty-five miles in length, extending from Provi-lence to Worcester, and has been in operation for several /ears. The Farmington Canal extends from the city of Newhaven to the south line of Massachusetts, where it s connected with the Hampshire and Hampden Canal, vhich goes to Northampton on the Connecticut River, a ’ listance of about thirty-five miles. A great number of umpike roads have been constructed by companies incor- ∙orated by the legislature of the state. These public works ntersect the country in every direction, and have greatly xcilitated the trade of the state, without, however, being productive of much emolument to the proprietors. A railroad of three miles in length has been constructed at Quincy, for the purpose of transmitting the valuable granite of that town to the navigable port of Boston Harbour. Three railroads have been very recently constructed from Boston, one to the town of Lowell, a distance of about twenty-five miles; another to Worcester, forty miles long; and a third to Providence, about the same length. From Providence a railroad was commenced in 1833 to Stovington in Connecticut, a distance of about forty-eight miles. Amongst the public improvements of various kinds which have been made, may be mentioned the numerous bridges over the Connecticut and other rivers, and over the arms of Boston Harbour.

The principal literary institution is Harvard University, at Cambridge, three miles west by north of Boston. It is the most wealthy as well as the most ancient institution of the kind in the United States, having been founded in 1638, less than twenty years after the settlement of New England. It has a president, eight professors, and six tutors and other teachers, besides four professors of the medical school and two of the law school. It has a library containing above 36,000 volumes of choice books, a large and valuable cabinet of minerals, an excellent anatomical museum, a complete set of philosophical apparatus, a botanic garden, and other necessary adjuncts of a university. William’s College in William’s Town, in the north-west corner of the state, was incorporated in 1793; and Amherst College in Hampshire county in 1825. They have each a president, and several professors and tutors. At Andover there is a richly endowed and flourishing theological seminary; and also an academy, the best endowed and most distinguished in the state. There are, besides, a great number of other academies throughout Massachusetts, and common schools are universally established at the public expense. The laws require that every town or district containing fifty families shall be provided with a school or schools equivalent in time to six months for one school in a year, one containing a hundred families twelve months, and so on; and the several towns in the state are authorized and directed to raise such sums of money as are necessary for the support of the schools, and to assess and collect the money in the same manner as other town taxes. Each town is also required to choose annually a school committee of three, five, or seven persons, to take the general charge and superintendence of the public schools. The charitable and other establishments are too numerous to be particularly specified. In respect to education, there is no country in which it is more strictly attended to, or more universally diffused. Religious sects are of course numerous in Massachusetts. The Congregationalists have 491 churches, and 423 ordained ministers, of whom 118 are Unitarians; the Baptists have 129 churches, the Methodists seventy-one preachers, the Universalists forty-six societies, the Episcopalians thirty-one ministers, the New Jerusalem church eight societies, the Presbyterians nine ministers, the Roman Catholics four churches, and the Shakers four societies.

There are now no slaves in this state, nor was their number ever very considerable. Previously to the declaration of independence, public opinion was strongly expressed against slavery. The first article in the declaration of rights contained in the general constitution is, that “all men are born free and equal and this was decided by the supreme court of Massachusetts, in 1783, to be equivalent to an abolition of slavery, which was accordingly carried into effect.

In the vicinity of Boston there are a great number of beautiful villages, some of them large enough to be classed in the rank of towns. Amongst these may be mentioned Roxbury, Dorchester, Milton, Cambridge, Waţerton, Medford, Chelsea, and Lynn. Salem, situated thirteen miles north-east of Boston, is built on a projection of land formed by two arms of the sea called North and South Rivers. Over the former is a bridge more than fifteen hundred feet in length, connecting Salem with the populous town of Beverley. The South River forms the harbour, which has good anchorage, but contains only about twelve feet of water. The situation of the town is low, but healthy. It is ŵell built, partly of brick, and many of the houses are large and elegant, with gardens attached to them. Salem contains a court-house, jail, alms-house, market-house, East India marine museum, and a lyceum. It has eight banks, five insurance companies, one mutual insurance company, and an institution for savings. There are two libraries, an athenaeum containing 6000 volumes, and a mechanics’ library. Three halfweekly and two weekly papers are published. There are two white-lead factories, sixteen tanneries, eleven rope and twine factories, and a chemical laboratory. There are a number of places of worship for various religious· sects, and great attention is paid to the education of youth. In 1801 a society was incorporated, composed of such persons as had sailed from this port round the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn in the capacity of masters or supercargoes of vessels. This East India Marine Society is designed to afford relief to indigent members or their families, and to promote the knowledge of navigation and trade to the East Indies, upon which Salem principally depends, and in which it has a large amount of capital embarked. This town is the second in Massachusetts in point of population, and probably also in respect of wealth; but New Bedford now surpasses it in its amount of shipping, and Lowell and some other towns greatly exceed it in manufactures.

Lowell, the chief seat of the cotton manufacture in the United States, is situated twenty-five miles north-west from Boston, at the confluence of the rivers Merrimac and Concord. It was formerly a section of the town of Chelmsford, and derives its name from Francis Lowell, who introduced the manufacture of cotton into the state. It contains a number of churches and public buildings, and has had a very rapid growth, having risen into manufacturing importance only of late years. The source of its riches and power is the water of the Merrimac, which is conducted to the town by a canal one mile and a half in length, eight feet deep, and sixty wide, distributed by lateral branches, and again discharged either into the Merrimac or Concord, the fall being thirty-two feet. Lowell communicates with Boston by a canal and a railway. The manufactures comprehend those of cotton and woollen of various kinds, gunpowder, and other articles. The chief manufacturing establishment is that of the Merrimac Company, which, in 1832, employed four hundred males and nine hundred females, and had one thousand looms and twenty-six thousand spindles at work. In 1833 there were in Lowell altogether 3494 looms and 97,400 spindles, which gave employment to 1155 males and 4595 females. The number of bales manufactured per annum was 32,607, or 36,044,000 yards. Of the thirty-six millions of yards of cloth made, eight millions were printed. Including the printed goods, which sell at twenty and twenty-eight cents, the whole may be calculated at ten cents per yard, making about three and a half millions of dollars per annum. Lowell is connected with the village Belvedere by a bridge over the river Concord, the water of which is also employed in giving motion to machinery. Seven newspapers are published, one of which is a daily print. There are no less than forty religious and benevolent societies, an unusually large number for the population of the place, but probably arising from the zeal of the religious sects to outvie each other in good deeds. By the census of 1832, the population amounted to 10,254.

Marblehead is situated on a peninsula extending more than three miles into Massachusetts Bay, and varying in breadth from one to two miles. It is four miles and a half [7:14:305] south-east of Salem, and sixteen north-east of Boston, ir latitude 42. 32. north, longitude 70. 51. west. The town is compactly built, but the streets are crooked and irregular It contains five places of public worship, and a customhouse. The harbour, which is a mile long and half a mile wide, is very safe, except when storms from the north-east prevail. This town was settled very soon after Salem, by a number of fishermen, and the inhabitants have* been principally devoted to the Bank fisheries. In this business Marblehead has greatly excelled all the other American towns. Previously to the revolution it was in a very flourishing state, but during that struggle, and also during the last war, it suffered severely. In 1830 it contained a population of 5150. Beverley is a wealthy mercantile town, and, like the preceding, largely engaged in the fisheries. It has a population of between four and five thousand. Newbury port, a post-town and port of entry, is situated on the south bank of the Merrimac, three miles from its mouth, twenty-four miles north of Salem, and thirty-two north-north-east of Boston, in latitude 42. 49. north, and longitude 70. 52. west. This town is very pleasantly situated, and handsomely built. The streets are regular, and cross each other nearly at right angles. The dwellinghouses are uncommonly good, and the public buildings are constructed in a very handsome style. It contains a courthouse, a jail, a market, a town-hall, several school-houses, and seven churches. There are several distilleries, a brewery, and manufactures of carriages, shoes, hats, cordage, morocco leather, and gold and silver plate. It has a respectable amount of shipping and foreign commerce, and is largely engaged in the fisheries. Ship-building is carried on to a considerable extent; and although the town is scarcely in so flourishing a condition as it was formerly, it is still interesting and important, and is improving. Gloucester is situated on the peninsula of Cape Ann, sixteen miles north-east of Salem. It is one of the most considerable fishing towns in the commonwealth, containing six churches, with several public buildings, and between six and seven thousand inhabitants.

New Bedford, a post-town and port of entry, is situated fifty-two miles south of Boston, in latitude 4L 38. north, longitude 70. 56. west. It stands on an arm of Buzzard’s Bay, aed is laid out upon ground sloping to the water, in streets intersecting each other at right angles. This town has rapidly increased in trade and population, and the inhabitants possess great enterprise, and are very wealthy. The whale fishery constitutes their principal business, and in it they have engaged about 150 ships and fifteen brigs. The fishing of cod on the grand banks is also carried on; and the people are extensively engaged in many other branches of commerce. New Bedford contains a courthouse, a jail, an alms-house, three banks, two insurance offices, an academy, a flourishing lyceum, four printing offices (one of which issues a daily, and the others weekly newspapers), eleven churches, and a chapel for seamen. Plymouth, a post-town and port of entry, is situated thirty-six miles south-south-east of Boston. It is remarkable is the place where the first settlers of New England landed, on the 22d of December 1620. The harbour is spacious, but shallow. The town has considerable commerce, ιnd valuable manufactures of iron. An elegant hall has 3een erected for the use of the pilgrim society; and there .s a court-house, which stands in latitude 41. 57. north, md longitude 70. 42. 30. west. A part of the rock on which the puritan emigrants landed on their arrival from England, has been conveyed to the centre of the town. Worcester is an inland town, situated forty miles west by south of Boston. It is a neat and flourishing place, with considerable trade and manufactures. Amongst the pubic buildings are a court-house, jail, county penitentiary, lunatic hospital, town-hall, and four places of public worship. There are three printing offices, from which four newspapers are issued weekly. The American Antiquarian Society has here a handsome hall, a valuable cabinet, and a library containing about 8000 volumes, amongst which are many ancient and rare works on American history. The town was incorporated in the year 1722, and, on the erection of Worcester county, in 1732, became the capital. Springfield, a town of some size, is situated on the east side of Connecticut River, ninety-seven miles southwest of Boston. The houses are well built, and the town has an appearance of great industry and wealth. There are many new and elegant erections, including several places of public worship, and the county buildings. On Mill River, which flows into the Connecticut, there are very extensive mills and factories of various kinds. In the town is a very extensive government establishment for the manufacture of arms. The arsenal is situated on an elevated plain, about half a mile from the town. Springfield is connected with West Springfield by an elegant bridge. Northampton, a post-town, is situated on the west bank of Connecticut River, ninety-five miles west of Boston. It is well built, and chiefly consists of two streets proceeding like radii from a circle, though with many irregularities. It contains several handsome public buildings, and a number of respectable seminaries of education, A stream passes near the centre of the town, on which are erected numerous mills and manufactories, and amongst these are two for making woollen stuffs. A bridge above 1000 feet in length, connecting this town with Hadley, was built in 1826. In the vicinity of Northampton there is a noted mine, which is visited by strangers as a curiosity.

Waltham, a post-town, is situated on the north side of Charles River, ten miles west of Boston. It contains three cotton manufactories, which are amongst the most extensive and best conducted establishments of the kind in the country. The quantity of cotton annually used amounts to about 700,000 pounds, and the cloth made to 2,000,000 yards. There are also bleaching works, at which two tons of goods are daily bleached, calendered, and packed. In 1830 the population of this place was 1859. Cambridge, a post-town, is situated on the north side of Charles River, at the distance of three miles from Boston. It consists of three principal parts or divisions, namely, Old Cambridge, which contains the university already noticed, a state arsenal, and several places of public worship; Cambridge-Port, which is a considerable trading village, containing four places of public worship, and is connected with the capital of the state by West Boston Bridge; and East Cambridge, which is a flourishing manufacturing village, situated on Lechmere Point, and connected with Boston by means of Craigie’s or Canal Bridge. It contains a court-house, a jail, a large glass manufactory, and three places of public worship. Concord, a post-town, is pleasantly situated upon the western bank of the river Merrimac, sixty-three miles north-north-west of Boston. It contains a state-house and state-prison, both built of stone, a court-house, three places of public worship, and about two hundred dwelling-houses. Much of the trade of the upper country centres here; and the importance of the place is increased by the boat navigation which is opened between this place and Boston, by means of the Merrimac River and Middlesex Canal. There are two bridges in Concord across the Merrimac, one in the north part, the other connecting the town with Pembroke. Taunton is situated at the junction of Canoe, Rumford, and Taunton Rivers, thirty-two miles south of Boston. It is a handsome and flourishing place, containing the county buildings, a bank, an academy, and seven meeting-houses. It has the command of excellent water power, and there are [7:14:306] here several factories for cotton, paper, nails, and various kinds of iron work. Lynn, a post-town, is situated nine miles north-north-east of Boston. It is noted for the manufacture of shoes, about 1,500,000 pairs of women’s shoes being made here annually. There is a medicinal spring in this place, near which is a house for the accommodation of visitors. In 1830 the population was 6138. Andover, a post-toλvnship, is situated on the south-east side of the Merrimac, twenty miles north of Boston. It is a pleasant and flourishing place, containing three parishes, in each of which there is a congregational meeting-house. Andover has some manufactures, but it is chiefly celebrated for its literary institutions, particularly the theological seminary already noticed. The population is about 4000. Amongst the manufacturing towns not already described are Fitchburg and Milbury in the county of Worcester, Bridgewater and Middleborough, noted for their manufactures of iron, Leominster, Mendon, Troy, Leicester, and various other places too numerous to mention.

Nantucket is an island of Massachusetts, situated to the south of the peninsula of Cape Cod, at the distance of 120 miles south-south-east of Boston. It is fifteen miles in length, and at its widest part eleven miles in breadth, being situated in long. 69. 56. to 70. 13. west, lat. 4L 13. to 41. 22. north. The island, town, and county of Nantucket have the same limits; but the county of Dukes is associated with it for several political purposes. A great proportion of the inhabitants are Quakers, and the land is held in common; but it is sandy and unproductive. Little attention is paid to agriculture, and the sheep and cows of all the inhabitants feed on one extensive common. The right of the island was originally granted by William earl of Stirling, to Thomas Mayhew, and conveyed by him to nine proprietors, who divided it into twenty-seven shares in 1659. It is mostly a joint property to this day, but the number of shares has been increased to several thousands. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in the whale-fishery, and the seamen are celebrated for their skill and daring. Their trade suffered severely during the late war, and also by the war of the revolution, but it is now flourishing; and several very extensive spermaceti works are in full operation.

The port of Nantucket is situated upon the north-west side of the island, and has a very good harbour. It contains two banks, two insurance offices, and seven houses of public worship. Education is well attended to, and the habits of the people are generally moral and industrious. For many years the island has been destitute of indigenous trees, and few are cultivated. In 1820 the amount of shipping was 28,512 tons. To the west of Nantucket is another island called Martha’s Vineyard, but it is of comparatively little importance.

In the year 1831 there were in Massachusetts 8981 mills and 339,777 spindles at work. At the same time, 69,880 spindles were in the course of being erected. There were sold of yarn during that year 807,366 pounds, and of cloth 79,231,000 yards. Woollen goods are also manufactured to a very considerable extent, and there are several glasshouses, and paper and other manufactories. In 1833 two lead manufactories existed in Salem, and made the following quantities, viz. white lead 2,081,894 pounds, red lead 42,236 pounds, and acetate of lead 20,586 pounds; the value of the whole being 195,000 dollars. The making of braid or straλv bonnets, and palm-leaf hats, is a branch of industry carried on to a considerable extent; and in 1830 common salt was manufactured in this state to the amount of 567,239 bushels. The preparing of flax and hemp, the making of combs and buttons, also constitute considerable branches of domestic industry. The following are returns for the year 1830 of the quantity of shipping belonging to Massachusetts:

Of registered vessels, 402 ships, 433 brigs, 141 schooners, and three sloops; of enrolled and licensed vessels, 55 brigs, 1546 schooners, 472 sloops, and eight steam-boats; of licensed vessels under twenty tons, 54 schooners, and 47 sloops. The total number of vessels was 3161, manned by 23,270 mariners. Massachusetts monopolizes nearly the whole of the North American whale-fishery. By returns for the winter of 1834, above 434 vessels were engaged in this trade, of which 286 belonged to the state of Massachusetts. The number of vessels employed in the sperm fishing in New Bedford and Nantucket during the same year was 181, and there were a few more from other ports of Massachusetts. The following is a statement of the commerce of the state for the year ending September 1833. Imported in American vessels 19,447,267; in foreign vessels 493,644; total amount of imports 19,940,911 dollars. Domestic produce exported in American vessels 4,779,492; in foreign vessels 371,092; total 5,150,584. Foreign produce exported in American vessels 4,301,004; in foreign vessels 231,534; total 4,532,538. Total value of domestic and foreign produce exported, 9,683,122 dollars. At the commencement of 1834 there were in Massachusetts 102 banks. The capital amounted to 28,236,250; notes issued were 7,889,110; specie and specie funds 922,309; deposits 11,666,122; discounts of notes, &c. 45,261,008 dollars. The amount of postage received for the year ending 31st March 1832 was 129,712,20 dollars. In 1810 only thirty-two newspapers were published in Massachusetts, but in 1834 there were no less than 108 established in the state. The number of monthly, quarterly, and other periodicals is proportionally great.

The first English settlement made in New England was formed by 101 persons, who fled from religious persecution in England, landed at Plymouth on the 22d of December 1620, and laid the foundation of Plymouth colony. The settlement of the colony of Massachusetts Bay was commenced at Salem in 1628, and in 1630 Boston was settled. For many years the colonies styled the Plymouth colony and the colony of Massachusetts continued separate, each electing its own governor and managing its own affairs independently of the other. In 1685-86, however, they, with the rest of the New England states, were deprived of their charters, and placed under the government, first of Joseph Dudley, and afterwards of Sir Edmond Andros. In 1692 they were united into one colony under a new charter, and the governors were afterwards appointed by the king. The constitution was formed in the year1780, and amended in 1821. The legislative power is vested in a senate and House of Representatives, which together are styled the General Court of Massachusetts. The members of the House of Representatives are elected annually, and consist in all of between 500 and 600 individuals. Every corporate town having 150 rateable polls may elect one representative, and another for every additional 225 rateable polls. The senate consists of forty members, who are chosen by districts annually. The governor or supreme executive magistrate is also elected annually, and is assisted in his office by a council of nine members, who are chosen, by the joint ballot of the senators and representatives, from amongst the senators. The general court meets at Boston on the first Wednesday of January. The right of suffrage is granted to every male citizen twenty-one years of age (excepting paupers and persons under guardianship) who has resided within the commonwealth one year, and within the town or district in which he may claim a right to vote, six calendar months immediately preceding any election, and who has paid a state or county tax assessed upon him within two years preceding such election; and also every citizen who may be by law exempted[7:14:307] from taxation, and who may be in all other respects qualified as above mentioned. The judiciary power is vested in a supreme court and a court of common pleas, consisting of four members each, besides such other courts as the legislature may establish. The judges are appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the council, and they hold their offices during good behaviour. Justices of the peace have original and exclusive jurisdiction in all civil cases in which the debt or damages demanded do not exceed twenty dollars, except where the title to real property comes in question. They have concurrent criminal jurisdiction as to breaches of the peace not aggravated in their nature, and in cases of larceny where the goods stolen do not exceed the value of five dollars. The court of common pleas has an appellate jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases tried originally before a justice of the peace. It has original and exclusive jurisdiction in all civil commonlaw cases, where the damage or debt demanded exceeds the sum of twenty dollars; and final jurisdiction where the damages demanded do not exceed one hundred dollars. Its criminal jurisdiction depends generally upon particular statutes. In relation to offences at common law, its jurisdiction includes everything where the punishment does not extend to life, demembration, or banishment, except where the punishment is by statute to be administered by the supreme court. In cases of mortgages, and of forfeitures annexed to contracts, this court has a concurrent chancery jurisdiction. The supreme judicial court has appellate jurisdiction in all cases where the debt or damage exceeds one hundred dollars, and in all criminal cases originally tried in the court of common pleas or the municipal court of the city of Boston. It has concurrent jurisdiction in all criminal cases cognisable by the inferior courts, and original and exclusive jurisdiction in all capital cases. It has also original and exclusive jurisdiction in all cases of alimony and divorce; and chancery powers in cases of trusts, specific performance of contracts in writing, mortgages, settlement of partnership accounts,waste, nuisance, and forfeitures annexed to contracts. It is the supreme court of probate, entertains appeals from the probate courts of the counties, and has a general superintending power over all inferior tribunals by writ of error, certiorari, quo warranto, &c. The probate courts, of which there is one in each county, consisting of a single judge, have original and exclusive jurisdiction in the probate of wills, settlement of estates, and guardianship of minors, idiots, lunatics, and others. There is in Boston a police court, consisting of three justices; a justices’ court for the county of Suffolk; and a municipal court, consisting of one judge who takes cognizance of all crimes not capital committed within the county of Suffolk, and appellate jurisdiction in all criminal cases tried before the police court.
