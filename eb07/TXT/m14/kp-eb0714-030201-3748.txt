MASSA, a small independent state in Italy, called a duchy, the sovereign of which is a female of the house of Este, at whose death it falls to her son the Duke of Modena. It contains about ninety square miles, with two cities, two towns, thirty-seven villages, and 27,500 inhabitants. It produces some little corn, with much oil, silk, and wine, and yields a revenue of L.20,000 yearly. The chief place is a city of the same name situated on the river Frigido; and on an elevation near it is the ducal palace. It is the seat of a bishop, and has a cathedral and several other churches, with 6550 inhabitants.
