MATLOCK, a town and parish of the county of Derby and hundred of Wirksworth, 144 miles from London. It is situated on the river Derwent, in a most picturesque situation, and is chiefly remarkable for its warm springs, celebrated for the cure of incipient consumptions, for which they are very much resorted to. The scenery around is highly picturesque; and the air, though warmed by the springs, remarkably pure, so that even in winter the atmosphere is genial. The accommodations for visitors are good and economical, and the objects of attraction are numerous, especially a cavern and the petrifying spring. Near to the village are the extensive cotton-works constructed by the late Sir Richard Arkwright, and now conducted by his family. Many of the inhabitants of Matlock are employed in converting the spars found here into ornamental articles of various kinds. The population amounted in 1801 to 2354, in 1811 to 2490, in 1821 to 2920, and in 1831 to 3262.
