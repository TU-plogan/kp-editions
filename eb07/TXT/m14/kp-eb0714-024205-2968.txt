ÎœARAWAS, a district of the south of India, in the Carnatic, situated on the eastern shore, opposite to Ceylon, and between the 9th and 10th degrees of N. lat. It is estimated at eighty miles in length by thirty in the average breadth, and it is bounded on the north by Tanjore and the Polygar territory, on the south by Tinevelly, on the west by Madura, and on the east by the sea. This district came into the possession of the British in the year 1792; and in 1801 it was added to the collectorship of Dindigul. The principal towns are Ramnad, Shevagunga, and Tripatoor. Many remains of ancient Hindu religious magnificence are to be found here, consisting of temples built with large massive stones. The district, which possesses considerable advantages from its maritime situation, is improving both in its commerce and in its agriculture.
