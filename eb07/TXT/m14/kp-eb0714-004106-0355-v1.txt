MAIDA, a town of the kingdom of Naples, in the province of Calabria Ulteriore II. It stands on the river Pesipo, about ten miles from Squillace, and contains four churches, a nunnery, and 1860 inhabitants. It suffered very severely by the earthquake of 1783. In the neighbourhood there are several marble quarries, and some salt springs. It has been rendered interesting as the scene of a battle fought there on the 4th of July 1806, between a body of French troops under General Regnier, and an English detachment of the same number (5000), in which the latter under General Stewart gained a splendid victory.
