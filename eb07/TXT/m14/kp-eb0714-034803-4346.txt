MECHANICAL, an epithet applied to whatever relates to mechanics.

Mechanical, in mathematics, denotes a construction of some problem, by the assistance of instruments, as the duplication of the cube and quadrature of the circle, in contradistinction to that which is done in an accurate and geometrical manner.

Mechanical Curve, is a curve, according to Descartes, which cannot be defined by any algebraical equation, and thus is contradistinguished from algebraic or geometrical curves. Leibnitz and others call these mechanical curves transcendental, and dissent from Descartes, in excluding them from geometry.

Mechanical Solution of a problem is either when the thing is done by repeated trials, or when lines used in the solution are not truly geometrical, or of organical construction.

Mechanical Powers, are certain simple machines, which are used for raising greater weights, or overcoming greater resistances than could be effected by the natural strength without them. See Mechanics.
