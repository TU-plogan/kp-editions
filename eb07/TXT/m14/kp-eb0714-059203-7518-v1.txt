MERCY-SEAT, or Propitiatory, in Jewish antiquity, the covering of the ark of the covenant. The Hebrew name of this cover, which we translate mercy-seat, is Cap-poreth, (Exod. xxv. 17, 22,) from cαppor, which signifies to cover, to shut up, to expiate, or to pay. This cover was of gold, and at its two ends were fixed the two cherubim of the same metal, which, by their wings extended forwards, seemed to form a throne for the majesty of. God; who in Scripture is. represented to us as sitting between the cherubim, with the ark itself forming as it were his footstool. It was hence that God issued his oracles to Moses, or to the high priest who consulted him, (Exod. xxv. 22. Numb. vii. 89.)
