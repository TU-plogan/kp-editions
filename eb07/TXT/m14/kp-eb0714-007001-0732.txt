MALTON, a town of the north riding of Yorkshire, in the wapentake of Rydall, 214 miles from London. It is situated on the navigable river Derwent, is well built, and contains three parish churches. At this place are some remains of an ancient castle, with its chapel. There is a house of correction; and the sessions are held here. There are good markets on Tuesday and Saturday. It formerly returned two members to the House of Commons, and the number has not been diminished by the new law. The country around is celebrated for breeding good horses. The population amounted in 1801 to 3047, in 1811 to 3713, in 1821 to 4005, and in 1831 to 4173.
