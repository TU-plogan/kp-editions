MALAGA, a city of Spain, in the kingdom of Granada, and province of Andalusia. There are few spots more beautiful, and few regions more fertile, than that in which this place is situated. It is on the sea-coast, on a rich and well-watered plain, sheltered by high mountains from the northerly and easterly winds, and open to the genial influence of the sun and the south and west winds, which have created a climate nearly similar to that of some of the tropical islands.

Although it is beautiful and fertile, it is far from being healthy. It is subject to epidemic fevers, to which, at various periods, numbers of its inhabitants have fallen victims. In one of these visitations which, in the year 1804, afflicted all the Mediterranean shores, this city was deprived, within three months, of more than 21,000 of its inhabitants.

As this portion of Spain grows the productions more peculiarly called tropical, they are deserving of some attention. Sugar has been cultivated here from a very distant period; the canes were brought from the eastern regions, as appears by authentic memorials, as early as the ninth century, and were then made into sugar, with very little difference in the process from that which is now practised. It is probable that the canes, originally from Chaldaea or Arabia, and long propagated near Malaga, were at length transplanted to the Canary Islands, and from them ultimately to the warmest regions of America, where they have been extended till they have supplied Europe with one of the most delightful and salubrious substances that is used for human aliment. The state of hostility in which Europe was long involved, as it raised the expense of conveying the sugar and other tropical productions from the place of their growth to the place of consumption, gave great inducement to the cultivation of such articles where the expense of war-freights, insurances, and risks, might be avoided; and during that period there was a constant increase in the plantations of sugar, coffee, cotton, and similar productions in the vicinity of Malaga. The return of peace will naturally affect those agricultural pursuits, and reduce them within those confined limits which they will be enabled to supply without coming into competition with the cultivators at a distance, who, from conducting their operations on a larger scale, are enabled to dispose of their produce on much lower terms, as well as to bear the additional expense of a longer conveyance.

The prosperity of the district round Malaga depends, however, more upon what may be called its indigenous productions, than upon the cultivation of the rarer articles to which we have adverted. The vine flourishes most luxuriantly, and its fruit dries into different kinds of raisins, according to the different periods of the year in which they ripen, and, when dried, becomes an important source of wealth to the cultivators. The wines which their vineyards yield are of various kinds, and mostly in very high request. That which is usually called mountain wine is most in demand for European markets; but a considerable quantity of a dry wine, like sherry, is made, the great consumption of which is in the American dominions of Spain. Oranges, lemons, figs, almonds, and nuts, are gathered in great quantities, and furnish a considerable portion of the exports of this city. In Malaga there are some manufactures, and in the country whose commodities find a vent through its port there are more, which form articles of export to America. Silk goods of various kinds, linens, sail-cloth, leather, and cordage, are shipped to America, as well as some goods brought for that purpose from Russia, Germany, England, and France. Malaga may be considered as the third port in Spain. Cadiz is by far the first; and Barcelona was the next, but the long occupation of that port and its surrounding country by the French destroyed much of its commerce, and renders it doubtful whether Malaga does not now equal it.

There is, properly speaking, no harbour; but a pier, extending into the sea nearly 1500 yards, gives security to shipping; and the largest vessels may load or discharge their cargoes close to the wharfs of the pier. The customhouse, near the pier, is a magnificent building, and of an extent far beyond the present wants of the trade of the port.

Malaga is fortified, but its defences are of little avail, as they are commanded by heights around them, the occupation of which by artillery would insure the surrender of the city. The most beautiful object in this city is the Almeida or public walk, bordered with trees, having splendid houses on both sides, but at a competent distance, and a very superb fountain of white marble, admirably adorned with good sculpture. The cathedral church, though of a mixed kind of architecture, is a very imposing mass of building, with two lofty towers at the western entrance. It is said to be of the same dimensions within as St Paulâ€™s in London; but, like all Catholic churches, the interior is far more exquisitely adorned and more beautifully finished. The roof is supported by lofty pillars with arches, and is divided into compartments, which are well painted, so as to resemble the sky. The high altar and the pulpits are of the most beautiful flesh-coloured marble. The choir is a most curious specimen of carving in wood. There are about fifty stalls, some of cedar, others of mahogany, and all richly carved with figures of various saints; which has induced some Spanish artists to call it the eighth wonder of the world. There are two fine organs in this church, which add much to its internal beauty. The pipes project from the instrument, and toward their termination are widened, and the ends curved, so as to represent a row of trumpets.

The cathedral, as well as some other churches and convents, are rich in statues and valuable paintings by native artists. The encouragement given to the fine arts has always distinguished the inhabitants of Malaga; and there is, of long standing, a society for the cultivation of science and the study of antiquities. No place affords a better field for the pursuits of the antiquary. The Carthaginians, the Romans, the Goths, and the Moors, have each contributed a portion of the buildings, the remains of which are profusely scattered about, and afford high delight to diligent investigators. The present number of its inhabitants does not exceed 50,000, as it has not recovered the loss of population which it suffered from the epidemic fever of 1804. The longitude of the mole of Malaga, by observations made in 1817, is 4. 24. 15. west from London, and the latitude 36. 43.30. north. Upon this mole a revolving light has been recently constructed, which may be clearly distinguished at the distance of about six leagues.
