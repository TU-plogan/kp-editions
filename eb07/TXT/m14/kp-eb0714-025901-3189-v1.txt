MARS, in Astronomy, one of the eleven planets, situated without the earth’s orbit, and remarkable for the extent of its atmosphere and the redness of its light. See Astronomy. Mars, in the Pagan mythology, was the god of war. According to some, he was the son of Jupiter and Juno; whilst others say that he was the son of Juno alone, who, being displeased at Jupiter’s having produced Minerva from his brain, without female aid, conceived without the assistance of the other sex, by touching a flower shown to her by Flora in the plains of Olenus, and became the mother of this formidable deity. The amours of Mars and Venus, and the manner in which Vulcan caught and exposed them to the laughter of the other gods, have been described by several of the ancient poets. He is represented as having several wives and mistresses, and a considerable number of children. He was held in the highest veneration by the Romans, both from his being the supposed father of Romulus their founder, and from their inclination to conquest; and magnificent temples were erected to him at Rome. Mars is usually represented in a chariot drawn by furious horses. He is completely armed, and extends his spear with the one hand, whilst he grasps a sword, imbrued in blood, with the other. He has a fierce and savage aspect. Discord is represented as preceding his car; Clamour, Fear, and Terror, appear in his train. The victims sacrificed to him were the wolf, the horse, the woodpecker, the vulture, and the cock.

Mars, amongst the older chemists, denotes iron, that metal being supposed to be under the influence of the planet Mars.
