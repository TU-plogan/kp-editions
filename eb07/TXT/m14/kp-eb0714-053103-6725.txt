MEDITATION, an act by which we consider any thing closely, or in which the soul is employed in the search or consideration of any truth. In religion it is used to signify a consideration of the objects and grand truths of the Christian faith. Mystic divines make a great difference between meditation and contemplation. The former consists in discursive acts of the soul, considering methodically and with attention the mysteries of faith and the precepts of morality, and is performed by reflections and reasonings, which leave behind them manifest impressions on the brain. But the [7:14:532]purely contemplative have no need of meditation, as they see all things in God at a glance, and without any reflection. WIÎ¹en a man, therefore, has once quitted meditation, and arrived at contemplation, he returns no more; and, according to Alvarez, never resumes the oar of meditation, except when the wind of contemplation is too weak to fill his sails.
