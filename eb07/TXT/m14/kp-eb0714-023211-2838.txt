MANICA, a district of Mocaranga, in Eastern Africa, celebrated as the country chiefly affording the gold for which this part of Africa is famous. It is mountainous, but fertile, and abounds in honey, wax, senna, dye-stuffs, and the like. A Portuguese expedition penetrated thither in 1569. They found the mines by no means equal to the reputation which they enjoyed, but consisting chiefly of gold dust in small quantities, imbedded in sand and earth, from which considerable labour was required to extract it. Manica is twenty daysâ€™journey from Sena, the nearest Portuguese settlement; and the communication is partly carried on through native tribes, who must be propitiated by presents. A small fort is maintained in this district.
