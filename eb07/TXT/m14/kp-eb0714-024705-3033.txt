MARIEGALANTE, a small island in the West Indies, discovered by Columbus in 1493, being situated between Dominica and Guadaloupe. About one half of it is mountainous, and it is so thickly covered with wood as to appear nothing but a large forest. The climate is pleasant, and on the western shore, which is level, are produced tobacco, cotton, indigo, and sugar. It was first settled by the French in 1647, yet repeatedly changed masters, having been taken both by the Dutch and the English; but it was finally ceded to France. Like the other islands, it is exposed to violent hurricanes, and, along with Guadaloupe, suffered severely from that which occurred in 1825. It is about forty-two miles in circumference, and contains a population of 11,778, of whom 1555 are whites, and the remainder slaves. Long. 65. 50. W. Lat. 16. N.
