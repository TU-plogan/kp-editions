MENES, born at a town of Thebais or Saïd, in Upper Egypt, was the founder of the Egyptian empire. He had three sons; Athotis,who ruled after him at This and Thebes; Curudes, who in Lower Egypt founded the kingdom of Heliopolis, which was afterwards the kingdom of the Diospoli-tans; and Necherophes, who reigned at Memphis. It is believed that this Menes reigned 117 years after the birth of Phaleg, son of Heber, which took place in the very year of the dispersion of mankind throughout the whole earth. In building Memphis, he stopped die Nile near it, by the construction of a causeway one hundred furlongs broad, which he caused to run through the mountains.
