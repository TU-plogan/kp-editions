MECHOACAN, a province of Mexico or New Spain, in America, bounded on the north by Panuco and Guadalajara, on the south by the Pacific Ocean, and on the west by Guadalajara and the South Sea. It is about 200 miles in circumference, and its population in 1793, amounted to 289,314. The soil is exceedingly fertile, and the climate so wholesome, that the Spaniards imagine it possessed of some peculiarly restorative quality, for which reason the sick and infirm flock to it from all quarters. The commodities are sulphur, indigo, sarsaparilla, sassafras, cacao, vanelloes, ambergris, hides, wool, cotton, silk, sugar, the root mechoacan or white jalap, and silver. This province formed an independent kingdom at the time when Mexico was reduced by Cortez. The sovereign had long been the inveterate enemy of the Mexicans, and was considered next to the republic of Elascala, as the most formidable barrier against the extension of the imperial frontier. However, he submitted to Cortez without striking a blow, being intimidated by the wonders he had performed with a handful of men; and thus Mechoacan became a province of the Spanish empire, and a valuable addition to Mexico The country at that time was exceedingly populous, but the natives are now much thinned. The capital of the province, called Mechoacan by the natives, but Valladolid by the Spaniards, contained 17,093 inhabitants in 1793.
