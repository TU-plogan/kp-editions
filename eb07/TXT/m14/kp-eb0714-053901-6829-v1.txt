MELCOMB-REGIS, atown of Dorsetshire, in the hundred of Culliford-tree, 127 miles from London. It is situated on the right bank of the river Wey, which divides it from Weymouth, both which towns are connected together by the bridge. The two towns have one corporation of mayor and aldermen between them, and formerly chose four members to parliament, each person entitled to the franchise having four votes. By the new law, an alteration has been made, and the towns united chuse two members only. The whole are commonly called Weymouth, though Melcomb is the larger place of the two, and that in which are the market, town hall, and custom house, and wherein are the best houses for the accommodation of the visitors who resort to it for the purpose of sea-bathing, for which the shore is peculiarly adapted. The market is held on Tuesday. The population was in 1801, 2350; in 1811,2985; in 1821, 4252; and in 1831, 5126.
