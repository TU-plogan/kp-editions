MARACAYBO, a province of South America, in what was till 1835 the republic of Colombia, but which is now separated into three independent states. Maracaybo is bounded on the west by Rio Hacha, on the east by Venezuela, on the south by Pamplona, and on the north by the Carribean Sea. Maracaybo may be described as a considerable tract of country surrounding a vast sheet of water of the same name. The lake of Maracaybo is a little Mediterranean, communicating with a gulf called after it, by a channel about two leagues in breadth by eight in length. Depons describes the lake and gulf as nearly of the form of a decanter, extending from south to north, the neck of which communicates with the sea. It is about fifty leagues in length from the bar to its most southern recess, its greatest breadth is about thirty leagues, and its circumference upwards of one hundred and fifty leagues. Its waters are sweet, unless the wind blows with violence from the sea, when salt water is forced into it, thus communicating to them a brackish property. The lake, however, is not subject to tempests; but occasionally the north wind produces a short and broken swell. It is navigated with ease, and has depth of water sufficient for the largest vessels. All goods intended for consumption or export at Maracaybo are conveyed by the rivers which discharge themselves into the lake. Of these there are above twenty, the most considerable being Sulia or Pamplona River, the Motatan, Chama, Catumbo, Cuernos, To-rondoy, and Perija. All the different species of fish found in the rivers of South America (Depons says), abound in this lake; but the tortoise is not found here. There are monatis or sea-cows of enormous size. On one of the shores of the lake there is an inexhaustible mine of mineral pitch. The bituminous vapours which it exhales are so inflammable, that during the night phosphoric fires are continually seen, which in their effect resemble lightning. They go by the name of the “Lantern of Maracaybo,” because they serve for a lighthouse and compass to both the Spaniards and the Indians, who without the assistance of either navigate the lake. There are still several barbarous tribes of Indians in its vicinity, but, from the sterility of the soil on the borders of the lake, and the insalubrity of the atmosphere, they formerly preferred fixing their abodes on the lake itself. These huts erected on the water amounted to a number of villages, but they were all destroyed by the Spaniards, with the exception of four. The inhabitants have a church, under the care of a curate; and they derive their chief subsistence from fishing and hunting wild ducks. The soil on the western shores of the lake is good, and this induced some Spaniards, regardless of the insalubrity of the climate, to fix their residence there, for the purpose of raising cocoa and provisions. The settlement, however, consists only of a few scattered habitations. The southern extremity of the lake is uncultivated, and destitute of inhabitants. The temperature of the whole province is very high; that of the northern [7:14:240] part iś no less so than the others, but it is incomparably healthier.

Maracaybo, or Nueva Zamora, situated on the left bank oí the lake, at the distance of six leagues from the sea, was founded in 1571. It stands in the midst of a sandy plain, without any stratum of vegetable earth, in latitude 10. 30. north, and longitude 74. 6. west of Paris. The climate is intensely hot, and during July and August almost insupportable; yet it is accounted healthy, because no endemic complaints prevail. Violent storms are frequent, accompanied with thunder and lightning, and occasionally prove very destructive. Most of the houses are covered with reeds, but the town is fortified. The parish church is large and handsome, and there are four monasteries, a convent, and an hospital. For upwards of twenty leagues towards the serrania (or mountain ridge) there is no other water for even the cattle, but rain water, which is preserved in tanks. Depons draws a favourable picture in some respects of the character of the inhabitants. From the habit which they contract in infancy of sailing on the lake, they imbibe at a very early period a taste for navigation; and this leads many of them to repair to the seaports to obtain employment, “Those who resist the attractions of the sea,” says that traveller, “raise herds of cattle, or take care of those of their fathers. Nothing better evinces their aptitude for this species of occupation, than the immense number of beasts with which the savannas of Maracaybo are covered. The principal ones are those of Jobo, Ancon, Palmares, and Cannades. I ought to mention, that there is more merit in raising cattle in the savannas of Maracaybo than in any other place in these provinces; because, having neither rivers nor ponds that never dry up, drought occasions the death of many, in spite of the precautions they take, in cases of this sort, to drive them towards those parts where they can with convenience water them.” Education is in a very low state amongst the people, yet they show a partiality for, and from their natural talents make no inconsiderable progress in literature. Notwithstanding their activity, courage, and talent, the inhabitants of Maracaybo are reproached with a want of regard for their word, and a habit of thinking themselves not bound by their signature, until after they have in vain endeavoured to release themselves from it by law. Depons places the character of the women very high. Maracaybo contains many descendants of the early conquerors, who now live in a state of affluence. Others of the inhabitants gain wealth by traffic, and the whole are supposed to exceed 20,000 in number. The slaves are said not to exceed 5000; and the freed blacks, by whom the trades are carried on, are but few. Depons estimates the entire population of the province at 100,000.
