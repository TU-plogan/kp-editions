MARCITES, Marcitae, a sect of heretics in the second century, who also called themselves the perfecti, and made profession of doing every thing with a great deal of liberty, and without any fear. This doctrine they borrowed from Simon Magus, who, however, was not their chief; for they were called Marrites from one Marcus, who conferred the priesthood and the administration of the sacraments upon women.
