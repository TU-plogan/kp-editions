MARSI, a nation of Germany, who afterwards settled in Italy, where they occupied the territory in the environs of the Fucine Lake. They at first proved inimical to Rome, but in process of time they became its firmest supporters. They were allowed by the Romans to be the most intrepid soldiers of their legions when friendly, and the most formidable of their enemies when at variance; and it was a common saying, that Rome could neither triumph over the Marsi nor without them. They are particularly celebrated for the civil war in which they were engaged, and which from them received the denomination of the Marsian War. The large contributions which they made to support the interest of Rome, and the number of men whom they continually supplied to the republic, rendered them bold and aspiring; and they claimed, along with the rest of the Italian states, a share of the honours and privileges which were enjoyed by the citizens of Rome. This petition, though supported by the interest, the eloquence, and the integrity of the tribune Drusus, was received with contempt by the Roman senate; upon which, in the 662d year of Rome, the Marsi put themselves at the head of the Social War, one of the most obstinate and dangerous struggles ever maintained against the progress of the Roman power. They obtained several victories, but were at last defeated, though the war was only terminated by a grant of those privileges for which they had contended.
