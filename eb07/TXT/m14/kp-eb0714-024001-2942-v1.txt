MARAGA, a city of Persia, in the province of Azerbijan. It is a well-built town, has a spacious bazar, and is encompassed with a high wall. It is pleasantly situated in a low valley at the extremity of a well-cultivated plain opening to the lake, from which Maraga is distant nine or ten miles. The gardens and plantations are watered by canals drawn from a small river, over which there are two bridges erected 800 years ago. There is a glass manufactory, and a very handsome public bath; and there are also several curious old tombs, in one of which, without the walls, Holaku, a distinguished prince of the line of Ghengis Khan, and his wife, are interred. The town contains about 15,000 inhabitants of the Turkish tribe of Muku-dim, under their chief Ahmed Khan, a nobleman of the first rank. It is sixty-eight miles north of Tabreez. Long. 46. 25. E. Lat. 37. 20. N.
