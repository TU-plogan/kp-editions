MASULIPATAM, or Muchilipatam, a considerable sea-port of Hindustan, in the Northern Circars, and district of Condapilly. It is defended by a fort, which is of an oblong square figure, 800 yards in length by 600 in breath, and situated in the midst of a salt morass, close to an inlet or canal, which communicates with the sea and the Krishna, so that the adjoining grounds may be inundated at pleasure; and this constitutes its principal defence. The town is situated a mile and a half to the north-west of the fort, on a plat of ground rising above the fort, and communicates with the fort by a strait causeway 2000 yards in length. It is extensive, and is bounded by another morass, which is never dry, even in the driest season. Masulipatam is situated in a fertile and well-watered territory, and has been long famous for the manufacture of chintzes, which are not, however, so handsome nor of so good a quality as European chintzes. It carries on an extensive trade with China, Pegu, Bengal, Persia, and Arabia. Masulipatam is the only port from Cape Comorin at which the sea is still, and it is capable of receiving vessels of 300 tons burden. It became at an early period a great commercial resort, and still carries on an extensive trade; but rice is yet an article of import, notwithstanding the fertility of the adjacent country. To the Maldive Islands chintz goods and snuff'are exported, and cocoa nuts brought back in return. In one year the number of vessels that left the harbour was 755, measuring 31,277 tons; and those that arrived amounted to 727 vessels, measuring 31,048 tons. The Mahommedans conquered Masulipatam in the year 1480. It afterwards came into the possession of the nizam of the Deccan, by whom it was made over to the French in 1751. From them the British took it by storm in 1759, and have ever since retained possession of it; and it is now the residence of the judge, collector, &c. of the district. It is 764 miles travelling distance from Calcutta, 1084 from Delhi, 292 from Madras, and 203 from Hyderabad. Long. 81. 10. E. Lat. 16. 10. N.
