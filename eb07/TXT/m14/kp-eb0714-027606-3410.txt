MASINISSA, a king of the Massyli, a tribe of the Nuâˆ™ midians, in Africa, was son of Gala, and born about 239 B. c. He died 149 b. c. The earlier part of his life seems to have been spent in Carthage, where he attracted so much of the attention of Asdrubal, the son of Gisgo, that he offered to him his daughter in marriage. His previous admiration of the young lady, who was called Sophonisba, made him willingly accept of the proposal; but before the marriage was consummated, he accompanied Asdrubal into Spain, where the Carthaginians were then carrying on war against the Romans, b. c. 212, towards the beginning of the second Punic war. (Liv. xxv. 34; Appian. Pun. 10, 37; Hisp. 25, 27.) Whilst Asdrubal and his intended son-in-law were employed in opposing Scipio, the Carthaginians were alarmed by the declaration of Syphax, a powerful prince of Numidia, that unless Sophonisba, of whom he had become enamoured, were given him in marriage, he would join the Romans in an attack on Carthage. To this demand of Syphax the Carthaginians agreed without the knowledge of Asdrubal, and to the great mortification of Masinissa when he was made acquainted with it. It induced him to enter into a private alliance with the Homans, towards whom he felt well inclined from their kindness in releasing from captivity his nephew Missiva, b. c. 207. Asdrubal having become apprised of his intrigues with the Romans, determined to put him to death privately; but Masinissa, discovering his intentions, escaped to Africa, where he found his father dead, and part of his kingdom possessed by Syphax. Here he collected a considerable army, and employed himself in bringing it into a proper state of discipline. The Carthaginians and Syphax, believing that the army was intended to be employed against them, determined to anticipate him in the attack, and marched with a large army into his kingdom, B. c. 204. Syphax defeated him, and compelled him to lie concealed for a time. He collected another army on [7:14:277] , . the frontiers of his kingdom, and was again obliged to ' fly. Upon the arrival of Scipio in Africa, b. c. 203, Masinissa hastened to join him with all the troops he could collect, and contributed in a great measure to the victory gained over Asdrubal and Syphax. He proceeded in pursuit of Syphax, and took him prisoner. Having got possession of Cirta, the capital of Syphax, he found there Sophonisba, who persuaded him that her marriage with Syphax had been much against her inclinations. He married her, but was soon obliged to dissolve this union, as Scipio highly disapproved of his being united to a woman who was supposed to bear an implacable hatred to the Romans. Masinissa found himself obliged to yield, and furnishing Sophonisba with poison, advised her to employ it, that she might escape from the hands of the Romans. The honours which he received from the Romans, and the hope he entertained of becoming sole king of Numidia, made him bear the loss of Sophonisba with more equanimity. Masinissa contributed much to the victory which Scipio gained over Hannibal at Zama, b. c. 202, and was soon afterwards re-instated in the possession of his hereditary dominions, to which was added the kingdom of Syphax. He and his successors were from that time honoured with the title of kings of Numidia. (Appian. Pun. 10-70; Liv. xxix. XXX.) From this time he was for many years employed in promoting peaceful habits amongst his people, and in changing their erratic propensities. He was never on very amicable terms with the Carthaginians, and we find him at war, b. c. 193, when commissioners were sent from Rome to settle the dispute; but they seem to have left it undecided. (Liv. xxxiv. 62.) He was again at war, B. c. 182, when the Romans became mediators between the contending parties. (40,17,34.) Towards the end of his life, B. c. 150, he was engaged in war with the Carthaginians, whom he conquered in several battles; and when the Romans commenced the third Punic war, he joined them with all his forces. He died the same year, B. c. 149, and left three sons, Micipsa, who succeeded him, Gulussa, and Manastabal. (Appian. Pun. 71, 105.)
