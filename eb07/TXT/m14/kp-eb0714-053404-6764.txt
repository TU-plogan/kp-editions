MEKRAN, a large maritime .province of Persia, (the ancient Gedronia) which extends along the Indian ocean from Cape Jask to the borders of Scind, which bounds it on the east; on the west and north-west it is bounded by Kerman; and on the north by Seistan and Arakaje. It is a country which has been but little travelled by Europeans; but from the account of Captain Grant, who traversed the western part of this province in 1809, from Guattur to Cape Jask, it appears that the middle parts are entirely mountainous, diversified with valleys and plains, none of which is exceedingly fertile, whilst others are arid. The mountains run parallel with the coast, seldom at a greater distance than eight or ten miles excepting at Cape Jask and Chobar, where they approach almost the edge of the sea. The greatest elevation of this chain is at Surku, where the streams that rise on the south side flow towards the Indian ocean, and these which have their source on the south side to the Persian Gulf. Between the sea and the hills there is a level plain, seldom more than eight or ten miles in breadth, where is produced abundance of pasturage, and where Captain Grant observed numerous flocks of sheep and camels, often in droves of two or three hundred, and only once in his journey experienced a scarcity of water. The produce of the province consists of rice, dates, wheat, barley, jour ceand cotton. They have two harvests; that of dry grain is in the end of March, and that of rice in September. Oxen are used in agriculture; and the horses are more remarkable for their hardiness and beauty. The towns and villages, most of which are surrounded with a few palm trees, consist of moveable mud huts, defended by a mud fort. The population of Mekran consists of many different tribes and independent chiefs; of these the Balooches are the most numerous. They are a middle-sized race of men, spare, muscular, and active; some live in towns, others in tents of black hair, migrating with their flocks from place to place. The women, unlike those in most Mussulman countries, are allowed to appear freely in public. The whole force in the country may amount to 25,000 men.
