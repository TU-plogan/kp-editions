MARCELLIANISM, the doctrines and opinions of the Marcellians, a sect of ancient heretics, who appeared towards the close of the second century, and were so called from Marcellus of Ancyra, their founder, who was accused of reviving the errors of Sabellius. Some, however, are of opinion that Marcellus was orthodox, and that his enemies were the Arians, who fathered their errors upon him. St Epiphanius observes, that there was a great deal of dispute with regard to the real tenets of Marcellus; but, as to his followers, it is evident that they did not acknowledge the three hypostases. Marcellus considered the Son and Holy Ghost as two emanations from the divine nature, which, after performing their respective offices, were to return again into the substance of the Father; an opinion which is altogether incompatible with the belief of three distinct persons in the Godhead.
