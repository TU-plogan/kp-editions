MAISTRE, Louis Isaac le, better known by the name of Sacy, formed from that of Isaac, was born at Paris in 1613. After a course of study under the direction of the Abbé de Saint Cyran, he was admitted to the priesthood in 1648, and soon afterwards chosen director of the religious house of Port Royal des Champs. But this establishment being accused of Jansenism, its enemies were furnished with a pretence for persecuting the inmates of the house. In 1661 the director was obliged to conceal himself, and in 1666 he was committed to the Bastille. During his confinement he composed his book entitled Figures de la Bible, in which, according to the Molinists, allusions are made to the sufferings endured by the Jansenists. To Sacy’s confinement the public are also indebted for a French translation of the Bible. This work was finished in 1668, the evening before the feast of All Saints; on which day he recovered his liberty, after an imprisonment of two years and a half. He was presented to the king and the minister; and all the favour he asked from them was, that they would send several times a year to examine the state of the prisoners in the Bastille. Le Maistre continued in Paris till 1675, when he retired to Port Royal, which he was obliged to leave in 1679. He then went to settle at Pompone, where he died on the 4th of January 1684, at the age of seventy-one. His works are, 1. La Traduction de la Bible, Paris, 1682; 2. Une Traduction des Psaumes selon l’Hebreu et la Vulgate, in 12mo; 3. Une version des Homélies de St Chrysostome sur St Matthieu, in three vols. 8vo; 4. La Traduction de l’imitation de Jesus Christ (sous le nom de Beuil, prieur de Saint-VaD, Paris, 1663, 8vo; 5. Celle de Phèdre (sous le nom de Saint-Aubin), 12mo; 6. De trois Comédies de Térence, in 12mo; 7. Des Lettres de Bongars (sous le nom de Brianville); 8. Du Poème de St Prosper sur les Ingrates, en verse et en prose, 12mo; 9. Les Enluminures de l’Al-roanach des Jésuites, 1654, 12mo, reprinted in 1733; 10. Heures de Port-Royal, 12mo; 11. Lettres de Piété, Paris, 1690, 2 vols. 8vo.
