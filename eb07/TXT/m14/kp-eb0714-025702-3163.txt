MARQUESAS, or Mendoca Islands. This group of islands, which extends from 138 to 140 degrees of west longitude, and from 8∣ to 10∣ south latitude, is situated in the South Pacific Ocean. They were discovered by Mendana, a Spanish navigator, in 1595, and were named by him Marquesas de Mendoca, in honour of Mendoca, then viceroy of Peru, by whom he was despatched on the voyage. They were also visited by Captain Cook in 1774, and have since been visited by several navigators. They are five in number, viz. San Pedro, or O-Niteo in the native language, Santa Christina or Wahitaho, and La Dominica or O-hivahoa, forming a group; La Madalena, eight leagues distant, and Hood’s Island, five and a half leagues, from the north-eastern point of Dominica. The aspect of these islands from the sea is bold and rugged, the land is high, and the shores present the appearance of volcanic eruptions. In most of these islands there are bays and coves along the shore, which afford shelter for shipping. Voyagers differ in their accounts of these islands, some describing them as fertile and beautiful, with verdant plains and hills crowned with luxuriant woods, whilst later visitors represent them as barren and mountainous. Probably they have landed at different parts of these islands. The ships which touch at these islands may procure supplies of hogs, fowls, plantains, yams, and other roots, also breadfruit and cocoa nuts. According to the concurring accounts of navigators, the inhabitants are a strong, tall, active race, distinguished by symmetry of person, as well as by regularity of features. But they are of the most barbarous habits, debased by an entire profligacy of manners, and addicted to the most cruel and degrading superstitions.
