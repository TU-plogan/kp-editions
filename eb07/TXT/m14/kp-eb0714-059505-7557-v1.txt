MERSENNE, Marin, a learned French author, born at Oysé, in the province of Maine, in the year 1588. He studied at La Flèche at the same time with Descartes, with whom he contracted an intimate friendship, which lasted till death. He afterwards went to Paris, and studied at the Sorbonne; but in 1611 he entered himself amongst the Minims, and became well skilled in Hebrew, philosophy, and mathematics. He was of a tranquil, sincere, and engaging temper; and was universally esteemed by persons illustrious for their birth, their dignity, and their learning. He taught philosophy and divinity in the convent of Nevers, and at length became superior of that establishment; but being anxious to apply himself with more freedom to study, he resigned all the posts he enjoyed in his order, and travelled into Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. He wrote a great number of excellent works, the principal of which are, 1. Questiones eeleberrimae in Genesim; 2. Harmonicorum libri; 3. De Sonorum natura, causis, et effectibus; 4. Cogitata physico-mathematica; 5. La Vérité des Sciences; 6. Les Questions inouies. He died at Paris in 1648. He had the reputation of being one of the best men of his age. No person was more curious in penetrating into the secrets of nature, and carrying all the arts and sciences to their utmost perfection. He was in a manner the centre of all the men of learning, by means of the correspondence which he carried on with them. He omitted no means of engaging them to publish their works; and the world is obliged to him for several excellent discoveries, which, had it not been for him, would perhaps have been lost.
