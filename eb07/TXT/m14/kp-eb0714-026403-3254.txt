MARTHA or Marta, Santa, a province of South America, in Magdalena, formerly a department of Colombia. It is bounded on the east by Rio Hacha, on the west by Carthagena, on the south by Mariqnita and Antioquia, and on the north by the Caribbean Sea. The provinces of Rio Hacha and Santa Martha, being separated by no recognised boundary or physical characteristic, have been described by travellers and geographers as one tract of country. It occupies about two degrees of longitude and one and a half of latitude, being traversed by a branch of the Andes, and also by the beautiful and lofty ridge called the Sierra Nevada, or Snowy Mountains of Santa Martha, from which descend numerous streams of water in every direction. Several of these streams are navigable for some distance, and between this ridge of mountains and the sea, as well as in other parts of the country, the soil is eminently fertile, and capable of producing abundantly cocoa, coffee, cotton, sugar-cane, indigo, rice, tobacco, maize, and every description of fruit and vegetable. These lands are . unoccupied, with the exception of two small villages of peaceful and inoffensive Indians. There are also large tracts of pasture lands of excellent quality, which are admirably adapted for raising cattle. On the sea-coast, near the city of Santa Martha, there is another tract of uninhabited country, extending about seventy leagues from north to south, nearly covered with superb forests, and abounding in lands of excellent quality, especially on the rivers which descend from the Snowy Mountains into the Cienaga or lake. There are only a few villages and farms scattered over it, and altogèther this part of the South American continent presents advantages to the foreign settler such as are but rarely to be met with. The climate, though warm, is healthy, and the country is free from those insects which are so troublesome in many parts. The great river Magdalena crosses the southern extremity of Santa Martha; it afterwards, during the latter part of its course, forms the boundary line between Carthagena and Santa Martha, and finally empties its waters into the sea by several mouths.

Santa Martha, the capital, is situated upon the coast, in latitude 11.19. 34. north, and longitude 74. 8. 30. west. It was founded in 1525, and was constituted an episcopal city four years afterwards. The bishopric, after being suppressed in 1562, was re-established in 1577. The place was repeatedly sacked by pirates during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; in 1672, in particular,it was completely pillaged by a French and an English vessel. Latterly, however, it rose into considerable importance as a commercial city, and enjoyed almost the exclusive privilege of importing goods for the capital of the country. The bay upon which it is situated is small and somewhat exposed. There is a castle admirably situated for the defence of the bay, upon the summit of an almost perpendicular insulated rock, above the angle at which a ship’s guns could have much effect. It commands the town and the entrance to the harbour. There is also a small battery on a level with the sea, in front of the town, mounted with a few guns. To the eastward is a range of hills, steep, and of a conical form, through the passes of which the wind rushes with great violence into the bay, thus contributing to its insecurity. Santa Martha suffered severely during the Colombian war of independence, and much of it is in ruins; but still there are some good houses, and it is improving. The cathedral is a very conspicuous object, whether the city be approached by land or sea; but neither its architecture nor its internal decorations are worthy of notice. The Franciscans and Dominicans had each a convent here. This city has one advantage over Carthagena, in being abundantly supplied with excellent fresh water from the. river Gaira, which flows near to the city. The climate is salubrious, although in summer the heat is very great. Behind the city are extensive labyrinths of wood, infested however by a great number and variety of snakes. These forests extend for some miles in an easterly direction, and are terminated by mountains, which gradually rise till they attain the height of 16,419 feet above the ocean level; and this is the elevation of the Snowy Mountains. These are all clothed with fine timber or brushwood, and form highly picturesque back ground to the town. The intermediate flat country is interspersed with numerous rosas or quintas, where fruits and vegetables are grown to supply the market. Within a league of the city there are some natural salt-pits, from which salt is to be obtained in sufficient quantities to render it capable of being made an important article of export. Silver also is said to have been found in the vicinity of Santa Martha, and a mine of lead has been discovered under the citadel. The population of this city was formerly 8000, but it has been considerably reduced. At the distance of seven or eight leagues from Santa Martha is situated the Cienaga or lake, which has a communication with the sea by a channel, sometimes navigable for canoes. These lagoons have so little depth of water, that though the canoes, by which alone they can be navigated, draw only two feet of water, they occasionally ground. Near the lake of Santa Martha is the Indian village of Pueblo Viejo, whence there is a water communication through a succession of lakes and canals, to the villages of Barranquilla and Solidad. These two places, situated on navigable canals communicating with the Magdalena, are depots for goods brought from Santa Martha to be conveyed up the river. Solidad is a place of considerable extent, built of bricks of sun-dried clay, and containing nearly 2000 inhabitants. The exports consist chiefly of cotton, which is exchanged for Osnaburg shirting, Russian duck, hardware, and other necessary articles. The population of the entire province of Santa Martha has been estimated at 62,000.
