MAJESTY, a title given to kings, which frequently serves as a term of distinction. The word seems composed of the two Latin words, major, greater, and status, state. The emperor is called Sacred Majesty, Imperial Majesty, and Caesarean Majesty; the king of Hungary is styled His Apostolic Majesty; the king of Spain is termed His Most Catholic Majesty; and the king of Portugal His Most Faithful Majesty. The king of France used to be called His Most Christian Majesty; but he was afterwards called simply King of the French, which style and title were revived after the revolution of July 1830. Napoleon Bonaparte assumed the title of Emperor and King of France. With respect to other kings, they are described from their kingdoms, as His Britannic Majesty, His Prussian Majesty, and the like. Formerly princes were more sparing in giving titles, and more modest in claiming them. Before the reign of Charles V. the king of Spain had only the title of Highness ; and before that of Henry VIII. the kings of England were only addressed by the titles of Grace and Highness.

Under the Roman republic, the title of Majesty (majestas') belonged to the whole body of the people, and to the principal magistrates; so that to diminish or wound the majesty of the commonwealth was to be wanting in respect to the state or its ministers. But when the power afterwards passed into the hands of a single person, the appellation of majesty was transferred to the emperor and the imperial family. Pliny compliments Trajan on his being contented with the title of Greatness, and speaks very invidiously of those who affected that of Majesty. Yet this last appears to be the most modest title that can be attributed to sovereigns, since, taken strictly, it signifies no more than the royalty or sovereign power.
