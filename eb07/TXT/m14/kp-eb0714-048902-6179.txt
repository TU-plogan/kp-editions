MEDIATOR, a person who manages or transacts between two parties at variance, in order to reconcile them. The word, in Scripture, is applied, first, to Jesus Christ, who is the only intercessor and peace-maker between God and man (1 Tim. ii. 5); and, secondly, to Moses, who interposed between the Lord and his people, to declare unto them his word (Deut. v. 5, iii. 19).
[7:14:490]
