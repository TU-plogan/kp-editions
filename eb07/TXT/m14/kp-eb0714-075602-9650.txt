MEUSE, a department of the north of France, formed out of the ancient provinces of Verdun, Barois (at one time called Lorraine), and Clermont. It extends in east longitude from 4. 42. to 5. 47. and in north latitude from 48. 29. to 49. 42. It is bounded on the north by the Ardennes, the duchy of Luxemburg, and the department of the Moselle; on the east by that of the Moselle and Meurthe, on the south by the Vosges and Upper Maine; and on the west by the Maine departments. It extends over 2517 square miles, and is divided into four arrondissements, twenty-eight cantons, and 591 communes. The population amounts to 284,700 persons, who all adhere to the Roman Catholic church. The whole department is hilly, and the northern part mountainous. In the valleys and the plains, which are few in number, there is moderate fertility, but nearly the half of the surface is covered with woods; and it yields barely sufficient corn for the consumption of the inhabitants. The cultivation of the vine has been of late extending, and wine of tolerably good quality is produced. The principal river, the Aleuse, is a small stream, which passes through the department, and only becomes navigable when it enters that of the Ardennes. The Aire, the Aisne, the Ornain, and the other rivers, fall into the Marne. The climate is dry and healthy, but much more temperate on the south than on the north part. Some woollen and cotton goods are manufactured; but the most important branch of industry consists of the working of iron mines, and in reducing the ore. These mines are said to yield 6600 tons of cast iron and 4400 tons of wrought iron annually. The produce of the forests is one of the chief articles of export. The capital is Bar-le-Duc. The department sends two deputies to the legislature.
