MELPOMENE, in fabulons history, one of the muses, daughter of Jupiter and Mnemosyne, who presided over tragedy. Horace has addressed the finest of his odes to her, as to the patroness of lyric poetry. She was generally represented as a young woman with a serious countenance; her garments were splendid; she wore a buskin, and held a dagger in one hand, with a sceptre and crown in the other.
