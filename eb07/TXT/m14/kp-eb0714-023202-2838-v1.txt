MANGALORE, a sea-port town and fortress of Hindustan, situated on the eastern shore of the Indian Ocean, in the province of Canara. It is large and well built, and is situated on a salt-water lake, which is separated from the sea by a beach of sand, but which communicates with a river. At high water and in fine weather ships drawing less than ten feet can enter it; and there is good anchorage off the mouth of the river in from five to seven fathoms water. The inhabitants are chiefly Mapillas or Moplas (Mahommedans), said to be descended from a colony of Arabians who settled in this place before the time of Mahommed, some of whom adopted the Nair custom of leaving their inheritance to their sister’s children. In the reign of Hyder, the principal were Moplays and Concanies; but since the British have acquired the government, and established peace and good order, men of property have resorted to the place from Surat, Cutch, Bombay, and other places to the north, and its trade and wealth have in consequence increased. The exports consist principally of rice, which is sent to Muscat in Arabia, to Goa, Bombay, and Malabar. The other articles of export are betel-nut, black pepper, sandal wood, cassia, and turmeric; in exchange for which, sugar, salt, and piece-goods, consisting of blue cotton cloth from Surat, Cutch, and Madras, and white cotton cloth from Cutch, Bownagur, and other places to the north of Bombay, are imported. Mangalore was at an early period a great mart of trade, and was resorted to for this purpose by the Arabians. Fl ere the Portuguese had also a factory, which was destroyed by the Arabians. In 1763 the town was taken by Hyder Ali, then the Mysore general; in 1768 it was captured by a detachment from Bombay, but was shortly afterwards retaken by Hyder. In 1783, Mangalore again surrendered to a force from Bombay; and, after the destruction of General Mathews’ army, sustained a long siege from Tippoo, and was gallantly defended by Colonel Campbell. Upon the conclusion of the peace in 1784 it was restored, and the fortifications were dismantled. In 1799 it was finally taken possession of by the British, and is now the station of the judge and collector, &c. of South Canara. The travelling distance from Seringapatam is 162 miles, from Madras 440 miles. Long. 75. E. Lat. 12. 49. N.
