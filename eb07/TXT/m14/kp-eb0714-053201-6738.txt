MEDITERRANEAN, something enclosed within land, or that is remote from the ocean, properly so called.

Mediterranean is more particularly used to signify that large sea which flows between the continents of Europe and Africa, entering by the straits of Gibraltar, and reaching into Asia, as far as the Euxine or Black Sea and the Palus Maeotis.

The Mediterranean was anciently called the Grecian Sea and the Great Sea. It is now cantoned out into several divisions, which bear several names. To the west of Italy it is called the Ligurian or Tuscan Sea; near Venice, the Adriatic; towards Greece, the Ionian and Aegean; between the Hellespont and the Bosphorus, the White Sea; and beyond the Bosphorus the Black Sea.
