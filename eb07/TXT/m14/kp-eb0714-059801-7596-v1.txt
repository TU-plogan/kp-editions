MESSINA, an intendancy or province of the island of Sicily, including the northern part of the Val de Demone, extending to the foot of Mount Aetna. It is bounded on the north and the east by the sea, on the south by the province of Catania, and on the west by that of Palermo. It is divided into four provinces, viz., Messina, Castroreale, Mistretta, and Patti, and contains 326,674 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, situated partly on a plain, and partly on the side of a hill overlooking the narrow Faro of Messina, and the province of Calabria on the continent. The harbour is capable of containing one thousand sail of vessels; and as the entrance is narrow, and protected by strong batteries, it was found an admirable position for a British force, whilst the opposite continent was in possession of the enemy. The city is surrounded by an old and irregular wall. It contains a fine Gothic cathedral, and many other churches, and several monasteries. Within the walls the houses are 9000, with 61,000 inhabitants, but including the several villages adjoining, the population is 73,000. It has some considerable manufactures of silk goods and an export trade in silk, oranges, citrons, oil, wine, and silk stuffs.
