MANILLA, the capital of the Spanish settlements in the Philippines, on the island of Lucon, situated on a bay of the same name, which is seventy-five miles in circumference, and into which several rivers pour their waters. At its entrance are several small islands, on one of which, called the Corregidor, an officer with a party of troops is stationed, to examine the ships coming in, and to guard against the introduction of contraband goods, or of disease. It is, perhaps, one of the most happily situated towns in the world, at the mouth of the river Pasig, which is navigable as far as the lake, about nine miles eastward of the town, out of which it flows. It is a large and handsome citv, [7:14:234]and contains many good private houses, and some magnificent churches, though they are liable to be overthrown by earthquakes. Monasteries and convents’compose the finest parts of the town. The houses of the native Indians are poor, being made of bamboos covered with leaves, and extremely combustible. On account of the frequency of earthquakes, many of the Spanish houses are built in the same manner and of the same materials. They are raised on wooden pillars, eight or ten feet from the ground, the entrance to them being by a ladder, which is pulled up at night. Most of the houses have flights of steps leading to the river, which winds through the town; and many, where the breadth of the river will admit, have baths. There is a number of small canoes with awnings constantly plying for hire, by means of which the inhabitants are enabled to visit one another with great convenience. Including the suburbs, the population of the town is estimated at 38,000, of which 1200 are Spaniards. The remaining inhabitants are mulattoes, Indians, and Chinese, who devote themselves to agriculture and to industry. Although the Spaniards are averse to the settlement of the Chinese near them, and although the latter have been several times cruelly expelled, yet there were in 1800 from 15,000 to 20,000 of that industrious nation settled on the island of Lucon. The country around Manilla is delightful, being watered by a fine river which branches into different streams. An intercourse is carried on between Manilla and the Chinese port of Amoy, as well as with the north-eastern parts of China, by means of seven or eight junks, which bring with them about 300 or 400 adventurers annually from China. Manilla, though regularly fortified, is but feebly garrisoned; and the native inhabitants have been so oppressed by the Spaniards, that it is not likely they would offer any effectual aid against an invading enemy. Under a wise and enlightened policy, Manilla, from its situation in regard to India, China, and America, might rise into great importance as an emporium of commerce; but the inhabitants are so harassed by Spanish tyranny, and all sorts of absurd restrictions, that industry is greatly discouraged. The chief exports are cordage, resinous substances, pitch and tar, cloths, rushes, rattans, indigo of an excellent quality, rice, cotton, and tobacco, which is manufactured into excellent cigars. The sugar-cane thrives well, but it is little cultivated. Cocoa is produced, and of an excellent quality; and copper is exported to Bengal, with indigo, cochineal, and a large quantity of treasure. Three leagues south-west from Manilla lies the port of Cavite, defended by an indifferent fort. A castle or fort stands at the west end of the city, and is styled the citadel of St James. It is strong; and some additional works, which still remain, were thrown up when the island was threatened, during the last war, with an attack by the English. But notwithstanding the strength of the works, it would have soon been taken if the attack had been made, as the garrison was totally deficient in discipline. In 1645 great part of this city was destroyed by an earthquake, and 3000 people perished in the ruins. It was taken in 1762 by the English, and, to save it from destruction, it was agreed to pay a ransom of a million sterling. The viceroy is captaingeneral of the Philippines; but the military strength which he possesses does not exceed 1500 men, mostly Mexicans, of whom 150 are cavalry. Long. 120. 54. E. Lat. 14. 38.
