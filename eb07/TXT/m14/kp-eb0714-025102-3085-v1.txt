MARK, St, was by birth a Jew, and descended of the tribe of Levi. He was converted by some of the apostles, probably by St Peter, of whom he was the constant companion in all his travels, supplying the place of an amanuensis and interpreter. He was sent by St Peter into Egypt, where he fixed his chief residence at Alexandria and the places adjoining, and he was so successful in his ministry that he converted multitudes both of men and women. He afterwards removed westwards, towards the parts of Libya, going through the countries of Marmorica, Pentapolis, and other places, where, notwithstanding the barbarity and idolatry of the inhabitants, he planted the gospel. Upon his return to Alexandria, he arranged the affairs of that church, and there suffered martyrdom. About Easter, at the time when the solemnities of Serapis were celebrated, the idolatrous populaće, excited.to vindicate the honour of their deity, broke in upon St Mark, whilst he was performing divine service, and binding him with cords, dragged him through the streets, and thrust him into prison, where in the night he had the comfort of a divine vision. Next day the enraged multitude used him in the same manner, till he expired under their hands. Some add, that they burned his body, and that the Christians decently interred his remains near the place where he used to preach. This happened in the year of Christ 68. Some writers assert that the remains of St Mark were afterwards translated with great pomp from Alexandria to Venice, of which he was constituted the tutelar saint and patron. This apostle is author of one of the four gospels inscribed with his name.

St Mark’s Gospel, a canonical book of the New Testament, being one of the four gospels. St Mark wrote his gospel at Rome, where he accompanied St Peter in the year of Christ 44. Tertullian and others pretend that St Mark was no more than an amanuensis to St Peter, who dictated this gospel to him; but others affirm that he wrote it after St Peter’s death. Nor are the learned less divided as to the language in which it was written; some affirming that it was composed in Greek, and others in Latin. Several of the ancient heretics received only the gospel of St Mark; and others, amongst the Catholics, rejected the last twelve verses of this gospel. The gospel of St Mark is properly an abridgment of that of St Matthew.
