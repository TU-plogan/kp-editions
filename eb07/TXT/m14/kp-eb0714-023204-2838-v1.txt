MANGEART, Dom Thomas, a Benedictine of the congregation of St Vanne and St Hidulphe, whose knowledge was an ornament to his order, and gained him the titles of antiquarian, librarian, and counsellor to Charles duke of Lorraine. He was preparing a very considerable work when he died, in the year 1763, before he had put the last hand to his book, which was published by Abbé Jacquin. This production appeared in 1763, under the title of Introduction a la Science des Médailles, pour servir à la Cοηnoissance des Dieux, de la Religion, des Sciences, des Arts, et de tout ce qui appartient a ľ Histoire ancienne, avec les preuves tirées des Médailles. But the elementary treatises on numismatical science were not sufficiently extensive, and the particular dissertations were by far too tedious and prolix. This learned Benedictine has collected into a single volume all the principles contained in the former, and all the ideas of any consequence which are to be found scattered throughout the latter. His work may serve as a supplement to Montfaucon’s Antiquity Explained. From Mangeart we likewise have a volume of Sermons, and a treatise on Purgatory, published at Nancy, 1739, in two vols. 12mo∙
