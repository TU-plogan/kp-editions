MENEDEMUS, a Greek philosopher, was a native of Eretria, the chief city of Euboea. He was the son of Clisthenes, a man of noble birth but in poor circumstances. In his youth Menedemus is said to have been employ ed in sewing the canvass of tents. The precise period of his birth and death is unknown to us, but he was the contemporary of Aretus, Lycophron, and Antagoras of Rhodes. He therefore flourished probably from aboutn.c.300 to 279∙ Menedemus having been sent with a body of troops to the assistance of Megara, seems to have there studied philosophy under Stilpo, and then proceeded to Elis, which was distinguished for the Eliac sect, founded by Phaedo. It was afterwards called the Eretrian school, from Menedemus, who taught the same doctrines. On his return to his native place, he began to give lessons in philosophy, and was distinguished for the dignified character of his eloquence, and the gravity of his deportment. He was remarkable for his temperate mode of living, which his friend Lycophron (see Lycophron) satirized in a poem entitled Menedemus. He was employed by his countrymen in the highest offices of the state; but having been accused of favouring the cause of the Macedonians, he was obliged to leave his country, and proceed to Antigonus Gonatas. In this situation, he tried to rescue his ungrateful country from slavery, but Antigonus refused tolisten to his petition, upon which Menedemus ended his life by abstinence from food for seven days. The life of Menedemus is written by Diogenes Laertius.
