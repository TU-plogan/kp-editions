MESEN, a circle in the Russian province of Archangel, extending from 63. 2. to 68. 10. N. lat., and from 37. to 44. 25. E. long. Except in the southernmost part it is very little capable of cultivation, and contains but a very thin population, in a rude state of bare existence. The capital is a city of the same name, situated at the mouth of the river Mesen, which forms a convenient harbour, in lat. 65. 16. 30. N., and long. 44. 18.55. E. It contains 1850 inhabitants, chiefly employed in the fisheries.
