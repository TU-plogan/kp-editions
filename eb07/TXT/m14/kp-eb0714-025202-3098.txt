MARLBOROUGH, a town of the county of Wilts, in the hundred of Selkley, seventy-four miles from London. It is situated on the banks of the river Kennet, in avale between two ranges of the chalk hills, about two miles from the forest sometimes called by the name of the town, but more correctly Savernake Forest. The town consists chiefly of one wide street, with piazzas to the houses on one side of it. It contains two parishes, and a corporation, which consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors. It returns two members to the House of Commons. This place conferred the title of duke on the celebrated general who conquered at Blenheim. His palace, at the end of the town, has been converted into an inn. The population amounted in 1801 to 2367, in 1811 to 2579, in 1821 to 3038, and in 1831 to 3426.
