MAYNWARING, Arthur, an eminent political writer in the beginning of the eighteenth century. He resided for several years at Oxford, and went to Cheshire, where he lived for some time with} his uncle Mr. Francis Cholmon-dely, a very worthy gentleman, but extremely averse to the government of William III. to which he refused to take the oaths. Here he prosecuted with great vigour his studies in polite literature; and coming up to London, applied himself to the study of the law. He had hitherto shewn great zeal in asserting anti-revolutionary principles, and written several pieces in favour of James II.; but upon being introduced to the Duke of Somerset and the Earls of Dorset and Burlington, he began to entertain very different notions in politics. His father left him an estate of nearly L.800 a-year, but so encumbered, that the interest-money amounted to almost as much as the income. Upon the conclusion of the peace he went to Paris, where he became acquainted with Boileau. After his return he was made one of the commissioners of the customs, in which situation he distinguished himself by his skill and industry. He was a member of the Kit-cat club, and from his pleasantry and wit was looked upon as one of its principal supporters. In the beginning of Queen Anneâ€™s reign, the lord treasurer Godolphin engaged Mr. Donne to quit the office of auditor of the imprests, and made Maynwaring a present of a patent for that office worth about L.2000 a-year, in time of business. He had a considerable share in the Medley, and was author of several other pieces. The Examiner, his antagonist in politics, allowed that he wrote with tolerable spirit, and in a masterly style. Sir Richard Steele dedicated to him the first volume of the Tatler.
