MASQUE, or Mask, a cover for the face, contrived with apertures for the eyes and mouth, and originally worn chiefly by women of condition, either to preserve their complexion from the weather, or out of modesty to prevent their being known. Poppaea, wife of Nero, is said to have been the inventor of the masque, which she used to guard her complexion from the sun and weather, aš being the most delicate woman, in regard to her person, that had then been known.

Theatrical masques were in common use both amongst the Greeks and the Romans. Suidas and Athenaeus ascribe the invention of them to the poet Choerilus, a contemporary of Thespis, and Horace attributes them to Aeschylus; but Aristotle informs us that the real inventor, and consequently the time of their first introduction and use, were unknown. Brantome observes, that the common use of modern masques was not introduced till towards the end of the sixteenth century. Masque is also used to signify any thing used to cover the face, and prevent a person being known.

Masque, in Architecture, is applied to certain pieces of sculpture, representing forms hideous or grotesque, used to fill up and adorn vacant places in frizes, the panels of doors, the keys of arches, and the like, but particularly in grottos.
