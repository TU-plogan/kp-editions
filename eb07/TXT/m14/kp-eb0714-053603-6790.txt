MELAMPUS, in fabulous history, a celebrated soothsayer and physician of Argos, the son of Amythaeon and Idomenea or Dorippe, who lived at Pylos in Peloponnessus. His servants once killed two large serpents which they found at the bottom of a large oak; and Melampus paid so much regard to their remains, that he raised a pile, upon which he burned them. He also took particular care of their young ones, and fed them with milk. Some time after this the young serpents crept to Melampus as he slept on the grass near the oak, and, as if sensible of the favours of their benefactor, they wantonly played around him, softly licking his ears. This awoke Melampus, who was astonished at the sudden change which his senses had undergone, finding himself acquainted with the chirping of the birds, and with all their rude notes, as they flew around him. Taking advantage of this supernatural gift, he made himself perfect in the knowledge of futurity, and Apollo also instructed him in the art of medicine. He had soon afterwards the happiness of curing the daughters of Proetus, by giving them hellebore, which from that circumstance has been called me-lampodium; and as a reward for his skill, he received the eldest of these princesses in marriage. The tyranny of his uncle Neleus, king of Pylos, obliged him to leave his native country; and Proetus, to shew himself more sensible of his services, gave him part of his kingdom. About this time the personal charms of Pero, the daughter of Neleus, had [7:14:537]gained many admirers; but the father promised his daughter to him only who should bring into his hands the oxen of Iphiclus. This condition displeased many; but Bias, who was also one of her admirers, engaged his brother Melampus to steal the oxen and deliver them to him. Melampus was caught in the attempt, imprisoned, and nothing but his services as a soothsayer and physician to Iphiclus could have saved him from death. All this pleaded in the favour of Melampus; but when he had taught the childless Iphiclus how to become a father, he not only obtained his liberty, but also the oxen, and, besides, he compelled Neleus to give Pero in marriage to Bias. A severe distemper, which had rendered the women of Argos insane, was totally removed by Melampus; and Anaxagoras, who then sat on the throne, rewarded his merit by giving him part of his kingdom, where he established himself, and where his posterity reigned during six successive generations. He received divine honours after death, and temples were erected to his memory.
