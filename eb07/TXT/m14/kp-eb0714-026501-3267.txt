MARTIN, St, was born at Sabaria, in Pannonia (Stain, in Lower Hungary), in the beginning of the fourth century. He was elected Bishop of Tours in the year 374. To the zeal and charity of a bishop he joined the humility and poverty of an anchorite. That he might detach himself the more from the world, he built the celebrated monastery of Mannoutier, situated near the city of Tours, between the Loire and a steep rock. In this situation St Martin, together with eighty monks, displayed the most exemplary sanctity and the greatest mortification; nor were there any monks better disciplined than those of Marmoutier. Martin died at Candes, on the 8th of November 397, but, according to others, on the 11th of November 400. His name is attached to a particular opinion concerning the mystery of the Holy Trinity. St Martin is the first of the saints confessors to whom the Latin church offered up public prayers. His life is written in elegant Latin by Fortunatus, and also by Sulpicius Severus, who was one of his disciples.

Martin, Benjamin, an eminent artist and mathematician, was born in 1704. After publishing a variety of ingenious treatises, and particularly a scientific magazine under his own name, and carrying on for many years an extensive trade as an optician and globe-maker in Fleet Street, the growing infirmities of age compelled him to withdraw from the active duties of business. Trusting too fatally to what he thought the integrity of others, he unfortunately (though with a capital more than sufficient to pay all his debts) became bankrupt. The unhappy old man, overpowered by this unexpected blow, attempted, in a moment of desperation, to destroy himself; and the wound lie gave himself, though not immediately mortal, hastened his death, which happened on the 9th February 1782, in his seventy-eighth year. He had a valuable collection of fossils, and curiosities of almost every kind, which, after his leath, were disposed of by auction. His principal publications are, 1. The Philosophic Grammar, being a view )f the present state of Experimental Physiology, or Natu-al Philosophy, 1735, 8vo; 2. A New, Complete, and Uni- ’ ersal System or Body of Decimal Arithmetic, 1735, 8vo; ’.The Young Student’s Memorial Book, or Patent Library, 735, 8vo; 4.
