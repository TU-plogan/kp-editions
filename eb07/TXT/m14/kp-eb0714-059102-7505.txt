MERCATORUM Festum, was a festival kept by the Roman merchants on the 15th of May, in honour of Mercury, who presided over merchandise. A sow was sacrificed on the occasion, and the people present sprinkled themselves with water brought from the fountain called aqua Mercurii ; the whole concluding with prayers to the god for the prosperity of trade.
