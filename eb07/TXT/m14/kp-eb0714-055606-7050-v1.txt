MENANCABOW. This state or empire is situated in the centre of the island of Sumatra, immediately under the equinoctial line. Its dominion was formerly very extensive, comprehending the whole island. When the island of Sumatra was first visited by Europeans, this state was on the decline. In more modern times it was included between the river Palemburg and that of Siak, on the eastern side of the island; and on the western side, between those of Manjuta (now Indrapur) and Singkel, where it borders on the independent country of the Battas. The present seat of the government is inland of the settlement of Padang, at the back of a mountainous district. The country is described as a large plain, surrounded with hills producing much gold, and as clear of wood and comparatively well cultivated; the people being far more advanced in the arts than any of the other natives in Sumatra. They manufacture gold and silver filagree, and have manufactured from the earliest times arms for their own use, and for exportation to the northern parts of the island. They have other weapons, [7:14:557] namely, swords and spears, a stiletto, chiefly used for assassination, and the fatal kris, a well known species of dagger in eastern countries. The government is founded upon feudal principles, like that of most other eastern states. The sultan is despotic, though he is controled by the aristocracy; and the people are slaves.
