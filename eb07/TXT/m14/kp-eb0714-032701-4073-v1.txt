MAUBEUGE, a city of the department of the North, and in the arrondissement of Avesnes, in France. It is strongly fortified, and stands on the river Sambre. It is a well-built place, containing 600 houses, with 5000 inhabitants, many of whom are occupied in making nails, articles of jewellery, and ornaments of marble; but the principal occupation of the inhabitants is the making of firearms, both for the cavalry and the infantry, and elegant fowling-pieces, which employ also many workmen in the adjoining villages.
