MERU SHAH TEHAIN, acity of Khorassan in Persia, capital of Murgiana, founded by Alexander the Great, and afterwards embellished by Antiochus Nicator, who gave it the name of Antiochia. It is situated on the river Mur-gab, the waters of which were raised by a dyke for the supply of the city. It was one of the four imperial cities of Khorassan, and was long the seat of many of the sultans of Persia, particularly of three of the Seljukian dynasty. The walls were at that time surrounded on all sides with stately palaces, groves, and gardens; and the fruits were reckoned superior to those of any other place. Alp Arslan the most powerful prince of his time, reigned here in all the splendour of oriental magnificence. This great capital was taken and pillaged by the Usbecks about the year 1793,-since which time it has been gradually declining; and its inhabitants do not amount to more than 3000, under the rule of an independent chief, the brother of the ruler of Bokhara, whose territories extend several daysâ€™journey round. It is 130 miles N.E. of Meshed.
