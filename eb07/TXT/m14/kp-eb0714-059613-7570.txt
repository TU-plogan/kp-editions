MESOPOTAMIA, the ancient name of the province of Diarbeck, in Asiatic Turkey. It is situated between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, having Assyria on the east, Armenia on the north, Syria on the west, and Arabia Deserta, with Babylonia, on the south. The Hebrews called it Padan-aram, and Aram Naharaim, or Aram of the two rivers, because it was first peopled by Aram father of the [7:14:597] Syrians, and is situated between the two rivers already mentioned. This country is much celebrated in Scripture, as being the first dwelling of men both before and after the deluge; and because it gave birth to Phaleg, Heber, Terah, Abraham, Nahor, Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Leah, and to the sons of Jacob. Babylon was in the ancient Mesopotamia, until, by vast labour and industry, the two rivers of the Tigris and the Euphrates were united into one channel. The plains of Shinar were in the same country. They often gave it the name of Mesopotamia, and sometimes that of Syria, (Hosea xii. 12).
