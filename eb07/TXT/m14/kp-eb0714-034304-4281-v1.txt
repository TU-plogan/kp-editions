MEACO, formerly the metropolis of the whole empire of Japan, and still a great city of Nephon. Its situation is in a spacious plain, hemmed in by high mountains, and almost entirely consisting of fine gardens, interspersed with temples, monasteries, mausoleums, and numerous rivulets. At the time when it flourished in its greatest prosperity, it was twenty miles in length, and nine in breadth. But a great part of this space is now unoccupied, and converted into gardens and cultivated fields. The streets are long and narrow, and consist of poor and ill-constructed houses. But a prodigious expense has been lavished on the temples, which are extravagantly magnificent; and the imperial palace forms a city by itself. Meaco is the seat of literature and science as well as of religion. It is here that the imperial almanac is printed, as well as most of the books which circulate through Japan. It is famed for the finer manufactures, particularly for Japan work, painting, carving, &c. The inhabitants are estimated at 477,000 by the last enumeration, which is probably an exaggeration, exclusive of the retainers of the court, namely, the monks and nuns, who cannot be 52,000. It is still the spiritual capital of the empire, being the residence of the dairo or head of the church, to whom the highest honours are paid. Long. 153.30. Lat. 35. 24. N.
