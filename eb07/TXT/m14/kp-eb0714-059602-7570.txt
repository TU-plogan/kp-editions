MERTON, a town in the county of Surrey and hundred of Brixton, seven miles from London. It is situated on the river Wandle and celebrated for its calico printing, which is considered as the most perfect both in design and execution of any produced in England. The college of the same name at Oxford was originally founded here and removed to that city in 1274, at the end of ten years. The great Lord Nelson was a resident of this place. The population in 1801 amounted to 813; in 1811 to 905; in 1821 to 1177; and in 1831 to 1447.
