METELLUS, the surname of the family of the Caecilii at Rome, of whom the best known were the following. First, a general who defeated the Achaeans, took Thebes, and invaded Macedonia. Second, Q. Caecilius, who rendered himself illustrious by his successes against Jugurtha, king of Numidia, from which he received the surname of Numidicus. Another of this name, being high priest, saved from the flames the palladium when Vesta’s temple was on fire. He lost his sight and one of his arms in the action; and the senate, to reward his zeal and piety, permitted him to be always drawn to the senate-house in a chariot, an honour which no one had ever before enjoyed. He also gained a great victory over the Carthaginians. Fourth, Q. Caecilius Celer, who distinguished himself by his spirited exertions against Catiline. He married the sister of Clodins, who disgraced him by her incontinence and lasciviousness, and died fifty-seven years before Christ. He was greatly lamented by Cicero, who shed tears at the loss of one of his most faithful and valued friends. Fifth, L. Caecilius, a tribune in the civil wars of Caesar and Pompey. He favoured the cause of Pompey, and opposed Caesar when he entered Rome with a victorious army. He refused to open the gates of Saturn’s temple, in which were deposited great treasures; upon which they were broken open by Caesar, and Metellus retired when threatened with death. Sixth, Q. Caecilius, a warlike general who conquered Crete and Macedonia, and was surnamed Macedonicus. He had four sons, of whom three were consuls, and the other obtained a triumph, all during their father’s lifetime. Seventh, a general of the Roman armies against the Sicilians and Carthaginians. Before he marched, he offered sacrifices to all the gods excepting Vesta; a neglect for which the goddess was so incensed that she demanded the blood of his daughter Metella. When Metella was going to be immolated, the goddess placed a heifer in her stead, and carried her to a temple at Lanuvium, of which she became the priestess. Another, surnamed Dalmaticus, from his conquest over· Dalmatia, in the year of the city 634. Cimber, one of the conspirators against Caesar. It was he who gave the signal to attack and murder the dictator in the senate-house. Lastly, Pius, a general in Spain against Sertorius, on whose head he set a price of a hundred talents and twenty thousand acres of land.
