MANASSEH, in Scripture history, the eldest son of Joseph, and grandson of the patriarch Jacob (Genesis, xli. 50, 51), was born in the year of the world 2290, and before Jesus Christ 1714. The tribe descended from him came out of Egypt in number thirty-two thousand two hundred men fit for battle, being upwards of twenty years old, under the conduct t of Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur (Numbers, ii. 20,21). This tribe was divided on their entrance into the land of promise; one half receiving its portion beyond the river Jordan, and the other half on this side of the stream. The half tribe of Manassch which settled beyond the river possessed the country of Bashan, from the river Jabbok to Mount Libanus (Numbers, xxii. 33,34, &c.); and the half tribe settled on this side Jordan obtained for its inheritance the country between the tribe of Ephraim to the south and the tribe of Issachar to the north, having the river Jordan to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the west (Joshua, xvii.).
