METZ, an arrondissement of the department of the Moselle, in France, extending over 664 square miles. It is divided into nine cantons, and these into 275 communes, and it contains 136,500 inhabitants. The city of Metz, the capital of the department, as well as that of the arrondissement, is situated on the river Moselle, where the Seille falls into that stream, and becomes navigable. It is divided into two branches, one of which washes the walls of the city, and the other divides it into two parts. The Seille passes the city on the south and east sides, and then falls into the Moselle. Metz is one of the strongest fortified cities of France, and is defended by a powerful quadrangular citadel on the south side. The situation is fine, being surrounded with gentle elevations, forming a circle, the sides of which are covered with vineyards and fruit-trees. It has several institutions for education, especially a united college for the instruction of officers of engineers and artillery. There are sixteen churches; and it is the see of a bishop. The cathedral is of Gothic architecture, of prodigious extent, and has a tower 360 feet in height. Some of the other public buildings are large, but in a very antique style, as are the greater part of the private dwellings. The city contains 5850 houses and 43,400 inhabitants, exclusively of the garrison. There are in it manufactories of coarse cloths, flannels, and blankets; of sail-cloth and other linen goods; besides distillers, paper-makcrs, and hat-makers. Long. 6. 5. 8. E. Lat. 49. 7. 10. N.
