MAST, a long round piece of timber, elevated perpendicularly upon the keel of a ship, to which are attached the yards, the sails, and the rigging. See Ship-Building.

The mast which is placed at the middle of the shipâ€™s length is called the main-mast; that which is placed in the fore part, the fore-mast; and that which is towards the stern is termed the mizen-rnast.
