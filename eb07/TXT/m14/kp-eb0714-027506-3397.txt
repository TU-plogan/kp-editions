MASBOTHAEI, or Mesbothaei, the name of a sect, or rather of two sects. Hegesippus, cited by Eusebius, mentions two different sects of Masbothaeans. The first waâ…› [7:14:276]one of the seven sects which rose out of Judaism, and proved very troublesome to the church; the second was one of the seven Jewish sects before the coming of Jesus Christ. The word is derived from the Hebrew rw, scha-bat, to rest or repose, and signifies idle, easy, indolent people. Eusebius speaks of them as if they had been so called from one Masbotheus their chief; but it is much more probable that their name is Hebrew, or at least Chaldaie, and signifies the same thing with Sabbatarian in our language, that is, one who makes profession of keeping Sabbath. Vale-sins cautions us not to confound the two sects; the latter being a sect of Jews before or contemporary with Christ, and the former a sect of heretics descended from them.
