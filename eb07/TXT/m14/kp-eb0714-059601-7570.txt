MERTHYR TYDVIL, a large town of the county of Glamorgan and hundred of Narberth, in South Wales, 184 miles from London, and 24 from Cardiff. From a small village it has, in a few years, since a canal navigation has been opened with the sea at Cardiff, risen from a small village to a large and populous town. This progress has been made by the great improvement which has been introduced in the fabrication of iron, the ore of which, as well as abundance of coal, is found in vast quantities. The machinery of the principal works, especially the overshed wheels, is of stupendous power, and one is turned by a stream of water brought by artificial means from hills at five miles distance. The cast and forged iron that is made in this place amount to many hundred tons weekly, and with the contingent occupations gives employment to thousands of individuals. It has well supplied markets on Wednesday and Saturday. From its population and wealth it has by the Reform Act acquired the privilege of returning one member to the House of Commons. The population in 1801 amounted to 7,705; in 1811 to 11,104; in 1821 to 17,404; and in 1831 to 22,083.
