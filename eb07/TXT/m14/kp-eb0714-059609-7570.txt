MESHED Ali, or Nesjiff, a celebrated town of Irak Arabi, and a holy city, the supposed burying place of the caliph Ali, situated on a hill at the bottom of an artificial lake, twenty-five miles from Hilleh and four miles from Kufa. This city was founded by Alexander the Great and for a long time bore the name of Alexandria which was afterwards changed into that of Hira, when it became the residence of an Arabian dynasty of princes, who fought under the Parthian banners against the emperors of Rome. It was governed by Christian princes till the year 632, when it was taken by Kaled the Saracen general, who put to death the last of the race. It is a well built town, defended by a good wall, deep ditch, and lofty towers, which were renewed in consequence of the dread of an attack from the Wa-habbees. The tomb of Ali, which fills an ample space in the middle of the city, is a monstrous structure, encircled by a high wall, within which it is death for an infidel to penetrate. The dome is light and elegant and was gilded by order of Nadir Shah. The town is supported by an influx of pilgrims who come to adore at the shrine of Ali. The environs are arid and barren, and are rendered still more gloomy by the numerous graves of Persian fanatics who order their remains to be transported hither from the most remote parts of Persia. The town was formerly supplied with water by an aqueduct which was destroyed by the Wahabbccs; so that Colonel Kinneir, who was here in 1808, mentions that a supply of water had to be brought to the city from a distance of three miles in sheep skins. It is 90 miles south of Bagdad.
