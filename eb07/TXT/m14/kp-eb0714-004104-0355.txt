MAHY, a river of Hindustan, in the province of Malwah and district of Oojain, not far from the source of the Chumbul, which, after a course of 280 miles, including its windings, falls into the Gulf of Cambay. In very few places does it attain to any considerable depth. The banks are inhabited by an uncivilized Hindu tribe, who are shepherds.
