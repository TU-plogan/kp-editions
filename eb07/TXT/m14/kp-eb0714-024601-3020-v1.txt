MARGATE, a town of the county of Kent, in the parish of St John and the liberty of Dover, seventy-two miles from London. It stands on the sea-shore, on the northernmost point of the Isle of Thanet. It was originally a fishing village, but has gradually risen to its present importance, from having become a bathing place of considerable celebrity, owing to its easy access from the metropolis. It rises from the shore with a most imposing aspect as viewed from the sea. Some of the streets, crescents, and buildings are handsome; and the machines for bathing, as well as the permanent baths, are appropriate. The hotels, lodging-houses, libraries, subscription rooms, and public gardens, are well adapted to the purposes of recreation, which is more the object of the numerous visitors than the restoration of health. The steam and sailing packets arrive here from London daily, and even almost hourly; and the conveniences for landing and embarking have been much improved by the erection of a pier, which forms also an agreeable promenade. The assembly room and the theatre are great attractions to the visitors. The police is under the superintendence of the mayor of Dover, and is well conducted. As the country around is fertile, the markets, which are held on Wednesday and Saturday, are abundantly supplied. The population amounted in 1801 to 4766, in 1811 to 6126, in 1821 to 7843, and in 1831 to 10,339; but the census was taken in May, when there are no visitors.
