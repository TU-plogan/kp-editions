MELOS, in Ancient Geography, an island situated between Crete and Peloponnessus, about twenty-four miles from Scyllaeum. It is about sixty miles in circumference, and of an oblong figure. It enjoyed its independence for about 700 years before the time of the Peloponnesian war. This island was originally peopled by a Lacedaemonian colony, 1116 years before the Christian era; and hence the inhabitants refused to join the rest of the islands and the Athenians against the Peloponnesians. But this refusal was severely punished. The Athenians took Melos, and pnt to the sw ord all those who were able to bear arms. The women and children were made slaves, and the island left desolate. An Athenian colony repeopled it, till Lysander reconquered the island, and re-established the original inhabitants in their possessions.
