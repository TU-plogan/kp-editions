MAXIMUS, a celebrated Cynic philosopher and magician of Ephesus. He instructed the emperor Julian in magic; and, according to the opinion of some historians, it was in the conversation and company of Maximus that the apostacy of Julian originated. The emperor not only visited the philosopher, but he even submitted his writings to his inspection and censure. Maximus refused to live in the court of Julian; and the emperor, not dissatisfied with the refusal, appointed him pontifex maximus in the province of Lydia, an office which he discharged with the greatest moderation and justice. When Julian went into the East, the philosopher promised him success, and even said that his conquests would be more numerous and extensive than those of the son of Philip. He persuaded his imperial pupil, that, [7:14:334]according to the doctrine of metempsychosis, his body was animated by the soul which had once animated the hero whose greatness and victories he was about to eclipse. After the death of Julian, Maximus was almost sacrificed to the fury of the soldiers; but the interposition of his friends saved his life, and he retired to Constantinople. He was soon afterwards accused of magical practices, before the emperor Valens, and beheaded at Ephesus in the year 366 of our era. He wrote some philosophical and rhetorical treatises, which were dedicated to Julian, but are all lost.

Maximus of Tyre, a Platonic philosopher, who went to Rome in 146, and acquired such reputation there, that the emperor Marcus Aurelius became his scholar, and gave him frequent proofs of his esteem. This philosopher is believed to have lived until the reign of the emperor Commodus. There are still extant forty-one of his dissertations; a good edition of which was printed by Daniel Heinsius in 1624, in Greek and Latin, with notes.
