MARTIN, St, an island in the West Indies, situated between Anguilla and St Bartholomew, in latitude 18.4.0. north, and longitude 63. 14. 0. west. It is about fifteen miles in length by twelve at its greatest breadth. The coast is indented with numerous bays, which makes it appear larger than it really is. The interior is mountainous, but the nature of the soil is of secondary importance, as the wealth of the island consists in its salt-pits and saltwater lakes. Salt indeed has been found the most profitable article of export, the annual value of one marsh exceeding L.12,000. It first belonged to Spain, from which it was wrested by the French; but the Dutch prevented their entire occupation of the island, and the two powers agreed to divide it between them. The French entered into possession of that part of it which looks towards Anguilla, being the most beautiful and pleasantly situated, whilst the Dutch occupied the most profitable, that which contained the salt-pits and ponds. The result was such as might have been anticipated. The Dutch throve prosperously, whilst the French remained poor and ill provided with the necessaries of life; and they were, besides, repeatedly plundered by the English. In 1801 the island was taken by the British, but it was afterwards restored to the two powers, who have since continued in the possession of their respective portions of it.
