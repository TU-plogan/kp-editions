MASTER, a title given to several officers and persons of authority and command, particularly to the chiefs of the orders of knighthood, and some others. Thus we say, the grand master of Malta, of St Lazarus, of the golden fleece, of the free masons, and so of others.

Master (Magister) was a title frequent amongst the Romans. They had their master of the people, magister populi, who was the dictator; the master of the cavalry, magister equitum, who held the second post in an army after the dictator; and there were also masters of the infantry, magistri peditum, and a master of the census, magister census, who had nothing of the charge of a censor, or subcensor, as the name seems to intimate, but was the same with the proepositus frumentariorum. Master of the Militia (magister militiae) was an officer in the lower empire, created, as is said, by Diocletian, and having the inspection and government of all the forces, somewhat like a constable of France. At first there were two of these officers instituted, the one for the infantry and the other for the cavalry; but the two were united into one under Constantine. Afterwards, as their power was increased, so was also their number; and there was one appointed for the court, another for Thrace, a third for the East, and a fourth for Illyria. They were afterwards called comites and clarissimi. Their power was only a branch of that of the ļrreefectusproetorii, who by this means became a civil officer.

Master of Arms (magister armorum) was an officer or comptroller under the master of the militia.

Master of the Offices (magister officiorum) had the superintendence of all the officers of the court; he was also called magister officii palatini, simply magister, and his post magisteria. This officer was the same in the western empire with the curopalates in the eastern.

Master at Arms is an officer appointed to teach the officers and crew of a ship of war the exercise of small arms, to confine and plant sentinels over prisoners, and to superintend whatever relates to them during their confinement.

Master of Arts, the first degree taken in foreign universities, but the second in ours; candidates not being admitted to it till they have studied in the university a certain number of years.

MASTER-Atteηdaηt is an officer in the royal dock-yards, appointed to hasten and assist at the fitting out or dismantling, removing or securing vessels of war and others, at the port where he resides.

Master of the Ceremonies is an officer instituted by King James I. for the more solemn and honourable reception of ambassadors and strangers of quality, whom he introduces into the presence.

Masters of Chancery are usually chosen out of the barristers of the common law, and sit in chancery, or at the rolls, as assistants to the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls.

Master of the Horse is reckoned the third great officer of the court, and is an office of great honour and antiquity, and always, when not put in commission, filled by noblemen of the highest rank and abilities.

Master of the Household is an officer under the treasurer of the household. His business is to survey the accounts of the household.

Master of the Mint was anciently the title of him who is now called Warden of the Mint, whose office is to receive the silver and bullion which comes to the mint to be coined, and to take charge thereof.

Master of the Ordnance. See Ordnance. Master of the Revels, an officer whose business it was to order all things relating to the performance of plays, masks, balls, and other amusements, at court.

Master of the Rolls, a patent officer for life, who has the custody of the rolls and patents which pass the great seal, and of the records of the chancery. In the absence of the [7:14:312] Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, he also sits as judge in the court of chancery, and is by Sir Edward Coke called his assistant. At other times he hears causes in the rolls chapel, and makes orders and decrees. He is also the first of the masters of chancery, and has their assistance at the rolls; but all hearings before him are appealable to the Lord Chancellor.

Master of a Ship, an officer to whom is committed the direction of a merchant vessel, who commands it in chief, and is charged with the merchandises on board.

Master of a Ship of War is an officer appointed by the commissioners of the navy, to take charge of navigating a ship from port to port under the direction of the captain.

Master of the Temple. The founder of the order of the Templars, and all his successors, were called magni templi magistri ; and ever since the dissolution of the order the spiritual guide and director of the house is called by that name.

Master Load, in mining, a term used to express the larger vein of a metal, in places where there are several veins in the same mountain. Thus it happens that there are seven, sometimes five, but more usually three veins or loads, parallel to each other, in the same mountain. Of these the middle vein is the largest, and is called the master load.
