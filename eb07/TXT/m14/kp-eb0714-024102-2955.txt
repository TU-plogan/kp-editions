MARATHON, in Ancient Geography, one of the demi or hamlets of Attica, about ten miles to the north-east of Athens, and near the sea. It still retains its ancient name; but is very inconsiderable, consisting only of a few houses [7:14:242]and gardens. The plain of Marathon is famous for the victory which was there gained by Miltiades over the Per- , sians, by which the liberties of Athens and the other cities of Greece were saved.
