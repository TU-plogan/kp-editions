MERDIN, a city of Diarbekir in Asiatic Turkey, situated upon the top of one of the lofty heights of a mountainous ridge, and commanded by a castle which crowns the summit of the rock. From its situation it is very difficult of access. On the northern side the access is by a narrow pathway which winds amidst rocks and precipices. On the south the road is somewhat better but still very steep, and about a mile and a half in length. The houses are all built of fine hewn stone, and are very old, appearing from the position of the town in a declivity, to rise successively one on the top of another. The works are kept in tolerable repair; but the castle which has a few old pieces of cannon mounted on its towers, is now in a very dilapidated state, having never been completely repaired since the place was taken by Timour. Notwithstanding the elevated situation of the city it has a plentiful supply of the finest water. In the recesses of the mountains the vine is cultivated with success, and wine and considerable quantities of brandy are made by the Armenians. The population of Merdin amounts to 11,000, of which 1500 are Armenians, 200 Jews, the remainder Turks, Arabs, and Kurds. Merdin is the frontier town of the pashalik of Bagdad towards Constantinople, and under the government of an officer appointed by the pasha; it is forty-five miles south from Diarbekir.
