MERSEBURG, one of the departments into which the Prussian government of Saxony is divided. It is formed out of a part of the dominion of the kingdom of Saxony, and several divisions which, before the late war, belonged to Prussia, and is now a compact territory, though some portions of the country of Saxe-Weimer and of Bernburg are mixed with and surrounded by it. The extent of the government is 4114 square miles, and in 1826 it contained 565,632 inhabitants, in sixty-nine cities or walled towns, eleven market towns, and 1648 villages and hamlets. It is divided into seventeen eircles, one of which is of the same name as the government, and contains the capital and the district around it. This capital is situated upon the river Saal, at the point where the Geisalbach falls into that stream; it is surrounded with walls, and though old is well built. The dome, or cathedral church, is celebrated as the burial-place of the Emperor Rudolph of Swabia, of Bishop Ditt-mar, one of the oldest of the German authors, and other eminent persons; and also on account of an organ of great power, with 4000 pipes. There are three parochial churches, an orphan house, workhouse and hospital, 1895 dwellings, and 8056 inhabitants. There are also several institutions for education, especially an endowed grammar school. It contains some cloth manufactories, some tanneries, and extensive distilleries. Lat. 51. 21. 35. N.
