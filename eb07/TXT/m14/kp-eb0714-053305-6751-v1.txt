MEGNA. This river is formed by the numerous streams which issue from the mountains that form the northern boundary of Bengal, of which the principal is the Brahmaputra, which joins it about lat. 24. 10., after which its size is greatly increased, and it assumes the name of the Megna. Below the city of Dacca it is joined by the Issamuthy, bringing the collected waters of the Dullasery, Boorigmega, Luckia, and many other smaller rivers, forming an expanse of water resembling an inland sea. From hence it approaches the sea by a SSE. course, when its volume is augmented by the Ganges·, and the whole collected stream is rolled into the bay of Bengal. The muddy tide leaves a great quantity of sediment, which forms many islands, amongst which are Dukkinshabazpoor, thirty miles long and twelve broad, Hatha, Sundeep, and Bamony. Between these islands the tide rushes with great impetuosity, forming in spring tides what is called the Bore, which in a few minutes rises twelve feet in height. The sand-banks run nearly thirty miles into the sea, and will probably be one day habitable islands, like Sangor.
