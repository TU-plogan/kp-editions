MANSAROWAR, or Mansahror, a lake situated on the northern side of the Himalaya Mountains, which divide Hindustan from Thibet and Tartary. It is considered by the Hindus as the most sacred of all the various places of pilgrimage, and they evince their zeal by the hardships and dangers which they endure in reaching it. It is also held in great veneration by the Tartars, who carry a portion of the ashes of their friends from a very great distance to be thrown into it. It is situated on an elevated plain covered with long grass; and to the north is a conical hill dedicated to Mahadeva, and described as forming an irregular oval, approaching to a circle. It is eleven miles in breadth from north to south, and fifteen miles in length. It occupies the pilgrims five days to go round the lake, which, from its form, appears as if it had been the crater of a volcano. From this lake, according to the notions of the Hindus, flow four venerated rivers, namely, the Brahmapootra, the Ganges, the Indus, and the Sita. For a long period this lake was supposed to he the source of the Ganges, but recent surveys have corrected this mistake. Mr Moorcroft, who visited this lake in 1812, is of opinion that it has no considerable outlet. The water is clear and well tasted, and is supposed to be deepest in August and September, when it is replenished by the melting of the mountain snows. In the adjoining country are found wild horses, the yak of Tartary, and goats, which produce shawl wool. It is supposed to be situated about the 81st degree of east longitude, and the 31st degree of north latitude.
