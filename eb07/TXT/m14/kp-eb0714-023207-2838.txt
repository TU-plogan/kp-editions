MANGEEDARA, a district in the most eastern quarter of Borneo, extending towards the Sooloo archipelago, in a long narrow point. This peninsula, which is named Unsang, terminates eastward in a bluff point. On the northeast is a small island named Tambeesan, which forms a harbour capable of admitting ships of a considerable size. This district produces edible bird-nests, lackawood, dammer, and gold.
