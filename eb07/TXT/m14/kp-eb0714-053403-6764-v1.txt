MEISSEN, one of the circles into which the kingdom of Saxony is divided, being formed out of the ancient margravate of that name. It extends over 1610 square miles, comprehends thirty-nine cities and towns, 1156 villages, and 309,460 inhabitants. It is divided into twelve bailiwicks, one of which bears the same name. It is a productive territory, but suffered much during the late war, from the effects of which it has scarcely yet recovered. The city of Meissen, which is the capital of the circle, is situated on the river Elbe, over which is a bridge in a picturesque situation, rendered more so from the Albertsburg, the ancient palace of the Saxon house, but now used for the manufacture of the celebrated china which has been commonly called Dresden. This fabric employs about 500 workmen, but is said to be attended with an annual loss to the king, who is the proprietor. Meissen contains in the town and suburbs 556 houses, with 4270 inhabitants, some of whom are employed in making linen and woollen goods, and in tanneries.
