MALVOISIN, William de, some time chancellor of Scotland, was bred in France, and has been thought by some to have been a native Frenchman. Soon after his coming to this country, he was made one of the clerici regis, and archdeacon of St Andrews, in which latter capacity we find him present at the christening of the young prince, afterwards King Alexander II. He was constituted chancellor of Scotland on the death of Hugh, bishop of Glasgow, 6th September 1199, about which time also he was elected into the see of Glasgow, and was consecrated the following year by a special precept from Pope Innocent III. In 1202 he was* translated to St Andrews, when he seems to have resigned the chancellorship. In September 1208 he dedicated the new cemetery at the monastery of Dryburgh (Chalmers’s Caledonia, ii. 339). In 1211 we find him, and Walter, bishop of Glasgow, possessed of legatine powers from Rome, and assembling at Perth a great council of the clergy and people, to press upon them the pope’s will and command that an expedition be undertaken to the Holy Land. In 1214 he attended the coronation of King Alexander II. and is said to have set the crown on the head of that monarch. The following year he went with the bishops of Glasgow and Moray, and Henry abbot of Kelso, to the fourth Lateran council, where he remained till 1218; and in the ninth year of King Alexander II. he made a mortification[7:14:72] for the soul of King William. He brought into this country from the Continent some orders of monks and mendicants, till then unknown here, and had convents of Dominican friars erected at Aberdeen, Ayr, Berwick, Edinburgh, Elgin, Inverness, Montrose, Perth, and Stirling, and monasteries for the monks of Valliscaulium at Pluscardine in Moray, Beaulieu in Ross, and Ardchattan in Argyle. He wrote lives of the popish saints Ninian and Kentigern; and it was to him and in his time that Pope Innocent III. sent the decretal letters which appear in the Corpus Juris Canonici {Decret. Greg. b. iii. tit. 49, c. 6), to the king of Scots; and (b. iii. tit. 24, c. 9; b. iv. tit. 20, c. 6; and b. v. tit. 39, c. 28), to the bishop, archdeacon, and abbot of St Andrews respectively. The zeal of this bishop for holy church is evident; but it was not his only passion, for on one occasion we find that he deprived the abbey of Dunfermline of the presentation to two churches, because the monks had failed to provide him wine for supper. Fordun says the monks had indeed supplied wine, but the bishop’s attendants had drunk it all up. In a composition regarding tithes, anno 1277 (Connel, Tith. ii. 413), there is reference to an ordinance, “Willielmi dicti Mawvoisin, Episcopi Sancti Andrere.” Malvoisin continued Bishop of St Andrews till his death, which happened on the 9th of July 1238. (Fordun; Keith’s Bishops ; Chalmers’s Caledonia, vol. iii. p. 616.)
