MEDITRINALIA, a Roman festival in honour of the goddess Meditrina, observed on the 30th of September. Both the deity and the festival were so called a medendo, because on this day they began to drink new wine mixed with old by way of medicine. The mixture of wines, on this festival, was drunk with much form and solemn ceremony.
