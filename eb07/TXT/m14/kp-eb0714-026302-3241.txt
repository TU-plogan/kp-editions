MARSHAL, or Mareschal (marescallus), primarily denotes an officer who had the charge or the command of horses. Nico derives the word from polemarchus, master of the camp; and Matthew Paris from Martis senes-callus. In the Old Gaulish language, march meant horse; and hence mareschal might signify him who commanded the cavalry. Other derivations have been given by different authors; and the name itself has been applied to officers whose employments were very different.

Earl Marshal of Scotland. This officer had the command of the cavalry, whereas the constable commanded the whole army. They seem, however, to have had a sort of joint command, as of old all orders were addressed to the constable and marischal. The office of earl marischal has never been out of the family of Keith.

Earl Marshal of England, is the eighth great officer of state. His office, until it was made hereditary, always passed by grant from the king, and was never held by tenure or sergeantry, as the offices of Lord High Steward and Lord High Constable were sometimes held. The title is personal, the office honorary and officiary.

Field- Marshal, an officer of high rank in the European armies.
