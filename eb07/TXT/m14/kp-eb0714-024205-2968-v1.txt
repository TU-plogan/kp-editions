MARBELLA, a city of Spain, situated on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, in the province of Andalusia and kingdom of Granada. It stands at the foot of a very high mountain, whence copious streams flow, and are conducted to a beautiful fountain in the square of this place. The vicinity of Marbella is a rich but narrow tract of land on the sea shore, where coffee, cotton, sugar, indigo, and other tropical productions are cultivated with considerable success, and which also yields the indigenous fruits, oranges, lemons, figs, grapes, pomegranates, and some exquisite plums. It more resembles the West India islands than a part of Europe. The city contains about 8000 inhabitants.
