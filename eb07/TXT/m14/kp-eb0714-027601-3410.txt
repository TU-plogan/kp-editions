MASCALI, a parliamentary city of the island of Sicily, in the kingdom of Naples, in the province Demone, 140 miles from Palermo. It is situated on a river issuing from Mount Aetna, in a salubrious district, and is very ill built, but contains 14,000 inhabitants, some of whom are employed in weaving cloth, others in the fisheries, and most in cultivating rice and other corn.
