MARTINICO, or Martinique, a large island in the West Indies, belonging to France. It is nearly fifty miles in length by about sixteen in breadth, and comprehends an area of 360 square miles. The surface is uneven, and intersected in all parts by steep and rugged rocks. Piton de Corbet, one of the highest, is about 812 feet above the level of the sea. The shape of this calcareous hill resembles a cone, and it is on that account very difficult of access. The palm trees with which it is covered become more lofty and abundant near the summit, and these continually attract the clouds, which occasion noxious damps, and contribute to render it more rugged in appearance, and more dangerous to ascend. There are also two other mountains conspicuous from their elevation, and from these, particularly from the first, descend numerous streams, which irrigate the island. Martinique is better supplied with water, and less exposed to hurricanes, than Guadaloupe, whilst the productions of both islands are nearly the same. Of 75,321 hectares,^[1. A hectare is nearly two and a łialf English acres.] the superficial area of the island, 17,622 are employed in raising sugar-cane, 3861 in [7:14:266] coffee, 719 in cocoa, 491 in cotton, 17,191 are pasturage, and 19,997 are woods. The annual production is valued at 21,000,000 francs. In 1824, the island consumed French products to the value of 16,000,000 francs, and exported to the mother country goods to the amount of 18,000,000 francs. The tonnage engaged in this commerce amounted to 33,500 tons. The revenue in 1823 was 4,000,000 francs. These are the latest returns which can be obtained, but the commerce of Martinique has continued nearly the same since the period at which the above estimate was made.

Port Royal, the capital and seat of the courts of justice, is situated on one of the several bays which indent the island, and possesses one of the safest and most capacious harbours in the West Indies, or even in the world. It is a well-built and pretty place, the streets being in general placed at right angles to each other, with water running on either side of them. The houses are high, and have more of an European appearance than those in our British colonies. It possesses four large and well-furnished booksellers’ shops, with a population of 7000. But the chief trade centres in St Pierre, the largest place in Martinique, or in all French America. Like Port Royal, it is situated in a bay, and possesses a large and excellent harbour. All visitors are liberal in their praise of the beauty of this town. The streets are neat, regular, and cleanly; the houses good, lofty, and substantial, being generally built of stone, and having an European aspect. Some of the streets have an avenue of trees, which overshadow the footpath; and on either side are deep gutters, down which the water flows. There are two churches, both of them good, and tastefully fitted up. There is a pretty large botanic garden, which is in a flourishing and improving state. St Pierre possesses a theatre, which English travellers pronounce the best in the West Indies. It is the most commercial town in the Lesser Antilles, and contains 2080 houses, and a population of 30,000. In 1827 the whole island contained 101,865 inhabitants, of whom 9937 were whites, 10,786 were free people of colour, and 81,142 were slaves. It has a garrison, and the administration is conducted by a council, at the head of which is the governor.

Martinique was discovered by the Spaniards in the year 1493. It afterwards came into the possession of France, by which power it was held till about the middle of the eighteenth century, when it fell into the hands of the English. It was subsequently restored to France, but during the wars between the two countries it was twice captured by Britain. At the peace of 1814, however, it was finally ceded to France.
