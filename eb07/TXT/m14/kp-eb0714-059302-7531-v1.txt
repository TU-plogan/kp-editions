MERIDA, a city of Spain in the province of Estremadura. It is situated on the south side of the river Guadiana, in a strong situation, but by no means in a fruitful country. It was a place of great importance during the prevalence of the power of the Romans in Spain. The monuments left of that people now claim the admiration of all travellers. The circus, the theatres, and a bridge of fifty arches, are still in tolerable preservation, and numerous interesting inscriptions have been discovered amongst the ruins. It contains six monasteries, and 4500 inhabitants.

Mekida, a province of Colombia in South America. It is bounded on the south by Pamplona and Uarinas; on the north by the lake of Maracaybo; on the west by the province of Maracaybo; and on the east by Truxillo. This province, although in some parts mountainous, and in others unhealthy, has many vallies and plains of extraordinary richness and fertility, yielding in abundance the choicest productions of Colombia. Merida the capital is situated about one hundred and sixty leagues from Caracas, and about one hundred and fifty leagues from Bogota. It stands upon an elevated table land, three leagues in length and one in breadth, is surrounded by three rivers, and unites a fertile soil and temperate climate, with remarkable beauty of situation. It was founded in 1558 under the name of Santiago de los Caballeros de Merida, and was once by far the largest city in Venezuela next to Caracas, but having been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes, it has greatly declined. It is regularly laid out like all the Spanish towns, the streets intersecting each other at right angles, and having each in the centre a clear stream of running water. Being an episcopal city it possesses a cathedral, and there are likewise a convent of nuns, an hospital, a college and other public institutions. By an earthquake which overwhelmed it in 1812, several convents and churches were destroyed, together with a considerable portion of the other buildings. Many of the inhabitants perished in the ruins, nor has Merida entirely recovered from the calamity which then overtook it. The population prior to 1812 amounted to 12,000, but it is now reduced below one-half of that number. Within view of the city the land yields cocoa, coffee, cotton, maize, plantains, and the tropical fruits; together with wheat, barley, and potatoes. In the valley of the Chama, at the foot of the mountains, the temperature is between 89° and 90° of Fahrenheit, whilst immediately fronting the town, the mountains rise into the regions of perpetual snow. The mean temperature of the city is from 67° to 70°, but the vicissitudes of a single day are extreme. The ascent to the city from the valley is by a very steep and narrow pass, and above the plateau on which the city stands, lofty chains of mountains are seen towering on every side. Those to the south are the highest, and their snowy summits are seen rising out of a zone of dark green forests. The number of mountain rivulets affords abundance of watcr-power for machinery; and should it be found practicable to render the Chama navigable, Merida, from its vicinity to the lake of Maracaybo, would enjoy almost the advantages of a maritime situation. But the excessive insalubrity of that part of the lake where the Chama falls into it is assigned as the reason why the difficulties of the river navigation have not been obviated. In the vicinity of Merida there are said to be mines of gold, but they are not worked. The exceeding fertility of the surrounding country, however, independently of the precious metals, might raise Merida into a place of importance did not its liability to earthquakes prevent its being settled to an extent commensurate with its natural resources. The population of the whole province has been estimated at 50,000.
