MENASSEH, Ben Israce, a celebrated rabbi,was born in Portugal about the year 1604. He was the son of Joseph Ben Israel, and followed his father into Holland, where he was educated by Rabbi Isaac Uziel, under whom he in a short time made so great progress in the Hebrew tongue, that at eighteen years of age he succeeded his instructor in the synagogue of Amsterdam. In this posthe continued several years, and married Rachel, of the family of the Abarbanels, whom the Jews believe to be descended from King David. He afterwards went to his brother Ephraim, a rich merchant, who had settled at Basil, and by whose advice he entered into trade. Some time afterwards, the hopes of a more agreeable settlement induced him to visit England, then under the protectorship of Cromwell, who gave him a very favourable reception, and one day entertained him at his table with several other learned divines. However, he soon afterwards passed into Zealand, and died at Middleburg about the year 1657. The Jews of Amsterdam obtained ,his body, and interred it at their own expense. He was of the sect of the Pharisees, and possessed lively wit, solid judgment, and great learning, with all the virtues which adorn private life. He wrote many works in Hebrew, Latin, Spanish, and English. The principal of those published in Latin are, 1. His Conciliator, a learned and curious work, in which he endeavours to reconcile those passages of Scripture which seem to contradict each other; 2. De Resurrectione Mortuorum ; 3. De Termino Vitee; â…›. Dissertatio de Fragilitate Humana ex lapsu Adami, deque Divino in bono opere Auxilio; and, 5. Spes Israel. Dr. Thomas Pococke has written his life in English.
