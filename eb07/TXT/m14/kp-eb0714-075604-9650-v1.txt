MEWING, the falling off'or the change of hair, feathers, skin, horns, or other parts of animals. This happens in some annually, in others only at certain stages of their lives; but the generality of animals mew in the spring. An old hart casts his horns sooner than a young one. This commonly takes place in the months of February and March, alter which they begin to button in March or April; and as the sun grows strong, and χ the season of the year puts forth the fruits of the earth, so their antlers grow, and are summed full by the middle of June. It is to be observed, that if a hart be gelded before he has antlers, he will never have any; and if he be gelded after he has antlers, he will never cast his horns; again, if he be gelded when he has a Ýelvet head, it will always remain so, without fraying or burnishing.
