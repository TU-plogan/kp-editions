MARANHAM, or Maranhao, a province of Brazil, in South America. This name, which is common to the province, the capital, the island on which it stands, the river Meary, and the Amazons, is derived from Maraĩion, the appellation which the navigator Pinzon first bestowed on the estuary of the Amazons, upon finding that its waters did not possess the saline properties of the ocean. It lies between 1. 20. and 10. 50. of south latitude, and 45. 10. and 53. 20. of west longitude, being nearly 400 miles in length from north to south, and having an average breadth of about 200 miles. It is bounded on the east by Piauhy, on the west by Para, on the south by Goyaz, and on the north by the Atlantic Ocean. Its bending line of coast extends above 300 miles, and so difficult is the navigation from north to south, both wind and current setting in from the south, that it is easier for Para and Maranham to communicate with Lisbon than with Rio or Bahia. It is very dangerous, and, especially after passing Rio Grande, has a bleak and dismal appearance. Although but thinly peopled in the interior, a considerable portion of territory being still in possession of savage tribes, it has increased in importance with extraordinary rapidity. Until about the middle of the last century, no cotton was sent out of the country; and an attempt was made by the inhabitants to prevent its exportation when the growers were about to make their first shipment. The reason of this was a dread lest there should not be enough for home consumption. The cultivation of rice, when first introduced, was regarded as a foolish innovation; but now these productions constitute almost the only articles of export, for the soil, although rich, is reported to be unfit for the culture of the sugar cane. Annati, capsicum, ginger, and the best fruits of Europe, grow in great abundance throughout the province. Cattle, sheep, and goats, are stated to be more prolific than in Europe, but they degenerate. There is said to be a native silk-worm here, whose cone is thrice the size of the European one, the colour of the silk being a deep yellow. It feeds upon the pinheirα or atta, an indigenous tree, and upon the leaves of the orange. The principal river is the Itapicura, which originates near the southern extremity of the province, and takes first a north-easterly and then a north-westerly course. Its current is rapid, and it flows for the most part through extensive woods. It abounds with a species of eel, which, though small, has great electrical powers.

Maranham, or St Luiz, the capital, is situated on an island of the same name, of about forty-two miles in circumference. It forms the south-east side of the bay of [7:14:241] Marcos, having to the eastward the bay of San Jose, in latitude 2. 32. south, and longitude 43. 40. west. It is fertile and well inhabited, there being, besides the capital, numerous small hamlets belonging to the natives. Much difficulty is experienced in reaching this islańd, on account of the rapidity of three rivers at the mouth of which it is situated. The harbour, which is formed by a narrow creek, is of sufficient depth to admit of merchantmen entering; but it is so beset with shoals as to require a pilot, and its depth is diminishing. It is defended bv several forts, which are not, however, in a very effective condition. The city of Maranham is built upon very unequal ground, commencing from the water’s edge, and extending to the distance of about one mile and a half in a northeasterly direction. It covers a considerable space of ground, the houses being built in a straggling manner; and there are several broad streets and spacious squares. Its situation upon the western part of the island, and upon one side of a creek, almost excludes it from the sea breeze, by which it is rendered less healthy than if it stood in a more exposed position. The streets are mostly paved, but are kept in bad repair. Many of the houses have a neat and genteel appearance, and are of one story in height. The lower part of them is appropriated to servants, to shops without windows, to warehouses, and other purposes. The family occupy the upper story, the windows of which reach down to the floor, and are ornamented with iron balconies. The churches are numerous, and there are likewise Franciscan, Carmelite, and other convents. The insides of the churches are gaudily decorated, but no regular plan of architecture has been followed in their construction. The governor’s palace stands upon rising ground, not far from the water side, with the front towards the town. It is a long uniform stone building, of one story in height. The western end joins the town-hall and prison, which gives them the appearance of being one edifice. There is an oblong piece of ground in front, one end of which is open to the harbour, and to a fort in the hollow close to the water; the other extremity is nearly closed up by the cathedral. This church, which formerly belonged to the Jesuits, is said to be the finest of any in the maritime cities, with the exception of that of Para. The Jesuits’ college is now the episcopal palace, the space opposite to which is occupied by dwelling-houses, and streets loading to other parts of the city. The ground upon which Maranĩiam stands is composed of a soft red stone, so that the smaller streets leading from the town into the country, some of which are not paved, are full of gullies, through which the water runs in rainy seasons. These streets consist of houses having only a ground floor. They have thatched roofs, the windows are destitute of glass, and altogether they have a mean and impoverished appearance. The city contains a ι customhouse and treasury; ' the former is small, but was, until lately, large enough for the business of the place. The air here is serene, the place being seldom incommoded with storms, excessive drought, or moisture, except in the time of the periodical rains, which continue from February till June. With regard to the number of inhabitants, little reliance can be placed upon the testimony of travellers, as by some they are estimated at 12,000, and by others at 30,000, including negroes. These are numerous, the streets being generally crowded with slaves.

The bay of St Marcos is studded with several islands. The width of the bay from Maranham to the opposite shore is between four and five leagues, but its length is considerably greater. Towards the south end it receives the waters of the river Meary, along the banks of which arc several cattle estates. On the opposite side of the island is a smaller bay, called San Jose. These bays are connected by a strait which separates the island from the continent. The Itapicura discharges its waters into San Jose, and the banks of this river are the best cultivated and most fertile lands in the province. The town of Alcantara, which is situated on the continent, to the west of Maranham, contains four hermitages, two convents, a town-hall, and prison; and a fort occupies the site of the Jesuits’ hospicio. The town is built on a semicircular hill, and, when seen from a distance, has a pretty appearance; but this favourable impression is dissipated by a nearer approach. Many of the houses are of one story, and built of stone; but the greater number of dwelling-houses have only a ground floor. Alcantara extends back to some distance in a straggling manner, with gardens and large spaces between the houses. It is a thriving place, and has rapidly increased in importance, from the lands in the neighbourhood being in request for cotton plantations. Not far from the mouth of the port of this town stands an island of about three miles in length by one in breadth, called the Ilha do Livra-mento. It is only inhabited by two persons, who have under their care a chapel dedicated to our Lady of Deliverance; and thither the inhabitants of the neighbouring shores come once a year for the purpose of celebrating, by a festival, this invocation of the Virgin. Cachias, a populous place, of some commercial importance, is situated on the eastern margin of the Itapicura, upwards of 200 miles southeast of Maranham. Great quantities of rice and cotton are raised here; but the inhabitants are addicted to gambling to a ruinous extent. This place forms the central point of communication between Maranham, Piauhy, and Goyaz. Large flat-bottomed boats, fit for navigating in shoal water, ascend the river thus far, and convey the produce downwards. Opposite to Cachias is Trezedellas, inhabited by descendants of the aborigines, where the Jesuits formerly had a seminary, to which the people of Piauhy were in the custom of sending their children to be educated. The river is navigable by canoes ninety miles higher, to the small town of Principe Regente, thirty miles south-southwest of which is St Bento das Balsas, situated amongst small hills adapted for pasture. It is ten miles from the Pannahiba, and twenty-eight from the Itapicura, and the whole of the territory lying between these two rivers has been evacuated by the Indians. All the other towns of the province are inconsiderable. The Meary or Mearim, the next river in size, is navigable to the centre of the province, where the further progress of boats is interrupted by a fall; but its course lies chiefly through the territories of barbarous tribes. The number of farms in Maranham is estimated at 4856, and the number of proprietors at 2683. The average number of slaves imported is 5000, for whom a considerable duty is paid. With regard to exports and imports, there are no returns which can be relied on later than the year 1820. From 1815 to 1820, the average number of bags of cotton exported was 68,000. The exports of rice varied during these years from 56,000 to 82,000 bags. The other articles sent out of the country consisted of hides, tanned and untanned, skins, and gums. The entire population of the province amounted in 1821 to 182,000. Upon the whole, this province might be made one of great importance, for it possesses vast capabilities; but as yet it is in an infant or semi-barbarous state.
