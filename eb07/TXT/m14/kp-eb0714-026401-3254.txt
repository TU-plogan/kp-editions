MARSYAS, in fabulous history, a celebrated musician of Celaenae, in Phrygia, and reputed the son of Olympus, or of Hyagnis, cr Oeagrus. He was so skilful in playing on the flute, that he is generally deemed the inventor of that instrument. According to the opinion of some, he found it after Minerva had thrown it aside on account of the distorsion of her features occasioned by playing upon it.
