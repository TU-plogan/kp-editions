MALWAH, an extensive province of Hindustan, situated principally between the 22d and 23d degrees of N. lat. On the north it is bounded by the provinces of Ajmeer and Agra, on the cast by Allahabad and Gundwaneh, on the south by Khandesh and Berar, and on the west by Ajmeer and Gujerat, being in length about 220 miles, and in average breadth 150. Malwah is a central and mountainous region, but with a regular descent from the Vindhya Mountains, which extend along the north side of the Nerbuddah. From these mountains numerous streams descend in every direction, whence they flow nearly due north until they join the Chumbul, and ultimately the Jumna and Ganges. The principal of these are the Nerbuddah, the Chumbul, Betwa, Sinde, Sopra, and Cane; also the Mahy, which has its source in the Vind-hyan Hills, and flows in the opposite direction from the other rivers, namely, to the south-west, and loses itself in the Gulf of Cambay. The land, notwithstanding its elevation, is extremely fertile, the soil being in general a fine black mould, which produces cotton, opium, sugar, indigo, tobacco, and grain, in large quantities, besides furnishing pasture for numerous herds of cattle. The tobacco, particularly that of the district of Bilsah, is highly esteemed, and carried to all parts of the country. The opium is also much esteemed, and is cultivated to a great extent. Barley is not cultivated, owing to the unfavourable soil; and rice only in a few detached spots, which lie convenient for water. The chief towns are, Oojain, Indore, Bopal, Bilsah, Seronge, Mundessor, Burseah, and Mundoo. The rivers are not navigable; and being an inland province, the commerce is carried on by means of land-carriage. The chief articles of export are cottons, coarse-stained and printed cloths, which are sent in large quantities to Gųjerat, and to Mirzapoor on the Ganges, and thence forwarded to Calcutta; the root of the morinda citrofolia, and opium, which last drug is exported to the adjacent provinces, especially to Gujerat and Cattywar, whence it is smuggled eastward. The province of Malwah was rendered tributary to the Patan sovereigns of Delhi in the thirteenth century. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries it was governed by independent sovereigns of the Patan or Afghan race. Malwah was subdued, and continued to form a province of the Mogul empire until the death of Aurungzebe in 1707, when it was invaded and overrun by the Mahrattas, and separated from the Mogul dominions, about the year 1732. The ancient landholders, however, still retained some forts, which they defended against their invaders, until they conceded to them a portion of the rents of the neighbouring villages. These people are called Grassias; and one of them retained a mud fort within ten miles of Oojain in 1790. There were other petty chiefs, who held hereditary possession of certain parts of the country, and who possessed each one or more strongholds, which were frequently defended with obstinacy against the rulers of the province. In the southern division of Malwah the Bheels or savage tribe are found in considerable numbers, especially amongst the mountains contiguous to the Nerbuddah and Tuptee Rivers. Malwah was the seat of the Pindarrie power, whence they issued in predatory bands to pillage and destroy the country. In 1818, after the war against them had been brought to a successful conclusion, they took refuge in Malwah, their ancient haunt, and still meditated new insurrections. But they were pursued with such activity by the British troops under the orders of Sir John Malcolm, that they were driven to the hills; and being pursued to their fortresses, they were in the end entirely routed and dispersed. The great object of the British in penetrating into these remote parts was to put down entirely the spirit of disorder and rapine by which all ranks appeared to be animated, having been long inured to the most unbounded license; and to restore peace in those regions of Central India, which had long been the scene of anarchy. For this purpose, having subdued the leaders of the Patan mercenaries and the Pindarries, he distributed his troops over the country in such convenient positions as to awe the disturbers of the public peace into submission, and to preclude all attempts at violence by the disorderly bands who were still lingering in the country, and ready for any violence. By a judicious combination of conciliation with firmness, Sir John Malcolm succeeded in restoring order in the distracted country. The result of his arrangements was the expulsion of the disorderly bands by which the public peace was disturbed, the restoration to power and security of the rulers of the different petty states, and the return to their homes of peaceable and industrious classes, who during the reign of terror and anarchy were forced to hide their heads in obscurity. The same talents and statesman-like policy were displayed by Sir John Malcolm in his transactions with the Grassia, Rajpoot, and Bheel freebooters, who were reclaimed from their wild habits, and converted into trustworthy soldiers and industrious cultivators.
