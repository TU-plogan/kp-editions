MANDOW, a city and capital of a district of the same name, in the province of Malwah, situated among the Vindhaya Mountains, between the twenty-second and twenty-third degrees of north latitude. The city was formerly the capital of an Afghan dynasty, the princes of which were the sovereigns of Malwah during a part of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It is described as having been of prodigious extent, that is, about twenty-two miles in circumference, with its suburbs and gardens. ‘The fortress is situated on the summit of a mountain, and formerly contained many handsome monuments and mosques. A minaret eight stories in height was particularly noted. In 1615, when it was visited by Sir Thomas Roe, it had greatly decayed from its former grandeur. The works are much dilapidated, and the town is in ruins. It is forty-seven miles south-south-west from Oojain. The district is bounded by the Nerbuddah on the south, which is the principal and only river; the face of the country being generally mountainous, with intervening valleys of great fertility. Its chief towns are Munda, Bajulpoor, and Dectan.
