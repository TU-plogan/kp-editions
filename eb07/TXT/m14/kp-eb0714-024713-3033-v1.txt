MARINO, St, an independent state of Italy, the smallest of all the sovereignties of Europe, and almost the only one which has maintained its independence and its territory during a period of 1300 years. It is said to have been founded by Marino, a hermit, who chose it for his retreat from the world, and assembled around him a great number of devotees, to whom a pious matron presented a hill and a small circle round it, to which the name of the Anchorite was given. The republic extends over twenty-five square miles, or 16,000 English acres, and, besides the city, comprehends the four villages of Acquaria, Faetano, Feglio, and Serravalle. The city is on the top of a hill, is surrounded by a wall, and is only accessible by a single narrow road. It contains five churches, three convents, and 5500 inhabitants. The government is administered by twelve members chosen out of the assembly of 300 ancients, one of whom is called the capitano, who is changed every three months. The only occupation is agriculture. The population of the state is only 7200. It is under the protection of the pope, and is surrounded by his delegations of Urbino and Pesaro.
