METRE, in Poetry, a system of feet of a just length. The different metres in poetry are the different modes of ordering and combining the quantities, or the long and short syllables. Thus hexameter, pentameter, iambic, and sapphic verses, consist of different metres or measures. In English verses, the metres are extremely various and arbitrary.
