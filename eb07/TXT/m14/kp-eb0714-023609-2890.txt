MANUAL, a word signifying any thing that is performed by the hand.

Manual (manualii), in Law, signifies what is employed or used by the hand, and of which a present profit may be made. Thus, a thing in the manual occupation of any one, means that it is actually used or employed by him.

Manual is the name of a service-book used in the church of Rome, containing the rites, directions to the priests, and [7:14:237]prayers used in the administration of baptism and other sacraments, the form of blessing holy water, and the whole service used in processions.
