MARIA’S Island lies off the east coast of Van Diemen’s Land, in the Great Southern Ocean. Its form is very singular, being penetrated by two deep bays on opposite sides’: that on the east side, called Oyster Bay, being safe and capacious. The coast in some parts is of a singular structure, presenting lofty granitic walls rising 300 or 400 feet perpendicularly above the sea, and being penetrated by deep caverns, into which the sea rolls with a noise resembling distant thunder. The western shore is embarrassed by an immense quantity of sea-weed, which grows from the bottom to the height of 250 or 300 feet, and covers the surface. Seals abound on the shore; and also zoophytes. This island was first discovered by Tasman in 1642. Long, 143. 29. E. Lat. 42. 42. S.
