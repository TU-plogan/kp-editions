MAHIE, the name given by the inhabitants of Ota-heitê to their bread-fruit when made into a kind of sour paste, which, in consequence of undergoing a fermentation, is found to keep a considerable time, and supplies them with food when no ripe fruit is to be had. When, therefore, they see a great show of new fruit on the trees, they strip them all at once of their former crop, out of which they make mahie. This substitute for ripe bread-fruit is prepared as follows. They gather the fruit before it becomes perfectly ripe, and laying it in heaps, cover it closely with leaves. In this state it ferments, and becomes disagreeably sweet; the core is then taken out entire, and the rest of the fruit thrown into a hole in their houses, dug on purpose, and neatly lined in the bottom and sides with grass. The whole is then covered with leaves, and heavy stones are laid upon it. In this state it undergoes a second fermentation, and becomes sour, after which it experiences no change for many months. It is taken out of this hole as it is wanted for use, and being made into balls, it is wrapped up in leaves and baked, and, thus dressed, it will keep for five or six weeks. It is eaten both cold and hot, and the natives ot those countries seldom make a meal without it; but to Captain Cook and his company the taste was as disagreeable as that of a pickled olive generally is the first time it is eaten.
