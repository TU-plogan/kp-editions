JUNIUS, Adrian, one of the most learned men of the age in which he lived, was born at Hoorn, in Holland, in the year 1511. He travelled into all parts of Europe, and practised physic with reputation in England, where, amongst other works, he composed a Greek and Latin lexico, to which he added considerably above six thousand words; an Epithalamium on the marriage of Queen Mary with King Philip of Spain and Animadversa et de Como Commentarius, which is the most applauded of all his works. He died in 1575.

Junius, Francis, professor of divinity at Leyden, was born at Bourges in 1545, and studied some time at Lyons. Bartholomew Aneau, who was principal of the college in that city, gave him excellent instructions as to the right method of prosecuting his studies. He was employed in public affairs by Henry IV., and at last invited to Leyden to be professor of divinity; an employment which he discharged with honour, till he was snatched away by the plague in 1602. Du Pin says he was a learned and judicious critic. He wrote, in conjunction with Emmanuel l’remellius, a Latin version of the Hebrew text of the Bible; and he also published Commentaries on the greater part of the Holy Scriptures, besides many other works, all in Latin.

Junius, Francis, or Francis du Jon, the son of the preceding, was born at Heidelberg in 1589. He at first designed to devote himself to a military life; but after the truce concluded in 1609, he applied himself entirely to study. He came to England in 1620, and lived thirty years in the Earl of Arundel’s family. He was greatly esteemed, not only for his profound erudition, but also for the purity of his manners; and he was so passionately fond of the study of the northern languages, that being informed there were some villages in Friesland where the ancient language of the Saxons was preserved, he went and lived two years in that country. He returned to England in 1675; and, after spending a year at Oxford, retired to Windsor, in order to visit Vossius, at whose house he died in the year 1677. The university of Oxford, to which he bequeathed his manuscripts, erected a very handsome monument to his memory. He wrote, 1. JDe Pictura Veterum, which is admired by the learned, the best edition being that of Rotterdam in 1694; 2. An Explication of the old Gothic manuscript called the Silver Manuscript, because the four gospels are there written in silver Gothic letters, published with notes by Thomas Mareschal or Marshal; 3. A large commentary on the Harmony of the four Gospels by Tatian, which is still in manuscript; 4. A Glossary in five languages, in which he explains the origin of the northern languages, published at Oxford in 1745, in folio.
