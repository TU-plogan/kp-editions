JACOB, the son of Isaac and Rebekah, was born in the year of the world 2168, and before Jesus Christ 1836. The history of this patriarch is given at large in the book of Genesis. He died in Egypt in the 147th year of his age. Joseph directed that the body should be embalmed, after the manner of the Egyptians; and there was a general mourning for him throughout Egypt for seventy days. After this, Joseph and his brethren, accompanied by the principal men of Egypt, carried him, with the king of Egypt’s permission, to the burying-place of his fathers, near Hebron, where his wife Leah had been interred. When they had reached the land of Canaan, they mourned for him again seven days; upon which occasion the place where they staid was called Abelmisraim, or the mourning of the Egyptians.

Jacob, Ben Hajim, a rabbi famous for the collection of the Masorah in 1525, together with the text of the Bible, the Chaldaic paraphrase, and the Rabbinical commentaries.

Jacob, Ben Naphtali, a famous rabbi of the fifth century. He was one of the principal masorets, and bred at the school of Tiberias in Palestine, with Ben Aser, another masoret. The invention of points in Hebrew to serve for vowels, and of accents to facilitate the reading of the language, are ascribed by some to these two rabbin∖ and said to be introduced in an assembly of the Jews held at Tiberias, a. d. 476.
