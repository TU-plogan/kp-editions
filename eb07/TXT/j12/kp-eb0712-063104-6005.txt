JUNGEYPOOR, a town of Bengal, district of Ran- ⅛shy,∙ situated on the eastern bank of the Bhagerutty River. It is the principal silk station of the East India Company. This establishment was erected in 1773, and in 1803 about 3000 persons were employed. The method employed in spinning the silk is the same as that employed in Italy, which was introduced as early as in 1762, by some natives of Italy sent over for that purpose by the Company. The worms are bred all over the country, under the care of women and children. The soil is favourable to the growth of the mulberry. The inhabitants are obliged to sell the choice cocoons to the Company’s agent. The employment has no deleterious effects, although the smell is excessively disagreeable. It is seventeen miles north by west from Moorshedabad. Long. 88. 13. E. Lat. 24. 28. N.
