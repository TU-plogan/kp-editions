JOUDPOOR, an extensive rajpoot principality of Hindustan, in the province of Ajraeer, of which the proper and ancient name was Marwar, and its sovereign was called the Rhatore rajah. The boundaries of this territory are not very exactly defined, being intermixed with that of Odeypoor and Jyepoor. They are said, however, to reach nearly to the Indus on the west, the town of Amer-kote in Sinde, within thirty miles of that river, being in possession of the rajah; on the east his territories comprehend the city of Meerta or Mcerat; on the north they are bounded by Bicanere and Jesselmere; on the south by the province of Gujerat and Odeypoor; and on the east by the dominions of Jyenagur. The southern and eastern parts of Joudpoor are fertile, being watered by streams that flow from the mountains. They are chiefly cultivated by Jauts, and they produce wheat, barley, and other kinds of grain common in India; also cotton, sugar, &c. The western portion of the country consists principally of desert or pasture lands, on which is bred a hardy race of horses, camels, and cattle. There are also lead mines in the country. The imports consist of cloth, shawls, spices, opium, rice, sugar, steel, and iron. The exports are salt, camels, bullocks, and horses. The principal inhabitants of Joudpoor are Rhatore rajpoots, who are a brave, handsome race of men, of the purest castes. The rajahs of Odeypoor, Jyepoor, and Joudpoor formerly enjoyed considerable power and consequence, and their alliance was much sought after by the Mogul emperors of Hindustan. The country is described as having been much more populous in ancient times.

The rajahs of Jyepoor and Joudpoor were employed with their followers in the imperial armies, and attained the highest military rank till the time of Aurungzebe, who attempted to enforce the capitation tax on his Hindu subjects, and sought to obtain possession of the children of the rajah Jerwont Sing, who died in the year 1678; a circumstance that gave rise to a war, in which the rajpoots were ultimately victorious, and, after the death of Aurungzebe, they only paid a nominal allegiance. Being afterwards weakened by dissensions amongst themselves, they became tributary to the Mahrattas, and were only delivered from their yoke by the British in their successful war against the Pindaries.

Joudpoor, a fortified city, and capital of the above principality, is well built, mostly of stone. It is situated on a hill; and carries on a considerable traffic, by means of caravans, with Gujerat and the Deccan. The rajah is now one of the British allies. Long. 73. 18. E. Lat. 26. 27. N.
