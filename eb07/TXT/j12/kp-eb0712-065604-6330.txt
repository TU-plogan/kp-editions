JUSTINUS, a Latin historian, whose name appears in some manuscripts as Μ. Junianus Justinus, and in others, Justinus Frontinus. We are unable to fix with precision the period during which he flourished, though some have placed him in the reign of Antoninus, A. d. 160, from the name of that emperor being found in the dedication according to some manuscripts, though it is doubted whether this dedication be genuine. Of his private history we know nothing. Justin abridged the history of Trcgus Pompeius, who wrote in the reign of Augustus. Its title runs thus: Historiarum Philippicarum, et totius mundi originum et terree situs ex Trogo Pompeio excerptarum, libri xliv aNinoad Cessarem Augustum. The first six books may be considered as an introduction to the history of Macedonia, which is found in books vii. viii. ix. xi.—xvii. xxiv.—xxvi. xxviii.—xxx∙ xxxiii. Justin tells ns that he omitted every thing which he considered as either unnecessary or likely to be displeasing to the reader, and in this way he has passed over all the geograpical information of Trogus. He is particularly deficient in chronological arrangement, though his style is in general simple and correct. The Prologi which are [7:12:657]found attached to each book were not written by Justin, but by some old grammarian. Editio princeps, Venet. 1470, per Jenson, and Rome, 1470, 1471. It has often been published along with Florus: Mediol. 1476; ed. Bongar - sius, Par. 1581; ed. Lemaire, Par. 1823; e recen. Gron. et cum var. not. ed. Frotscher, Lips. 1827, 3 vols.
