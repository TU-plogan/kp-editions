JOHNSTONE, Robert, is a Scotish historian of considerable reputation, but his personal history is very imperfectly known. We are however informed that he was the son of an honest burgess of Edinburgh, and that he was educated in the university of his native city.^[1. Crawford’s History of the University of Edinburgh, p. 140. ] He took the degree of A. Μ. in the year 1587. His father may perhaps have been a native of Annandale, where Johnstone is still a prevalent name. The son bequeathed legacies to some of his cousins in Annandale, L.500 sterling in trust to Lord Johnstone for building a bridge over the river Annan, and L.1000 in trust to the same nobleman for the maintenance of a grammar school at Moffat. Whether he prosecuted his studies in some foreign university, and there took his degree of LL. D., we are not informed. He appears to have fixed his residence in London, and to have inherited or acquired a considerable fortune. Dempster, to whom we are indebted for many scattered notices of Scotish writers, has stated that he was particularly esteemed by Lord Bruce of Kinloss, and, although not a courtier, that he was acceptable to King James.^[2. “Robertus Johnstonus, Baroni Killosensi dum vivebat carus, vir variae lectionis, rarae eruditionis, scripsit Historiam sui Secuh Latine, lib. i. et tersissimam, ut est limati judicii. Vivit adhuc Londini virtutis merito, licet non aulicus, regi acceptus.” (Demp-Bteri Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum, p. 394.) ] His testament, extracted from the register of the prerogative court of Canterbury, has lately been printed, and reflects some additional light upon his history.^[3. Constable’s Memoirs of George Heriot, p. 163. Edinb. 1822, 8vo. ] He there describes himself as “Robert Johnstone, of the parish of St Anne, Blackffy-ers, London, Esquire.” The codicil is dated on the 12th of October 1639, and probate was granted to one of his executors six days afterwards; so that the testator must have died in that interval. The greatest part of his property he bequeathed to charitable and benevolent purposes. It is however to be suspected that his laudable intentions were in some cases frustrated: the bridge was never built over the Annan, nor did Moffat school derive much benefit from his legacy. He had been appointed one of the executors of George Heriot; and he bequeathed L.1100 to the hospital. He bequeathed L.1000 “towards the maintenance of eight poor scholars” in the university of Edinburgh. The destination of his library is thus expressed: “As for my books, l’do appoint the books of humanity, Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, and Lexico Graecum, to be sent unto Moffat in Annandale, when the aforesaid school is ereckted, with the Latin poets and commentaries: as for the Italian, French, and Spanish books, 1 would have them changed for books of philosophy, to be sent unto the College of Edinburgh: for my civil law books, and books of [7:12:604]history, I give also to the said College of Edinburgh; and my English books I give unto my said servant Hendry Heron.”

Dr Johnstone had prepared a history of his own time; and the earliest part of it, consisting of two books, appeared under the title of “Historiarum libri duo, continentes Rerum Britannicarum vicinarumque Regionum Historias maxime memorabiles. Sunt praeter hos adhuc xx. libri, qui typographe nondum in manus venere.” Amst. 1642, 12mo. It contains the author’s dedication to King Charles, and the subsequent epigram, “Ad Robertum Johnstonum Scoto-Britannum,” written by John Owen:

Ingenii, Johnstone, tui sum factus amator, Ilistoriae legerem dum monumenta tuae.

Nil magis ingenuum, nihil ingeniosius extat Tergeminae Britonum gentis in historia:

Excipias unum Morum de rege Ricardo, Nemo Britannorum dignior invidia.

Such portions of the volume as relate to Scotish history were soon afterwards translated into English: “The Historie of Scotland during the Minority of King Iames: written in Latine by Robert Johnston: done into English by T. Μ.”^[4. This translation occurs in a volume entitled Scotia Rediviva, a Collection of Tracts illustrative of the History and Antiquities of Scotland, p. 361. Edinb. 1826, 8vo. ] Lond. 1646, 12mo. This translator was perhaps Thomas Middleton, author of the Appendix to Spotswood’s History. The identity of the historian and of the individual who died in 1639, is established by the testimony of the translator, who mentions his author’s bequest to the university of Edinburgh. He has however magnified the eight exhibitions into eight fellowships. The entire history at length made its appearance in an ample volume: “Historia Rerum Britannicarum, ut et multarum Galli carum, Belgicarum, et Germanicarum, tam politicarum quam ecclesiasticarum, ab anno 1572 ad annum 1628.” Amst. 1655, fol. The editor, under the signature of J. S. has prefixed a very brief notice, which contains an erroneous statement of the author having himself published the first two books. Buchanan’s history, according to the opinion of Nicoson, has been “continu’d in the same fine language” by Johnstone;^[5. Nicoson’s Scottish Historical Library, p 121. ] and Lord Woodhouselee describes this continuation as “a work of great merit, whether we consider the judicious structure of the narrative, the sagacity of the reflections, the acute discernment of characters, or the classical tincture of the style. In those passages of his history where there is room for a display of eloquence, he is often singularly happy in touching those characteristic circumstances which present the picture strongly to the mind of the reader, without a vain parade of tvords, or artificial refinement of sentiment.”^[6. Woodhouselee’s Memoirs of Lord Kames, vol. i. app. p. 3. ] Of this high commendation we are however disposed to make some abatement, both as to the matter and style of Johnstone’s history. (x.)

Johnstone, a modern and thriving village of Scotland, in the county of Renfrew, at the distance of about three miles west from Paisley. It owes its origin entirely to manufactures, as about forty years ago only a few cottages stood where now is seen a town consisting of two large squares, many considerable streets, and public works. It is regularly laid out, there being one main street, which is crossed by others at right angles. The houses are substantially built, and for the most part two stories high. There are within the precincts of the place seventeen cotton mills of various extent, and other three in the neighbourhood. There are also in the town two brass and two extensive iron founderies; five machine manufactories, and a public gas-work. Besides a chapel of ease belonging to the Scotch church, there is here a United Secession and Relief church, a Universalist, and Methodist chapel. In Johnstone are also a town school, a subscription library, two news-rooms, a mechanics’ institution and library, and sundry benevolent and religious societies. The Ardrossan Canal from Glasgow terminates in a basin at the east end of the town. In its neighbourhood are four collieries, which are of great advantage to a place to which coal is of essential importance. The population in 1811 amounted to 3647, and in 1818 to 5000.
