JOORIA, a populous and thriving sea-port of Hindustan, in the Gujerat peninsula, belonging to the rajah of Amram. It is situated on the Gulf of Cutch, twenty miles below Wowamia, and carries on a considerable traffic with Mandavee and other places in the Gulf of Cutch, and on the western coasts of India, Persia, and Arabia, and occasionally with Bombay. Its exports consist chiefly of cotton, ghee, oil, and hides, to the southward, and coarse cloth for Persia and Arabia. In return it receives spices of all sorts, powder, lead, and cocoa-nuts. In 1808, the rajah and principal inhabitants agreed with the Bombay government not to permit or connive at piracy; and also to abstain from plundering persons in distress. Long. 70. 40. E. Lat. 22. 40. N.
