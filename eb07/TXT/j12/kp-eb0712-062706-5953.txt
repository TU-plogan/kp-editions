JUGURTHA, king of Numidia, was son of Mastanabal and a concubine; he was also grandson of Masinissa. The principal events of his life are included between 134 and 106 b. c. He was educated, along with his cousins Adherbal and Hiempsal, the sons of his uncle Micipsa, and began at an early period to exhibit such strong symptoms of ambition, that Micipsa felt much uneasiness respecting the succession of his sons to the throne. With a view, therefore, of getting rid of Jugurtha, when the Romans sent for auxiliaries in their war against Numantia, B. c. 134, Jugurtha was despatched at the head of a body of troops, and it was hoped that he might fall in some engagement with the enemy. The event did not correspond with his expectation; for he returned to Micipsa with letters from Scipio, who commanded the Roman troops, full of the most flattering expressions. When Micipsa found his end approaching, he saw it necessary to change his policy in respect to Jugurtha; and, hoping that gratitude might prevent him from gratifying his ambitious views, he named him joint heir with his two sons Adherbal and Hiempsal. But the third part of the kingdom did not satisfy Jugurtha, who began immediately to take measures for getting rid of his cousins. Hiempsal was murdered, and Adherbal only saved his life by a timely flight, B. c. 112. The fugitive prince had recourse to Rome, where the venality of the nobility had become proverbial, and made application to the senate. The bribes of Jugurtha prevented an adverse decision, and commissioners were appointed to divide the kingdom equally between the two princes. The most fertile and populous part of Numidia was given to Jugurtha, who, finding all his schemes succeed, began without delay to make war on his cousin. Having shut him up in the town of Cirta, Jugurtha induced him to surrender upon promise of his life, but, in contempt of all the laws of honour, put him to death. This atrocious proceeding roused the indignation of the people of Rome, and the senate could no longer withstand the popular feeling. War was declared, and carried on with vigour (b. c. 111), till the Numidian prince succeeded in bribing the generals sent against him. Peace was at last granted to him upon very advantageous conditions, and he had even the boldness to come to Rome, where he caused Massiva to be murdered, whose claims to his kingdom began to give him uneasiness. Nothing could now save him from the indignation of Rome, and he was ordered immediately to quit Italy. It was on leaving Rome that he is said to have frequently looked back on it, and to have exclaimed, “Urbs venalis et mature peritura si emptorem inveniet.” The war began b. c. 110, but with little success to the Romans. Jugurtha defeated Aulus, who had been sent against him, and made his troops pass under the yoke. Metellus was next despatched to Africa, who, not allowing himself to be gained either by the promises or bribes of Jugurtha, soon reduced him to great difficulties. He took many of his chief cities, b. c. 109, and compelled Jugurtha to apply for assistance to the Gaetulians and Moors. Marius followed up the war with still greater vigour, till Jugurtha was obliged at last to fly to Bocchus, who delivered him up to Sylla, then quaestor of Marius, b. c. 106. He was carried to Rome, where he was led in triumph [7:12:628]by Marius, and afterwards perished in prison. His life has been written by Sallust, and some facts may be found in Plutarch’s Life of Marius (c. 3), and Sylla (c. 10), and Diodorus Siculus, Fragm. tom. x. p. 141.
