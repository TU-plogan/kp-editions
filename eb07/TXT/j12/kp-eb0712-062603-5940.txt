JUDICIUM Calumniae was an action brought against the plaintiff for false accusation. The punishment, upon conviction, was inustio frontis, or branding in the forehead.

Judicium Pei, Judgment of God, was a term anciently applied to all extraordinary trials of secret crimes, as those by arms and single combat, and the ordeals, or those by fire or red-hot ploughshares, by plunging the arm in boiling water, or the whole body in cold water, in hopes that God would work a miracle rather than suffe,r truth and innocence to perish. These customs were a long time kept up even amongst Christians; and they are still in use amongst some nations. Trials of this sort were usually held in churches in presence of the bishops, priests, and secular judges, after three days’ fasting, confession, and communion, with many adjurations and ceremonies, which are described at large by Ûu Cange.

Judicium Pa ∣ ium denotes a trial by a man’s equals, that is, of peers by peers, and of commoners by commons. In Magna Charta it is more than once insisted on as the principal bulwark of our liberties, that no freeman shall be hurt either in his person or in property, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum velper legem terroe. And this was esteemed in all countries a privilege of the highest and most beneficial nature.

Judicium l’alsi was an action which lay against the judges for corruption or unjust proceedings.

Judicium Praevaricationis was an action brought against the prosecutor, after the criminal was acquitted, for suppressing the evidence of, or extenuating, Ins guilt, rather than urging it home, and bringing it to light.
