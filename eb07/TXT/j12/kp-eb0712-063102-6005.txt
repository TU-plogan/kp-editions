JUNE, the sixth month of the year, during which the sun enters the sign of Cancer. The word comes from the Latin Junius, which some derive a Junone ; and hence Ovid, in the sixth of his Fasti, makes the goddess say,

Junius a nostro nomine nomen habet.

Others rather derive it a junioribus, this being for young people what the month of May was for old ones. In this month is the summer solstice.
