JESTING, or concise wit, as distinguished from continued wit or humour, lies either in the thought or the language, or both. In the first case it does not depend upon any particular words or turn of the expression. But the greatest fund of jests lies in the language, that is, in tropes or verbal figures; those afforded by tropes consist in the metaphorical sense of the words, and those of verbal figures principally turn upon a double sense of the same word, or a similitude of sound in different words. The third kind of jokes, which lie both in the sense and language, arise from figures of sentences, where the figure itself consists in the sense, but the wit turns upon the choice of the words.
