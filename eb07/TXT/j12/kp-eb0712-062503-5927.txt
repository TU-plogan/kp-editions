JUDE, St, brother of St James the younger, and son of Joseph (Mat. xiii. 55). He preached in Mesopotamia, Arabia, Syria, Idumea, and died in Berytus for the profession of the faith of Christ. He wrote the epistle which goes under his name, and which was composed after the death of most of the apostles. He was cruelly put to death for reproving the superstition of the Magi.

Jude, or the General Epistle of Jude, a canonical book of the New Testament, written against the heretics, who, by their disorderly lives and impious doctrines, corrupted the faith and morals of the Christians. St Jude draws them in lively colours, as men given up to their passions, full of vanity, and conducting themselves by worldly wisdom, and not by the spirit of God.
