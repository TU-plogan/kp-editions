JERSEY, one ot a group of islands, forming part of the ancient duchy of Normandy, but now considered as a portion of the county of Hampshire in England, for some few legal purposes. It is about six leagues from the French, and twenty-three from the English coast. It is nearly twelve miles in length from east to west, and in no part more than seven miles in breadth. The square extent is sixty-three miles, or about 40,000 English acres. The shore is indented with numerous bays; but they are very difficult of access, from the rapidity of the tide, which, among the rocks that surround the island, causes eddies of great but variable velocity. The island is protected by appropriate fortifications, and in time of war is commonly provided with a sufficient military force, besides a well-disciplined militia, to defend it from sudden attacks. The face of the island is rather hilly, with rich, well-watered valleys between the respective ranges; the slope is towards the south; and, though the tops of the hills are almost barren, yet the soil in the lower parts is a rich and wdl-cultivatcd alluvium. The climate is mild and uniform, frosts being rare in winter, and the air being tempered by the sea-breezes in the summer. Though fertile, the island does not grow sufficient corn for the sustenance of the dense population; but it yields a surplus of fruit, of cider, and of potatoes; and, besides, sends yearly to England some hundreds of the peculiar race of cows which, like those of Guernsey and Alderney, are esteemed for the great quantity rather than the good quality of the milk which they yield. The chief trade of the island is the Newfoundland fishery, for which several ships are equipped and annually despatched. Formerly a great contraband trade was carried on; and in time of war the business of privateering was extensively followed. The island is governed by a local legislature and a distinct judicature, under the ultimate control of the king in council. The ancient Norman laws are still in force, and the greater part of the inhabitants retain, and among themselves use, the language of the country from which they originated. The church of England is the established religion, and is under the ecclesiastical direction of the Bishop of Winchester. There are several of the other protestant sects, who support their own religious institutions. Though easily defended as long as England has a superior naval force to succour it, Jersey has always been deemed a. desirable possession by France. Several attacks have been projected, and one actually made in 1781, which was at first successful, but ultimately repelled by a body of troops under the brave Major Pierson, who was unfortunately killed in the action. In an attempt two years before, the French were intercepted by an English squadron, and destroyed before they could land any troops. The chief town is St Hilliers; another town, St Aubins, is smaller; both the harbours are dry at low water. The population amounts to upwards of 29,000, being the most dense of any' in the British dominions·.
