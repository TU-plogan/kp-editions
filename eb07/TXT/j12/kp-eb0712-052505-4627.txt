JARDYN, or Jardin, Karel du, a painter of conversations, landscapes, and such like subjects, was born at Amsterdam in 1640, and became a disciple of Nicholas Berchem. This painter, in colouring and touch, resembled his master Berchem; but he added to that manner a force which distinguishes the great masters of Italy; and it is observed, that most of his pictures seem to express the warmth of the sun, and the light of mid day. However, some of his subjects are often more extensive, containing a greater number of objects, and a larger design. His works are as much sought after as they are difficult to be met with. He died at the age of thirty-eight.
