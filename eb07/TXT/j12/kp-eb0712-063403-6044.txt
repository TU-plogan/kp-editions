JURIN, James, born in 1684, a distinguished person, who cultivated medicine and the mathematics with equal success. He was secretary to the Royal Society of London, as well as president of the College of Physicians there. He had serious disputes with Micbelotti upon-the momentum of running waters, with Robins upon distinct vision, and with the partisans of Leibnitz upon moving bodies or living forces. A treatise of his upon Vision is printed in Smith’s Optics. He died in 1750. Jurin was a warm partisan and an active defender of the practice of inoculation, and, in several publications, established its utility by a comparison of the respective degrees of mortality occasioned by the casual and the inoculated smallpox. He was also editor of Varenius’s Geography, published at the request of Newton and Bentley; and in the Works of the Learned for 1737, he carried on a controversy with Dr Pemberton in defence of Newton.
