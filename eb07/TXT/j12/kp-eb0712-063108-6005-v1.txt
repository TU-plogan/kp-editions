JUNKSEYLON, a considerable island on the western coast of the Malay peninsula, and situated at the southeast extremity of the Bay of Bengal. It is divided from the continent by a narrow isthmus of sand about a mile in length and half a mile in breadth, which is covered only at high water, the tide rising in the springs about ten feet. The island is about forty miies in length by fifteen in breadth, and has several small islands near it from one to six miles in cireumferenee. There is another island sixteen miles east, named Pulo Pinjang, or Long Island, being twenty-three miles in length by eight in breadth, and divided from the main by a strait having two fathoms of water in the narrowest part. On the north side of the island is an excellent harbour, called Popra, which may be entered over a mud bar, during the springtides, by ships drawing twenty feet water. The anchorage round the island is generally good, with a mud bottom. A considerable trade was formerly carried on here, previously to the establishment of Prince of Wales’ Island, in the Buggess prows, who resorted to Jnnkseylori in great numbers, and brought various mixed cargoes to sell for tin. It is still occasionally visited by country ships from Calcutta in their voyage eastward, which import coarse cutlery, China-ware, iron in bars, looking-glasses, opium, pieee-goods, steel in faggots, tobacco, woollens, &c. From Prince of Wales’ Island also are imported opium and piece-goods, and in return tin, edible bird-nests, which are found on the rocky eoasts of the island, biehe-de-mer, and elephants’ teeth, are received. This island is noted for the production of tin, whieh is raised by the natives, and smelted by a Chinese, who farms the privilege from government. In 1782, when it was visited by numerous native traders, the mines yielded an average of 500 tons per annum. All kinds of coin are current, but the preference is given to Spanish dollars. Certain pieces of tin also circulate, whieh are shaped like the under half of a eone, and weigh about three pounds. But as the population, owing to the unsettled.

state of the country, has since decreased to about G000 inhabitants, and the Siamese have mines closer to their capital, a very small supply is now derived from the island, not exceeding 46,600 pounds a year. The miners dig pits of from twelve to twenty feet deep; but seldom venture on a lateral shaft; and the ore is generally found in round or oblong masses, with well-defined crystals, and in quartz, or embedded in masses of halt-decomposed granite.

Junkscylon enjoys a good climate. The heats are never violent. The rains begin in July, and continue, to November, with frequent intermissions; after which fine weather succeeds, accompanied by cold north-easterly winds at night. There are no horses on the island, bullocks and buffaloes being here used for labour. Persons of consequence travel on elephants, which are brought from Mergui. The island breeds wild hogs and deer, a few tame goats, and poultry; but no sheep, domestic dogs, nor cats.
