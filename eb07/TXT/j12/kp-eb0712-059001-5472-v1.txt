JOHN’S Island, an island on the southern coastof Carolina, a little to the south -west of Charleston harbour. It is thirty miles in circumference, and is divided from James’ Island by Stono River, which forms a convenient and safe harbour. Long. 80. 10. W. Lat. 32. 42. N.

John’s, St, the capital of the island of Newfoundland. See Newfoundland. John’s, St, or Prince Edward Island, a fine island, situated in the Gulf of St Lawrence, within the longitudes of 62° and 65° W., and the latitudes of 46° and 47° 10' N. It is 140 miles in length, and its greatest breadth is thirty-four miles. From Nova Scotia it is separated by Northumberland Strait, which is nine miles broad between Cape Traverse and Cape Tormcntine. Cape Breton lies within twenty-seven miles of the east point; and Cape Ray, the nearest part of Newfoundland, is one hundred and twenty miles distant.

This island was discovered by Cabot on the 24th of June 1497, being∣ St John’s day, and hence derived its name. The English, however, neglected to avail themselves of this right of possession; and the French, who appear at first to have entertained more correct views of its importance, took possession of it, when they made the conquest of Canada, apparently without any remonstrance on the paιt of Britain. For a period of two hundred and thirty-five years it continued attached to the crown of France; and although it cannot be said to have advanced in prosperity with an average degree of celerity, considering the value at which such a possession ought to have been rated, yet the ιesouιces of the island had not been overlooked, and would probably have been called into activity, had it not been surrendered to Great Britain in 1758. At that time the population in the various settlements appears not to have amounted to more than 6000. At the peace of 1763 this colony and Cape Breton were annexed to the government of Nova Scotia; and a plan of settlement was agreed to, by which the island was divided into sixty-seven townships, of about 20,000 acres each, granted to individuals ho were considered as having claims on the government, and who were to pay a small sum as quit-rent. A reservation was set apart for his majesty, and also for the purposes of religion and education; and the grantees were bound to settle each township within a stipulated period, by a given number of individuals. The plan, however, was unsuccessful, and many of the proprietors disposed of their lands to others who had either not the will or not the power to proceed with the colonization of the island, according to the principle originally fixed upon. In 1768, St John’s was erected into a separate government from that of Nova Scotia, at the request of a majority of the proprietors; and a governor was appointed, who set vigorously about settling the island in a proper manner, and who did more in this respect than any other proprietor at that time. The colony obtained a complete constitution in 1773, when the first house of assembly met. During the American war, it continued true to the interests of the mother country, and was resorted to by ships of war, as well as converted into a military station. About the year 1790, two provincial corps were raised for the protection of the island, and three troops of volunteer cavalry were likewise formed. As a mark of respect for the Duke of Kent, commander of the British army in America in 1799, the island was then named Prince Edward Island; a very uncalled-for change from St John’s, its most appropriate designation. Since that period no event has occurred of such moment as to require particular mention here.

This island, without being mountainous, or possessed of romantic scenery, is agreeably diversified by hill and dale; but the level is, in general, never so far deviated from as to interfere with the purposes of agriculture. There are no mountains, properly so called; but a chain of hills intersects the island breadthwise, about its middle. It abounds with streams, and springs of the purest water; and numerous arms of the sea penetrate so far inland that no part of the country is more than eight miles removed from the flux and reflux of the tide. When first seen, it presents the aspect of a flat country, covered with trees to the margin of the ocean; but, on a nearer approach, the more inviting prospect discloses itself, of villages and farms situated in valleys or on green and gentle declivities, with the other smiling features which result from agricultural industry or spontaneous fertility. Almost every part presents beautiful landscape views, especially in summer and autumn, when the forests exhibit an exuberance of rich and splendid foliage. Unlike Cape Breton, Newfoundland, and other contiguous islands, St John’s is very rarely visited by fogs; and although the winter be equally severe, the transitions from one extreme to another are less violent. The season of cold is likewise less protracted than it is in Lower Canada, whilst the frost is not so intense, nor the snows so deep. Altogether the climate is very salubrious, and there are few countries where health is enjoyed with less interruption.

The soil consists of a thin layer of black or brown mould, composed of decayed vegetables, superimposed uponŉ light loam, occasionally of a sandy, and at other times of a clayey character. This extends about one foot downwards, and then a stiff clay, resting upon sand-stone, predominates. The latter rock is the base of the island, and it appears to extend under the bed of Northumberland Strait, into the contiguous islands, and also into the continent. A solitary block of granite occasionally presents itself; but neither limestone, gypsum, nor coal, have been discovered, although their presence was to have been expected from the occurrence of the sandstone formation. Iron has not yet been found, although the soil and the springs are impregnated with it. Red clay, of a superior quality, for bricks, abounds in all parts; and white clay, for potters’ use, is found in limited quantities. The soil is fertile, and its quality can be readily ascertained by the nature of the [7:12:591] wood which grows upon it; the richest being that where the maple, beech, black birch, and a mixture of other trees, grow; and the less fertile being that where the varieties of the fir tribe are most abundant. There are some unproductive bogs, swamps, and other tracts called barrens; but they bear but a small proportion to the whole surface of the island, and may, by judicious management, be brought under cultivation. The marshes, which are overflowed by the tide, rear a strong, nutritious grass, and, when dyked, yield heavy crops of wheat or hay. Those swamps also which have been drained form excellent meadows. A very considerable proportion of the island must have formerly been covered with pine forests, and some tracts, from which these have disappeared, partake of the character of barrens. Many of these plantations of wood have been destroyed by fires, which have at different periods raged over the island; and in these places white birches, spruce-firs, poplars, and wild cherry-trees, have sprung up. The poplars grow to an immense size, and are very plentiful. There are many other kinds of trees besides, such as beech, maple, dog-wood, alder, Indian pear tree; and most of the shrubs, wild fruits, herbs, and grasses, common to other parts of British North America. Sarsaparilla, ginseng, and probably many other medicinal plants, are plentiful in all parts of the island. Amongst the wild fruits, rasp-berries, straw-berries, cran-berries, which are very large, blueberries, and whortle-berries, are exceedingly abundant.

Amongst the quadrupeds native to the island may be mentioned bears, once very numerous and destructive, but now much reduced; loup-cerviers, a deadly enemy of sheep; foxes and hares, which are both numerous; otters, martens, and musk-rats, now rarely met with, from having been long hunted for their skins; varieties of the squirrel in great abundance; and a few weasels and ermines. During spring, summer, and autumn, seals frequent the shores; and walrusses were at one time annual visitants, but they have now entirely disappeared. Partridges and wild pigeons are plentiful, and, as well as hares, are free for any person to kill, no game-laws existing. In spring and autumn, wild geese, ducks, and other water-fowl, are abundant. The> reptiles and insects do not require particular notice. The rivers abound with excellent fish, such as trout, eel, mackerel, flounders, oysters, lobsters, the two latter being very large and very fine; and the coast with cod-fish and herrings in great abundance.

Prince Edward Island is essentially an agricultural colony, for which its climate, soil, and the configuration of its surface, admirably adapt it. All kinds of grain and vegetables raised in England arrive at perfection. Crop after crop of wheat springs up without manuring; the barley is excellent, and the oats much superior to any other of American growth. The potatoes and turnips cannot be anywhere excelled in quality, and peas and beans are equally good. Cabbage, carrots, parsnips, and, indeed, all culinary vegetables, thrive as well here as in English gardens. Various fruits are also cultivated, such as cherries, plums, damsons, and the like. Flax, of excellent quality, is raised and wrought into fabrics by private individuals. Hemp grows, but not to such perfection as in other places. The climate is particularly favourable to sheep, and they are exempt from those diseases common to the animal in this country. Black cattle are good, but small; swine thrive well, as also do horses and milk-cows. The breed of useful animals generally has been much improved of late years; and agriculture, by the fostering care of the governor, has recently made decided advances. Such being the natural resources and advantages of this colony, it appears to be admirably adapted for industrious emigrants with small capitals. Before adverting to the trade of the island, it will be necessary to speak of the principal settlements, and its division into three counties, viz. Queen’s, King’s, and Prince’s Counties. These are again divided into parishes, the whole being subdivided into sixty-seven townships, containing about 20,000 acres each. The ground for a town, containing about 400 building lots,«with the same number of pasture lots, are reserved in each county. These are, George Town in King’s County, Charlotte Town in Queen’s County, and Prince Town in Prince’s County.

Queen’s County contains five parishes, namely, Grenville, Charlotte, Bedford, Hillsborough, and St John’s, and comprehends an area of 486,400 acres in the centre of the island. The north coast of this county possesses few harbours, except for smaller vessels; but it is extremely picturesque. On the south shore is Hillsborough Bay, at the bottom of which, and at the confluence of the three rivers Hillsborough, York, and Elliott, Charlotte Town, the capital of the island, and the seat of government, is situated. Its harbour is considered as one of the best and most secure in the Gulf of St Lawrence, though not more than half a mile wide at the entrance. Within this point it widens into a spacious basin, and then branches into three beautiful and navigable rivers. The harbour is protected by several batteries, and it could easily be put into such a state of defence as to secure the town from any attack from the seaward. The town is advantageously situated on ground which rises gradually to a moderate height above the level of the sea. It is regularly laid out, the streets being broad, and intersecting each other at right angles, five or six vacancies being left for squares. There are about three hundred and fifty dwelling-houses, many of them handsomely finished. The public buildings are, the courthouse, in which the court of chancery, as well as the court of judicature, are held, and in which the legislative assembly likewise sit; the Episcopal church, the new Scotch church, and the Catholic and the Methodist chapels. The barracks are pleasantly situated near the water, and a neat parade or square occupies the space between those of the officers and privates. On the west side of the harbour lies the Fort or Warren Farm, the most beautiful situation on the island. No place could have been more judiciously selected as a site for the metropolis, than that which has been chosen for Charlotte Town. It is situated almost in the centre of the county, and of easy access, either by water, or by the different roads leading to it from the various other settlements. Indeed there is a maritime communication with a considerable portion of the island by means of the three rivers near the confluence of which it stands. The population amounts to about 3400. Twenty miles west of Charlotte Town, and nearly opposite to Bai de Verts, or Green Bay, in Nova Scotia, stands Tryon village, one of the most populous and pleasant places in the island. A serpentine river winds through it, on the banks of which are well-cultivated farms. The tide flows up about two miles; but, from a dangerous bar at its mouth, the harbour will only admit small vessels. On the north coast of this county is New London, in the district of Grenville Bay. The harbour of New London, though safe and convenient, will not admit vessels drawing more than twelve feet of water. The bar is sheltered during northwesterly winds by Cape Tryon, three miles to the north. The lands on the west side of this harbour have long been cultivated; and there was formerly an extensive fishing establishment erected here, but circumstances occurred to interrupt its prosperity. Harrington, or Grand Rustico Bay, has two entrances, and a harbour for small brigs and schooners. Here are two villages inhabited by Acadian French. The surrounding parts of the bay have been populously settled, chiefly by emigrants from Scotland. To the east of Grand Rustico, are Brackly, and Little Rustico, or Stanhope Cove, esteemed two of the finest settlements on the island. Still further east is Bedford, or Tracady Bay, at which there is a small harbour for schooners and [7:12:592] . small brigs. On the opposite side of the island is Belfast district, which includes the villages of Great and Little Belfast, Orwell, and Point Prince, together with various settlements. The soil here is excellent, and heavy crops are raised, the surplus of which is exported.

King’s County, on the east side of the island, is divided into four parishes, viz. East, St Patrick, St George’s, and St Andrew’s, the whole comprising 412,000 acres. The first, as its name signifies, occupies the whole eastern point of the island, and is destitute of a harbour on its north shore, which is called the District of the Capes. The inhabitants are principally from the west of Scotland and the Hebrides, and they have chiefly applied themselves to agriculture. Owing to the abundant supplies of sea-weed which they possess, they manure the land well, and raise valuable crops, particularly of barley and wheat. Colville, Rollo, Fortune, and Broughton Bays, are small harbours with thriving settlements. St Patrick’s parish has a good bay for small vessels on the north shore, called St Peter’s, about nine miles long. The settlements on each side are in a flourishing and rapidly improving condition. St Andrew’s parish has Murray Harbour and river in it. The former is well sheltered, but of difficult access. Ship-building is carried on here to some extent, and the surrounding country is rapidly improving. George Town, or Three Rivers, is situated in the parish of St George’s, on the south-east part of the island. It possesses an excellent and safe harbour, at the junction of three fine rivers, and is well calculated for being the centre of any trade carried on within the Gulf of St Lawrence. Excellent fishing-grounds lie in its vicinity; and at certain seasons of the year herrings enter it in large shoals. The contiguous settlements are rapidly improving, the settlers turning their attention more to agriculture than formerly. Ship-building is carried on here, and a considerable quantity of timber has been exported within the last five-and-twenty years.

Prince’s County contains five parishes, namely, North, Egmont, Halifax, Richmond, and St David’s, and comprises an area of 467,000 acres. This county possesses several very fine harbours, particularly on the north side, that of Richmond Bay being the largest. This bay is ten miles in depth and nine miles in breadth; and although the centre part is unsheltered, there are several inlets perfectly safe from all winds, with from three to four fathoms of good anchorage.

Six beautiful islands lie within or across the bay, three of which have an area of 500 acres of good land. Lennox Island is the principal rendezvous of the Micmac Indians, once a powerful people, but, like the other aboriginal tribes of the west, now reduced to a mere handful by the arts and the arms of their white subjugators. They profess the Roman Catholic faith, and have here a burying-ground and chapel, where they assemble for a few weeks in summer. A number of townships abut on Richmond Bay, which has a highly advantageous water communication along the coast. It is well situated for cod and herring fisheries, and has afforded several cargoes of timber, as well as vessels built upon the spot, for the English market. The settlers here are principally Scotch, and are, generally speaking, a moral and orderly class of people. To the west of Richmond Bay is Holland Harbour, or Cascumpec, a safe and convenient place of anchorage. The lands around it are well adapted for agriculture; and this place also, by its advantageous situation, is well calculated for extensive fishing establishments. It is the most convenient port in the island for loading timber, where there is a very large quantity; it has also a saw-mill for cutting plank or board.

The population consists of Acadian French and some English families. From Holland Bay to the north-west point (in 47° 7' north latitude) of the island, a distance of twenty-four miles, the coast is low and sandy, as is likewise the case from North Cape, down towards the West Cape, on the south coast, which forms the western entrance of Egmont Bay. This bay is sixteen miles broad, from the west point to Cape Ľgmont, and about ten deep. There is no harbour for large vessels within it, and it is by no means very inviting for strange vessels. The inhabitants in this part are chiefly Acadian French, who live in three small thriving villages on the east side of the bay. Farther to the east lies Halifax, or Befieque Bay, which has a well-sheltered harbour. The shores are populously settled, and there are two or three ship-building establishments here.

When this island was in possession of the French, little commerce was carried on by the inhabitants; but when it came into the hands of the British, a small trade commenced in the articles offish, oil, sea-cow skins, and sealskins, which were exported to various parts of the North American continent. Since that period the trade has very materially increased. The following tables show the present state of the commercial and shipping interests of the island.
[table]

There is also a respectable trade in ship-building carried on in the colony. During the year 1833 there were thirty-two vessels launched and registered, having in the a gg re gate a tonnage of 4006, The number of vessels [7:12:593] employed in the foreign and coasting trade belonging to the island in the same year was, foreign, five vessels, of 1169 tons burden, carrying forty-five men; coasting, 124 vessels, of 6346 tons burden, carrying 359 men. During the year ending December 1832, there were transferred from the island to other ports, thirty-two vessels, of 3202 tons burden in the aggregate. As the best fishing banks within the Gulf of St Lawrence are situated in the neighbourhood of this island, it is surprising that fisheries have not been more attended to. The herring fishery is the most important; immense shoals of these fish arrive on the coast early in spring, and can be taken in any quantity. Cod, mackerel, and other fish, may likewise be caught in abundance. In short, were more attention paid to the fisheries, they would add much to the value of property on the island. Agriculture, however, is not neglected, as will be seen by the following table, showing the quantity of
[table]

The total amount of imports during the same year was L.70,068. The items were severally thus in the return :—

Brandy L.443

Cordage 2,189

Dry goods, consisting of bales, cases, casks, trunks, boxes, and bundles , 19,423

Nails 1,248

Molasses 1,517

Sail-cloth 1,123

Salt 734

Stationery 181

Sugar 2,164

Rum 8,355

Tea 4,894

Tobacco 1,369

Wine 966

Iron 685

Sundries 24,109

The returns for 1834 show a decided increase in trade, especially that which is dependent upon the cultivation of the soil. But of course the commerce of the island is as yet in its infancy. The following is a statistical view of the island, according to a return made under the authority of the act Will. IV. cap. 7, a. d. 1834, viz.

Townships 67

Acres of land occupied 382,301⅜

Acres of improved land ditto 89,757⅛

Cows owned 13,185

Oxen ditto 3,267

Other kinds of neat cattle 12,624

Horses 5,866

Sheep 48,076

Hogs 19,864

Bushels of wheat 121,032⅜

barley 37,300∣

oats 246,049

potatoes 1,208,766

Grist mills 44

Saw mills 29

The total annual product of property has been estimated at the sum of L.l,146,336; the total moveable property at L.2,056,342; and the total immoveable property at L.l,305,000.

The constitution of this island, like that of the other islands in this quarter, is similar to the government of Britain, and in all civil matters is independent of any jurisdiction in America. The king is represented by a lieutenant-governor, who is also chancellor of the court of chancery. There is a council, consisting generally of twelve members elected by the king’s mandamus, and which acts in an executive as well as legislative capacity; and a house of assembly of eighteen members elected by the people, and who manage their affairs after the manner of the British House of Commons. The chief-justice and attorney-general are appointed by the king, and the local government annually nominate the high sheriff. All [7:12:594] criminal and civil matters of importance are tried in the supreme court of judicature, by a jury of twelve men. Magistrates and justices of peace take cognizance of smaller matters. The laws by which justice and good government are dispensed and secured are the same as those of England.

In financial matters the island is thus situated. When the soil was originally granted by government to various proprietors, the conditions of the settlement were, that a certain sum should be paid as quit-rent, amounting on an average to about four shillings and sixpence for each hundred acres. But this sum not being regularly paid, government agreed to accept of a composition; and this arrangement, by freeing the land from heavy claims, imparted a new stimulus to the island. In 1833 it was agreed upon by the house of assembly to address his majesty, offering to provide the whole civil expenses of the island, and asking in return that the crown would resign its claim to the quit-rents, and accept of a substitute of 4s. 6d. for every hundred acres in a township. At the same time it was stipulated that a civil list should be granted to the crown, so as to render the governor, judge, and other functionaries, independent of the annual votes of the house. The fate of this proposal is as yet undecided. St John’s is one of those colonial islands which, from their native resources not having been sufficiently called forth, is at present of equivocal value to the mother country, in as far as revenue is concerned. The revenue has not always kept pace with the expenditure, as in 1833,-when the former amounted to L.7684, and the latter to L.13,759; yet the deficit is to be accounted for by additional outlays for erecting public edifices, and for other useful or necessary purposes. Besides, there was a considerable balance, the remainder of former years; and an issue of treasury notes was made to meet the exigency, a redemption of these being anticipated from the new act levying an assessment upon land. Various causes have contributed to occasion a reduction in the amount of impost duty, such as the failure of crops, and the advanced prices of foreign articles; but such interruptions to prosperity are not likely to remain permanent. With respect to the monetary system, the weights and measures are the same as in England. The dollar is estimated at four shillings and sixpence, and thus becomes five shillings currency; the guinea is L.l. 3s. 4d.; and the other coins are in proportion. The paper currency at present in circulation is supposed to be about L.20,000. There is no banking establishment in the island, which is a material drawback to its prosperity.

The established religion of the colony is the Episcopalian, but the members of the church of Scotland and of that of Rome are supposed to be the most numerous. There are several missionary establishments, and the inhabitants generally are very much awake to the interests of religion, as is shown by the efforts which they have made for its dissemination, as well as that of its powerful auxiliary, education. There is at Charlotte Town a very respectable grammar-school, another on the Madras system, and there are others in most of the settlements for elementary instruction, government devoting a sum for their support. In all, there are seventy-four schools, attended by 2276 scholars. There are two well-conducted newspapers, one of which is published in Charlotte Town, where there is also a public subscription-library on a respectable footing.

We have no data by which to form a correct estimate of the progressive increase of the population. When taken from the French, the island, as we have seen, was supposed to contain about 6000 Acadĩans. By the census of 1833, the males were in number 15,129, and the females 13,795, making a total population of 28,925; which is an increase since 1827 of 8274. Natives of Scotland constitute more than one half of the whole population; those from the Hebrides are best suited to the island. The Acadian French are estimated at about 5000; but of the Micmac or native Indians, once so numerous, there remain probably not more than thirty families on the island.
