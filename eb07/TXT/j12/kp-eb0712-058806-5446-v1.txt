JOGHIS, a sect of religious persons in the East Indies, who never marry, nor hold any private property, but live on alms, and practise strange severities or mortifications. They are subject to a general, who sends them from one country to another to preach. They are, properly, a kind of penitent pilgrims, and supposed to be a remnant of the ancient Gymnosophists. They principally frequent such places as are consecrated by the devotion of the people, and pretend to live several days together without either eating or drinking. After having gone through a course of discipline for a certain time, they look upon themselves as impeccable, and privileged to do any thing; in consequence of which they give a loose rein to their passions, and run into all manner of debauchery.
