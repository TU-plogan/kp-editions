JANSSEN, Cornelius, called Johnson, an eminent painter of portraits, was born at Amsterdam, though, in the Chronological Tables, and in Sandrart, it is asserted that he was born in London; but he resided for several years in England, where he was engaged in the service of King James I. and painted several excellent portraits of that monarch, as also of his children, and of the principal nobility of his court. He had not the freedom of hand, nor the grace, of Vandyck; but in other respects he was accounted his equal, and in the finishing of his pictures superior. His paintings are easily distinguished by their smooth, clear, and delicate tints, and by that character of truth and nature with which they are strongly marked. He generally painted on boards ⅛ and his draperies are for the most part black, probably because the opposition of that tint made his flesh colours appear more beautifully bright, especially in his female figures. He frequently painted in a small size in oil, and often copied his own works in that manner. His fame began to be somewhat obscured on the arrival of Vandyck in England; and the civil war breaking out some time afterwards, induced him to return to his own country, where his paintings were held in the highest esteem. He died in 1685.

Janssens, Abraham, an historical painter, was born at Antwerp in 1569. He was contemporary with Rubens, and also his competitor, and in many of the finest parts of the art was accounted not inferior to that celebrated master. It is reported, that having wasted his substance by a life of dissipation and pleasure, and falling in consequence into necessitous circumstances, which, however, he imputed to ill fortune rather than to his own neglect of his business, he grew envious of the grandeur in which Rubens appeared, and, impatient of his merit, and success, challenged him to paint a picture with him for fame alone. But Rubens rejected the proposal, answering with modesty, that he freely submitted to him, and the world would certainly do justice to them both. Sandrart, who had seen several of his works, assures us, that he not only gave a fine roundness and relief to his figures, but also such a warmth and clearness to the carnations, that they had all the appearance of real flesh; and his colouring was as durable as it was beautiful, retaining its original lustre for a number of years. His capital performance is said to have been the resurrection of Lazarus, which was in the cabinet of the elector-palatine, and an object of admiration to all who beheld it.

Janssens, Vict.r Honorius, an historical painter, was born at Brussels in 1664. He was a disciple of Volders, under whose direction he continued for seven years, during which time he gave many proofs of a superior genius. He afterwards went to Rome, where he studied particularly the works of Raffaelle. He designed after the antiques, and sketched the beautiful scenes around that city. In a short time his paintings rose in esteem, and the principal nobility of Rome were desirous to employ him. He associated for several years with Tempesta, the celebrated landscape painter, and painted the figures in the works of that great master as long as they resided together. Janssens composed historical subjects, both in a small and a large size; but he found the demand for his small pictures so considerable, that he was induced to paint most frequently in that size. He continued at Rome during eleven years, which barely sufficed for his finishing those pictures which he was engaged to paint; nor would he have even then been at liberty, had he not limited himself to a number, and determined not to undertake more. On his return to Brussels, his performances were as much admired there as they had before been in Italy; but having married, and become the father of eleven children, he was compelled to change his manner of painting in small, and to undertake only those of the large kind, as being more lucrative, more expeditious, and also more agreeable to his genius and inclination. He adorned with his compositions most of the churches and palaces of his own country.
