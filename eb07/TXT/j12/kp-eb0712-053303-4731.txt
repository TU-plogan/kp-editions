JAY, Gui Michel le, distinguished by the Polyglott which bears his name, was born at Paris in 1588. He studied the ancient languages, in which, however, he was but moderately skilled. In 1615, three men of rare merit, Cardinal Duperron, Jacques de Thou, and François de Brèves, had conceived the project of publishing a Polyglott; but, from some circumstances, the design was not carried into effect. Lejay, however, resolved to revive the scheme, and conduct it to a conclusion. He had fortune, he was laborious, and he was not wanting in resources. He associated with himself in the undertaking some of the most learned men of his time. The elder Morin of the Oratory, Philippe d’Aquin, a converted Jew, Godefroy Hermant, a canon of Beauvais, and three Maronites of Lebanon, were charged with revising the different books of the Holy Scriptures, each in the language which he understood; whilst Jacques Sanlecque, a famous artist, cast the characters, and Antoine Vitré or Vitray, printer to the king, undertook the impression. It commenced in 1628, and, after encountering a variety of difficulties and obstacles, was completed in 1645, under the title of Biblia Hebraica, Samaritana, Chaldaica, Groe- ca, Latina, Arabica, quibus textus originales totius Scripturae sacrae, quorum pars in editione Complutensi, deinde Antucrpiensi regiis sumptibus extat, nunc integri ex manuscriptis toto fere orbe queesitis, exemplaribus exhibentur, in ten volumes. The execution of this work is magnificent; it is indeed a masterpiece of typography; but it literally swarms with blunders, editorial as well as typographical; whilst, by reason of the enormous size of the volumes, the use of them is attended with much inconvenience. Lejay [7:12:534]ruined himself Dy the impression, first, because he would not suffer it to appear under the name of Cardinal Richelieu, who, after the example of Cardinal Ximenes, was ambitious of immortalising his name by such an undertaking; and next, because he made it too dear for the English market, upon which Dr Walton undertook his Polyglott Bible, which, being more commodious, reduced the price of Lejay’s. After the death of his wife. Lejay, having taken orders, was made dean of Vezelay, in the Nivernois; and Louis XIV. gave him the post of councillor of state.
