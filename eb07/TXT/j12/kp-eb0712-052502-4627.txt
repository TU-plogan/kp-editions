JAQUELOT, Isaac, a learned French Protestant divine, was born on the 16th December 1647, at Vassy in Champagne, of which place his father was minister. The revocation of the edict of Nantes having obliged him to quit France, he took refuge first at Heidelberg, and then at the Hague, where he procured an appointment in the Walloon church. Here he continued till that capital was taken by the king of Prussia, who, having heard him preach, appointed him his French minister in ordinary at Berlin, to which city he removed in 1702. During his residence at Berlin he entered into a warm controversy with Μ. Bayle on the doctrine advanced by him in his dictionary concerning Manichaeism, which dispute continued until death imposed silence on both parties. It was in this controversy that Μ. Jaquelot openly declared in favour of the Remonstrants. His reputation as a writer rests principally on the following works, viz. 1. Dissertation sur l’Existence de Dieu, Hague, 1697, in 4to; 2. Dissertation sur la Messe, où l’on prouve aux Juifs que Jésus-Christ est le Messie promis, et prédit dans l’Ancien Testament, Hague, 1699, in 8vo; 3. Traité de la Vérité et de l’Inspiration des Livres du Vieux et du Nouveau Testament, Rotterdam, 1715, in 8vo; 4. Select Sermons, Geneva, 1721, in two vols. J2mo.
