JEZIDES, amongst the Mahommedans, a term of similar import with heretics amongst Christians. The Jezides are a numerous.sect inhabiting Turkey and Persia, and so called from their head, Jezid, an Arabian prince, who slew the sons of Ali, Mahommed’s father-in-law; for which reason he is reckoned a parricide, and his followers heretics. There are in Turkey and Persia many Jezides, who are of two sorts, black and white. The white are clad like Turks, and distinguished only by their shirts, which are not slit at the neck like those of others, but have a round hole to thrust their heads through. The black Jezides, though married, are the monks or religious persons of the order; and they are called Fakirs.

The Turks exact excessive taxes from the Jezides, who in their turn hate the Turks as their mortal enemies; and when, in their wrath, they curse any creature, they call it Moslemin. They are extremely ignorant, and believe both the Bible and the Koran without reading either. All the adoration they pay to God consists of some songs in honour of Jesus Christ, the virgin, Moses, and sometimes Mahommed; and it is a principal point of their religion never to speak ill of the devil, lest he should resent the injury if ever he were to come into favour with God again, which they think possible. They bury their dead in the first place they come at, rejoicing as at a festival, and celebrating the entry of the deceased into heaven. When they get wine, they drink it to excess; and it is said that they sometimes do this with a religious purpose, calling it the blood of Christ.
