JUGUM, an humiliating mode of punishment inflicted by the victorious Romans upon their vanquished enemies. It was done in this way: They set up two spears, and laying a third across, in the form of a gallows, they ordered those who had surrendered themselves to pass under this ignominious erection, without arms or belts. None suffered this disgrace of passing sub jugo except such as had been obliged to surrender.
