JEDBURGH, a royal burgh, the seat of a presbytery, and the capital of a parish of the same name, as well as the county town or Roxburghshire in Scotland. It is beautifully situated in the romantic valley of the Jed, on the left bank of that stream, environed with sylvan banks, and embosomed in venerable orchards. This town is of very ancient date, and the name appears to have been at a former period indiscriminately written Gedworde, Jedworth, Jed-wood, Jeddart (still in use amongst the common people), and Jedburgh. The name of the river being anciently written Ged, and perhaps Gad, has afforded an opportunity for antiquaries conjecturing that this parish was the principal seat of the Gadeni, a tribe who inhabited the district between the river Teviot and Northumberland. In the twelfth century David I. founded a monastery here, which greatly enhanced the importance of the town. From the antique choir which remains, in a dilapidated state, some have been led to suppose that a sacred edifice existed on the same site prior to the time of David I., and that the venerable ruin, which still attracts much attention, was not founded, but only rebuilt, by that munificent monarch. He also gave to the canons the chapel of Scarsburgh, lying in a recess of the forest, to the east of the Jed; and at a later period the dependencies of Restennet in Angus, and Cannoby in Dumfriesshire, came into the possession of the monastery. The importance of the town was still further secured by the erection of a castle; but by whom it was founded is not known. It was a royal residence, and for ages continued a place of great strength, the object of eager dispute to the contending kingdoms. It was frequently honoured with the presence of the Scottish monarchs, and was the scene of the royal festivities of Alexander III. on the occasion of his second marriage. After the fifteenth century, the town is frequently mentioned in the history of the wars between the Scotch and English. It was burned by the Earl of Surrey in 1523, at which period it appears to have been a very considerable town; for Surrey, in his despatches to Henry VIII. says, that “there was two times more houses therein than in Berwick, and well builded, with many honest and fair houses in garrison, and six good towers therein.” The same writer also extols, in no measured terms, the warlike character and bravery of the men of Jedburgh. Their favourite weapon was the Jedwoöd axe; and their war-cry or slogan, “Jedworth’s here.” But an account of the various battles and skirmishes in which they distinguished themselves belongs rather to the history of the county, than to a description of the town. At the present day, Jedburgh has four principal streets, crossing each other at right angles, and terminating in a square or market-place. They are wide and clean, and the houses are well built. In recent times the town has been generally improved, and many elegant, if not spacious buildings have been erected. It contains numerous handsome shops, in which all the necessaries and most of the luxuries of life can be readily obtained. It is celebrated for the production of excellent bread, which is exported in great quantities to the north of England, as well as to the surrounding villages of the county. It is entitled to hold two markets every week, on Tuesday and Saturday. The Tuesday’s market is well attended, and grain is then sold by sample to a considerable extent. There are two banks in Jedburgh, branches of the British Linen Company and of the National Bank. Besides the established church, Jedburgh contains several meeting houses for dissenters, who are here a numerous body. The principal manufactures are blankets, flannels, tartans, shawls, shepherds’ plaidings, hosiery, lamb’s-wool yarn, and carpets; and the town also derives part of its income from fruit, which is produced in considerable quantities in private gardens. There is here an excellent grammar and English school, united in 1804, several subscription libraries, a savings bank for the district, a dispensary, one or two religious societies, and there are letter-press printers in the town. An establishment for making printing presses, on a new principle of construction, has likewise been or considerable benefit to Jedburgh. It is governed by a council, consisting of a provost, four bailies, a dean of guild, and eighteen ordinary councillors. There are eight incor porated trades, who annually elect their own deacons and office-bearers, and four of these deacons are admitted into the council to represent the trades for the year. Jedburgh unites with Haddington, North Berwick, Lauder, and Dunbar, in sending a member to parliament. The revenue oí the burgh amounts at present to L.573 per annum, being chiefly derived from the rent of the mills. Jedburgh is forty-six miles south of Edinburgh, ten west of Kelso, and [7:12:535] twelve north of the borders of England. The population of the burgh amounted in 1821 to 2500, and in 1831 to 3709.
