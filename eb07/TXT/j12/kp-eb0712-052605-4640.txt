JASSY, a city, the capital of Moldavia, the residence of the prince, of a Greek archbishop, and of many of the waywodes or nobles. It stands on a lofty situation, but is surrounded with hills still higher. It is watered by brooks forming a stream ending in the Pruth. The town is composed chiefly of wooden houses, and is said to be excessively filthy, and by no means healthy. The palace of the prince is plain, small, and badly situated. The city contains no less than forty-three churches, with twenty-six convents and nunneries of the Greek religion. It has also a Catholic and a Lutheran chapel. The houses are stated to be six thousand in number, and the inhabitants from twenty-five to thirty thousand. It is not a place of any other trade than such as arises from providing for the luxuries of a voluptuous nobility and a petty sovereign. Long. 27. 24. 55. E. Lat. 47. 8. 30. N.
