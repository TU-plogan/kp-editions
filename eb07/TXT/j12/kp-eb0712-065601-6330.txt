JUSTIN, commonly called Justin Martyr, one of the earliest and most learned writers of the eastern church, was born at Neapoli, the ancient Sechem of Palestine. His father, Priseus, a Gentile Greek, brought him up in his own religion, and had him educated in all the learning of Greece. To complete his studies, he travelled to Egypt, and followed the sect of Plato. But one day walking by the sea side wrapt in contemplation, he was met by a grave person, of a venerable aspect, who, falling into discourse with him, turned the conversation by degrees from the excellence of Platonism to the superior perfection of Christianity, and reasoned so well, as to raise in him an ardent curiosity to inquire into the merits of that religion. The consequence of this inquiry was, that he was converted about the year 132. On his embracing the Christian religion, he quitted neither the profession nor the habit of a philosopher; but a persecution having broken out under Antoninus, he composed an Apology for the Christians; and afterwards presented another to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, in which he vindicated the innocence and holiness of the Christian religion, against Crescens a Cynic philosopher, and other calumniators. He did honour to Christianity by his learning and the purity of his manners; and suffered martyrdom in the year 167. Besides his two Apologies, there are still extant his Dialogue with TryphoÂ·, a Jew; two treatises addressed to the Gentiles, and one on the unity of God. Other works are also ascribed to him. The best editions of St Justin are those of Robert Stephens, in 1551 and 1571, in Greek and Latin; that of Morell, in Greek and Latin, in 1656; and that of Prudentius Marandus, a learned Benedictine, in 1742, in folio. His works have also been published separately.
