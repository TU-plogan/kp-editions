JAMES, St, called the Greater, the son of Zebedee, and the brother of John the Evangelist, was born at Bethsaida in Galilee. Fie was called to be an apostle, together with St John, as they were mending their nets with their father Zebedee, who was a fisherman; when Christ gave each of them the name of Boanerges, or Son of Thunder. They then followed Christ, were witnesses, with St Peter, of the transfiguration on Mount Tabor, and accompanied our Lord in the garden of olives. It is believed tha t St [7:12:506] James first preached the gospel to the dispersed Jews; and afterwards returned to Judaea, where he preached at Jerusalem, when the Jews raised up against him Herod Agrippa, who put him to a cruel death, about the year 4İ4. Thus St James was the first of the apostles who suffered martyrdom. St Clement of Alexandria relates, that his accuser was so struck with his constancy, that he became converted, and suffered with him.

James, St, called the Less, an apostle, the brother of Jude, and the son of Cleopbas, and Mary the sister of the mother of our Lord, is called in Scripture the Just, and the brother of Jesus, who appeared to him in particular after his resurrection. He was the first bishop of Jerusalem, when Annanias II. high priest of the Jews, caused him to be condemned and delivered into the hands of the people and the Pharisees, who threw him down from the steps of the temple, when a fuller dashed out his brains with a club, about the year 62. His life was so holy, that Josephus considers the ruin of Jerusalem as a punishment inflicted on that city for his death. He was the author of the epistle which bears his name.

Nr James of the Sword (San Jago del Espada), a military order in Spain, instituted in 1170, under the reign of Ferdinand II. king of Leon and Gallicia. Its object was to put a stop to the incursions of the Moors, these knights obliging themselves by a vow to secure the roads. An union was proposed and agreed to in 1170, between these and the canons of St Eloy; and the order was confirmed by the pope in 1175. The highest dignity in that order is that of grand-master, which has been united to the crown of Spain. The knights were obliged to give proof of their descent from families that had been noble for four generations on both sides; they also were required to make it appear that their ancestors were neither Jews, Saracens, nor heretics, nor had ever been called in question by the inquisition.

James, the name of several kings of Scotland and of Great Britain.

James I. king of Scotland in 1423, the first of the house of Stuart, was not only the most learned king, but one of the most learned men, of the age in which he flourished. This ingenious and amiable prince fell into the hands of the enemies of his country in his tender youth, when he was flying from the snares of his unnatural and ambitious uncle, who governed his dominions, and was suspected of designs against his life. Having secretly embarked for France, the ship was taken by an English privateer off Flamborough Head; and the prince and his attendants were confined in a neighbouring castle until they were sent to London. The prince was conducted to the Tower immediately after he was seized, on the 14th of April 1405 (in the thirteenth year of his age), and there kept a close prisoner till the 10th of June 1407, when he was removed to the castle of Nottingham, from which he was brought back to the Tower on the 1st of March 1414, and there confined till the 3d of August in the same year, when he was conveyed to the castle of Windsor, where he was detained till the summer of 1417, when Henry V., for political reasons, carried him with him into France in his second expedition. In this melancholy situation, so unsuitable to his age and rank, books were his chief companions, and study his greatest pleasure. That he wrote as well as read much we have his own testimony, and that of all our historians who lived near his time. Bowmaker, the continuator of Fordun, who was his contemporary, and personally acquainted w ith him, spends ten chapters in his praise, and in lamentations for his death; and, amongst other things, states that his knowfledge of the Scriptures, of law, and philosophy, was incredible. Hector Boyce tells us that Henry IV. and Henry V. furnished their royal prisoner with the best teachers in all the arts and sciences; that by their assistance, he made great proficiency in every part of learning and the fine arts; and that he became a perfect master in grammar, rhetoric, poetry, music, and all the secrets of natural philosophy, and was inferior to none in divinity and law. This prince’s skill in music was remarkable. Walter Bower, abbot of Inchcolm, who was intimately acquainted with him, assures us that he played on eight different instruments, which he names, and especially on the harp, with such exquisite skill, that he seemed to be inspired.^[1. Scutichruηicοη, lib. xvi. c. 18.] Above a century after his death he was celebrated in Italy as the inventor of a new and pleasing kind of melody, which had been admired and imitated in that country. This appears from the following testimony of Tassoni, a writer who was well informed, and of undoubted credit. “W τ e may reckon amongst us moderns, James king of Scotland, who not only composed many sacred pieces of vocal music, but also of himself invented a new kind of music, plaintive and melancholy, different from all other; in which he had been imitated by Carlo Gesualdo, prince of Venosa, who, in our age, has improved music with new and admirable inventions.”^[2. Alessandro Tassoni Ρensieri Diversi, libs.] After spending almost twenty years in captivity, and encountering many difficulties on his return into his native kingdom, he was murdered by barbarous assassins in the prime of life. Many of the productions of his pen have perished, for only three poems that have been ascribed to him are now extant, viz. Christ’s Kirk on the Green; Peebles at the Play; and the King’s Quair. But slender as these remains are, they afford sufficient evidence that the genius of this royal poet was not inferior to that of any of his contemporaries, and that it was equally fitted for the gayest or the gravest strains. (See Poetical Remains of James I. Edinburgh, 1783; and Warton’s History of Poetry, vol. ii. p. 12.)

James V. king of Scotland, was but eighteen months old when his father fell in the battle of Flodden Field in 1513. When of age he assisted Francis I. king of France against the Emperor Charles V.; a service for which, in 1535, Francis gave him his eldest daughter in marriage. This princess died in two years; and James married Mary of Lorraine, daughter of Claude duke of Guise, and widow of Louis d'Orleans, by whom he had only one child, Mary queen of Scots, born only eight days before his death, which happened on the 13th of December 1542, in the thirty-fifth year of his age. This was the first prince of his family who died a natural death since its elevation to the throne. He is said to have been the author of a humorous composition called the Gaberlunzie Man. James VI. king of Scotland in 1567, and of England in 1603, was son of Mary queen of Scots, whom he succeeded in Scotland, as he did Elizabeth in England. He valued himself much upon his polemical writings, and was so fond of theological disputations, that, to keep them alive, he founded Chelsea College for the express purpose of attaining this object; but it was converted to a much better use by Charles II. His Basilicon Doroη, his Commentary on the Revelation, his writings against Bellarmine, and his Doemonologia, or doctrine of witchcraft, are sufficiently known. A collection of his writings and speeches was published in one folio volume. He died in 1625, in the fifty-ninth year of .his age and twenty-third of his reign.

James, Thomas, a learned English critic and divine, was born at Newport, in the Isle of Wight, about the year 1571. Having completed his preliminary studies at Westminster[7:12:507] School, he entered New College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow in 1593; took his degree as master of arts in 1599; and having collated several manuscripts of the Philobiblion of Richard of Durham, which he published in 4to, dedicated to Sir Thomas Bodley, he recommended himself to the favour of that munificent patron of learning, and through his influence was in 1602 appointed keeper of the public library, an office which he held during eighteen years. In 1614 he was created doctor in divinity, promoted to the archdeaconry of Wells, and about the same time presented to the rectory of Mongeham in Kent, not to mention other spiritual preferments. In 1620 he resigned his situation as librarian, and applied himself chiefly to the readings of old manuscripts, in which he assures Archbishop Usher that he had restored three hundred citations, or rescued them from corruptions. Having been chosen a member of the convocation held with the parliament at Oxford in 1625, he there moved to have commissioners appointed to collate the manuscripts of the fathers in all the libraries of England, with the Roman Catholic editions; but as this project did not meet with the desired encouragement, he himself undertook the arduous task, and continued to prosecute it until his death, which took place in August 1629. He left behind him a great number of learned works, the principal of which are, 1. Philobiblion Ricardi Dunelmensis, 1599; 2. Cyprianus Redivivus, London, 1600; 3. Catalogus Librorum in Bibliotheca Bodleiana, Oxford, 1605, in 4to; 4. Concordantiae SS. Patrum, Oxford, 1607, in 4to; 5. Apology for John W τ ickliffe, Oxford, 1608, in 4to; 6. Specimen Corruptelarum Pontificiorum in Cypriano, Ambrosio, Gregorio Magno, &c. London, 1626; 7. Index librorum prohibitorum a pontificibus, Oxford, 1627, in 8vo; and, 8, some pieces in manuscript. (a.) James, Dr Robert, an English physician, particularly distinguished by the preparation of a fever powder, was born at Kinverston, in Staffordshire, in 1703; his father was a major in the army, his mother a sister of Sir Robert Clarke. He was of St John’s College in Oxford, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts; and afterwards practised physic at Sheffield, Lichfield, and Birmingham successively. He then removed to London, and became a licentiate in the college of physicians; but in what year is not know n. At London he applied himself to writing, as well as practising physic; and in 1743 published a Medical Dictionary, in three vols, folio. Soon afterwards he published an English translation, with a supplement by himself, of Ramaz ziηi de morbis artificum ; to which he also prefixed a piece of Frederic Hoffman upon Endemical Distempers, 8vo. He also published, in 17⅛6, The Practice of Physic, 2 vols. 8vo; in 1760, On Canine Madness, 8vo; in 1764, A Dispensatory, 8vo. In June 1755, when the king was at Cambridge, James was admitted by mandamus to the doctorship of physic. In 1788 were published, A Dissertation upon Fevers, and A Vindication of the Fever Powder, 8vo; with A Short Treatise on the Disorders of Children. This was the eighth edition of the Dissertation, the first of which had been printed in 1751; and the purpose of it was to set forth the success of this powder, as well as to describe more particularly the manner of administering it. The Vindication was posthumous and unfinished; for he died in March 1776, whilst he was employed upon it.
