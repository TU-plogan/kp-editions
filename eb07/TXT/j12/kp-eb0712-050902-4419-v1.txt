JANUARIUS, St, the patron saint of Naples, where his head is occasionally carried in procession, in order to stay the eruption 'of Vesuvius. The liquefaction of his blood is a famous miracle, or rather juggle, at Naples. The saint suffered martyrdom about the end of the third century. When he was beheaded, a pious lady of Naples caught about an ounce of his blood, which has ever since been carefully preserved in a bottle, without having lost a single grain of its weight. This of itself were it equally demonstrable, might be considered as a greater miracle than the circumstance on which the Neapolitans lay the whole stress, namely, that the blood, which has congealed, and acquired a solid form by age, is no sooner brought near the head of the saint, than, as a mark of veneration, it immediately liquefies.
