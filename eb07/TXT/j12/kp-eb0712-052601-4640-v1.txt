JASLO, a circle of the Austrian kingdom of Gallicia, extending over 1354 square miles. It contains five cities, eleven market-towns, and 366 villages, inhabited by 195,200 individuals, occupying 28,562 houses. It consists of part of the Carpathian Mountains, and the soil is for the most part poor and stony; but it produces corn equal, with the aid of potatoes, to the consumption. The capital is the city of the same name, situated at the junction of the rivers Jastel and Wisloka, and containing 224 houses, and 1463 inhabitants.
