JENKINS, Sir Leoline, a civilian and statesman of considerable note, born in Glamorganshire about the year 1623. Having become obnoxious to the parliament during the civil war, by adhering to the king’s cause, he consulted his safety by flight; but he returned at the restoration, was admitted an advocate in the court of arches, and succeeded Dr Exton as judge. When the queen-mother Henrietta died at Paris in 1669, her whole estate, real and personal, was claimed by her nephew Louis XIV.; upon which Dr Jenkins’ opinion being called for and approved, he proceeded to Paris, accompanied by three others who were joined with him in a commission, and recovered her effects; a service for which he received the honour of knighthood. He officiated as one of the mediators at the treaty of Nimeguen, and was afterwards made a privy councillor and secretary of state. He died in 1685, and bequeathed his whole estate to charitable uses. Dr Jenkins was so great a benefactor to Jesus College, Oxford, that he is generally looked upon as the second founder. All his letters and papers were collected and printed in 1724, in two vols, folio.
