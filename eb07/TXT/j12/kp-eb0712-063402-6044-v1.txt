JURIEU, Peter, an eminent French protestant divine, called ironically by the Catholics the Goliath of the Protestants, was born in the year 1637. He was educated in England under his maternal uncle Peter du Moulin, and took orders in the English church; but returning to succeed his father as pastor of a reformed congregation at Mer, in the diocese of Blois, he was made professor of divinity and Hebrew at Sedan, where he acquired great reputation. This university being taken from the Protestants, a professorship of divinity was founded for him at Rotterdam; and he was also appointed minister of the Walloon church in the same town. Being now in a place of liberty, he gave full scope to an imagination naturally warm, and applied himself to study the book of Revelation, of which he fancied that he had by a kind of inspiration discovered the true meaning; a notion which led him to form many enthusiastic conjectures. He was, moreover, so unfortunate as to quarrel with his best friends for opposing his visionary opinions, which produced violent disputes with Bayle and De Beauval. He died in 1713; and left a great number of esteemed works, the principal of which are, 1. A Treatise of Devotion; 2. Preservative against Popery, 1673; 3. A Vindication of the Morality of the Protestants against the Accusations of Μ. Arnauld, 1675, 1685; 4. The last Efforts of Afflicted Innocence; 5. i Histoire des Dogmes et des Cultes; 6. Histoire du Galvanisme et du Papisme mise en parallèle, 1683, in three vols.; 7. Lettres Pastorales; 8. Traité de l’Unité de l’Eglise, 1688; 9. Abrégé de l’Histoire du Concile de Trente, 1683; 10. Traite de la Nature et de la Grace; and various Other works. Jurieu was unquestionably a man of considerable learning, but he entertained peculiar notions of his own, and showed little toleration for the opinions of others.
