JENTACULUM, among the Romans, a morning refreshment like our breakfast. It was exceedingly simple, consisting, for the most part, of bread alone; but labouring people had something more substantial, to enable them to support the fatigues of their employment. The Greeks distinguished this morning meal by the several names of apgrov, a%gaτι ∣ iμος, or axξar ∣ gμa, though àgiōrov is generally applied to dinner.
