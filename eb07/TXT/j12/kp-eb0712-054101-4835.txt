JEOFAILE (compounded of three French words, Pay faille, I have failed), a term in law, used to indicate an oversight in pleading or other proceeding at law.

The showing of these defects or oversights was often practised by the counsel formerly; and when the jury came into court in order to try the issue, they said, This inquest you ought, not to take; and after verdict they would say to the court, To judgment you ought not to go. But several statutes have been made to avoid the delays occasioned by such suggestions; and a judgment is not now to be stayed after verdict for a mistake in the Christian or surname of either of the parties, or in a sum of money, or in the day, month, year, &c. where the same are rightly named in any preceding record.
