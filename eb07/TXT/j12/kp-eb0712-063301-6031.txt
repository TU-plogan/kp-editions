JURA, one of the Hebrides, or Western Islands of Scotland, lying opposite to Knapdale in Argyleshire, is supposed to be about thirty-four miles in length and ten in breadth. It is the most rugged of all the Hebrides, and is composed chiefly of vast mountains, naked, and without a possibility of cultivation. See Scotland. Jura, one of the departments of the north-east of France. It is formed out of what was formerly called Higher Burgundy, is bounded on a part of its eastern frontier by Switzerland, and on all other sides by French departments. It is about sixty-six miles in length from north to south, and about thirtyÂ· eight in breadth from east to west, comprehending 1388 square miles. The department may be classed under three heads; first, the plains on the western side, which are fertile; second, the first steps of the mountains, which suddenly rise like a wall, extending from ten to twelve miles, above which is an extensive plateau mixed with hills, between which are some valleys, which, though stony, are of moderate fertility; the third division, which comprises nearly two thirds of the whole, is a mountainous district, but none of its summits exceed 5500 feet in height. These mountains are on the eastern side of the department; the most remarkable are the Reculet, 5200 feet; the Dole, 4950 feet; and the Poupet, somewhat lower. The woods, according to the Description Topographique et Statistique, cover one quarter of the whole surface. This department is the source of the small rivers Tansche, Dorrain, Dcffoy, and some others; but a great part is watered by the Doubs and the Ain, and there are within it several lakes. The climate varies with the elevation, and the snow in the eastern parts is often so deep as to prevent all communication. The different parts produce wheat, barley, maize, and buck-wheat; a little excellent and much middling wine, abundance of fuel, and some very [7:12:634]good cattle, especially horses. There are some mines of iron, and manufactures of various articles from it. The department is divided into four arrondissements, and subdivided into thirty-two cantons and 728 communes, inhabited by 292,880 persons, all of whom adhere to the catholic religion.
