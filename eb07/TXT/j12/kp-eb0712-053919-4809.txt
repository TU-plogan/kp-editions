JEMLAH, a small district of Hindustan, situated between the thirtieth and thirty-first degrees of north latitude. It was formerly an independent state, but is now tributary to the rajah of Nepaul. It is said to be nearly of the same extent as that of Nepaul, but to be more contiguous to the great Himalaya ridge of mountains, and more chequered with low hills. It produces a species of rice which is adapted to the climate of northern countries. Its capital is called Chinnochin, but has not been visited by Europeans.
