JAPETUS, a son of Coelus and Terra, who married Asia, Asope, Theonis, or Clymene, and had four sons, Atlas, Menoctius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus. He was thus considered as the author of the Hellenic race. (Apollodor. i. 1,2; Diodor. v. 66, 67; Hesiod, Theog. 134. Iapetionides, a son of Japetus; Atlas, Ovid. Met. iv. 631). He is supposed to be the same as Japheth, the son of Noah.
