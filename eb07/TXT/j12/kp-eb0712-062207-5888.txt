JOTAPATA, in Ancient Geography, a town of the Lower Galilee, distant forty stadia from Gabara; a strong place, situated on a rock, walled round, and encompassed on all hands with mountains, so as not to be seen except by those who approach very near. It was taken with difficulty by Vespasian. When it surrendered, it was ordered to be razed.
