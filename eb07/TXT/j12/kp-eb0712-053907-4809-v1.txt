JEJURRY, a Mahratta town of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapoor. This place is noted for a fine Hindu temple, built of hewn stone, and dedicated to an incarnation of Mahadeva or Siva, under the form of Khandeh Row, which he assumed to destroy an enormous giant named ĩvlanimal. The temple has very ample revenues, about L.6000 annually being expended on account of the idol, for whom horses and elephants are maintained; and who, with his spouse, is washed every day in rose and Ganges water, which has to be brought a distance of] 000 miles. About 250 dancing girls are attached to the establishment, with many Brahmins, and beggars innumerable. The revenues are derived from the donations of the pious, consisting of houses, lands, and money. This is a noted place for penance; and, at a particular season of the year, a number of persons, in order to expiate their sins, undergo the penance of swinging on a kind of gibbet, suspended by hooks passed through the fleshy part of the back. Twenty-eight miles south-east from Poonah. Long. 74. 17. E. Lat. 18. 16. N.
