JUDGE, a chief magistrate of the law, appointed to hear causes, to explain the laws, and to pronounce sentence.

Judges, in Jewish antiquity, certain supreme magistrates who governed the Israelites from the time of Joshua till the reign of Saul. These judges resembled the Athenian archons and the Roman dictators. The dignity of judge was for life, but not always in uninterrupted succession. God himself, by an express declaration of his will, regularly appointed the judges. The Israelites, however, did not always wait for his appointment, but sometimes chose for themselves a judge in times of danger. The power of the judges extended to affairs of peace and war. They were protectors of the law, defenders of religion, and avengers of all crimes; but they could make no laws, nor impose any new burdens upon the people. They lived without pomp or retinue, unicss their own fortunes enabled them to do so; for the revenues of their office consisted in voluntary presents from the people. They continued from the death of Joshua till the beginning of the reign of Saul, being a space of about 339 years.

Judges, in ordinary affairs, civil and religious, were appointed by Moses in every city, to terminate differences; but in affairs of greater consequence, the differences wcrc referred to the priests of Aaron’s family, and the judge of the people or prince at that time established. Moses likewise established two courts in all the cities; one consisting of priests and Levites, to determine points concerning the law and religion; the other consisting of heads of families, to decide in civil matters.

Booh of Judges, a canonical book of the Old Testament, so Called from its relating to the state of the Israel ites under the administration of those illustrious persons who were called judges, from being both the civil and military governors of the people, and who were raised up by God upon special occasions after the death of Joshua till the time of their making a king. In the time of this peculiar polity, there were several remarkable occurrences, which are recorded in this book. It acquaints us with the gross impiety of a new generation which sprung up after the death of Joshua; and it gives us a short view of the dispensations of heaven towards this people, sometimes relieving and delivering them, and at others severely chastising them by the hands of their enemies.

Select Judges (Judices selecti), in Antiquity, were persons summoned by the prsetor to give their verdict in criminal matters in the Roman courts, as juries do in ours. No person could be regularly admitted into this number till he was twenty-five years of age. The Sortitio Judicum, or impannelling of the jury, was the office of the Judex ∖ Questionis, and was performed after both parties had come into court, each having a right to reject or challenge whomsoever he pleased. The number of the Judices selecti varied, according to the nature of the charge. When the proper number appeared, they were sworn, took their places in the subsellia, and heard the trial.
