JUXON, Dr William, archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Chichester in 1582. He was educated at Merchant Tailors’ School, and thence elected into, St John’s College, Oxford, of which he became president. King Charles I. made him bishop of London, and in 1635 promoted him to the office of lord high treasurer of England. The whole nation, and especially the nobility, were greatly offended at this high office being given to a clergyman; but he behaved so well in the administration, that be soon put a stop to all the clamour raised against him. This place he held no longer than the 17th of May 1641, when he prudently resigned the staff, to avoid the storm which then threatened the court and the clergy. In the following February an act passed, depriving the bishops of their votes in parliament, and incapacitating them from exercising any temporal jurisdiction. In these leading steps, as well as in the total abolition of the episcopal order which followed, he was involved with his brethren; but neither as a bishop nor as a treasurer was a single accusation brought against him in the long parliament. During the civil wars he resided at his palace at Fulham, where his meek, inoffensive, and affable manners, notwithstanding his remaining steady in his loyalty to the king, procured him the visits of the principal persons of the opposite party, and respect from all. In 1648 he attended his majesty at the treaty in the Isle of Wight; and, by his particular desire, waited upon him at Cotton House, Westminster, the day after the commencement of his trial, during which he frequently visited him in the office of a spiritual father; and his majesty declared he was the greatest comfort to him in that afflicting situation. He likewise attended his majesty on the scaffold, where the king, taking off his cloak and george, gave him the latter. After the execution, Bishop Juxon took care of the body, which he accompanied to the royal chapel at Windsor, and stood ready, with the common-prayer book in his hands, to perform the last ceremony for the king; but he was prevented by Colonel Whichcot, governor of the castle. He continued in the quiet possession of Fulham Palace till the ensuing year, 1649, when he was deprived, having been spared longer than any of his brethren. He then retired to his own estate in Gloucestershire, where he lived in privacy till the restoration, when he was presented to the see of Canterbury; and, during the little time he enjoyed it, expended, in buildings and reparations at Lambeth Palace and Croydon House, near L. 15,000. He died in 1663, having bequeathed L.7000 to St John’s College, and to other charitable uses near L.5000. He published a sermon on Luke, xviii. 31, and Some Considerations upon the Act of Uniformity.
