JUNO, in Pagan worship, was the sister and wife of Jupiter, the goddess of kingdoms and riches, and was styled the Queen of Heaven. She presided over marriage and child-birth, and was represented as the daughter of Saturn and Rhea. She married Jupiter, but was not the most complaisant of wives; for, according to Homer, that god was sometimes obliged to make use of all his authority to keep her in due subjection; and the same author observes, that on her entering into a conspiracy against him, he punished her by suspending her in the air with two anvils fastened to her feet, and golden manacles on her hands, whilst all the other deities looked on without a possibility of helping her. However, her jealousy made her frequently find opportunities of interrupting her husband in the course of his amours, and prompted her to punish with unrelenting fury Europa, Semele, Io, Latona, and the rest of his mistresses. Juno, as the queen of heaven, preserved great state. Her usual attendants were Terror and Boldness, Castor, Pollux, and fourteen nymphs; but her most faithful follower was the beautiful iris, or the rainbow. Homer describes her as riding in a chariot adorned with precious stones, the wheels of which were of ebony, and which was drawn by horses with reins of gold. But she is more commonly painted as drawn by peacocks. She was represented in her temple at Corinth seated upon a throne, with a crown on her head, a pomegranate in one hand, and in the other a sceptre with a cuckoo on its top. This statue was of gold and ivory. Some mythologists suppose that Juno signifies the air; and others, that she was the Egyptian Isis, who, being represented under various figures, was by the Greeks and Romans represented as so many distinct deities.
