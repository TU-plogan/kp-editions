JUVENCUS, Caius Vecticus Aquilinus, one of the first of the Christian poets, was born of an illustrious family in Spain. About the year 320 he put the life of Jesus Christ into Latin verse, of which he composed four books. In this work he followed closely the text of the evangelists; but his verses are written in bad taste and in worse Latin.
