JOVIUS, Paul, in Italian Giovio, a celebrated historian, was born at Como, in Italy, in the year 1483. As his father died in his infancy, he was educated by his eldest brother Benedict Jovius, under whom he became well skilled in classical learning; and then went to Rome for the sake of enjoying the benefit of the Vatican library. He there wrote his first work, De Piscibus Romanis, which he dedicated to Cardinal Louis of Bourbon. For many years he received a pension of five hundred crowns from Francis I. king of France, whose favour he secured by his flatteries. But, in the following reign, having disgusted the Constable Montmorency, his name was struck out of the list of pensioners. Jovius, however, did not suffer his spirits to sink under his misfortune. He had obtained a high reputation in the learned world by his writings; and having always showed great respect to the house of Medicis, on whose praises he had expatiated in his works, he applied to Clement VII. and obtained the bishoprick of Nocera. His principal production is his History, which is that of his own time, beginning with 1494, and extending to the year 1544. The composition of this work constituted the chief business of his life. For he formed the plan of it in the year 1515, and continued to labour upon it till his death, which happened at Florence in 1552. It is printed in three volumes folio. Jovius is allowed to have been a man of wit as well as learning; he was master of a polished style, and has made many curious observations; but being a venal writer, his statements are not much credited.
