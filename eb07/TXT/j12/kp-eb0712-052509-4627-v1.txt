JAROSLAW, a government of European Russia, formerly in the province of Moscow, to the eastward of Twer, extending over 15,202 square miles. It comprehends twelve cities or towns, 554 parishes, 7705 villages, and 1,022,900 inhabitants. It is an elevated level district. The soil is generally marshy, but mixed with portions of sandy or clayey land. It is miserably cultivated, and though all the population are chiefly occupied in agriculture, it scarcely produces sufficient corn (chiefly rye and barley) for their subsistence. Both hemp and flax succeed tolerably well; and the conversion of these into the various kinds of linen is a means of affording to the inhabitants of the towns occupation and subsistence. The hides of their cattle also form a branch of employment to the people, as does the fishery on the rivers and lakes. The river Wolga enters the province from Twer, and receives the waters of numerous streams that flow through it. There is a lake of eight miles in length and three in breadth, called Rostow, out of which the Kotorosla runs to the Wolga; and thirty-six smaller lakes, all, like the streams, abounding in fish. The Wolga is navigable in its whole progress through the province, as are also the Mologa and the Scheksna, which run into it. The province is divided into ten circles. The capital, Jaroslaw, is also that of the circle of the same name. It stands at the junction of the Kotorosla with the Wolga. It has no other fortification than palisades, but is defended by a fortress. It contains forty-four churches, several convents and hospitals, 2754 houses, and 24,200 inhabitants, whose chief subsistence arises from the linen trade, and Russia leather. Long. 30. 4. 55. E. Lat. 57. 57. 30. N.

Jarosław, a city in the circle of Przemysl, in the Austrian kingdom of Gallicia, and situated on the river San. It contains a minster and six other churches, for Catholics, Greeks, and Protestants, with 1400 houses, and 6975 inhabitants, occupied in linen and woollen manufactures, and in distilleries. It was a part of the ancient kingdom of Poland, and is still the property of Prince Adam Czartoryski, a nobleman of the country. Long. 22. 47. E. Lat. 49. 59. N.
