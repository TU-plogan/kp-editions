JACK, in Mechanics, a well-known instrument, of common use for raising great weights of any kind. The common kitchen-jack is a compound engine, where weight is the power applied to overcome the friction of the parts and the weight with which the spit is charged; and a steady and uniform motion is obtained by means of the fly.

Jack, in nautical language, a sort of flag or colours, displayed from a mast erected on the outer end of a ship’s boltsprit. In the British navy the jack is nothing more than a small union flag, composed of the intersection of the red and white crosses; but in merchant ships this union is bordered with a red field.

Jack is also used for a horse or wooden frame to saw timber upon; for an instrument to pull off a pair of boots; for a great leathern pitcher to carry drink in; for a small bowl that serves as a mark at the exercise of bowling; and for a young pike.

ĴACK-Daw, the English name of a species of corvus. See Ornithology.
