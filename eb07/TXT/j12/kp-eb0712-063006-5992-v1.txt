JUMNA. This celebrated river takes its rise in the Himalaya Mountains, probably on the southern side, where the Ganges has its rise, though its source has never been accurately explored. It flows through the province of Scrinagur, in a southern direction, in a line nearly parallel to the Ganges, from whieh, at the village of Gurud-war, in latitude 32. 22. north, it is only forty miles distant, and is between 200 and 300 yards broad, after emerging from the mountains. The Jumna enters Hindustan in the province of Delhi, and directs its course, at the distance of sixty or seventy miles, in a parallel line to that of the Ganges, until, after passing the cities of Delhi and Agra, it falls into the Ganges at Allahabad, in which, as the holier and rather the larger stream, its name is absorbed. The length of the stream, including its windings, is estimated at 780 miles. The Jumna is only useful as a military barrier to the British territories during the rainy season, when all field operations are impracticable. At this period it may be navigated by flat-bottomed boats of considerable burden; but at other times it is of no utility to commerce. Above its junetion with the Chumbul, or ten miles below the fort of Ľtayeh, it is fordable, except for a few weeks during the rainy season. From Calpee to its junction with the Ganges there is no obstruction, and only one place where, in the dry season, the passage is rendered difficult by a bank of limestone. It is mentioned by Bishop Heber that its waters act on strangers like the Cheltenham waters.
