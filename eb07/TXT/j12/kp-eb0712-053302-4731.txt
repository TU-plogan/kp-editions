JAXT, one of the circles into which the kingdom of Wirtemberg is divided. It is 2112 square miles in extent, and comprehends thirty-one cities, thirty-five markettowns, and 1608 small villages and hamlets, with 336,000 inhabitants, who are chiefly Lutherans, but intermixed with some Catholics and Jews. It is subdivided into fourteen bailiwicks. It is a mountainous district, but none of the elevations exceed 2200 feet. It is the source of several rivers, some of which run to the Rhine, and others to the Danube. It is a fruitful province, and better cultivated than most parts of Germany; and it yields abundant crops of wheat, summer and winter barley, rye, oats, potatoes, hemp, flax, and rape-seed. A r ineyards are numerous, and produce excellent wine. Its mineral products are iron, vitriol, marble, and alum, and abundance of salt is prepared from natural saline springs. The breed of cattle is good, and forms a part of its exports to France. There are manufactories, chiefly of linen. On the whole, this is the most prosperous circle of the whole kingdom.
