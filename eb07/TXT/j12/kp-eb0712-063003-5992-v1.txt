JULIUS Caesar. See Caesar. Julius II. a pope, remarkable for bis warlike disposition, and his political negotiations. By the latter, he induced the principal powers of Europe to unite with him against the republie of Venice, in the confederacy called the league of Cambray, signed in 1508. The Venetians having purchased peace by the cession of part of Romania, Julius turned bis arms against Louis XII. king of France, and appeared in person, armed cap-á-pied, at the siege of Mirandola, which place he took by assault in 1511. But proceeding to excommunicate Louis, the king wisely turned his own weapons against him, by calling a general council at Pisa. The pope having refused to appear, was declared to be suspended from the holy see; and Louis, in his turn, excommunicated the pontiff, who died soon afterwards, in the year 1512. He built the famous church of St Peter at Rome, and was a patron of the polite arts.
