JUS Deliberandi, in Scotch Law, that right which an heir has, by law, of deliberating for a certain time whether he will represent his predecessor.

Jus Devolutum, in Scotch Law, the right of the church to present a minister to a vacant parish, in the event of the patron neglecting to exercise that right within the time limited by law.

Jus Mariti, in Scotch Law, the right which the husband acquires to his wife’s moveable estate, in virtue of the marriage.

Jus Relictoe, in Scotch Law, the right which the wife has in the goods in communion, in case of the previous decease of the husband.

Jus Preventionis, in Scotch Law, the preferable right of jurisdiction acquired by a court, in any cause to which other courts are equally competent, by having exercised the first act of jurisdiction.

Jus Civile, amongst the Romans, signified no more than the interpretation given by the learned, of the laws of the Twelve Tables, though the phrase is now extended to the whole system of the Roman laws.

Jus Civitatis signifies the freedom of the city of Rome, which entitled those persons who had obtained it to most of the privileges of Roman citizens; yet it differed from the Jus Quiritium, which extended to all the advantages which a free native of Rome was entitled to. The difference, in fact, was much the same as that between denization and naturalization with us.

Jus Honorarium was a name given to those Roman laws which were made up of edicts of the supreme magistrates, particularly the praetors.

Jus Imaginis was the right of using pictures and statues amongst the Romans, and had some resemblance to the right of bearing a coat of arms amongst us. This honour was allowed to none but those whose ancestors or [7:12:653] themselves had borne some curule office, that is, had been Curule Aedilc, Censor, Prcetor, or Consul.

The use of statues or pictures, which the Jus Imaginis conferred, was that of exhibiting them in funeral processions.

Jus Papirianum included the laws of Romulus, Numa, and other kings of Rome, collected into a body by Scxtus Papirius, who lived in the time of Tarquin the Proud.

Jus Trium Liberorum was a privilege granted to such persons in the city of Rome as had three children, by which they were excmptcd from all troublesome offices. The same exemption was granted to any person who lived in other parts of Italy having four children; and those who lived in the provinces, provided they had five, or, as some say, seven children, were entitled to the same immunity.
