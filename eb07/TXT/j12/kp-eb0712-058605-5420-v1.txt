JIONPOOR, or Joanpore, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Allahabad, included principally between the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth degrees of north latitude. It is situated between the river Gogra on the east, and the Ganges on the south; to the north it is bounded by the Gogra and part of Oude; and on the west it has the nabob of Oude’s territories. It is well watered, and extremely fertile; and the soil is under good cultivation, and well covered with wood. The inhabitants are Mahommedans and Hindus, in nearly equal proportions. Of the Hindus there was one tribe amongst whom the practice of female infanticide greatly prevailed; but, by the humane influence of the British government, it has been in a great measure abolished. This district came into the possession of the British in 1775, as forming part of the Benares zemindary. The principal towns are Jionpoor, Gazypoor, and Azimgar.

Jionpoor, the chief town in the above district, and formerly the capital of an independent principality. It is situated upon the banks of the Goomty. The fort, which is built of solid stone-work, was rounded in 1370, by Sultan Feroze III. of Delhi, and named after his uncle and predecessor, whose name was Joana. He ordered a Hindu temple to be levelled, and erected the fort around the ruins of it. After his return to the capital, he collected numerous artificers, and persons of every description, and sent them to inhabit the new city, which was completed in twelve years. On the subversion of the empire of Delhi by Timour or Tamerlane, Khuaje Jehan, a governor of the eastern districts, assumed the royal dignity, and he made Jionpoor his capital. He was succeeded in 1399 by his son Moba-rik Shah, whose successor was Sultan Ibrahim. During his prosperous reign of forty years he spared no expense to strengthen and improve the fortress and city, and Jionpoor became one of the most celebrated cities of Hindustan, famed for religion and learning. J ionpoor was again annexed to the empire of Delhi in the year 1478, when the reigning prince was overthrown. Many of the mosques, and some of the caravanserais and colleges built at that period, are still in existence. The fortress is built upon a high bank of the river Goomty, so named from its meandering course. It is built of solid stone, and rises considerably above the level of the surrounding country. It was frequently taken in the contests between the Afghans and the Moguls, and much dilapidated; but about the year 1570 it was thoroughly repaired by a nobleman from the court of Akbar, who was governor of Bengal. It was also during his time that the celebrated bridge of Jionpoor was built, which has now stood 250 years, and still remains a monument of ancient magnificence and of architectural skill. In 1773, when this bridge was submerged during the rainy season, a brigade of British troops sailed over it. Such is the strength and solid construction of this bridge, that it suffered no damage from the violence of the current. The town surrounds the fort on three sides, and contains a good bazar and a number of brick houses. The surrounding country for several miles is covered with the ruins of tombs and mosques. Of the latter there are several in a good state of repair, namely, the Jamai Musjed, which is very handsome, and is built of stone. The travelling distance from Benares is forty-two miles, and from Lucknow 147 miles. Long. 82. 39. E. Lat. 25. 45. N.
