JABLONSKI, Daniel-Ernest, a learned Polish protestant divine, was born at Dantzig, on the 20th of November 1660. He commenced his studies at the gymnasium of Lissa, then attended the academical course of the university of Frankfort, and, after taking his degrees, visited Holland and England, in which last country he remained a year to hear the prelections of the Oxford professors. On his return he became successively minister of Magdeburg, Lissa, Köningsberg, and Berlin; and was at length appointed ecclesiastical counsellor, and president of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin. He took great pains to effect an union between the Lutherans and Calvinists, and wrote some works which are esteemed. He died in 1741. His works consist of, LA German and Hebrew Catechism, 1 r 7^08, in 4to; 2. Sermons in German, 1718, in 4to; 3. The History of the Consensus of Sendomir, in Latin, 1730; 4. Different writings, in Latin and German, in favour of the Protestants of Poland, amongst which may be mentioned, Afflicted Thorn, or a Relation of what passed in that City since the 16th of July 1724, of which there is a French translation by Beausobre, Amsterdam, 1726, in I2mo, now very rare.

Jablonski, Paul-Ernest, was the son of Daniel-Ernest, and, like his father, entered the clerical profession, but distinguished himself much more in that of instruction, and particularly in the study of the oriental literature and antiquities. Born at Berlin in the year 1695, he received his academical education at the university of Frankfort-on-the-Oder; and such was his progress in the study of the Coptic, that he even surpassed his master, the celebrated Lacroze. In 1714, being then only twenty-one years of age, he obtained permission to travel, at the king’s expense, throughout the greater part of Europe, in order to extend his knowledge of that language. He visited the rieh libraries of Oxford, Leyden, and Paris, and made ample extracts from all the Coptic manuscripts wdιich were then contained in these collections. On his return to his own country, he was appointed pastor of Liebenberg, in the Middle March, in 1720; professor of philosophy in 1721; ordinary professor of theology at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, and pastor of the Reformed or Calvinistic congregation of the same city, in 1722; and, not long afterwards, member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin. This learned antiquary and orientalist died on the 13th of September 1757, after having published more than fifty works, of which a list may be found in the Dictionary of Meusel. Of these the principal are, 1. Disquisitio de Lingua Ly-caonica, Berlin, 1714, in 4to; 2. Thirty-nine Letters full of erudition, in the Thesaurus Epistolic. Lacrozianus, tom. i. p. 163 et seqq.; 3. Exercitatio Historico-theologica de Nestorianismo, Berlin, 1724, in 8vo; 4. Remphah Egyptiorum Deus ab Israëlitis in deserto cultus, Frankfort, 1731, in 8vo; 5. Dissertationes Academicae viii. de terra Gosen, ibid. 1735, 1736, in 4to; 6. De ultimis Pauli Apostoli laboribus a B. Luca praetermissis, ibid. 1746, in 4to; 7. Pantheon Aegyptiorum, sive de Diis eorum Commentarius, cum Prolegomenis de Religione et Theologia Aegyptiorum, ibid. 1750, 1752, in 3 vols. 8vo; 8. De Memnone Graecorum et Aegyptiorum, hujusque celeberrima in Thebaide statua, ibid. 1753, in 4to, with figures; 9. Institutiones Historiae Christian® antiquioris, ibid. 1754, in 8vo; 10. Institutiones Historiae Christian® recentioris, ibid. 1756, in 8vo; 11. Remarks on the Canon of the Kings of Thebes, by Eratosthenes, inserted in the Chronology of Devignoles; 12. Different Memoirs or Extracts in the Miscellanea Beroliηensia,, the Nova Miscellanea Lipsiensia, and other periodical collections; and, 13. Opuscula quibus Lingua et Antiquitas Aegyptiorum, difficilia Librorum Sacrorum loca, et Historiae Ecclesiastic® capita illustrantur, magnam partem nunc primum in lucem protracta, edidit Jan. Gulielm. Te-Water, Leyden, 1804, 1813, in 4 vols. 8vo.

Of all the works of Jablonski, undoubtedly the most important is his Pantheon Aegyptiorum, and it is also the most complete treatise we possess on the subject to which it relates. For, although subsequent investigations, and monuments recently discovered, may have shed new light on different matters of detail, the estimation in which the work as a whole is held by the learned has noton that account been diminished. But, to peruse it with advantage, the reader should begin with the Prolegomena, which are commonly annexed to the second or third volume. Jablonski had commenced this work as early as the year 1720; and he is sometimes censured for having made no use of what appeared on the same subject in the interval between that year and the date of its completion. His own resources, however, were great; and although the general table at the end of the third volume occupies twenty-nine pages, some critics have found it of too limited extent in proportion to the variety of materials and the vast erudition displayed in the work. Jablonski is merely the translator into Latin of what relates to the worship of the sacred animals; he acknowledges, indeed, that this piece had been furnished to him by a lady of high rank, “matrona perillustris, non natalium magis et dignitatis splendore quam virtute incomparabili et rarae doctrinae inclyta ;” but he gives no information whieh can enable us to ascertain who this distinguished female really was. His treatise on the Memnon of the Greeks and Egyptians, and on the celebrated statue in the Thebaid, is a sort of sequel to the Pantheon, and, like it, is full of erudition. In his dissertation on the Egyptian god Remphah, worshipped by the lsraelites in the desert, he proves, from Egyptian and Coptic monuments, what the very name of the god might have led him to infer, that Reιn-phah is the same with the Sun, which, in Egyptian, is denominated Ra, Ré, and Phré. To the student of Egyptian antiquities, and particularly of Coptic, the Opuscula present many recommendations, not only as being a collection of valuable pieces, some of which had been published separately, whilst others had remained in manuscript, and all equally inaccessible to scholars generally, but also as containing the fruits of the author’s mature labours, especially a valuable glossary of Egyptian words, whether found in the Bible or in the ancient Greek and Latin authors. The treatise on the Statue of Memnon [7:12:493] has been translated into French by Μ. Langles, who has inserted it, with several additions, in the second volume of his translation of the Travels of Norden. (a.) Jablonski, Theodore, counsellor of the court of Prussia, and secretary of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was also a man of distinguished merit. He loved the sciences, and did them honour, without that ambition which is generally observable in men of learning; and it was owing to this modesty that the greatest part of his works were published without his name. He published, in 1711, a French and German Dictionary; in 1713, a Course of Morality; a Dictionary of Arts and Sciences in 1721; and translated Tacitus de Moribus Germanorum into High Dutch in 1724.
