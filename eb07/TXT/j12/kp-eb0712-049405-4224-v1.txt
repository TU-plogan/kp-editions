JAGEPOOR, a large straggling town of Hindustan, in the province of Cuttack, situated on the south side of the Byturnee River, which is here nearly half a mile broad. It is the chief town of a principality of the same name, and has a manufacture of cotton cloths. Here formerly resided an independent rajah, who, in the year 1243, repelled the Afghans from his territory, and, pursuing them into Bengal, laid siege to Gour, the ancient capital of that country. They were again totally defeated in the year 1263. We have no certain account of the time when this country fell into the power of the Mahommedans, by whom it was possessed until it was conquered by the Mahrattas. During the period of the Mogul government it was a place of some consequence, and the remains of several Mahommedan mosques and other edifices are still visible. In the year 1751 it was ceded to the Mahrattas, under whose government it has declined; but it will probably recover, since the province has been subjected to the authority of Britain. Long. 86. 35. E. Lat. 20. 50. N.
