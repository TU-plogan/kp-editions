JONKOPING, a province in the south of Sweden, extending over 4804square miles, and situated between 56. 56. and 58. 9. of north latitude, and 13. 9. and 15. 36. of east longitude. It is a mountainous and rocky district; but in the cultivated parts produces corn sufficient for food, and tolerable crops of potatoes, hemp, flax, and buck-wheat. The mines produce a little gold and silver, and considerable portions of iron and copper. The woods are extensive, and furnish deals, pitch, tar, and potash for exportation. It is divided into six bailiwicks or circles, comprehending three towns or cities, 4029 farming or mining establishments, and 121,250 inhabitants, who are remarkable for their sprightly cheerfulness, and especially for their activity. Jonkoping, the capital of the province, is a city on the Lake of Wetter, and close to two smaller lakes. It is well and regularly built, the court of justice and guildhall being of stone. It contains three churches, 608 houses, and 3145 inhabitants. A detachment of artillery is fixed here, with its laboratory and stores.
