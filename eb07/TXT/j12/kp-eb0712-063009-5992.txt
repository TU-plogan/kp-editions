JUNCTURE, a joining or closing of two bodies. Seo Joint.
[7:12:631]

Juncture, in Oratory, is a part of composition particularly recommended by Quintilian, and denotes such an attention to the nature of the vowels and consonants, in the connection of words, with reference to their sound, as will render their pronunciation most easy and pleasant, and best promote the harmony of the sentence. Thus the coalition of two vowels, occasioning a hollow and obscure sound, and likewise of some consonants, rendering it harsh and rough, should be avoided; nor ought the same syllable to be repeated at the beginning and end of words, because thereby the sound becomes harsh and unpleasant. The first verse in Virgilâ€™s Aeneid is an example of juncture.
