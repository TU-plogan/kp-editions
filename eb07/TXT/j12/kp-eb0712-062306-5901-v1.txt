JUAN FERNANDEZ, an island in the South Pacific Ocean, about one hundred and ten leagues west of Chili, of which it may be considered an appendage, the governor of it being appointed by the president of that republic. It is about twelve miles in length, and hardly six in breadth; but, though small, it is so diversified by lofty hills, streams, and varied vegetation, that it has been described as one of the most enchanting spots upon the sea. It abounds with excellent timber trees, amongst which are the sandal, the yellow wood, and the chon ta, a species of palm, which produces a pleasant fruit. It is noted for the refreshments it has afforded to navigators, from its wild goats, vegetables, and water. This island was discovered by Juan Fernandez, from whom it derived its name, and was early settled from the continent of South America. After the death of the discoverer it was deserted, but subsequently the Spaniards made a permanent establishment on it, and settled the port called Juan Fernandez on the south-west coast. There is another port lying to the south, which is called English Harbour, from the circumstance of its having given shelter to Anson’s squadron during his celebrated voyage round the world. It was also early noted for having been the solitary residence for several years of Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch mariner, who was cast away upon it; an event upon which, as is well known, De Foe founded his celebrated narrative of Robinson Crusoe. Long. 78. 58.15. W. Lat. 33. 40. 0. S.

Juan de Ulloa, or the island of Sacrifices, is an island on the west coast of Mexico, in the bay of Vera Cruz. It was first visited by Grijalva, who gave it its name from having found on it a temple in which a human sacrifice had been offered up the day previous to his landing. It is now a mere heap of sand, but there are vestiges of ruins upon it; and when Humboldt was in this quarter of the world, one wretched Indian family constituted its only inhabitants.

Juan Dlanco, or White Jack, a Spanish name for platina.
