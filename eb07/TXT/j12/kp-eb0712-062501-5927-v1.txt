JUDAISM, the religious doctrines and rites of the Jews. Judaism was but a temporary dispensation, and destined to give way, at least the ceremonial part of it, at the coming of the Messiah. For a complete system of Judaism, it is only necessary to refer to the books of Moses. Judaism was anciently divided into several sects, the principal of which were the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenians. At present there are but two sects amongst the Jews, viz. the Caraites, who admit of no rule of religion but the law written by Moses; and the Rabbinists, who add to the law the traditions of the Talmud.
