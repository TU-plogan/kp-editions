JABESH, or Jabesh Gilead, was the name of a city in the half tribe of Manasseh, beyond Jordan. The Scripture calls it generally Jabesh Gilead, because it lay in Gilead, at the foot of the mountains which go by this name. Eusebius places it six miles from Pella, towards Gerasa; and hence it must have been to the eastward of the Sea of Tiberias.
