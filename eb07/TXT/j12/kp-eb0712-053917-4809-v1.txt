JEMAULABAD, a town and fortress in the south of India, province of Canara, which was originally called Narasingha Augady. The first, which was built by Tippoo, stands on the summit of an immense rock, which may be deemed impregnable, as it is wholly inaccessible except by one narrow way. The nature of the access to it, however, renders the approach to it in the face of an enemy nearly as difficult as the ascent; so that a very small body of men with artillery are adequate to blockade a strong garrison, which renders the place of little use, excepting as a safeguard for treasure or records. After the fort was built by Tippoo, he placed in it a khiladar or commandant, with a garrison of 400 men; and the town at that time contained 1000 houses, and carried on a considerable trade. On the invasion of Mysore, the Coorg rajah destroyed the town, and carried away half the inhabitants; the remainder made their escape into the woods, and only about twenty houses have since been rebuilt. After the fall of Seringapatam, it sustained a siege of six weeks from the British, when, being bombarded, it was taken, and, the commander having poisoned himself, his principal officers were hanged. It was afterwards surprised and taken by a band of insurgents or plunderers, when it was reduced, after a blockade of three months, and all that did not escape were summarily executed. The surrounding country is woody. Long. 75. 24. E. Lat. 13. N.
