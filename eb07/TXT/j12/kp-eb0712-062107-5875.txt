JORDANO, Lucca, an eminent Italian painter, was born at Naples in the year 1632. He became early a disciple of Ribera; but going afterwards to Rome, he attached himself to the manner of Pietro da Cortona, whom he assisted in his great works. Some of his pictures being seen by Charles II. king of Spain, he engaged him to paint the Escurial, in which task he acquitted himself as a great painter. The king having shown him a picture of Bassani, expressing his concern that he had not a companion, Lucca painted one so exactly in Bassaniâ€™s manner, that it was considered as a performance of that master; and for this service he was knighted, and gratified with several honourable and valuable employments. The works he had executed in [7:12:622]Spain raised his reputation so high when he returned to Naples, that, though he was a very quick workman, he could not supply the eager demands of the citizens. No one, not even Tintoret, ever painted so much as Jordano; and bis generosity carried him so far as to present altarpieces to churches that were not able to purchase them. His labours were rewarded with great riches, which he left to his family at his death, which took place in 1705.
