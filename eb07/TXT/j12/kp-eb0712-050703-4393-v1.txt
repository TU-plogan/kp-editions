JAMTLAND, a province in the north of Sweden, extending over 17,732 square miles, and bounded on the west by Norway, and on the other sides by Swedish provinces. It is mountainous, as there are five chains of alpine elevations that cross it from west to east, several of whose points are 7000 feet in height. Through some of these ranges routes have been opened, which are still passed with difficulty, from their steepness and ruggedness. Between the ranges are some valleys, which would be fruitful but for the severity of the climate, which is an impediment to the growth of any corn besides oats, with which the inhabitants often mix the bark of the pine-trees to make their bread. The chief nourishment of the inhabitants is supplied by the dairy and the fisheries, but chiefly by the latter. The province yields abundance of timber, and some supplies of copper, lead, iron, and alum. It has but two towns, both small; Ostersund.is the capital, with only 200 inhabitants. The whole population is about 32,000 persons. It is between latitude 61. 39. and 65. 6. north.
