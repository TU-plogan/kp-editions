JEDO, or Jeddo, a large city of Japan, the residence of the emperor, and the capital of the country, as it is by much the largest city of the empire, from the resort of princes and lords, who, with their numerous families and servants, swell the train of the imperial court. It is situated in the province of Musasi, in 35. 32. of north latitude, on a large plain at the end of the gulf, which is so shallow, with a muddy clay at the bottom, that no ships of any considerable size can come up to the city, but must be unladen aleague or two below it. According to the Japanese accounts, the city is seven miles long, five broad, and twenty in circumference. It is not enclosed with a wall, but is intersected by many broad ditches and canals, with high ramparts raised on both sides, on the top of which are planted rows of trees. A large river, rising to the west of the city, runs through it, and loses itself in the harbour. It sends off a branch, which divides itself into five channels, over each of which is a stately bridge. Jedo is not so regularly built as most other cities of Japan, though in some parts, which have been burnt down and rebuilt, the streets cross each other at right angles. The houses are small and low, being built of wood, with thin clayed walls, divided within into rooms by paper screens, the floors covered with fine mats, the roofs with shavings of wood. They consist entirely of combustible materials, so that we need not wonder at the havoc which fires frequently occasion. In this city are many stately palaces, the residences of the nobles and princes, who are obliged to reside six months of the year at the imperial court. They are distinguished from other houses by large court-yards and stately gates; fine varnished staircases, of a few steps, lead up to the door of the house, which is divided into several magnificent apartments, all on one floor, only one story high, and not adorned with towers, as the castles and palaces are where the· princes and lords of the empire reside in their hereditary dominions. There arc, besides, numerous temples, monasteries, and other religious buildings. The castle and residence of the emperor, which is a magnificent structure, is situated about the middle or the city. It isofan irregular figure, inclining to the circular, and is five Japanese miles in circumference. It consists of two enclosures; the innermost and third castle, which is properly the residence of the emperor; two other strong, well-fortified, but smaller castles at the sides; and some large gardens behind the imperial palace. The first and outermost castle takes in a large space of ground, which encompasses the second and half the imperial residence, and is enclosed with walls and ditches, and strong, well-guarded gates. This is the residence of the princes of the empire, with their families, who live in commodious and stately palaces, built in streets, with spacious courts shut up with strong and heavy gates. The second castle takes in a much smaller space of ground. It fronts the third, the residence of the emperor, and is enclosed by the first, but separated from both by walls, ditches, &c. Here are the stately palaces of some of the most powerful princes of the empire, the councillors of state, the prime ministers, chief officers of the crown, and such other persons as give immediate attendance on the emperor. The castle where the emperor himself resides is enclosed with a thick, strong wall of freestone, having bastions standing out, much after the manner of the European fortifications. On the top of this wall are erected several long buildings and square guard-houses,built in the form of towers, and several stories in height. Those on the side where the imperial residence is are all of freestone of an extraordinary size. It is adorned with a square tower, raised many stories high, adorned with beautiful bended roofs, gilt dragons at the top and corners, and many other fantastical ornaments. The second castle is very small, and more like a citadel; and the third lies on the side of the second, and is of much the same structure. In these two castles are bred the imperial princes and princesses. The rising ground behind the imperial residence is beautified with gardens and magnificent orchards. The palace itself is only of one story, but it is of great height, and contains many long galleries and spacious rooms, which, on removing the screens, may be narrowed or enlarged as occasion requires. The structure of all the interior apartments is fine, according to the fashion of the country; the ceilings, beams, and pillars are of cedar, or camphire, or a peculiar sort of wood, which runs into flowers and other curious figures, and is in some apartments covered only with a thin transparent layer of varnish, in others japanned, or curiously carved with birds and branched work neatly gilt. The floor is covered w-ith the finest white mats, bordered with gold fringes or bands; and this is all the furniture to be seen in the emperor’s palace. There are two strong rooms, in which are kept the imperial treasures. Besides being the residence of the court, and the seat of luxury, Jedo contains flourishing manufactures, and carries on an extensive commerce. From the combustible materials of which the houses are formed, it is liable to dreadful conflagrations. One that occurred in 1703 is supposed to have consumed 100,000 houses. Long. 140. E.
