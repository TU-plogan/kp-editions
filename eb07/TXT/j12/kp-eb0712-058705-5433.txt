JOANA, a town on the northern coast of the island of Java, formerly fortified. It is situated a few miles inland, on the river Joana, along which it extends about a mile. The surrounding country yields rice, timber, and the natives are employed in spinning cotton. The river on which the town is situated is the longest and deepest in the country. It flows out of a deep lake, to which it is navigable by boats; and it has several branches, one of which communicates with Samarang.
