JANUS, in the heathen worship, the first king of Italy, who, it is said, received Saturn into his dominions, after he was driven from Arcadia by Jupiter. He tempered the manners of his subjects, and taught them civility; and from him they learned to improve the vine, to sow corn, and to make bread. After his death he was adored as a god. This deity was thought to preside over new undertakings. Hence, in all sacrifices, the first libations of wine and wheat were offered to Janus; all prayers were prefaced with a short address to him; and the first month of the year was dedicated to and named from him. Janus was represented with two faces, either to denote his prudence, or that he views at once the past and approaching years. He had a sceptre in his right hand, and a key in his left, to signify his extensive authority, and his invention of locks. Though this is properly a Roman deitv, the Abb√© la Pluche represents it as derived from the Egyptians, who made known the rising of the dog-star, which opened their solar year, with an image having a key in its hand, and two faces, the one old and the other young, to typify the old and new year.

Temple of Janus, in ancient history, a square building at Rome, erected by Romulus, and so large as to contain a statue of Janus five feet high, with brazen gates on each side, which were always kept open in time of war, and shut in time of peace. But the Romans were so much engaged in war, that this temple was shut only twice from the foundation of Rome till the reign of Augustus, and six times afterwards.
