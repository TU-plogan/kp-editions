JOB, or Booh of Job, a canonical book of the Old Testament, containing a narrative of a series of misfortunes which happened to a man whose name was Job, as a trial of his virtue and patience; together with the conferences which he had with [his friends on the subject of his misfortunes, and the manner in which he was restored to ease and happiness. This book is filled with those noble, and elevated, and figurative expressions, which constitute the essence of poetry.

Many of the Jewish rabbin pretend that this relation is altogether fictitious; and others think it a simple narrative of a matter of fact just as it happened; whilst a third class of critics acknowledge that the groundwork of the story is true, but that it is written in a poetical strain, and decorated with peculiar circumstances, to render the narrative more profitable as well as entertaining. The time in which Job lived is not mentioned. It has been thought that he was much more ancient than Moses, because the law is never cited by Job or his friends, and because it is related that Job himself offered sacrifices. Some imagine that this book was written by himself; others are of opinion that Job wrote it originally in Syriac or Arabic, and that Moses translated it into Hebrew; but the rabbin generally held that Moses was the author of it, and many Christian writers are of the same opinion.
