JUBA, king of Numidia, who succeeded to the throne on the death of his brother Hiempsal, about b. c. 50. In the war between Caesar and Pompey, we find Juba espousing the cause of the latter, and proceeding to the assistance of Varus, who was besieged in Utica by Curio. He gained a victory over Curio; and when many of the partisans of Caesar had surrendered to Varus, on condition of their lives being preserved, Juba, disregarding the promise made to them, put thegreater parttodeath. (Caes.Zte Bello Civili, ii. 26, 42.) After the battle of Pharsalia, Caesar proceeded into Africa to crush the remains of Pompeyâ€™s party; but Juba, thinking this a favourable opportunity of destroying the troops of his opponent, collected a large army. He was soon, however, obliged to retire to the protection of his dominions, which were threatened by Sittius, the chief of a band of banditti. Appointing Sabura to the command of the troops against Sittius, he proceeded to rejoin Scipio at the head of a numerous army. The pride of Juba could not tolerate that Scipio should wear a purple cloak like his own, and Scipio did not think proper to offend his powerful ally on such a trivial point. A battle was fought, in which Caesar defeated the allied army; and the Numidian prince fled to his own dominions, where he found Sabura had been defeated by Sittius. He wished to shut himself up inZama; but the inhabitants gained by Caesar having shut the gates of their city, Juba caused himself to be put to death (b. c. 46) by Petreius, one of his companions in misfortune (Liv. Epit. 114; Flor. iv. 2), or by a slave (Caes. Afr. 94). Caesar reduced the kingdom of Juba into the form of a province, and the historian Sallust was the first governor. (Afr. 97.)

Juba IE, the son of the former, was carried to Rome by Julius Caesar on the defeat and death of his father, and formed one of the principal ornaments of the triumph which Caesar enjoyed. At Rome the young prince received the benefit of an excellent education; and being naturally of an intelligent and thoughtful disposition, he soon equalled in learning and knowledge the wisest philosophers of Greece and Rome. (Plut. Caes. 55.) Augustus became attached to him from his excellent qualities, and gave him in marriage Selene, or Cleopatra, the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra. (Anton. 87 ) He was restored to the kingdom of his father by Augustus, and some parts of Gaetulia were added to it. The Gaetulians, unwilling to acknowledge themselves tributary to a prince imposed upon them by the Romans, made incursions into his territory, which he was unable to repel until he received assistance from Augustus. (Dion Cass. li. liii.) He was more fortunate in peace than in war, and made himself so much beloved by his subjects, that they placed him in the number of their gods, and erected statues to his honour. Pliny states, that the profound knowledge of Juba made him more illustrious than even his crown. He wrote many historical works of great value: the Antiquities of Assyria [7:12:624]and of Rome; a History of Arabia, which he dedicated to the young Caius Caesar; a History of Painting and of Painters; a History of Theatres, many fragments of which still remain; on the Nature and Qualities of different Animals; a Treatise on the Plant Euphorbia; and an Essay on the source of the Nile.
