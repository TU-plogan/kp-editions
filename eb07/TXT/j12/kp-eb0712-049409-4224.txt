JAGHIRE, a district of the Carnatic, now included in the collectorship of Chingleput. It extends northwards from Madras to the Pullicat Lake, southwards to Allum-parva, and westwards beyond Conjeveram. It is about 108 miles along shore, and forty-seven inland in the widest part, containing altogether 2440 square miles. This territory was obtained in the years 1750 and 1763, from the nabob of Arcot, in return for services rendered to him and his father by the Company; and was rented to the nabob on renewed leases until 1780, when it was taken under the management of the presidency of St George. This territory was dreadfully ravaged by Hyder Ali in 1768, and in the war of 1780; and was left in a state almost desolate, with nothing to mark its former state but the bones of those who had been massacred, or the naked walls of houses, temples, &c. A destructive famine, which succeeded, completed the ruin of the country.

Jaghire, an assignment made in Bengal by an imperial grant upon the revenue of any district, to defray civil or military charges, pensions, gratuities, and the like.
