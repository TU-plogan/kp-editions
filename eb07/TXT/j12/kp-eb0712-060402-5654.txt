JOHORE, a town of Malacca, and capital of an independent Malay principality, situated near the southern extremity of the peninsula of Malacca, twenty miles up a river of the same name. It was founded in 1511 by the inhabitants of Malacca, who fled thither on the capture of their city by the Portuguese. In 1603 Johore was also taken by the Portuguese, but rebuilt a little higher up the river. The surrounding country abounds in pepper, tin, gold, sago, and elephants’ teeth. The inhabitants bring these articles in their own prows to Prince of Wales’ Island, and receive in return opium and other goods. Long. 104. 5. E. Lat. 1. 40. N.
