HYPOGAEUM, ∙⅛oya∕ov, formed from ûwo, under, and yα∕α, earth, in the ancient architecture, is a name common to all the parts of a building which are under ground; as the cellar, butteries, and such like places. The term hy- pogocum was used by the Greeks and Romans for subterraneous tombs in which they buried their dead.

Hypogaeum, ô-roya/of, in Astrology, is a name given to the celestial houses which are below the horizon; especially the imum coeli, or bottom of heaven.
