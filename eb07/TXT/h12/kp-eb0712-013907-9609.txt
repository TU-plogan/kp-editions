HYSTERON Pkoteron, in Grammar and Rhetoric, a species of the hyperbaton, in which the proper order of construction is so inverted, that the part of any sentence which should naturally come first is placed last. Thus in Terence, Valet et vivit, for vivit et valet ; and in Virgil, Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus, for In media arma ruamus, et moriamur.

ΗΥΊΉΕ, a borough town of the county of Kent, in the parish of Saltwood, in the hundred of Horne, sixty-seven miles from London. It is one of the Cinque Ports, and as such returns one member to the House of Commons, who is chosen by about 420 voters. It consists chiefly of one long and well-built street, parallel to the shore, about a mile from the sea. In a vault under the church is a vast collection of dry human bones, which, according to tradition, are the remains of a great battle fought here between the Danes and the Britons antecedent to the Norman conquest. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1365, in 1811 to 2318, in 1821 to 2181, and in 1831 to 2287.
