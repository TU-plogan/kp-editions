HYPOTRACHELION, in Architecture, is used for a little frize in the Tuscan and Doric capital, between the astragal and annulets, and which is also called the colerin and gorgerin. The word is applied by some authors in a more general sense, to the neck of any column, or that part of its capital below the astragal.
