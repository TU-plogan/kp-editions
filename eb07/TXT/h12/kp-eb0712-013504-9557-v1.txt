HYMENAeUS, or Hymen, the god of marriage amongst the Greeks, the son of Apollo and Calliope, or of Bacchus and Venus. Others have thought that he was an Athenian youth, who disguised himself in female attire, that he might accompany his mistress to Eleusis, when she went with others to offer up sacrifice. They were seized by pirates and carried to sea; but Hymenaeus encouraged his female companions, and with their assistance put the pirates to death. The Athenians were so pleased at the rescue of their friends, that they allowed him to marry the lady of his affection, who had been refused to him [7:12:136] till that time. Hymenaeus enjoyed so much happiness from his marriage, that the Athenians invoked him solemnly at their nuptials, as the Romans did Thalassius.

He is represented by the poets as crowned with flowers, particularly with marjoram, having a flammeum (veil of a flame colour) on his head, and a torch in his hand. (Serv. Ecl. viii. 30; Aen. iv. 99, 127; Donat. Ter. Add. v. 7, 6; Lactan. Stat. Theb. iii. 283.)
