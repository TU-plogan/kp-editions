HYDROGRAPHICAL Charts or Maps, usually called sea-charts, are projections of some part of the sea or coast, for the use of navigation. In these are laid down all the rhumbs or points of the compass, the meridians, parallels, &c. with the coasts, capes, islands, rocks, shoals, shallows, &c. in their proper places and proportions.
