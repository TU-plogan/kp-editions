SUPRALAPSARIANS, in Theology, persons who hold that God, without any regard to the good or evil works of men. has resolved, by an eternal decree, supra lapsum, antecedently to any knowledge of the fall of Adam, and independently of it, to save some and to condemn others; or, in other words, that God intended to glorify his justice in the condemnation of some, as well as his mercy in the salvation of others; and for that purpose decreed that Adam should necessarily fall, and by that fall bring himself and all his offspring into a state of everlasting condemnation. These are also called antelapsaries, and are opposed to sublapsaries and infralapsaries. According to the supra-lapsarians, the object of predestination is, homo creabilis et labilis; and, according to the sublapsarians and infralapsa-rians, homo creatus el lapsus.
