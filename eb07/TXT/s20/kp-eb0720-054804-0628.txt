SPRAY, the sprinkling of the sea, which is driven from the top of a wave in stormy weather. It differs from spoon drift, as being only blown occasionaly from the broken sur face of a high wave; whereas the latter continues to fly horizontally along the sea, without intermission, during the excess of a tempest or hurricane.
