SET, or Sets, a term used by the farmers and gardeners to express the young plants of the white thorn and other shrubs, with which they used to raise their quick or quickset hedges. The white thorn is the best of all trees for this purpose; and, under proper regulations, its sets seldom fail to answer the farmerâ€™s utmost expectations.
