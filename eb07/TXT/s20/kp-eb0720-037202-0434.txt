SIZE, the name of an instrument used for finding the bigness of fine round pearls. It consists of thin pieces or leaves, about two inches in length, and half an inch in breadth, fastened together at one end by a rivet. In each of these are round holes drilled of different diameters. Those in the first leaf serve for measuring pearls from half a grain to seven grains; those of the second for pearls from eight grains or two carats to five carats; and those of the third, for pearls from six carats and a half to eight carats and a half.

Size , is also a sort of paint, varnish, or glue, used by painters and others. The shreds and parings of leather, parchment, or vellum, being boiled in water and strained, make size. This substance is much used in many trades. The manner of using size is to melt some of it over a gentle fire, and scraping as much whiting into it as will just colour it, let them be well incorporated together. After it[7:20:373] dries, melt the size again, and put more whiting and whiten the frames seven or eight times, letting it dry between each time; but before it be quite dry, between each washing with size, you must smooth and wet it over with a clean brush-pencil in fair water.
