SOHAM, a town of the hundred of Staplac, in the county of Cambridge, seventy-one miles from London. It is usually called Monks-Soham, to distinguish it from some villages of the same name near it, and from having been formerly the seat of a large Benedictine monastery. It has a charity school and a market on Saturday. The inhabitants were, in 1801, 2004; in 1811, 2386; in 1821, 2856; and in 1831, 3667.
