SIMONY, is the corrupt presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical benefice for money, gift, or reward. It is so called from the resemblance it is said to bear to the sin of Simon Magus, though the purchasing of holy orders seems to appr o ach nearer to his offence. It was by the canon law a very grievous crime; and is so much the more odi o us, because, as Sir Edward Coke observes, it is ever accompanied with perjury, the presentee being not to commit simony.
