SMITH, Sir Thomas, was born at Walden in Essex, in the year 1512. At fourteen he was sent to Queen’s College, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself so much, that ne was made Henry the Eighth’s scholar, together with John Chekc. He was chosen a fellow of his college in 1531, and appointed two years afterwards to read the public Greek lecture. The common mode of reading Greek at that time was very faulty, the same sound being given to the letters and diphthongs, ι, η, υ , ει , oι , υι . Smith and Cheke had been for some time sensible that this pronunciation was wrong; and after a good deal of consultation and research, they agreed to introduce that mode of reading which prevails at present. Smith was lecturing on Aristotle De [7:20:414] Republica, in Greek. At first he dropped a word or two at intervals in the new pronunciation, and sometimes he would stop as if he had committed a mistake, and correct himself. No notice was taken of this for two or three days; but as he repeated it more frequently, his audience began to wonder at the unusual sounds, and at last some of his friends mentioned to him what they had remarked. He owned that something was in agitation, but that it was not yet sufficiently digested to be made public. They entreated him earnestly to discover his project, He did so, and in a short time great numbers resorted to him for information. The new pronunciation was adopted with enthusiasm, and soon became universal at Cambridge. It was afterwards opposed by Bishop Gardiner the chancellor; but its superiority to the old mode was so visible, that in a few years it spread over all England.

In 1539 he travelled into foreign countries, and studied for some time in the universities of France and Italy. At Padua he took the degree of LL.D. On his return, he was admitted ad eundem at Cambridge, and was appointed regius professor of the civil law. He was useful in promoting the reformation of religion as well as of learning. Having gone into the family of the duke of Somerset the protector, during the minority of Edward the Sixth, he was employed by that nobleman in public affairs; and in 1548 he was made secretary of state, and received the honour of knighthood. While Somerset continued in office, he was sent as ambassador, first to Brussels, and afterwards to France. Upon the accession of Mary, he lost all his places, but was fortunate enough to preserve the friendship of Gardiner and Bonner. He was exempted from persecution, and was allowed, probably by their influence, a pension of L. 100. During Elizabeth’s reign he was employed in public affairs, and was thrice sent to France in the capacity of an ambassador. He died in the year 1577.

Sir Thomas Smith was a man of excellent talents, united with solid and variegated learning. He obtained a respectable place among the scholars of the age, by the publication of his epistle to the bishop of Winchester, “De recta et emendata Linguae Graecae Pronuntiatione.” Lutetiae, 1568, 4to. The same volume includes his dialogue, “De recta et emendata Linguae Anglicanae Scriptione.” But the work by which he is best known in modern times, is entitled “De Republica Anglorum: the Maner of Gouern-ment or Policie of the Realme of England.” Lond. 1583, 4to. Of this treatise, which was translated into Latin, there are many editions.

Smith, Edmund , an English poet, the only son of Mr. Neale, an eminent merchant, by a daughter of Baron Lechmere, was born in 1668. By his father’s death, he was left young to the care of Mr. Smith, who had married his father’s sister, and who treated him with so much tenderness, that at the death of his generous guardian, he assumed his name. His writings are not many, and these are scattered in miscellanies and collections. His celebrated tragedy of Phaedra and Hippolytus was acted in 1707; and being introduced at a time when the Italian opera so much engrossed the attention of the polite world, gave Mr. Addison, who wrote the prologue, an opportunity to rally the vitiated taste of the public. Notwithstanding the esteem in which it has always been held, it is perhaps rather to be considered as a fine poem than as a good play. This tragedy, with a poem to the memory of Mr. John Philips, three or four odes, with a Latin oration spoken at Oxford, In lαudem Thomae Bodleii, were published as his works by his friend Mr. Oldisworth. Mr. Smith died in 1710.
