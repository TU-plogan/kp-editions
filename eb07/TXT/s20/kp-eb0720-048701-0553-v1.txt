SOURABAYA, a large and flourishing town of Java, on the northeastern coast, and capital of a government of the same name, subordinate to that of Java. It is situated at the mouth of a river, navigable for vessels of 100 tons one mile and a half from the seashore. The harbour is one of the most convenient in the island; it is broad and spacious, secure against the violence of the sea and wind; and it is mentioned by Sir Stamford Raffles, that it may be rendered impregnable to any hostile attack.^[1. Raffles’s History of Java, vol. i. p. 12.] It is form ed by the approaching extremities of the islands of Java and Madura, which in some places are not above eighty three fathoms distance for about ten or fifteen miles. This strait is not of easy navigation, but it is marked all along by buoys; and is, besides, defended by strong batteries. One of these, a circular battery, has a commanding sweep across the Strait of Madura, which is narrowest there, being opposite to the southwest end of the island of that name. The eastern entrance being impassable for large ships, the batteries are still incomplete on that side; but the north western entrance is defended by Fort Ludowyk, distant from Gressie about six, and from Point Panka about five miles. It presents, low on the water, a hundred pieces of the finest ordnance, mounted on traversing carriages, be sides some heavy mortars. The European part of the town is separated from the Chinese part, and from the native quarter, by the river; but is connected with it by a fine drawbridge. The houses are very good, some of them elegant, particularly the newly erected country-seats of private individuals. The house of the British resident at Sim pang is a fine large building, close to the river; and near it the general hospital is unequalled in elegance and commodiousness. Sourabaya has been greatly improved within these few years, in proportion as the neighbouring town of Grossie has fallen into decay. A fine arsenal, and other extensive works, calculated for equipments on a very large scale, were formed by General Daendels at this place. Vessels are built and equipped at Sourabaya. Abundance of timber is procured from the adjoining forests, which is floated down the river that takes its rise from a large inland lake encircled with high mountains. Here is also a mint, from which silver and copper coins are issued. A new governmenthouse was begun at Sourabaya, and was designed to be a splendid edifice; but the foundation of the front range having sunk, and endangered the building, the plan was abandoned, and that part which conti nued firm was converted into storerooms. Ships from Batavia bound to China or the Philippines generally touch for refreshments at this place, especially during the northwest monsoon. The surrounding country is fertile, and shaded by thickets of bamboos, bananas, and other shrubs. The adjacent country is remarkably populous; and the villages of the Javanese, Malays, and Chinese are so populous that they appear to be a continuation of the town. Long. 112. 55. E. Lat. 7. 14½.
