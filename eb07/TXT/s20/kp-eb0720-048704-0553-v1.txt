SOUTCHEOUFOU, a large city of China, and capital of the province of Kiangnan, situated on the great canal, not far from its southern termination at Hangtcheoufou. It is one of the finest cities in China, noted for the beauty of its site, which is intersected by rivers and canals, and is compared by Europeans to Venice. This city is celebrated as an emporium of pleasure, and supplies the country with the choicest ropedancers, jugglers, and the best actors; is famed for the beauty of its females; and is, in consequence, the residence of great numbers of the rich and voluptuous Chinese. The walls are more than four leagues in compass; and the suburbs extend along the canal, which is everywhere crowded with large barks, that afford a permanent residence to many of the inhabitants. It has an extensive manufacture of brocade and embroidery; and, from the continual bustle and crowds in the streets, it has the appearance of a great centre of trade. Long. 120. E. Lat. 31. 22. N.
