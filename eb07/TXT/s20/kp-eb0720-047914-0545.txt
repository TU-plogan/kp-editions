SOOSOOHOONAN, a district in the island of Java, on the south coast, formerly extending to the north coast, and[7:20:480] including the territories of Cheribon, and the greater part of the island. It is now much fallen from its ancient gran deur, and in the last century was divided into two parts. The prince, embarrassed by the rebellion of a powerful nobleman, made a cession of his territory to the Dutch, who in return granted him half back again, under the title of Sultan. Prior to 1740 this sovereign was proprietor of all the territory to the east of Cheribon; but he lost part of his dominions in a new contest with the Dutch. The dynasty, however, still continues; and in 1813 the capital was visited by Sir Stamford Raffles, the British governor, who was graciously received.
