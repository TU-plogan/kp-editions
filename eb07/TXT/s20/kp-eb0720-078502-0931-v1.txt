STURM, John, better known by the name of Sturmius, a learned philologer and rhetorician, was born at Schleiden in Eissel, near Cologne, on the 1st of October 1507. He studied at first in his native country with the sons of Count von Manderscheid, whose receiver his father was. He afterwards pursued his study at Liege, in the college of St Jerome, and then went to Louvain in 1524. He there spent five years, three in learning and two in teaching. He set up a printing-press with Rudger Rescius, professor of the Greek tongue, and printed several Greek authors. In 1529 he went to Paris, where he was highly esteemed, and read public lectures on the Greek and Latin writers, and on logic. There he married, and kept a great number of boarders: but as he was inclined to what were called the new opinions, he was more than once in danger; and this undoubtedly was the reason why he removed to Strasburg in 1537, in order to take possession of the place offered him by the magistrates. The year following he opened a school, which became famous, and by his means obtained of Maximilian II. the privileges of a university in the year 1566. He was very well skilled in polite literature, wrote Latin with great purity, and was an able teacher. His talents were not confined to the school; for he was frequently intrusted with deputations in Germany and foreign countries, and discharged these employments with great honour and diligence. He showed extreme charity to the refugees on account of religion: he not only laboured to assist them by his advice and recommendations, but he even impoverished himself for them. He died on the 3d of March 1589, in the eighty-second year of his age, after he had been for some time blind. Although he was thrice married, he left no children. He was a learned writer, and published various works, which were found to be useful and important by his contemporaries. One of these was an edition of Cicero in nine vols. 8vo. He bestowed much labour in elucidating the rhetorical works of Aristotle, Hermogenes, and Cicero. With the view of improving the system of education, he published several treatises; one of which was frequently reprinted. It is entitled “De Literarum Ludis recte aperiendis liber.” Argent. 1538, 4to. F. A. Hallbauer edited a collection of his tracts, under the title “De Institutione Scholastica Opuscula omnia.” Jenae, 1730, 8vo. The name of Sturmius is familiar to the reader of Ascham’s epistles. He must not be confounded with John Sturm, a native of Mechlin, and physician and professor of mathematics at Louvain, who also wrote several works.
