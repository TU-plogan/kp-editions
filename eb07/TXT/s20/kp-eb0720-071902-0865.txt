STEP, in a ship, a block of wood fixed on the decks or bottom of a ship, and having a hole in its upper side, fitted to receive the heel of a mast or capstern. The steps of the main and fore masts of every ship rest upon the kelson, to which they are firmly secured by knees, bolts, or spikenails. The step of the mizen-mast usually rests upon the lower deck.
