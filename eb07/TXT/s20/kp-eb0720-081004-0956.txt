SUNNINGHILL, a parish in Berkshire, in the hundred of Cookham, twenty-two miles from London, and five miles from Staines. It is finely situated in the most delightful part of Windsor forest. It chiefly consists of elegant villas, and was once much visited on account of some mineral springs, which had great reputation in removing paralytic complaints. Besides the hill, the parish contains the liberty of Early, and the townships of Sandford and Woodley. The whole population amounted in 1811 to 1534, in 1821 to 1648, and in 1831 to 1701. A small portion of this parish is on the opposite side of the Thames, and in the county of Oxford.
