SENSE is a faculty of the soul, by which it perceives external objects by means of the impressions they make upon certain organs of the body. Sec MetaPHysIcs. common Sense is a term that has been variously used both by ancient and by modern writers. With some it has been synonymous with public sense; with others it has denoted prudence; in certain instances it has been confounded with some of the powers of taste; and, accordingly, those who commit egregious blunders with regard to decorum, saying and doing what is offensive to their company, and inconsistent with their own character, have been charged with a defect in common sense. Some men are distinguished by an uncommon acuteness in discovering the characters of others; and this talent has been sometimes called common sense, similar to which is that use of the term which makes it to signify that experience and knowledge of life which is acquired by living in society. To this meaning Quintilian refers, when speaking of the advantages of a public education. “Sensum ipsum qui communis dicitur, ubi discet, cum se a congressu, qui non hominibus solum, sed mutis quoque animalibus naturalis est, segregarit? (Lib. i. cap. 2.)

But the term common sense has in modem times been employed to signify that power of the mind which perceives truth, or commands belief, not by progressive argumentation, but by an instantaneous, instinctive, and irresistible impulse, derived neither from education nor from habit, but from nature, acting independently of our will, whenever its object is presented according to an established law, and therefore called sense; and acting in a similar manner upon all, or at least upon a great majority of mankind, and therefore called common sense. See Metaphysics. Moral Sense is a determination of the mind to be pleased with the contemplation of the affections, actions, or characters, of rational agents, which we call good or virtuous.

This moral sense of beauty in actions and affections may at first view appear strange. Some of our moralists themselves are offended at it in Lord Shaftesbury, as being accustomed to deduce every approbation or aversion from rational views of interest. It is certain that his lordship has carried the influence of the moral sense very far, and some of his followers have carried it farther. The advocates for the selfish system seem to drive their opinions to the opposite extreme; and we have elsewhere endeavoured to show that the truth lies between the contending parties. See Moral Philosophy.
