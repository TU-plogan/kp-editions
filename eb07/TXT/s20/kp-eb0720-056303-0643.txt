STANOVOI, a chain of mountains in Astatic Russia, forming a part of the great northern chain which crosses the breadth of that continent. It is of considerable height, and continues uninterrupted, though with some diminution of magnitude, to Cape Tchontchi, at the northeastern extremity of Asia; and the Aleutian and Fox Islands may be considered as in some degree a continuation of it. This chain turns to the north near the source of the Aldane, whence it runs parallel to the eastern sea or gulf of Ok hotsk, a narrow plain only intervening. Granite and porphyry are the chief materials of which these mountains con sist, though there are some of green jasper.
