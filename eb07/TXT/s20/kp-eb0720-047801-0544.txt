SOMNER, William, an eminent English antiquary, was oom at Canterbury in 1606. His first treatise was the Antiquities of Canterbury, which he dedicated to Archbishop Laud. He then applied himself to the study of the Saxon language; and having made himself master of it, he perceived that the old glossary prefixed to Sir Roger Twisdenâ€™s edition of the laws of King Henry I. printed in 1644, was faulty in many places; he therefore added to that edition notes and observations valuable for their learning, with a very useful glossary. His Treatise of Gavelkind was finished about 1648, though not published till 1660. Somner was zealously attached to King Charles 1.; and in 1648 he published a poem on his sufferings and death. His skill in the Saxon tongue led him to inquire into most of the European languages, ancient and modem. He assisted Dugdale and Dodsworth in compiling the Monastico Anglicanum. His Saxon Dictionary was printed at Oxford in 1659. He died in 1669.
