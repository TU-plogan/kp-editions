STOCKHOLM, the capital of the kingdom of Sweden, stands in the centre of the province of that name. It is built on two peninsulas, and several islands of different dimensions, which are connected by numerous bridges and ferries, and, including the water, is of great extent, being two and a quarter miles in length, and near two miles in breadth. A gτeat part of this enclosure is not covered with houses; and in many parts the rocks are interspersed among patches of land and gardens, so as to give it an appearance very different from that of any other of the European capitals. The whole is divided into ten districts, the most important of which, called the city (Stadt), is small but interesting, from being the residence of the higher classes of the inhabitants, and the site of the most prominent buildings. In this division the streets are narrow, dark, and badly paved. They run parallel to each other, and are united by cross streets; but in all of them the gutters in the middle are very repulsive to more than one sense. The houses however are large, firmly built, and not destitute of taste. The royal palace is of colossal dimensions, and erected in a noble style of architecture. Being rather elevated, it commands a view of the whole city on one side, and is surrounded with tasteful gardens on the other. Within it is contained the presence-chamber, the royal museum, a library of 30,000 volumes, the collection of the Swedish academies, a square with a monument and figure of Gustavus III., and the German church, with a tower of 120 feet in height. In the same part are also the exchange, the bank, the cabinet of coins and medals, the mint, the college of mining, and the town-hall. The royal stables are in another division. On one of the islands, forming a district, are the naval storehouses, and the hall of the admiralty. On another island, also a district, is a fort with twelve cannon and a lazaretto. On many of these districts, though each has some good buildings, the others are poor wooden houses, without taste or ornament, and destitute of cleanliness. The city is under the government of a stadtholder, with inferior officers; and under the police are organized bodies of watchmen and firemen. Here both the civil and the criminal courts are held. The ecclesiastical affairs are managed by the consistory, with a superintendent as president. Under it are fourteen pastorates of the Lutheran religion; and there are besides places of worship for German and French Calvinists, for Catholics, and for Finnish Lutherans. There are many schools both for elementary and classical learning, and also an academy of sciences, with an astronomical observatory, a society of antiquaries, and other bodies for promoting the different branches of knowledge. There are abundance of benevolent institutions, adapted to alleviate the various calamities to which mankind are subject, but especially hospitals for seamen and widows. Stockholm is the chief manufacturing place of the kingdom, and supplies silk, woollen, and cotton clothing, much linen, and also refined sugar, tobacco and snuff, pottery and china ware, glass, jewellery, brandy, and many smaller articles, but almost exclusively for domestic use. It is also the chief mart of foreign trade, to which the excellence and security of its harbour greatly contributes. About 500 or 600 vessels, of different burdens, are yearly despatched. Some of these arrive with cargoes of corn, but many in ballast. They are loaded with the excellent iron of Sweden, with copper, tar, pitch, anchors, nails, cannon, bar-steel, planks, masts, cordage, hides, leather, tiles, and in some years a large quantity of preserved herrings. The city has establishments for recreation in two theatres, several public walks, and a variety of clubs and other social assemblies. The population has been fluctuating. In 1795 it amounted to 74,378, in 1800 to 75,511, in 1805 to 72,652, in 1814 to 62,830, in 1818 to 65,474, in 1826 to 77,273, in 1832 to 79,526. Long. 17. 59. 30. E. Lat. 59. 19. 15. N.
