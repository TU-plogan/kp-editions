SUECA, a city of Spain, in the province of Valencia, and government of Alcira. It stands on the banks of the river Xucar, in a marshy soil, which, though not very favourable to health, is well adapted for the growth of rice, which is here cultivated to a great extent. In the town there is a church, with a monastery and a chapel; and it contains 700 dwellings, with 4800 inhabitants.[7:20:788]
