SERANGANI Isles, a group of small islands in the Eastern Seas, about five leagues south of Magindanao, and between the fifth and sixth degrees of north latitude. The largest island is called Hummock Isle, about thirty miles in circumference. The next in size is about twenty-five miles in circumference; and there is another of somewhat inferior dimensions. This island, which is the most westerly, is very high and of a conical form, and its northern coast is very bold. It is fertile and well cultivated, and produces most of the tropical fruits, also rice, sugar-canes, pine-apples, mangoes, sour oranges, limes, jacks, plantains, cocoa-nuts, sago, sweet potatoes, tobacco, &c. The ships that pass, trade with the inhabitants for poultry, goats, and other refreshments; and one principal article of trade is beesâ€™ wax. There is a great demand among the natives for white or printed cottons, such as loose gowns or jackets, coloured handkerchiefs, knives, razors, and bar-iron. The inhabitants are, like almost all the islanders in the Eastern Seas, addicted to piracy; and they have canoes, and also larger boats, armed with small brass cannon, with which they carry on this trade of plunder. The Dutch claimed the sovereignty over these islands, which, however, they seldom exercised.
