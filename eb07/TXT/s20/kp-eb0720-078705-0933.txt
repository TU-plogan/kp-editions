SUBMULTIPLE, in Geometry, &c. A submultiple number or quantity is that which is contained a certain number of times in another, and which, therefore, repeated a certain number of times, becomes exactly equal thereto. Thus 3 is a submultiple of 21. In this sense a submultiple coincides with an aliquot part.

Submultiple Ratio, is that between the quantity contained and the quantity containing. Thus the ratio of 3 to 21 is submultiple. In both cases submultiple is the reverse of multiple: 21, e. gr. being a multiple of 3, and the ratio of 21 to 3 a multiple ratio.
