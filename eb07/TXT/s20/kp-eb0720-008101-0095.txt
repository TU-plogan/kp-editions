SELEFKEH, the ancient Calicadnus, in Asia Minor, in the province of Caramania, situated near the mouth of a river called Ghiuk Sooyoo. The modern town is merely an assemblage of mud and wooden huts; it is, however, the residence of an aga under the governor of Cyprus. It is on the site of the ancient Seleucia, the remains of which are still to be seen scattered over a large extent of ground on the western side of the river. Here are found the remains of a theatre, with portico in front, and other large buildings. Farther on is a temple which had been converted into a Christian church, and several large Corinthian columns about four feet in diameter, a few of which are still standing. A little farther to the southward, near a marble quarry, which seems to have supplied materials for the town, is seen an extensive cemetery, containing sarcophagi of coarse workmanship; and also catacombs, which have been all opened and emptied. On all these remains are inscriptions denoting their origin and object. Near the catacombs is an enormous reservoir hewn out of the soft stone, one hundred and fifty feet by seventy-five, and thirty-five feet in depth. To the west of the town are seen the remains of a citadel. Long. S3. 35. E. Lat. 36. 20. N.
