SLEIDAN, John, an excellent German historian, born of obscure parents, in 1506, at Sleidan, a small town on the confines of the duchy of Juliers. After studying some time in his own country, together with his townsman, the learned John Sturmius, he went to France, and in[7:20:391] 1525 entered into the service of the cardinal and archbishop John du Bellay. He retired to Strasburg in 1542, where he acquired the esteem and friendship of the most considerable persons, particularly of James Sturmius, by whose advice and assistance he was enabled to write the history of his own time. He was employed in some public negociations; but the death of his wife, in 1555, plunged him into so deep a melancholy, that he entirely lost his memory, and died the year following. In 1555 came out, in folio, De Statu Religionis et Reipublicae sub Carolo Quinto, in fifteen books, from the year 1517, when Luther began to preach, to the year of its publication, and this history was]>resently translated into most of the languages of Europe. Besides this great work, he wrote, De quatuor summis Imperiis, libri tres; with some other historical and political pieces.
