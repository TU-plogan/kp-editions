SHIELDS, North, a township of the parish of Tynemouth, in the county of Northumberland, 233 miles from London and eight from Newcastle, situated on the north bank of the Tyne. It has gradually grown from a dirty fishing village to a town of great extent and wealth, from the coal trade. The population amounted in 1831 to 6744.

Shields , South, a township of the parish of Jarrow, in the county of Durham. It stands on the river Tyne, opposite to North Shields, and, like it, has risen chiefly from the coal trade, but has, besides, extensive salt-works. There are also large establishments for making glass, and for ship-building. It consists for the most part of one street, extending nearly two miles along the bank of the river. The population amounted in 1821 to 8885, and in 1831 to 9682.
