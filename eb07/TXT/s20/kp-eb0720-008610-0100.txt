SEMICOLON, in Grammar, one of the points or stops used to distinguish the several members of a sentence from each other.

The mark or character of a semicoon is (;), and it has its name from being of somewhat less effect than a colon, or as demanding a shorter pause.

The proper use of the semicoon is to distinguish the conjunct members of a sentence. Now, by a conjunct member of a sentence is meant such a one as contains at least two simple members. Whenever, then, a sentence can be divided into several members of the same degree, which are again divisible into other simple members, the former are to be separated by a semicoon. For instance, “If fortune bear a great sway over him, who has nicely stated and concerted every circumstance of an affair; we must not commit every thing, without reserve, to fortune, lest she should have too great a hold of us.”
