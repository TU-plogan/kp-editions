STAINES, a town in the hundred of Spelthorne and county of Middlesex, seventeen miles from London. It is on the left bank of the Thames, over which a stone bridge has recently been erected. Just above the bridge is the termination of the boundary of the London corporation on the river, marked by a stone, formerly by stones, from which the town takes its name. There is a good corn market on Friday, and several posting houses. The inhabitants were, in 1801, 1750; in 1811, 2042; in 1821, 1957; and in 1831, 2486.
