STERN, the posterior part of a ship. The stern is terminated above by the taffarel, and below by the counters; it is limited on the sides by the quarter-pieces, and the intermediate space comprehends the galleries and windows of the different cabins.

Stern-East, a rope used to confine the stern of a ship or boat to any wharf or jetty head, &c.

Stern -Most, in sea language, usually denotes that part of a fleet of ships which is in the rear, or farthest a-stern, as opposed to headmost.

Stern- Post, a long straight piece of timber erected on the extremity of the keel, to sustain the rudder and terminate the ship behind.

Stern- Sheets, that part of a boat which is contained between the stern and the aftmost or hindmost seat of the rowers. It is generally furnished with benches to accommodate the passengers.
