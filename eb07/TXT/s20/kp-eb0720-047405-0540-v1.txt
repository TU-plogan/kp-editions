SOLSTICE, in Astronomy, the time when the sun is in one of the solstitial points; that is, when he is at his greatest distance from the equator; thus called because he then appears to stand still, and not to change his distance from the equator for some time; an appearance owing to the obliquity of our sphere, and to which those living under the equator are strangers.

The solstices are two in each year; the aestival or summer solstice, and the hyemal or winter solstice. The summer solstice is when the sun seems to describe the tropic of cancer, which is on June 22, when he makes the longest day: the winter solstice is when the sun enters the first degree, or seems to describe the tropic of capricorn, which is on December 22, when he makes the shortest day. This is to be understood as in our northern hemisphere; for in the southern, the sun’s entrance into capricorn makes the summer solstice, and that into cancer the winter solstice. The two points of the ecliptic, at which the sun’s greatest ascent above the equator, and his descent below it, are terminated, are called the solstitial points; and a circle, supposed to pass through the poles of the world and these points, is called the solstitial colure. The summer solstitial point is in the beginning of the first degree of cancer, and is called the aestival or summer point; and the winter solstitial point is in the beginning of the first degree of capricorn, and is called the winter point. These two points are diametrically opposite to each other.
