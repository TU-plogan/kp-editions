SIMPLON, a village in Switzerland, in the canton of the Vallais, only to be noticed from giving its name to the most magnificent of the roads over the Alps. This road, which leads from Switzerland into Piedmont, was constructed by Bonaparte betwixt the years 1801 and 1806, and has been long considered as one of the noblest monuments of his genius and power. It is near seventy English miles in length, is in every part twenty-five feet in breadth, and with an ascent so gentle, only one inch and a half in six feet, that the heaviest carriage can pass down on both sides of the mountain without the necessity of applying the drag chain. It passes over several frightful precipices. It is carried through six solid rocks by means of arches called galleries, where by gunpowder a passage has been bored. Out of these the passenger steps into lovely valleys with the huts of the shepherds sprinkled on the sides, and looks through forests of pines, to behold the glaciers and the snow-toped mountains in lofty regions of the air. Some bold bridges lead over the deep fissures from one rock to another. The Italian side presents more picturesque scenery than the Swiss side, from the rocks being much more rugged. On that side, too, is the grand gallery, 690 feet in length, excavated through a granite rock, called, from a remarkable cascade near it, the gallery o f Frissinone. The greatest height which the road attains, is at the gallery of the glaciers, where trees cease to grow, being somewhat more than 6000 feet above the level of the sea, while the mountain above it rises to the height of 11,000 feet. Owing to the expences of this magnificent road being to be provided for by the governments of Sardinia and of Switzerland, several repairs have been deferred or neglected, and it has in parts fallen into decay.
