STIGMATA, in Natural History, the apertures in different parts of tile bodies of insects, communicating with the tracheae or air-vessels, and serving for the office of respiration.

Stigmata, in Antiquity, certain marks impressed on the left shoulder of the soldiers when listed.

Stigmata were also a kind of notes or abbreviations, consisting only of points disposed various ways; as in triangles, squares, crosses, &c.

Stigmata is likewise a term used among the Franciscans, to express the marks or prints of our Saviourâ€™s wounds, said to have been miraculously impressed by him on the body of their seraphic father St Francis.
