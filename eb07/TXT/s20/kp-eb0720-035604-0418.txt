SIMPSON, Thomas, professor of mathematics at the Royal Academy at Woolwich, fellow of the Royal Society, and member of the Royal Academy at Stockholm, was born at Market Bosworth in Leicestershire in 1710. His father, a stuff-weaver, taught him only to read English, and br o ught him up to his own business; but meeting with a scientific pedlar, who likewise practised fortune-telling, young Simpson by his assistance and advice left off weaving, and professed astrology. As he improved in knowledge, however, he grew disgusted with this pretended art; and renouncing it, was driven to such difficulties for the subsistence of his family, that he came up to London, where he worked as a weaver, and taught mathematics at bis spare hours. As his scholars increased, his abilities became better known, and he published his Treatise on Fluxions, by subscription, in 1737; in 1740, he published his Treatise on the Nature and Laws of Chance, and Essays in Speculative and Mixed Mathematics. After these, appeared his Doctrine of Annuities and Reversi o ns; Mathematical Dissertations; Treatise on Algebra; Elements of Geometry; Trigonometry, Plane and Spherical; Select Exercises; and his Doctrine and Application of Fluxions, which he professes to be rather a new w o rk, than a sec o nd edition of his former publication on Fluxions. In 1743, he obtained the mathematical professorship at Woolwich academy; and soon afterwards was chosen a member of the Royal Society, when the president and council, in consideration of his moderate circumstances, were pleased to excuse his admission-fees, and his giving bonds for the settled future payments. At the academy he exerted all his abilities in instructing the pupils who were the immediate objecte of his duty, as well as others whom the superior officers of the ordnance permitted to be boarded and lodged in his house. In his manner of teaching he had a peculiar and happy address, a certain dignity and perspicuity, tempered with such a degree of mildness, as engaged the attention, esteem, and friendship of his scholars. He therefore acquired great applause from his superiors in the discharge of his duty. His application and close confinement, however, injured bis health. Exercise and a proper regimen were prescribed to him, but to little purpose; for his spirits sunk gradually, till he became incapable of performing his duty, or even of reading the letters of his friends. The effects of this decay of nature were greatly increased by vexation of mind, owing to the haughty and insulting behaviour of his superior, the first professor of mathematics. This person, greatly his inferior in mathematical accomplishments, did what he could to make his situation uneasy, and even to depreciate him in the public[7:20:357] opinion; but it was a vain endeavour, and only served to depress himself. At length his physicians advised his native air for his recovery, and he set out in February 1761; but was so fatigued by his journey, that upon his arrival at Bosworth, he betook himself to his chamber, and grew continually worse till the day of his death, which happened on the 14th of May, in the fifty-first year of his age.
