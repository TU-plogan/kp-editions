SRAVANA BALGUTA, a village of Hindustan, in the northern province of Mysore, celebrated as the principal seat of the Jain worship, which at one time prevailed all over the south of India, but which has now greatly declined, from the influence of the Brahmins. There arc two hills adjoining the town, on one of which, named Indra Betta, is situated the temple; the other is cut into a colossal statue, seventy feet in height. The village is almost wholly inhabited by Jainas. Long. 76. 43. E. Lat. 12. 45. N.
