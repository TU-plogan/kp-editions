SETON, in Surgery, a few horse hairs, small threads, or large packthread, drawn through the skin, chiefly the neck, by means of a large needle or probe, with a view to restore or preserve health.

Experience shows that setons are useful in catarrhs, inflammations, and other disorders, and particularly those of the eyes; to which may be added, severe headachs, with stupor, drowsiness, epilepsies, and even apoplexy itself.
