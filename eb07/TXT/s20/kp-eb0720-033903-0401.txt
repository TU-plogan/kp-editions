SILBERBERG, a town of the Prussian province of Silesia, in the circle of Frankenstein. It is an open town in a mining district in a narrow valley, surrounded with hills, on whose sides the streets are built, but the valley is 1350 feet above the level of the sea. The inhabitants are occupied in making cloth, and in exploring the mines. It is chiefly remarkable from fortified points on five hills, which overlook the town, and which are so connected with each other by works, as to form a most complete citadel, which is surrounded by a ditch seventy feet in depth, and which has within its barracks a natural cavern, sufficiently commodious to lodge securely a garrison of 5000 men. When, in the campaigns of 1806 and 1807, the whole of Prussia was subdued by the French, this place alone defended itself up to the conclusion of the peace of Tilsit.
