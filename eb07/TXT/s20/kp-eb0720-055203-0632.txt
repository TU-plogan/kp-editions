SQUADS, in a military sense, are certain divisions of a company into so many squads, generally into three or four. The use of forming companies into as many squads of inspection as it has serjeants and corporals, is proved by those regiments who have practised that method; as by it the ir regularity of the soldiers is considerably restrained, their dress improved, and the discipline of the regiment in general most remarkably forwarded. Every officer should have a roll of his company by squads.
