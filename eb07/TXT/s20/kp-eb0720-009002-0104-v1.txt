SEMLIN, a city of the Austrian dominions, on the frontier towards Turkey. It stands in that district which forms a part of the military colonies of Austria, distinguished by the name of the Sclavonian boundary. It is situated on a point of land where the river Drave falls into the Danube; and it is strongly fortified, and tolerably well built. The Catholics have one church and four chapels; the Greeks have two churches, over which a propapa presides. There are a convent of Franciscans, a German normal sch∞l, a hospital, a Jews’ synagogue, and 1250 dwelling-houses, with about 8700 inhabitants. At this place is the lazaretto, where all persons arriving from Turkey must exhibit bills of health, and perform quarantine. In a meadow between this place and Belgrade a daily market is held, where two rows of palisades separate the dealers, and where sentinels are continually on the watch, to see that no hazardous communication takes place; and all goods bought from the Turks must be exposed to the air and fumigated. It is a place of considerable traffic with Turkey. The communication by steam-vessels between Vienna and Constantinople has given a stimulus to its commerce, and is likely to occasion a much greater increase. There are now more than 120 mercantile houses established here, some of which are Greek, others Turkish, and a part Austrian. There are 380 persons employed in manufactures, and more than 100 hotels or taverns. The colonists regimented here form the Pe-terwarden branch of the army. Long. 20. 19. 39. E. Lat. 44. 51. 22. N.
