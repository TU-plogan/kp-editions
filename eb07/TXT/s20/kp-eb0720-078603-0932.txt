SUAREZ, Francis, a renowned Jesuit, was born at Grenada on the 5th of January 1548. He belonged to a noble family, and was sent to prosecute the study of law in the university of Salamanca; but when he had finished his course, he was induced to change his destination, and assume the habit of St Ignatius. He at first experienced much difficulty in comprehending the principles of the philosophy which was then taught; but having been placed under the guidance of Rodriguez, he soon began to be distinguished by the uncommon rapidity of his progress, and became one of the most distinguished members of the society. Having taught philosophy at Segovia, he was afterwards employed in teaching theology at Valladolid, Rome, Alcala, and Salamanca. Wherever he taught, his lectures attracted a numerous auditory. He was at length appointed to the first chair of divinity in the university of Coimbra; but before entering upon his office, he went to Evora, and took his doctor’s degree. Here his reputation continued to increase. At the instigation of the pope, he prepared an elaborate work, entitled “Defensio Catholics Fidei contra Anglicanae Sectae Errores.” Conimbricae, 1613, fol. This work gave much offence to King James, and was burnt at St Paul’s by the hands of the hangman. Nor did it receive better treatment from the parliament of Paris; who, by an arrêt pronounced on the 26th of June 1614, condemned it to the flames, as containing maxims contrary to the rights of sovereigns. It was ably refuted by Robert Abbot, afterwards bishop of Salisbury. Suarez, having been called to Lisbon for some weighty conference, died there on the 25th of September 1617. An instant before he expired, he said to those who surrounded his bed, “I never knew it was so pleasant to die.”

Suarez was a great master of the scholastic philosophy and theology of his age, nor was he a mean or ordinary proficient in jurisprudence. Grotius has described him as the most acute of philosophers and divines. His treatise “De Legibus et Deo Legislatore,” is commended by Sir James Mackintosh, “as exhibiting the most accessible and perspicuous abridgment of the theological philosophy in its latest form.” According to the same competent authority, “he first saw that international law was composed, not only of the simple principles of justice applied to the intercourse between states, but of those usages, long observed in that intercourse by the European race, which have since been more exactly distinguished as the consuetudinary law acknowledged by the Christian nations of Europe and America.” Of this learned Jesuit, the works are very numerous. An edition of them in twenty-three vols. fol. began to be published at Maintz and Lyon in the year 1630. An edition was published at Venice in the year 1740. (x.)
