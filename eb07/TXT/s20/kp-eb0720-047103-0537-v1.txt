SOFFITA, or Soffit, in Architecture, any timber ceiling formed of cross beams of flying comices, the square compartments or pannels of which are enriched with sculpture, painting, or gilding; such are those in the palaces of Italy, and in the apartments of Luxembourg at Paris.

Soffita, or Soffit, is also used for the underside or face of an architrave; and more particularly for that of the corona or larmier, which the ancients called lacunar, the French plafond, and we usually the drip. It is enriched with compartments of roses; and in the Doric order has eighteen drops, disposed in three ranks, six in each, placed to the right of the guttae, at the bottom of the triglyphs.
