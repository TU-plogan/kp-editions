SHERRIFF of Mecca, the title of the descendants of Mahommed by Hassan Ibn Ali. These are divided into several branches, of which the family of Ali Bunemi, consisting at least of three hundred individuals, enjoy the sole right to the throne of Mecca. The Ali Bunemi are again subdivided into two subordinate branches, Darii Sajid and Darii Barkad, of whom sometimes the one, sometimes the other, have given sovereigns to Mecca and Medina, when these were separate states.
