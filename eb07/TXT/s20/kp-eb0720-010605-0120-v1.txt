SERAMPORE, a town of Bengal, belonging to theDanes, situated on the west side of the Hooghly river, about twelve miles above Calcutta. Serampore has a pleasing appearance viewed from the river, the houses being tolerably well built, of brick, and whitened; they have flat roofs, with balconies and Venetian windows, though few of them are more than two stories in height. There is a handsome church, and a battery of twelve pieces of cannon, chiefly for saluting, for the town is without fortifications. The trade which the Calcutta merchants carried on during the war, under cover of the Calcutta flag, was very profitable to the Danes who were settled here. The trade which it now carries on with Europe and China is but trifling. It is chiefly supported by missionaries; and insolvent debtors from Calcutta found here an asylum, from whence they could set their creditors at defiance. The missionaries have here established a printing-press, and printed the Scriptures in various dialects. During the short war with the Danes it was taken possession of by the British; but it was soon afterwards restored. Long. 88. 26. E. Lat. 22. 45. N.
