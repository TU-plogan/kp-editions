SCYLAX, a celebrated mathematician and geographer of Caria, flourished under the reign of Darius Hystaspes, about 558 before Christ. Some have attributed to him the invention of geographical tables. We have under his name a geographical work published by Hoeschelius; but it is written by a much later author, and is perhaps only an abridgment of Scylax’s Ancient Geography.
