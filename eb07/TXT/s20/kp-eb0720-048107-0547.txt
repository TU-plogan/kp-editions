SORIA, one of the four departments into which the pro vince of Old Castille, in Spain, is divided. Its extent is 341 square leagues, and its population amounts to 257,537 souls. It is in general a hilly district, and in some parts very mountainous. The plains are fertile, especially that of Rioja, and yield abundance of wheat and barley, and in some years it has a surplus of both these productions. Its wine is good, but not abundant; and it is deficient in a supply of oil, which is procured from the more southern provinces. This province furnishes to commerce a great proportion of the fine wool of the merinos. That of Soria is not equal in fineness to what is produced in Segovia, but is however of a good quality; and the quantity annually sent away amounts to about 2,250,000 pounds.

Soria , a city of Spain, in New Castille, the capital of the department of that name. It is situated on the north bank of the river Duero, but too near its source to derive any benefit as to navigation. In the vicinity there are excellent pastures for sheep, with houses of various kinds to shelter them when the weather is more than usually inclement, or when they are shorn. It is not a large city, nor are the public buildings of a nature to merit a detailed description; but the extensive ruins of the ancient Numantia invite the notice of every lover of Roman antiquities. Soria contains thirteen churches, eleven monasteries, four hospitals, and 6000 inhabitants. The manufacture of silk stockings employs eighty-two looms. Some of the inhabitants are employed in soapboiling, tanning, and in the manufacture of cloth. Lat. 4L 48. N.
