STOW ON THE WOLD, a town of the hundred of Haughton, in the county of Gloucester, eighty-two miles from London. It stands on a hill in a wild district near the river Windrash. It is irregularly and not well built. The parish is very extensive, though not densely peopled. The town has a market on Thursday, and several fairs at which sales are made of hops, sheep, and cheese. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1471, in 1811 to 1544, in 1821 to 1731, and in 1831 to 1810.
