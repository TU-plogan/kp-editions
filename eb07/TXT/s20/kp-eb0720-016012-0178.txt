SEVEN Stars, a common denomination given to the cluster of stars in the neck of the sign Taurus, the bull, and properly called the Pleiades. They are so called from their number, seven, which appear to the naked eye, though some eyes can discover only six of them; but by the aid of telescopes there appears to be a great multitude of them.[7:20:161]
