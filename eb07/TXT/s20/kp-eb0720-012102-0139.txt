SERINO, a city of Italy, in the Neapolitan province of Ulteriore. It stands between two hills, and contains ten parish churches, with 7500 inhabitants, who are employed in making woollen goods and in spinning silk. There is also a very large annual fair held at Serino; and near to it are the ruins of the ancient Roman city Sabatia.
