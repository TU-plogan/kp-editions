STROMBOLI, the most northern island of the Lipari group, in the Mediterranean, being a part of the kingdom of Naples. It was known to the ancients by the name of Strongyle; a name implying a conical mountain with an irregular base. The mountain is bifurcated, upwards of 2000 feet in height, and about nine miles in circumference, and is evidently a monstrous product of subterraneous fires. The crater of this mountain is on the north-west side, about two thirds of the whole height from the base; it is of a circular form, and about one hundred and seventy yards in diameter, and has a yellow efflorescence adhering to its sides, as to those of Mount Aetna. This crater has burnt without intermission from the earliest periods, and is supposed to be supported by oxygen, pyrites, and sulphur; but there are not any traces of the aid of bitumen. It appears to be not only the vent of all these islands, but likewise to have subterraneous communication with Sicily and Italy; for, previously to a severe earthquake taking place in those parts, Stromboli has been observed to be covered with dense clouds of smoke, and to emit with increased activity unusually ardent flames. The access to the summit, though fatiguing, is not dangerous. When a person approaches the crater, and the smoke clears away, as it does at intervals, he can observe an undulating igneous substance, which at short periods rises and falls with great agitation, and when swollen to the utmost height bursts with a violent explosion and a discharge of red-hot stones in a semi-fluid state, accompanied with showers of ashes, and a strong sulphureous smell. These masses are thrown up to the height of from sixty or seventy to three hundred feet, and some few even to a thousand. In the moderate ejections the stones in their ascent gradually diverge like a grand pyrotechnical exhibition, and fall again into the abyss, except on the side next the sea, where they roll down in quick succession to the water.

The island contains about 1200 inhabitants. The principal places are St Bartolo and St Vincenzo. The soil is a black mold, very fertile, consisting of argilaceous tufa, scoriae, puzzolana, and sand. Stromboli produces some good wine, with excellent wheat, barley, cotton, rasins, currants, and figs. The church of St Bartolo is in long. 15. 13. 10. E., and lat. 38. 48. 12. N.
