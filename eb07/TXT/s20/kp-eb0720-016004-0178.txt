SETTEE, in sea-language, a vessel very common in the Mediterranean, with one deck and a long sharp prow. They carry some two masts, and some of them three, without top-masts. They have generally two masts, equipped with triangular sails, commonly called lateen sails. The least of them are of sixty tons burden. They serve to transport cannon and provisions for ships of war, and the like. These vessels are peculiar to the Mediterranean Sea, and are usually navigated by Italians, Greeks, or Mahommedans.
