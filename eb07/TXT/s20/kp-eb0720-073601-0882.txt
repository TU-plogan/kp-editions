STONEHAVEN, or Stonehive, a seaport town in Kincardineshire, Scotland, occupies part of the parishes of Dunnotar and Fetteresso. It is situated in a south-westerly direction from Aberdeen, from which it is distant fifteen miles. The more ancient part of the town, which was built in the reign of Charles II., stands on the south side of the Carron, and presents an appearance somewhat paltry. But on the north side of the stream some elegant streets, with a square in the centre, have risen up under the auspices of Captain Barclay of Ury, upon whose ground they are built. Between the old and new towns there is a communication by means of a bridge. There is safe anchorage for shipping in the harbour, which is a natural basin, sheltered on the south-east by a high rock, and on the north-east by a quay, where goods can be landed with convenience and despatch. The harbour has been recently improved by the erection of a jetty. The vessels that sail out of this port are chiefly employed in the coal and lime trade, but the amount of tonnage is inconsiderable. Here many persons reside who occupy themselves in the herring-fishery; and there was formerly employment for a number of weavers, but their trade has in a great measure deserted them. The prosperity of the place depends in some degree upon the persons connected with the sheriff court of the county, which is held here. Although the capital of Kincardineshire, Stonehaven is only a borough of barony, of which the magis trates, who are authorized by the charter to preside in the justice of peace court, are appointed by the superior and feuars. A weekly market is held here, and also five annual fairs. In the vicinity of Stonehaven stand the parish churches of Dunnotar and Fetteresso. The town itself contains other two places of worship, one of which is an Episcopal chapel, and the other a meeting-house of the United Associated Synod. The population amounted in 1821 to 2150, and in 1831 to 2965.
