SQUALL, a sudden and violent blast of wind, usually occasioned by the interruption and reverberation of the wind from high mountains. These are very frequent in the Mediterranean, particularly that part of it which is known by the name of the Levant, as produced by the repulsion and new direction which the wind meets with in its passage between the various islands of the Archipelago.
