SHEICK, in the oriental customs, the person who has the care of the mosques in Egypt: his duty is the same as that of the imams at Constantinople. There are more or fewer of these to every mosque, according to its size or revenue. One of them is head over the rest, and answers to a parish priest with us, and has under him, in large mosques, the readers, and people who cry out to go to prayers; but in small mosques the sheick is obliged to do all this himself. In such it is their business to open the mosque, to cry to prayers, and to begin their short devotions at the head of[7:20:198] the congregation, who stand rank and file in great ordcr, and make all their motions together. Every Friday the sheick makes an harangue to his congregation.
