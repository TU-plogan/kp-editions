SNOWDON, one of the highest mountains in Wales. It is within the county of Carnarvon, but extends to the borders of Merionethshire. The highest point of the range is 3571 feet above the level of the sea. The snow begins to fall on it in November, and is seldom melted till the middle of June. It is easily accessible in several directions. The view from the summit is extensive and grand, on a clear day, which does not often occur. The hills of Scotland are to be seen, with a part of the coast, as well as the Isle of Man; and the hills of Lancashire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, and, in some very translucent days, the hills of Kerry, in Ireland, have been perceived. The mountain of Snowdon was held sacred by the ancient Britons.
