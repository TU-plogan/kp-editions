SLINGING is used variously at sea, but chiefly for hoisting up casks or other heavy things with slings, that is, contrivances of ropes spliced into themselves at either end, with one eye big enough to receive the cask or whatever is to be slung. There are other slings, which are made longer, and with a small eye at each end, one of which is put over the breech of a piece of ordnance, and the other comes over the end of an iron crow, which is put into the mouth of the piece, to weigh and hoist the gun as they please. There are also slings by which the yards are bound fast to the cross-trees aloft, and to the head of the mast, with a strong rope or chain, that if the tie shoιdd happen to break, or to be shot to pieces in fight, the yard, nevertheless, may not fall upon the hatches.

Slinging a Man overboard, in order to stop a leak in a ship, is managed thus. The man is trussed up about the middle in a piece of canvass, and a rope to keep him from sinking, with his arms at liberty, a mallet in one hand, and a plug, wrapped in oakum and well tarred in a tarpauling clout, in the other, which he is to beat with all dispatch into the hole or leak.
