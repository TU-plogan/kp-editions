SEARCH-W arrant, in Law, a kind of general warrant issued by justices of peace or by magistrates of towns, for searching all suspected places for stolen goods. In Scotland this was often done formerly; and in some English lawbooks there are precedents requiring the constable to search all such suspected places as he and the party complaining shall think convenient; but such practice is condemned by Lord Hale, Mr Hawkins, and the best authorities both among the English and the Scotch lawyers. However, in case of a complaint, and oath made of goods stolen, and that the party suspects that those goods are in a particular house, and shows the cause of such suspicion, the justice may grant a warrant to search not only that house, but other suspected places, and to attach the goods, and the party in whose custody they are found, and bring them before him or some other justice, to give an account how he came by them, and to abide such order as to law shall appertain. This warrant should be directed to the constable or other public officer, who may enter a suspected house and make search.
