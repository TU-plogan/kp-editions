STOWEY-NETHER, a town of the county of Somerset, in the hundred of Willerton and Freemanners, six miles from Bridgewater, and 149 miles from London. It is in a fertile district at the foot of the Quanloch Hills. It formerly contained a castle, of which no vestige now appears, though the ditch that surrounded it may be traced. The parish church is a handsome building; and near to it is a spring, which has the property of incrusting, with the appearance of stone, pieces of wood, or other substances that may be thrown into it. There is a small market held on Thursday. The population amounted in 1801 to 586, in 1811 to 620, in 1821 to 773, and in 1831 to 778.
