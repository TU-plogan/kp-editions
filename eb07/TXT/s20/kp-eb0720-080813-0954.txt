SUNDA, Straits of. The arm of the sea which separates the large islands of Sumatra and Java is so called by the Europeans, and by the Malays Sunda Kalapa. The length of this channel, taken from the flat point to Varkens or Hog Point, is about seventy miles; and on the opposite coast, from Java Head to Bantam Point, about ninety. The passage, though wide, is occasionally dangerous, from the currents. There are two passages formed by Prince’s Island, which lies in the mouth of the straits; one between it and Java, which is generally made use of during the south-west monsoon, in order that they may approach as close as possible to the shore, so as to anchor to escape the danger of being driven to sea by the currents which set strongly out of the straits to the westward. The other pas[7:20:809] sage, called the Great Channel, is sometimes resorted to during the south-east monsoon; but it is navigated with the greatest difficulty, in consequence of the opposition from the south-easterly gales. In the narrowest part of the straits is an island, which, from its situation, is called Thwart the Way, or Middle Isle; on both sides of which a strong current runs during the whole year, setting with the prevailing easterly or westerly winds either to the north-east or southwest. The other chief islands in the straits are Prince’s Isle, Krakatau, and Pulo Baby. The rest are small and insignificant, mostly level, founded on beds of coral, and covered with trees.
