SIWAH, a considerable oasis of the Lybian desert, on the route from Egypt to Fezzan, and the most interesting island of the waste, as being the supposed site of the temple of Jupiter Ammon. It is situated in latitude 29° 12' north, and longitude 26° 5' east. Horneman represents it as fifty miles in circumference; but subsequent travellers have reduced its dimensions to about one half of that. The nearest distance from the river does not exceed 120 miles. Date trees cover a large portion of the soil, which is extremely fertile; but the palm, pomegranate, olive, vine, fig, aprico, plum, and even apple, flourish in the gardens. Tepid saline springs are numerous throughout the district; and shocks of earthquakes are here frequently felt. The town of Siwah is built upon a steep conical rock, and both in external aspect and internal arrangement, presents a striking and singular appearance. The streets are narrow, crooked, and so dark, that artificial light is required at noon-day. Each house has several floors, the upper communicating with the[7:20:371] lower by galleries and chambers which cover the streets. The houses and walls are for the most part built of natron or mineral soda, and rock salt mixed with sand, coated with a gypseous earth, which preserves the salt from melting. The total population of the town is from 2000 to 2500; that of the whole oasis is supposed to amount to 8000 souls.

The great object of interest connected with this place, is, as we have said, the ruins of what is conjectured to have been the famous temple of Ammon. They are situated a league and a half east of the town, and are called by the natives Om Beydch. The edifice has been built in the Egyptian style of architecture. The vestiges of a triple enclosure, enormous stones lying on the ground, and masses still standing, prove it to have been a monument of the first order. The part which is in tolerable preservation is thirty feet in length, and consists of part of a gateway and two great walls, which are covered with three immense stones, measuring thirty-four feet by twenty-seven. The only apartment which has been distinctly made out is 112 feet in length; the whole area of ruins being a rectangular space about 360 feet by 300. The decorations are observed to bear the closest resemblance to those of the Egyptian monuments; the figures, scenes, and arrangements being entirely the same. Here are seen the identical style, cast of countenance, costumes and sacrifices, as in the monuments of Thebaid. Here is the god with the ram’s head, priests in long procession, multitudes of hieroglyphic tables, and at the entrance is sculptured in full relief the figure of Typhon, or the evil genius, about five feet in height. Nearly a mile from these ruins is situated the fountain of the sun, dedicated of old to the Ammonian deity. It is a small marsh rather than a well, extending about ninety feet in length by sixty in breadth, but is at the same time perfectly transparent. The diurnal change of temperature recorded by the father of history is quite perceptible. A temple stands near this spring, and there are other temples and lakes extending in succession towards the west. Major Rennel has employed much learning to prove that Siwah is the site of the famous temple of Ammon, and with considerable success. See his work, The Geographical System of Herodotus Examined and Explained. &c. vol. ii. p. 230.
