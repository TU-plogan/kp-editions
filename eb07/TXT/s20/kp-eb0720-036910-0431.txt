SIRHIND, a town and district in the province of Delhi, of which the latter occupies the north-western quarter, being situated between the 30th and 31st degrees of north 1a-titude. It is not fertile, being barren and sandy, and in many places destitute of water. Its vicinity to the capital was, however, in its favour, as the Afghan emperor, Feroze III. caused several canals to be cut from the rivers Jumna and Suttubje, in order to fertilize it. The country is at present possessed by the Seiks. Its principal towns are Pati-cola, which is large and flourishing, and Tahnesir. The town was built or repaired by Sultan Feroze about the year 1351. It is now a scene of desolation, and has never recovered the dreadful ravages to which it was exposed by the Seiks in 1707. It is 155 miles north north-west from Delhi. Long. 75. 55. E. Lat. 30. 40. N.
