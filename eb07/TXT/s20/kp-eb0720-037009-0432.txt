SITUS, in Algebra and Geometry, denotes the situation of lines, surfaces, and the like. Worfius delivers some things in geometry, which are not deduced from common analysis, particularly matters depending on the situs of lines and figures. Leibnitz has even founded a particular kind of analysis upon it, called calculus situs.
