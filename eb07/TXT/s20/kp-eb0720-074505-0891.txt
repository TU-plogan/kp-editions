STRALSUND, one of the governments into which the Prussian province of Pomerania is divided. It comprehends the whole of what was Swedish Pomerania, with the island of Rugen, and some others in the Baltic Sea. It extends over 1584 square miles, and contains fourteen cities and towns, and 347 villages. The population, by the census of 1817, amounted to 129,239, and by that of 1834 to 153,945. With the exception of about 450 Catholics and 152 Jews, all the inhabitants are of the Lutheran church. The soil is generally fertile and well cultivated, yielding of corn, flax, and hemp, more than is consumed. The capital, a city of the same name, stands in the island of Rugen, opposite the Strait of Gellen, by which it is separated from the continent. The harbour is good and secure, and the city is strongly fortified both on the land and the sea sides. It is ancient, and in a style of building corresponding to its age. It has five churches and a college, with a few other public buildings. In the year 1834 it contained 14,713 inhabitants, who have extensive foreign trade, chiefly in domestic productions.
