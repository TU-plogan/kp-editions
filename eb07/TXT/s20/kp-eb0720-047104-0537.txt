SOFIA, a city of Turkey in Europe, the ancient Sardica. It is situated in Romelia, and is the capital of a province of its own name. It is on an extensive plain, between the two rivers Iscar and Rissava. It is surrounded with walls flanked by towers, and defended by a citadel. It is the seat of a Greek and of a Catholic bishop; has twenty-three mosques, several Greek, Catholic, and Armenian churches, some Jewish synagogues, 8000 houses, with about 48,000 inhabitants. It is one of the most flourishing cities of the empire, depending chiefly on its manufactures. They consist of silk, woollen and linen goods, and various smaller articles. The general appearance of the town is somewhat imposing; but many of the houses are of wood, and look meanly, as there are few glass windows, and generally iron grating in their stead. Sofia was built by the emperor Justinian out of the ruins of the ancient Sardica, and fell under the power of the Turks in 1382.
