SEERDHUNA, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Delhi, and district of Merat. This place was formerly the residence of Somroo Begum, and the capital of a small principality under her government, about twenty miles in length by twelve in breadth, which, with the town, were assigned to Somroo, who was originally a German, his real name being Walter Reinihard, who went to Bengal and entered the French service, and afterwards that of Gregory, an Armenian, who was high in favour with Cossim Ali, to whom he recommended Somroo. It was this adventurer who massacred the English prisoners at Patna in 1763. He died in 1776, leaving a favourite concubine, who resided at Delhi, under the protection of the British government, in 1807, and invested her property in the East India Companyâ€™s funds at Calcutta. The district is fertile, producing all kinds of grain, sugar, and cotton. Long, of the town 77. 28. E. Lat. 29. U. N.
