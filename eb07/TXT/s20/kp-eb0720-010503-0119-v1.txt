SEQUESTRATION, in common Law, is setting aside the thing in controversy from the possession of both the parties that contend for it. In this sense it is either voluntary, as when done by the consent of the parties; or necessary, as where it is done by the judge, of his own authority, whether the parties are inclined or the reverse.

Sequestration is also used for the act of gathering the fruits of a benefice void, to the use of the next incumbent.

Sometimes a benefice is kept under sequestration for many years, when it is of so small value that no clergyman fit to serve the cure will be at the charge of taking it by institution; in which case the sequestration is committed either to the curate alone, or to the curate and churchwardens jointly. Sometimes the profits of a living in controversy, either by the consent of the parties, or by the judge’s authority, are sequestered, and placed for safety in a third hand, till the suit is determined, a minister being appointed by the judge to serve the cure, and allowed a certain salary out of the profits. Sometimes the profits of a living are sequestered for neglect of duty, for dilapidations, or for satisfying the debts of the incumbent.
