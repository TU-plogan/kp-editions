SOLDER, Sodder, or Soder, a metallic or mineral composition used in soldering or joining together other metals. Solders are made of gold, silver, copper, tin, bismuth, and lead. In the composition there must commonly be some of the metal that is to be soldered mixed with some higher and finer metals. Goldsmiths usually make four kinds of solder, viz. solder of eight, where to seven parts of silver there is one of brass or copper; solder of six, where only a sixth part is copper; solder of four,[7:20:472] and solder of three. It is the mixture of copper in the solder that makes raised plate come always cheaper than flat.
