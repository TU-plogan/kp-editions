SHEERNESS, a town of the county of Kent, situated on the island of Sheppey. It stands at the point where the river Medway forms its junction with the Thames, on the right bank of the former river. It has been long a place of vast importance in a military point of view. The works having been suffered to fall into decay in the war with Holland in the reign of Charles IL, the Dutch fleet attacked and destroyed the fortifications, and thus opened[7:20:195] the way for an attack on the marine arsenal of Chatham. After the Dutch retired, the works were repaired, and have been from time to time vastly strengthened. It is now a complete marine fortress, and a powerful protection to the important anchorage at the Nore, where, in time of war, especially if the port of Antwerp should be in possession of an enemy, it is necessary always to have a strong naval force ready to act. These fortifications were found of great service during the mutiny of the fleet at the Nore in the year 1796. Many of the crews were soon tired of their state of rebellion, rose upon their committees, and slipping their cables, ran under the guns of the forts, and were protected from their associates.

It is now a regular marine arsenal, chiefly used for repairing ships, and well furnished with every necessary kind of stores, and of late years well supplied with what was previously scarce, good spring-water. It is a part of the parish of Minster, the population of which amounted in 1801 to 5061, in 1811 to 7008, in 1821 to 8414, and in 1831 to 7983. The town itself has diminished from 1422 to sixty-one inhabitants, as dwellings have been removed to make space for ports. It has a market on Saturday, and there is a chapel of ease to Minster church.
