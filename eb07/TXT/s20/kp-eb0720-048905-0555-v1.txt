SOVEREIGN, in matters of government, is applied to the supreme magistrate or magistrates of an independent government or state; because their authority is only bound ed by the laws of God and the laws of the state: such are kings, princes, &c.

Sovereign Power, or Sovereignty, is the power of making or sanctioning laws; for wherever that power resides, all others must conform to it, and be directed by it, what ever appearance the outward form and administration of the government may assume. For it is at any time in the op tion of the legislature to alter that form and administration by a new edict or rule, and to put the execution of the laws into whatever hands it pleases; and all the other powers of the state must obey the legislative power in the execution of their several functions, or else the constitution is at an end. In our constitution the law ascribes to the king the attribute of sovereignty; but that is to be understood in a qualified sense; that is, he is supreme magistrate, not sole legislator, as the legislative power is vested in the king, lords, and commons, not in any of the three estates alone.
