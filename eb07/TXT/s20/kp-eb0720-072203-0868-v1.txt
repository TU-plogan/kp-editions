STETTIN, one of the governments into which the Prussian province of Pomerania is divided. It extends over 4895 square miles, comprises forty cities and market-towns, and 1510 villages. It is divided into eleven circles. The inhabitants amounted in 1817 to 327,002, and in 1831 to 432,570; the whole of them adhering to the Lutheran church, with the exception of about 3000 Catholics and 1500 Jews. It has been formed out of the whole of the former province of Pomerania and the western part of Hither Pomerania. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on the left bank of the river Oder, from which it has a gradual ascent. It is a well-built city, but some of its streets are steep. It is strongly fortified, has a citadel, and a fine place of arms, and storehouses for munitions of war. From its position near the mouth of such a river, it has facilities for carrying on a very extensive commerce. The productions of foreign countries are conveyed from it to the cities of Kustrin, Frankfurt, Breslau, and even to Cracow; and it is the best shipping port for the productions of the districts which surround those cities. The larger classes of vessels cannot ascend to Stettin, but are loaded or discharged by means of barges at the port of Swinemunde, near the discharge of the Fresh Haff into the Balric. It contains a fine old royal palace, a Gothic cathedral with two lofty towers, a gymnasium, to which belong an astronomical observatory, a library, and museums. It has considerable manufactories of linen and woollen goods, tobacco and snuff, several sugar refineries, tanneries, soapboilers’ works, and extensive breweries and distilleries. Many vessels are built at Stettin, and more than 200 are owned by the merchants of the city. About 800 ships yearly enter and clear out. The city, with the suburbs, contains 32,191 inhabitants, and the markets are well and cheaply supplied. Long. 14. 50. 25. E. Lat. 52. 25. 36. N.
