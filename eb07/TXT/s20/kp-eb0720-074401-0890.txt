STRADA, Famianus, an ingenious and learned Jesuit, was born at Rome in the year 1572, and there taught rhetoric for fifteen years. He wrote several pieces upon the art of oratory, and published some orations with a view of illustrating by example what he had inculcated by precept. But his “Prolusiones Academicae” and his “Historia de Bello Belgico are the works which raised his reputation, and have preserved his memory. His history of the war of Flanders was published at Rome, the first decad in 1640, the second in 1647; the whole extending from the death of Charles V. which happened in 1558, to the year 1590. It is written in good Latin, as all allow; but its merit in other respects has been variously estimated. His “Prolusiones Academicae” show great ingenuity, and a masterly skill in classical literature; that prolusion especially in which he introduces Lucan, Lucretius, Claudian, Ovid, Statius, and Virgil, each of them versifying according to his own strain. This work has often been printed. Strada died at Rome in the Jesuits College in the year 1649.
