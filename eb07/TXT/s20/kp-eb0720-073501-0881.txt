STOCKPORT, a town in the hundred of Macclesfield and county of Chester, 173 miles from London. It stands on the banks of the river Mersey, over which is a neat stone bridge of a single arch, resting on rocks on both sides. By means of a canal this town has water communication with the rivers Dee, Ribble, Trent, and Severn, and thus with the greater part of the kingdom. The trade which it carries on is very extensive. It was formerly confined in a great measure to making cotton goods; but of late years the silk-manufacture has been introduced, and has been prodigiously extended. There are two parish churches. The oldest, called the Red Church, is built on a solid rock, and has a neat square tower, with a good set of bells. There are also many places of worship for the various dissenting sects. By the act of 1832 it has been created a borough, and returns two members to the House of Commons. There is a large market on Fridays. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 14,830, in 1811 to 17,545, in 1821 to 21,726, and in 1831 to 25,469.
