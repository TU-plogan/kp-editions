+====================================================================+


SPINOZA, Benedict, was born at Amsterdam the 24th November 1632. His father was a Jew of Portugal, and by profession a merchant. After being taught Latin by a physician, the son applied himself for many years to the study of theology, and afterwards devoted himself entirely to philosophy. He began very early to be dissatisfied with the Jewish religion; and as his temper was open, he did not conceal his doubts from the synagogue. The Jews, it is said, offered to tolerate his infidelity, and even promised him a pension of a thousand dollars per annum, if he would remain in their society, and continue outwardly to practise their ceremonies. But if this offer was really made, he rejected it, perhaps from his aversion to hypocrisy, or rather be cause he could not endure the restraint which it would have imposed. He also refused being constituted heir to an independent fortune, to the prejudice of the natural claimants; and he learned the art of polishing glass for spectacles, that he might be enabled to maintain himself by the labour of his own hands.

His retreat from the synagogue was hastened by an alarming incident. As he was returning home one evening from the theatre, he was stabbed by a Jew: the wound was slight, but the attempt naturally led Spinoza to conclude that the Jews had formed the design of assassinating him. After leaving the synagogue he professedly became a Chris tian, and frequented the churches of the Lutherans and Calvinists. He now devoted himself more than ever to his favourite philosophical speculations; and finding himself frequently interrupted by the visits of his friends, he left Amsterdam, and settled at the Hague, where he often continued for three months together without ever stirring from his lodging. During his residence in that city, his hostess, who was a Lutheran, asked him one day if she could be saved while she continued in her religion? “Yes,” replied

Spinoza, “provided you join to your religion a peaceable and virtuous life.” From this answer, it has been concluded, that he was a Christian in appearance only, while in reality he regarded all religions as indifferent. But this conclusion would be too severe, even if the woman had been a Mahommedan. His “Tractatus theologicopoliticus”(Hamb. 1670, 4to.) is a better proof of his insincerity than a thou sand such conclusions; for this book contains all those doc trines in embryo which were afterwards unfolded in his posthumous works, and which are generally considered as a system of atheism. His fame, which had now spread far and wide, obliged him sometimes to interrupt his philosophical reve ries. Learned men visited him from all quarters. While the prince of Condé commanded the French army in Utrecht, he intreated Spinoza to visit him; and though he was ab sent when the philosopher arrived, he immediately retum ed and spent a considerable time with him in conversation. The elector Palatine offered to make Spinoza professor of philosophy at Heidelberg; but this offer he thought it expedient to decline. He died of consumption at the Hague on the 21st February 1677, at the age of forty-five. His life was a perpetual contradiction to his opinions. He was temperate, liberal, and remarkably disinterested; he was sociable, affable, and friendly. His conversation was agreeable and instructive, and never deviated from the strictest propriety.

Soon after his death appeared a thick volume entitled “B.d.S. Opera Posthuma.” [Arastelodami] 1677, 4to. A collective edition of his works has been published in the course of the present century: “Benedicti de Spinoza Opera quae supersunt omnia. Iterum edenda curavit, praefationes, vitam auctoris, nec non notitias quae ad historiam[7:20:547] scriptorum pertinent, addidit Henr. Eberh. Gottlob Paulus, Ph. ac Th. D. hujus Prof. Ord. Jenensis.” Jenae, 18023, 2 tom. 8vo. Spinoza has generally been considered as the author of a tract entitled “Lucii Antistii Constantis de Jure Ecclesiasticoum liber singularis.” Alethopoli, 1666, 8vo. It has also been ascribed to Meyer, his friend and physician; but Leibnitz believed the author to have been Van den Hoof, who wrote “L'Intérêt de la Hollande,” and various other works.^[1. • Leibnitz, Essais de Theodicée, p∙ 371. ]
