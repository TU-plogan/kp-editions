SHAFRAS, or Suffras, Gregory Savarof, an Armenian merchant, remarkable only as the person who sold the large and celebrated diamond which is now set in the imperial sceptre of Russia. Shah Nadir, an lndian prince, had two principal diamonds in his throne, one of them denominated the Sun of the Sea, and the other the Moon of the Mountain. When that prince was assassinated, many precious ornaments belonging to the crown were pillaged, and privately disposed of by the soldiers who shared the plunder.

Shafras, who was called Millionshik at Astrakhan, had then his residence at Bassora, with two of his brothers. A chief of the Afghans one day applied to him, and proposed to sell the diamond already mentioned for a very moderate sum (probably the Moon of the Mountain), together with a very large emerald, a ruby of considerable size, and other precious stones of less value. Shafras was astonished at the offer; and giving out that he had not a sufficient sum to purchase them, he requested time to consult with his brothers on the subject. The vender did not again make his appearance, probably from suspicious motives. Shafras, with the approbation of his brothers, went directly in search of the stranger with the jewels, but by that time he had left Bassora. Shafras, however, accidentally met him at Bagdad, and paid him 50,000 piastres (L.8958. 6s. 8d.) for all his jewels. Shafras and his brothers, being well aware that the most profound secrecy was absolutely necessary, resolved to remain at Bassora.

At the expiration of twelve years, Shafras set off with the largest of the jewels, directing his route through Sham and Constantinople, and afterwards through Hungary and Silesia to the city of Amsterdam by land, where he publicly offered them for sale.

It is reported that the British government was among the bidders. The Russian court sent for the large diamond, with an offer to reimburse all reasonable expenses if the price could not be agreed on. When the diamond arrived, Count Panin, the Russian minister, made the following offer to Shafras. Besides the patent of hereditary nobility, which the vendor demanded, he was to receive an annual pension of 6000 roubles during life, 500,000 roubles in cash (L.l 12,500 sterling), one fifth of which was to be payable on demand, and the remainder by instalments in the course of ten years. He also claimed the order of nobility for his brothers, persisting so obstinately in his demands, that the diamond was returned.

Shafras was now very much perplexed. He had involved himself in expenses, was forced to pay interest for considerable sums of borrowed money, and he saw no prospect of selling the jewel to advantage. The negociation was recommenced with Russia by Count Gregory Grigorevitsh Orlof, afterwards created a prince of the empire; and the diamond was purchased for 450,000 roubles (L. 105,250) ready money, together with a grant of Russian nobility. We are informed that 120,000 roubles (L.27,000) fell to the share of the negociators for commission, interest, and similar expenses. Shafras settled at Astrakhan; and his riches, which by inheritance devolved to his daughters, have been in a great measure dissipated by the extravagance of his sons-in-law.
