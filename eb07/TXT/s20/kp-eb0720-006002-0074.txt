SEATON, a town in the hundred of Colyton, in the county of Devon, 150 miles from London. It consists chiefly of one street, and stands on the sea-shore, in a very pleasant but secluded situation. It is much resorted to as a sea-bathing place during the summer months; and there is a considerable fishery carried on from hence. It has a parish church and an Independent chapel. The population amounted in 1821 to 1745, and in 1831 to 1803, taken at a period of the year when there is no occasional residence.

Seaton-Carew, a township in the parish of Stranton, in the county of Durham, in the ward of Stockton, two miles from Hartlepool, seven from Stockton, and 256 from London. It stands close to the sea-shore, near the influx of the river Tees into the sea. It is well adapted for seabathing, which has caused an increase in the number of the houses. The chief occupation of the inhabitants is that of fishing. Their number amounted in 1821 to 704, and in 1831 to 736; but it has much increased in the last seven years.
