SUPEREROGATION, in Theology, what a man does beyond his duty, or more than he is commanded to do. The Romanists strenuously contend for works of supererogation, and maintain that a stock of merit is accumulated, of which the church has the disposal, and which she distributes in indulgences according to her own pleasure. This absurd doctrine was first invented towards the close of the twelfth century, and modified and embellished by St Thomas in the thirteenth. Men were then taught to believe that there actually existed an immense treasure of merit, composed of the pious deeds and virtuous actions which the saints had performed beyond what was necessary for their own salvation, and which were therefore applicable to the benefit of others; and the guardian and dispenser of this precious treasure was the Roman pontiff; and that of consequence he was empowered to assign to such as he thought proper a portion of this inexhaustible source of merit, suitable to their respective guilt, and sufficient to deliver them from the punishment due to their crimes. The reformed churches do not allow of any work of supererogation; but hold, with the apostles, that when we have done our best, we are but unprofitable servants.
