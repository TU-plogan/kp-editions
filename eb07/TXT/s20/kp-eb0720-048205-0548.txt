SOSVA, the name of two considerable rivers in Asiatic Russia, in the government of Tobolsk. The first has a course of 160 miles. It rises in the Oural Mountains, about the sixtyfifth degree of north latitude, and running almost due east, falls into the Obi near Beresof, after receiving a smaller river of the same name, called the Little Sosva. The other river rises somewhat farther to the north, in the same chain of hills, and running southwards about 200 miles, joins the Sosva, where their united streams take the name of Tauda.
