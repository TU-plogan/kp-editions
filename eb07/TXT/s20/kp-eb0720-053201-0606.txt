SPELLING, in Grammar, that part of orthography which teaches the true manner of resolving words into their syllables.

All words are either simple or compound, as use, disuse; done, undone; and the rules for dividing each must be such as are derived from the analogy of language in general, or from the established custom of speaking; which, for the English language, are reduced to the following rules: 1. A consonant between two vowels must be joined with the latter in spelling, as nature, ve-ri-ly, ge-ne-rous; except, however, the letter x, which is joined to the first, as in flax-en, ox-en, &c ., and compound words, as in upon, unused, &c. 2. A double consonant must be divided, as in letter, manner, &c. 3. Those consonants which can begin a word, must not be parted in spelling, as in defraud, re-prove, distinct: this rule, however, is sometimes found to fail; for though gn begins a word, as in gnaw, gnat, &c., yet it must be divided in spelling, as in cog-ni-zance, ma-lig-ni-ty, &c. 4. Those consonants which cannot begin a word must be divided, as ld in seldom, lt in multitude, mp in tem-per, rd in ar-dent; but in final syllables there are exceptions, as tl in title, dl in handle, &c. 5. When two vowels come to gether, and are both of them distinctly sounded, they must be separated in spelling, as in co-e-val, mutual, &c. 6. The grammatical terminations or endings must be separated in spelling, as ed in wing-ed, edst in de-li-ver-edst,ing in hearing, ance in deliverance, &c . 7. Compound words must be resolved into their simple and component words, as up on, into, neverthe∙less, not∙withstand∙ing, &c.
