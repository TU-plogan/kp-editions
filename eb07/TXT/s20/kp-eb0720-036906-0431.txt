SIRCAR, or Circar, any office under the government in Hindustan. It is sometimes used for the state of govem-ment itself; likewise a province, or any number of pergunnahs placed under one head in the government books, for convenience in keeping accounts. In common usage, the under banyans of European gentlemen are, in Bengal, called sircars.
