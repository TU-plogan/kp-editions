SOUTHWOLD, a seaport town of the hundred of Blything, in the county of Suffolk, 105 miles from London. It is situated on the river Blythe. It is connected with the port of Yarmouth, but has a corporation of its own. The herringfishery is extensively carried on in it, and of late years it has been resorted to for seabathing. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 1676, and in 1831 to 1875.
