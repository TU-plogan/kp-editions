SOANE River has its rise on the east of the table land of Omercuntire, in the province of Gundwana. It flows through Pindarah, where, being joined by numerous other streams from the north-east side of this mountainous territory, it proceeds in a northerly course to the Ganges, which it joins in the province of Bahar, after a winding course of about five hundred miles.
