Socrates was also the name of an ecclesiastical historian of the fifth century, born at Constantinople in the beginning of the reign of Theodosius: he professed the law and pleaded at the bar, whence he obtained the name of Scholasticus. He wrote an ecclesiastical history from the year 309, when Eusebius ended, down to the year 440; and wrote with great exactness and judgment. His work is to be found in different editions of Eusebius, Sozomenus, and the other Greek writers on the history of the church.
