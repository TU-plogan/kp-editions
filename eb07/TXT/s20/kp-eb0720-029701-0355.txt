SHIPSTON-on-Stour, a town of the hundred of Oswaldslow, in the county of Worcester, but detached from it, and surrounded by Gloucestershire. It is eighty-three miles from London, has little trade except what arises from its great sheep-fairs. It has a large market on Friday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1293, in 1811 to 1377, in 1821 to 1562, and in 1831 to 1632.

Ship- Money was an imposition charged upon the ports, towns, cities, boroughs, and counties of England, in the reign of King Charles I., by writs, commonly called shipwrits, under the great seal of England, in the years 1635 and 1636, for the providing and furnishing of certain ships for the kingâ€™s service, which was declared to be contrary to the laws and statutes of this realm, the petition of right, and the liberty of the subject, by statute 17 Car. I. c. 14.
