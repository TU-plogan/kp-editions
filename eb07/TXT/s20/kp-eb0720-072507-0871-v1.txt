STIGMATA, in Natural History, the apertures in different parts of tile bodies of insects, communicating with the tracheae or air-vessels, and serving for the office of respiration.

Stigmata, in Antiquity, certain marks impressed on the left shoulder of the soldiers when listed.

Stigmata were also a kind of notes or abbreviations, consisting only of points disposed various ways; as in triangles, squares, crosses, &c.

Stigmata is likewise a term used among the Franciscans, to express the marks or prints of our Saviour’s wounds, said to have been miraculously impressed by him on the body of their seraphic father St Francis.
