SHAPOUR, an ancient city of Persia, which existed prior to the era of Alexander, but of which the former magnificence is now only marked by masses of ruins. It is situated immediately under a range of mountains, on the banks of a small but rapid river, amid rocks and precipices, many of which are decorated with sculpture.
