STAMFORD, a town of Lincolnshire, in the hundreds of Ness and of Kesteven. It is eighty-five miles from Lon don, on the river Willand, which divides Lincolnshire from Northamptonshire; and one of the parishes of the town, St. Martin’s, is in the latter county, and called the outparish. There are five parish churches, several of which have lofty spires. Two of them are so close together, as to resemble one building. St. Martin’s church contains some curious ancient monuments. In that parish stands Burleigh Hall, the magnificent residence of the marquis of Exeter. This town was in former times a more extensive place than it is at present, and contained fourteen churches, besides many religious houses; but it suffered severely by the wars between the houses of York and Lancaster, and has never re covered from those ravages. It is by no means well built, though of late its appearance lias been improved. Being in a rich district, it has good markets on Monday and Friday, and several fairs. The population was, in 1801, 4012; in 1811, 4582; in 1821, 5050; and in 1831, 5837.
