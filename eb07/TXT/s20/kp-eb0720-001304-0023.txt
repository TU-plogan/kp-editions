SCUTARI, a city of the western part of Turkey, the capital of the province of the same name, sometimes also called by the Turks Iskandria. It is situated on the river Drenas, at its efflux from the Lake Bojana. It is the seat of a Greek bishop. It contains Greek and Catholic churches, several mosques, and about 4000 houses, with 16,000 inhabitants. There is a considerable employment furnished by the building of ships and exporting of timber, and by fisheries. It is not on the sea-shore; but the village of Polna is the place where vessels load and unload, and which is fortified and protected by the castles Dragos and Golbaschi.
