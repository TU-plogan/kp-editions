SUNDEEP Isle, an island of Bengal, in the district of Chittagong, about twenty miles in length by ten in breadth. It is the seat of a salt manufacture by the government, subordinate to the Bulwa and Chittagong agency. The soil is fertile and affords excellent pasture for cattle, and might be easily rendered of much more value than it is at present; but its station for the manufacture of salt supersedes every other use. Ships may safely approach it on all sides except the north. The entrance of the river is safe, and it possesses good anchorage, where ships may remain safe during the adverse monsoon; but the climate is dangerous to Europeans. The town is situated about a mile from the western shore, on the north bank of a creek called Sittal. Towards the end of the sixteenth century a number of Portuguese had settled on the coasts of Arracan and Chittagong; and, having recommended themselves by their bravery and maritime skill, had risen to considerable commands in the service of the native princes. But in consequence of their turbulent conduct, they were expelled by the rajah of Arracan from his dominions, and many of them put to death. A remnant however joining together, elected Sebastian Gonzales for their chief, who took possession of this island, and having collected about 3000 men, extended his conquests. He was at last subdued by the rajah of Arracan, who retained possession of the island till 1666, when it was conquered by the Mogul armies, and came into the possession of the British along with the province of Bengal.
