SUDBURY, a town in the hundred of Babergh and county of Suffolk, fifty-six miles from London. It stands on the river Stour, which divides it from Essex, and is navigable to the sea by Manningtree. The town comprises three parishes, with each a church, and is tolerably well built. It was one of the earliest seats of the woollen manufacture, some share of which it still retains; and it has likewise some silk trade. It is a borough, governed by a mayor, six aldermen, and twenty-three common-council men, and returns two members to the House of Commons. It has a good market on Saturdays. The inhabitants in 1801 amounted to 3263, in 1811 to 8471, in 1821 to 3950, and in 1881 to 4677.
