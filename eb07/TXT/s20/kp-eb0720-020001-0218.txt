Sheridan, Mrs. Frances, wife of Thomas Sheridan, A. M. was born in Ireland about the year 1724, but descended from a good English family which had removed thither. Her maiden name was Chamberlaine, and she was granddaughter of Sir Oliver Chamberlaine. The first literary performance by which she distinguished herself, was a little pamphlet at the time of a violent party-dispute relative to the theatre, in which Mr Sheridan had newly embarked his fortune. So well-timed a work exciting the attention of Mr Sheridan, he by an accident discovered his fair patroness, to whom he was soon afterwards married. She was a person of the most amiable character in every relation of life, with the most engaging manners. After lingering some years in a very weak state of health, she died at Blois, in the south of France, in the year 1767. Her Sidney Bid-dulph may be ranked with the first productions of that class in ours or in any other language. She also wrote a little romance, in one volume, called Nourjahad, in which there is a great deal of imagination, productive of an admirable moral. She was likewise the authoress of two comedies, The Discovery, and The Dupe.
