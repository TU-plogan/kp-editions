STERLING, an epithet by which genuine English money is distinguished. It is unnecessary to mention the various conjectures of antiquaries about the origin and meaning of this appellation. The most probable opinion seems to be this, that some artists from Germany, who were called Esterlings, from the situation of their country, had been employed in fabricating our money, which consisted chiefly of silver pennies; and that from them the penny was called an esterling, and our money esterling or sterling money.
