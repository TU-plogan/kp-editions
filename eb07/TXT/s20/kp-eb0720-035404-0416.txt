SIMFEROPOL, called formerly Akhmetschet; a city of the province of Tauria in Russia, the capital of that province as well as of a circle of the same name. It stands on an elevated plain, surrounded on all sides by mountains, on the banks of the river Salair. It is divided into the new and the old city; the former is regularly laid out, and contains a public school, and a few offices of the government. The latter is surrounded with high walls, and has narrow and crooked streets without pavement, and is chiefly inhabited by the Tartars. The united towns contain about 1000 houses, and nearly 20,000 inhabitants, from a great variety of nations. It has a Russian, a Greek, and an Armenian church, and three Tartar mosques, with several baths. Lat. 44. 59. Long. 34.1. 5. E. It is 1458 miles from St. Petersburg. It is considered to be unhealthy in summer, owing to a deficiency of good water, and the filthy habits of the Tartar population.
