SOMMEANY, a town of Persia, in the province of Mek ram, and the principal seaport of Lus. It is situated on an elevated bank, at the mouth of the river Pooralee, which forms a bar about a mile from the town, with three fathoms depth at low water, and boats can anchor close to the shore. It is an inconsiderable place, and the inhabitants, with the exception of a few Hindu merchants, subsist by fishing.
