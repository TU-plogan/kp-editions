STARK, William, was born at Manchester in the month of July 1740; but the family from which he sprang was Scotish, and respectable for its antiquity. One of his uncles, John Stark, was minister of Lecropt in Perthshire; and it was under the care of this gentleman that he receiv ed the rudiments of his education, which, when we consider the character of the master, and reflect on the relation between him and his pupil, we may presume was calculated to store the mind of the latter with those virtuous prnciples which influenced his conduct through life. From Lecropt young Stark was sent to the university of Glasgow, where, under the tuition of Dr. Smith and Dr. Black, with other eminent masters, he learned the rudiments of science, and acquired that mathematical accuracy, that logical precision, and that contempt of hypotheses, with which he prosecuted all his future studies. Having chosen physic for his profession, he removed from the university of Glasgow to that of Edinburgh, where he was soon distinguished, and honour ed with the friendship of the late Dr. Cullen; a man who was not more eminently conspicuous for the superiority of his own genius, than quick-sighted in perceiving, and liberal in encouraging, genius in his pupils. Having finished his studies at Edinburgh, though he took there no degree, Mr. Stark, in the year 1765, went to London, and devoted himself entirely to the study of physic and the elements of surgery; and looking upon anatomy as one of the principal pillars of both these arts, he endeavoured to complete with Dr. Hunter what he had begun with Dr.Monro; and under these two eminent teachers he appears to have acquired a high degree of anatomical knowledge. He likewise entered himself, about this time, a pupil at St. George’s hospital; and with what industry he prosecuted this plan, with what success his labours were crowned, may be seen in a series of Clinical and Anatomical Observations, which were made by him during his attendance at the hospital, and were published after his death by his friend Dr. Carmichael Smyth.

In the year 1767 he went to Leyden, where he took the degree of M.D., publishing an inaugural dissertation on the dysentery. On his return to London, he recommenced his studies at the hospital; and when Dr. Black was called to the chemical chair in Edinburgh, which he long filled with so much honour to himself and credit to the university, Dr. Stark was solicited, by several members of the υniversity of Glasgow, to stand as a candidate for their professor ship of the theory and practice of physic, rendered vacant by Dr. Black’s removal to Edinburgh. This, however, he de clined, being influenced by the advice of his English friends, who wished to detain him in London, and having, likewise, some prospects of an appointment in the hospital. In 1769 he commenced a series of experiments on diet, which he was encouraged to undertake by Sir John Pringle and Dr. Franklin, whose friendship he enjoyed, and from whom he received many hints respecting both the plan and its exe cution. These experiments, or rather the imprudent zeal with which he prosecuted them, proved, in the opinion of his friends, fatal to himself; for he began them on the 12th of July 1769 in perfect health and vigour, and from that day, though his health varied, it was seldom if ever good, till the 23d of February 1770, when he died after suffering much uneasiness.
