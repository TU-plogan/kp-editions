SHOUT, Clamour, in antiquity, was frequently used on ecclesiastical, civil, and military occasions, as a sign of approbation, and sometimes of indignation. Thus as Cicero, in an assembly of the people, was exposing the arrogance of Antony, who had had the impudence to cause himself to be inscribed the patron of the Romans, the people on hearing this raised a shout to show their indignation. In the ancientmilitary discipline, shouts were used, first, upon occasion of the generalâ€™s making a speech or harangue to the army from his tribunal. This they did in token of their approving what had been proposed. Secondly, they were used before an engagement, in order to encourage and spirit their own men, and fill the enemy with dread. This was a practice of great antiquity; but, besides, it wants not the authority of reason to support it; for as mankind are endowed with two senses, hearing and seeing, by which fear is raised in the mind, it may be proper to make use of the ear as well as the eye for that purpose. Shouts were also raised in the ancient theatre, when what was acted pleased the spectators. It was usual for those present at the burning of the dead to raise a great shout, and call the dead person by his name, before they set fire to the pile.
