STRYPE, John, a most industrious and meritorious labourer in the department of ecclesiastical and literary history, was born at Stepney on the first of November 1643. His father, John van Stryp, was a native of Brabant, and sought refuge in England on account of his religion. He was a merchant and silk-thrower. The son received his early education at St Paul’s school, where he remained for six years. In 1662 he proceeded to Jesus College, Cambridge, from which he was transferred to Catherine Hall. In 1665, he there took the degree of A.B., and that of A.M. four years afterwards. He was appointed to the perpetual curacy of Theydon-Boys, in the county of Essex, in 1669; but he only retained it for a few months, having been appointed minister of Low Leyton, in the same county. He was elected by the parishioners, whom the patrons had left to make their own choice of a spiritual guide. His emoluments were not secured to him in the usual way, but by a bond for his maintenance entered into by his parishioners. Their annual subscriptions amounted to sixty-nine pounds sterling. Five years after his appointment to that parish, he was licensed by the bishop of London to preach the word of God in Low Leyton; and the bishop’s license was the only credential which he had to produce. This undisturbed enjoyment of questionable rights may be attributed to the favour which the ecclesiastical dignitaries felt for a man who had made many valuable additions to the annals of the church. When far advanced in life, Strype was presented by Archbishop Tenison to the sinecure of Terring in Sussex. He was also appointed to the lectureship of Hackney, which he resigned in 1724. At Hackney he resided, in his old age, under the roof of Mr Harris, an apothecary, who was mar ried to his grand-daughter. In his house he died on the 11th of December 1737, at the patriarchal age of ninety-four.

Strype’s principal works are, The Life of Archbishop Cranmer, 1694, fol.: The Life of Sir Thomas Smith, 1698, 8vo: The Life of Dr John Aylmer, bishop of London, 1761, 8vo: The Life of Sir John Cheke, 1705, 8vo: Annals of the Reformation, 4 vols.; vol. i. 17Ô9, reprinted 1725; vol. ii. 1725; vol. iii. 1728; vol. iv. 1731: The Life of Archbishop Grindal, 1710, fol.: The Life and Letters of Archbishop Parker, 1711, fol.: The Life of Archbishop Whitgift, 1718, fol.: Ecclesiastical Memorials, 1721, 3 vols. fol.

The writings of Strype were for many years neglected, but they are now held in deserved estimation; and they have all been reprinted at the Clarendon press. He is not remarkable for the methodical arrangement of his materials, nor did he ever attain to much proficiency in the art of composition; bût no one ever denied him the praise of diligence and fidelity. Beside these works, he published Lessons for Youth and Old Age, 1699, 12mo. He likewise published the second volume of Dr Lightfoot’s Works, in 1684; and an elaborate edition of Stow’s Survey of London, 1720, 2 vols. fol.
