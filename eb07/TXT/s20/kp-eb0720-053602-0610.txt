SPINDLE, in Geometry, a solid body generated by the revolution of some curve line about its base or double ordinate; in opposition to a conoid, which is generated by the rotation of the curve about its axis or absciss, perpendicular to its ordinate. The spindle is denominated cir cular, elliptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic, according to the figure of its generating curve.
