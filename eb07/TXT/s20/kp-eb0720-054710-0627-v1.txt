SPONGIA, Sponge; a genus of animals. It is fixed, flexible, and very torpid, growing in a variety of forms, com posed either of reticulated fibres, or masses of small spines interwoven together, and clothed with a living gelatinous flesh, full of small mouths or holes on its surface, by which it sucks in and throws out the water. As early as the days of Aristotle, sponges were supposed to possess animal life; the persons employed in collecting them having observed them shrink when torn from the rocks, thus exhibiting symptoms of sensation. The same opinion prevailed in the time of Pliny; but no attention was paid to this subject till Mar sigli examined them, and declared them vegetables. Dr. Peysonell, in a paper which he sent to the Royal Society in the year 1752, and in a second in 1757, affirmed they were not vegetables, but the production of animals; and he has accordingly described the animals, and the process which they performed in making the sponges Mr. Ellis, in the year 1762, was at great pains to discover these animals. For this purpose he dissected the spongia urens, and was surprised to find a great number of small worms of the genus of nereis or sea scolopendre, which had pierced their way through the soft substance of the sponge in quest of a safe retreat. That this was really the case he was fully assured, by inspecting a number of specimens of the same kind of sponge, just fresh from the sea. He put them into a glass filled with sea water; and then, instead of seeing any of the little animals which Dr. Peysonell described, he observed the papillae or small holes with which the papillae are surrounded contract and dilate themselves. He examined another variety of the same species of sponge, and plainly perceived the small tubes inspire and expire the water. He therefore concluded that the sponge is an animal, and that the ends or openings of the branched tubes are the mouths by which it receives its nourishment, and discharges its excrements.
