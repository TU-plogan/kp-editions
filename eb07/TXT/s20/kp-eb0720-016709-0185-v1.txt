SHACKLES, aboard a ship, are those oblong iron rings, bigger at one end than at the other, with which the ports are shut fast, by thrusting the wooden bar of the port through them. There is also a sort of shackles to lift up the hatches with, of a like figure, but smaller. They are fastened at the corners of the hatches.
