SPELMAN, Sir Henry, an eminent antiquary, was descended from an ancient family, and born at Congham, near Lynn in Norfolk, about the year 1561. He was knighted by King James I. who had a particular esteem for him on account of his known capacity for business; and he employed him several times in Ireland in public affairs. When he was about fifty years of age, he went to reside in London; where falling into a study to which his own genius had always inclined him, he collected all such books and MSS. as concerned the subject of antiquities, either fo reign or domestic. In 1626, he published the first part of his well-known “Glossarium Archaiologicum," which he never carried beyond the letter L; because, as some have suggested, he had made remarks under “Magna Charta,” and “Maximum Consilium,” which could not then have appeared without giving offence. Upon his death, all his papers came into the hands of his son Sir John Spelman, a gentleman who had abilities to have completed his father’s design, if death had not prevented him. The second part was after wards published by Sir William Dugdale, but with all the marks of a scanty unfinished performance. The next work which he undertook was an edition of the English Councils; of which he published the first volume in 1639, leaving the second volume, as well of this as of his Glossary, to be published by Dugdale. The second volume appeared in 1664. Spelman wrote several other works relating to ancient laws and customs, and died in 1641. His Treatise concerning Tithes, and his History of Sacrilege, deserve a passing notice. His Posthumous Works were published at Oxford, in folio, in the year 1698, under the inspection of Mr. Gibson, afterwards Bishop of London.
