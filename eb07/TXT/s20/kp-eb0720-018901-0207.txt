SHANNON, the largest river in Ireland, and one of the finest in the British dominions, not only on account of its running two hundred miles, but also of its great depth in most places, and the gentleness of its current, by which it might be made exceedingly serviceable to the improvement of the country, the communication of its inhabitants, and consequently the promoting of inland trade through the greater part of its long course. But the peculiar prerogative of the Shannon is its situation, running from north to south, and separating the province of Connaught from Leinster and Munster, and of consequence dividing the greater part of Ireland into that which lies on the east and west of the river; watering in its passage the valuable counties of Leitrim, Roscommon, Galway, and Clare; the small shire of Longford, Kingâ€™s County, and Meath in Leinster, Tipperary, Limerick, and Kerry in Munster; visiting ten counties in its passage, and having on its banks Leitrim, Jamestown, Lanesborough, Athlone, Clonfert, Killaloe, and Limerick. It at last joins its waters to the sea, being navigable all this way for the largest vessels.
