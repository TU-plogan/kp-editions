STRATEGUS, ςϑατηγος , in Antiquity, an officer among the Athenians, whereof there were turn chosen yearly, to command the troops of the state. Plutarch avers there was one chosen from each tribe; but Pollux seems to say they were chosen indifferently from the people. The people themselves made the choice, on the last day of the year, in a place called Pnyx. The two strategi did not command together, but took their turns day by day, as we find from Herodotus and Cornelius Nepos. Constantine the Great, besides many other privileges granted to the city of Athens, honoured its chief magistrate with the title of M εγας ∑ ετϐατηγος , or the Great General.
