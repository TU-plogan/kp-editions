SERVANT, a term of relation, signifying a person who owes and pays obedience for a certain time to another in quality of a master.

The first sort of servants acknowledged by the laws of England are menial servants, so called from being intra maenia, or domestics. The contract between them and their masters arises upon the hiring.

Another species of servants are called apprentices, from apprendre, to learn; and are usually bound for a term of years, by deed indented, or indentures, to serve their musters, and be maintained and instructed by them.

A third species of servants are labourers, who are only hired by the day or the week, and do not live intra maenia, as part of the family.

There is yet a fourth species of servants, if they may be so called, being rather in a superior or ministerial capacity, such as stewards, factors, and bailiffs; whom, however, the law considers as servants pro tempore, with regard to such of their acts as affect their master’s or employer’s property.
