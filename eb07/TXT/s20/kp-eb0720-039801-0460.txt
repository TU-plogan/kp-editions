It is an elevated plain, over which few hills are to be seen. It contains but few forests, and the soil is generally dry, but by no means unfruitful. There are many small rivulets and rivers, which discharge their waters into either the Don or the Dnieper. The climate is considered healthy, though intensely hot in summer, and as severely cold in winter. The land varies in quality, but much of it is highly productive in com. The inhabitants are of various races, some of them of Little Russian origin, others Cossacs, others from Great Russia, many called colonists, consisting chiefly of Germans or Poles, a tew Kalmucks, and many Jews. The whole population is 718,500, the far greater part of whom adhere to the Greek church, but there are Arminians, Catholics, Lutherans, and a few Mahomedans and Pagans. The province is divided into twelve circles, and contains 15 cities, 547 parishes, with 1180 market-towns and villages. The capital is Charkow, or Kharkow, in latitude 49. 59. 20., and longitude 36. 10. E.
