SECUTORES, a species of gladiators among the Romans, whose arms were a helmet, a shield, and a sword or a leaden bullet. They were armed in this manner, because they had to contend with the retiarii, who were dressed in a short tunic, and bore a three-pointed lance in their left hand, and a net in their right. The retiariue attempted to cast his net over the head of the secutor; and if he succeeded, he drew it together and slew him with his trident; but if he missed his aim, he immediately betook himself to flight, till he could find a second opportunity of entangling his adversary with his net. He was pursued by the secutor, who endeavoured to despatch him in his flight.

Secutores was , also a name given to such gladiators as took the place of those that were killed in the combat, or who engaged the conqueror. This post was usually taken by lot.
