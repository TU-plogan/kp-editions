SUBUNREEKA, a river of Hindustan, which has its source in the province of Bahar, district of Chuta Nagpeor, whence it flows in a south-easterly direction, and after a winding course of 250 miles falls into the Bay of Bengal. It is fordable except in the rainy season. It was the first river of Bengal into which Europeans were allowed to Alter. The channel is now choked up with sand.
