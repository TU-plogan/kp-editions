SLACKEN, in Metallurgy, a term used by miners to express a spongy and semivitrified substance which is mixed with the ores of metals, to prevent their fusion. It is the scoria or scum separated from the surface of the former fusions of metals. To this is frequently added limestone, and sometimes a kind of coarse iron ore, in the running of the poorer gold ores.
