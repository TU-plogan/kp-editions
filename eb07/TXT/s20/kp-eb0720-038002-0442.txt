SKIROS, an island of Turkey, on the western side of the Archipelago, about twenty-three miles from the mainland. It is sixty-three square miles in extent, and contains 1800 Greek inhabitants, who grow oil and cotton, and feed cattle in the valleys between the rocky hills which cover the greater part of the surface. The chief town is of the same name, and has a small harbour.
