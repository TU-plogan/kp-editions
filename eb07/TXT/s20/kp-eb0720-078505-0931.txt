STUTTGART, the capital of the kingdom of Wirtemberg, stands in a beautiful valley, and is surrounded on every side with hills of very moderate elevation, which are clothed to the tops with vineyards. The valley is watered by a clear and rapid but not copious river, which meanders through the walks at the extremity of the city. A great part of the city is composed of fine and modern buildings, and those streets are clean, well paved, and light. The royal palace is an extensive and magnificent pile of building; and the theatre, opera-house, the gymnasium, and the Catholic church, are fine specimens of architecture. Though there are no fortifications, the entrance to the city is through handsome gates, and one of them of most imposing beauty. Besides the gymnasium, there are other institutions for instruction; and the collection of ancient paintings, and the workshop of the sculptor Daneker, will be a treat to an amateur of the fine arts. The inhabitants amounted in 1817 to 26,016, and in 1831 had increased to 31,500. It is a place of little trade beyond what arises from supplying the court and the nobility that resort to it.
