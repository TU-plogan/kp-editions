SESOSTRIS, Sesoosis, Sesoosis, the fifteenth sovereign of the eighteenth dynasty of the Egyptians, is called Rameses by Eusebius, and is said to have reigned during the sixteenth century before the Christian era. At his birth his father is said to have collected all the children born at the same time with him, and to have subjected them to an education which he thought best fitted to render them able to assist his son in his future career. When they had reached the age of puberty, he sent them, under the command of his son, to subdue the inhabitants of Arabia, and afterwards to Libya. On his accession to the throne, he first devoted his attention to the internal affairs of his kingdom, and after having divided i into thirty-six nomi, and appointed governors, he commenced a military career, which only ended when he had subdued the greater part of the world. The Aethiopians, the Gangetic Indians, the Scythians, and the Thracians, with the whole of Asia Minor, acknowledged his sway; and, as memorials of his victories, he erected pillars in the various countries he subdued, some of which were seen by Herodotus. On his return to Egypt[7:20:159] he narrowly escaped being burnt to death by the treachery of his brother, who was Danaus of Greece. He brought home a large body of captives, whom he employed in the erection of public works, and more particularly in constructing canals. He erected two statues representing himself and his wife before the temple of Hephaestos, which were forty-five feet high; and four representing his sons, which were thirty feet high. At his death he was succeeded by his son Pheros.
