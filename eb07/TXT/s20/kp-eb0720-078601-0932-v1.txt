SUAKIN. a seaport town of Nubia, situated on the western coast of the Red Sea, was formerly a place of great wealth and importance, but has long been in a declining state, and is now almost in ruins. Snakin looks better when seen at a distance than on a nearer view; the buildings all white-washed and on an elevated site, and two minarets, giving the town a handsome appearance. Like all the towns in the east, it has narrow and dirty streets. All that remains of its former grandeur is its capacious port, which is capable of containing 200 large vessels, that can anchor close to the island in seven fathoms water; but is so narrow at the mouth as to render an entrance impracticable, except with the most favourable wind. It is rather remarkable that this narrow passage should have so long remained open, considering the clouds of sand which are borne toward it at one season, and the action of the sea continually breaking over it, after having passed over sandbanks. The Turks obtained possession of Suakin at the same time that they occupied the opposite coast of Arabia. In the fifteenth century Suakin was a place of great importance and wealth, the emporium of the Red Sea, and one of the richest cities in the east. It derived its importance from its being in the middle ages the maritime capital of the Turks in the Red Sen, when that empire maintained there a powerful navy. Suakin has declined along with the Turkish power; and its only support is now derived from its being the channel of communication between Arabia and the interior of Africa. Pilgrims and slave-dealers, or persons who combine these two vocations, quit the Nile at Shendi, and proceed through Taka and other districts of Nubia to this port, where they embark for Jidda. They carry with them slaves, with a little ivory and gold, and take Indian goods in return. The surrounding country is arid and barren, and produces no grain except that coarse species called dhonrra nr juwarry. There is abundance of good water, which is preserved in wells and tanks. Fish are cheap and plentiful, and the mullets are particularly fine. Sheep are cheap, and do not cost above a dollar each. But fowls are scarce and dear. The country around, and the coast to a considerable extent, is occupied by a hardy race of Bedouin Arabs, called Suakini. Suakin is supposed to be the Soter Limen of Diodorus, the Theon Scter of Ptolemy; though it is not easy to conceive how these terms, signifying “the safe harbour,” could apply to one of such difficult entrance.
