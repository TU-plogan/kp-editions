SUETONIUS TRANQUILLUS, Caius, a Latin historian, was the son of Suetonius Lenis, who became a military tribune in the reign of the emperor Otho. The son is supposed to have been born about the beginning of the reign of Vespasian. Having betaken himself to the practice of the law, he appears to have acquired reputation as a pleader. He lived on terms of intimacy with the younger Pliny, who recommended him to Trajan as a very learned and upright man, and obtained for him the “jus trium liberorum.” Although he had a wife, he was without children; and a participation of this privilege was of some importance to him in the exercise of his profession. After the death of this emperor, he was appointed secretary to Hadrian; but he was dismissed from his office in consequence of his having manifested a want of due respect for the empress Sabina. After his retirement from public life, he had more leisure to devote himself to literary pursuits. Of that period of Roman history, his principal work, “Vitae duddecim Caesarum,” contains the most curious and characteristic record which has been transmitted to our times. The picture which he exhibits is certainly a very foul one, but on that account is more likely to be true. His lives are not digested according to any order strictly chronological, but it is rather his plan to combine curious, interesting, and characteristic particulars, which serve to mark the progress of the different emperors, most of whom were a disgrace to human nature. Other two works of a slighter texture, “De illustribus Grammaticis liber,” and “De claris Rhetoribus liber,” bear the name of Suetonius. To him are likewise ascribed very brief lives of Terence, Horace, Lucan, Persius, Juvenal, and the elder Pliny.

Suetonius was twice printed at Rome during the same year, 1470, and several other editions appeared at an early period. We pass over these, and hasten to mention the valuable editions of Casaubon, printed at Geneva in quarto in the years 1595 and 1615. His commentary abounds with recondite learning. Another elaborate edition was published by Graevins, Hag. Com. 1672, 4to. It was reprinted at the same place in 1691, and at Utrecht in 1703. This learned editor was soon succeeded by Pitiscus, Traj. ad Ren. 1690, 2 tom. 8vo. Leovard. 1714, 2 tom. 4to. But an edition still more elaborate was produced by the indefatigable Burman, Amst. 1736, 2 tom. 4to. And after no long interval, he was followed by Oudendorp, Lugd. Bat. 1751, 2 tom. 8vo.
