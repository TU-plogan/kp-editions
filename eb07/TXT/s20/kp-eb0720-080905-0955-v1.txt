SUNDERLAND, a large and important seaport town on the east coast of England, in the county of Durham, 268 miles from London by way of Stockton. The municipal boundary includes the townships of Monkwearmouth, Bishopwearmouth, and Southwick, which form an area of 5095 acres. The river Wear, after running through the centre of the borough, falls into the sea. Sunderland proper is situated on the south or right side of the river, and is a[7:20:810] place of considerable antiquity. At the latter end of the twelfth century it received a charter from Bishop Pudsey, which gave it equal privileges with those enjoyed by Newcastle, and from that time it has risen into importance. The town consists of one long street, under the names of Sunderland High Street and Bishopwearmouth High Street, and the two together extend to nearly a mile in length. This continued street is broad, well built, having many respectable shops, and in it are the principal buildings. With this exception, Sunderland presents the appearance of one mass of small houses, of considerable age, crowded together, with interstices of narrow streets and lanes; and here the population is extremely dense. To this crowded state of the population, together with the want of cleanliness, may be traced the fearfid ravages of the cholera in 1832, which first broke out in England at this port. On the outskirts of the town there are some good streets, which are rapidly extending, with excellent houses, and in them the higher class of the inhabitants reside. There are various well frequented literary institutions in the town, to most of which libraries are attached. It contains numerous charitable institutions, which are liberally supported. The great object of interest is the magnificent iron bridge which crosses the Wear, and connects Sunderland with Monkwearmouth. It consists of a single arch of 236 feet in span, formed by small segments of iron, having a height of upwards of 100 feet from the centre of the arch to the surface of the river at low water, which enables vessels of above 300 tons burden to pass under by merely lowering their top-gallants. The projector of the bridge was Rowland Burdon, Esq. of this neighbourhood, who subscribed L.23,000 out of the L.27,000 which it cost. The harbour is constructed at the mouth of the river, by means of two piers of more than 200 yards in length, which form a beautiful promenade. It is defended by a battery, near to which are extensive brick barracks, capable of holding 2000 men. At the end of the north pier there is a lighthouse. The w ater in the harbour is too shallow to admit large vessels, and they are loaded and discharged by means of large boats locally called keels. Great advantages have been gained by the formation of a railway, running through the eastern part of the town, in the direction of the low quay; by which means the coals and other products of the interior are more easily and expeditiously shipped than higher up the river, where great inconvenience was frequently experienced from its crowded state above the existing staiths where the coals are kept. The trade, which is principally in the building of vessels and shipment of coals, is on the increase. Of the former, a hundred can be laid on the stocks at the same time; and when it is mentioned that there are upwards of thirty yards for building ships, five for small craft, and four dry and floating docks, besides a large basin or dock, which is constructed on the left bank, near the mouth of the river, the shipping interest of the port must appear to be of great value. In the year 1836 the number of ships which left the port was 994, with a tonnage of 153,415; and in 1837 they had increased to 1338, with a tonnage of 193,133. The coal-trade employs many vessels and hands. It is calculated that upwards of 2000 seamen belonging to the town are occupied in the trade, besides those employed in the keels. The quantity of coals shipped for home consumption in 1836 was 971,190 tons; for foreign consumption, 170,367 tons. In 1837 the quantity for home use was 931,944 tons; for foreign, 242,252 tons. In addition to those important branches of industry, there are several extensive manufactories for chain-cables, ropes, sail-cloths, salt, glass, and pottery. Lime also forms a considerable part of the trade, upwards of 40,000 tons being annually shipped. The value of the custom-duty received at this port for the year 1836, after deducting all expenses, amounted to L.71,637, and lor the year 1837 L.80,072. The municipal govemment of the borough is vested in a mayor, fourteen aldermen, and forty-one councillors, and it is divided into seven wards. The borough returns two members to parliament. In 1821 the population of Sunderland alone amounted to 14,725, and in 1831 to 17,060. In 1821 the conjoined population amounted to 31,891, and in 1831 to 40,735.
