STEYERMARK, or Steiermark, one of the provinces of the Austrian empire. Its name is derived from an ancient palace at the junction of the Steyer with the Ens, which in the twelfth century was inhabited by a Count Trungau, who was ruler over a part of Carinthia, then an independent duchy. It extends in north latitude from 45° 54' to 47° 50', and in east longitude from 13° 26' to 16° 19', being an extent of 8600 square miles. It comprehends twenty cities, ninety-six market-towns, and 3540 villages, with a population, according to the last census, of 869,000 persons, all adhering to the Catholic church, with the exception of four Lutheran congregations and a few Jews. It is bounded on the north by the province of Lower Ens, on the east by Hungary, on the south by the Illyrian province of Laybach, and on the west by that province and the Upper Ens. The northern and western divisions of the province are covered with the lofty mountains of the Julian Alps, divided into two branches. These mountains in no case reach the line of perpetual snow, the highest of them, called the Grossenberg, being but 8380 feet, and the others from 3250 to 7600 feet. The southern and eastern parts of the province are less elevated, consisting of plains and undulating bills. The mountains give rise to numerous rivulets, which form within it large rivers, all of which terminate in the Danube. The principal of these are the Mur, the Drave, the Ens, and the Raab. There are no extensive lakes, but many of small extent, and some of them in very elevated situations. It abounds in mineral springs, both warm and cold, and containing various combinations of iron, salt, and sulphur; but they are not much repaired to by invalids. One half of the province is covered with woods, which yield fuel and timber for building, and contain abundance of game both of the larger and smaller kind. Of the former kind are roebucks, wild swine, gemsen, and bears, as well as beasts of prey, especially wolves and lynxes. The land in the valleys is fertile and well cultivated, and produces good corn, a great proportion of which is maize, forming the chief food of the labouring classes. More than 60,000 acres are cultivated with vines, which produce tolerable wine. Hemp and flax are sufficiently raised to provide clothing, with the aid of the wool of about 150,000 sheep. The mineral productions are various. Salt is the most considerable in quantity. Iron is produced, and is converted into utensils for internal use, but not for exportation. Silver is raised to the extent of about 60,000 ounces yearly, and likewise some copper, cobalt, alum, vitriol, and sulphur. The commerce is not extensive, except between the upper and lower parts of the province, though some is carried on both with other parts of Germany and with Austrian Italy. One of tile great roads to Lombardy passes through this province. It still retains some privileges respecting the assembling of the states, but they are of little practical efficacy. The capital is Gratz, a city of 40,900 inhabitants.
