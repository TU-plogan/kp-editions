STAFFORD, the county town of Staffordshire, is 135 miles from London. It consists of two parishes, and returns two members to Parliament. It stands on the river Sow, and was once fortified. It is now well built. The principal buildings are the assize hall, the county jail, and the infirmary. It has a good free-school, several almshouses, and on Saturday a good market, well attended. The cabal encourages some trade; but the chief occupation of the inhabitants is making shoes, and some cloth is also made. The population was in 1801, 3927; in 1811, 4898; in 1821, 5775; and in 1831, 6998.
