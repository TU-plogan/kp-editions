SOPHIS, or Sofees, a kind of religious order among the Mahommedans in Persia, answering to what are otherwise called dervises, and among the Arabs and Indians faquirs. Some writers suppose them to be called sophis from a kind of coarse camblet which they wear, called souf, from the city Sonf in Syria, where it is principally manufactured. The more eminent of those sophis are complimented with the title schick, that is, reverend, much as, in Romish coun tries, the religious are called reverend fathers. Schick Sophi, who laid the foundation of the grandeur of the royal house of Persia, was the founder, or rather the restorer, of this order. Ishmael, who conquered Persia, was himself a so phi, and greatly valued himself on that character. He chose all the guards of his person from among the religious of this order, and would have all the great lords of his court sophis. The king of Persia is still grandmaster of the or der, and men of rank continue to enter into it, though it be now fallen under some contempt.
