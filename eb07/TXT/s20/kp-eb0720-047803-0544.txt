SONATA (Ital. ), a piece of music, consisting of various movements for a single instrument, with or without accompaniment. The name has sometimes been given to cer tain vocal compositions, in which all the voices are equally essential. Some of the most remarkable modern sonatas are for the pianoforte, such as those of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Clementi, Dussek, &c. Formerly sonatas were classed as sonate di camera and sonate di chiesa, i.e. chambersonatas and churchsonatas, on account of their difference of style, and the place of performance.
