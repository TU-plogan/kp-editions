SEEKS, or SIKHS, a religious sect settled at Patna, and so called from a word contained in one of the commandments of their founder, which signifies learn thou. In books giving an account of the oriental sects and oriental customs, we find mention made both of the Seeks and the Sikhs; and we are strongly inclined to think that the same tribe is meant to be denominated by both words. If so, however, different authors write very differently of their principles and manners. (See Mr Wilkins’s account of them in the Asiatic Researches.)
