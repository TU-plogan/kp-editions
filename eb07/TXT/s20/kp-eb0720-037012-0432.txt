SIVANA Samudra, an island formed by the river Ca-veny, in the province of north Coimbetoor, about nine miles in length, by one in breadth. It is remarkable for an uncommon grand cataract near it; and it communicates with the continent by a bridge formerly magnificent, and three hundred yards in length, but is now in ruins.
