STRAPADO, or Strappado, a kind of military punishment. The criminalâ€™s hands being tied behind him, he is hoisted up with a rope to the top of a long piece of wood, and again let fall almost to the ground; so that, by the weight of his body in the shock, his arms are dislocated. Sometimes he has to undergo three strapadoes or more.
