SHADWEL, Thomas, descended of an ancient family in Staffordshire, was born in 1640, and educated at Caius College, Cambridge. He was then placed in the Middle Temple to study the laws; and having spent some time there, he travelled abroad. Upon his return home, he became acquainted with the most celebrated persons of wit in that age. He applied himself chiefly to dramatic writing, in which he had great success, and upon the Revolution was made poet laureat and historiographer to King William and Queen Mary, in the room of Mr Dryden. These employments he enjoyed till his death, which happened in 1692. Besides his dramatic writings, he composed several other pieces of poetry, the chief of which are his congratulatory poem on the Prince of Orange’s coming to England, another on Queen Mary, and his translation of Juvenal’s tenth satire. Mr Dryden treats him with great contempt, in his satire called Macflecno. The best judges of that age, however, gave their testimony in favour of his comedies, which have in them fine strokes of humour; the characters are often original, strongly marked, and well sustained. An edition of his works, with some account of his life and writings prefixed, was published in 1720, in four vols. 8vo.
