SHREWSBURY, a town in the liberty of the same name, and the capital of the county of Shropshire, 156 miles from London. It is situated on a peninsula formed by the river Severn, which nearly surrounds it, and over which are two stone bridges. It comprehends three parishes, with a church to each, which were formerly collegiate, namely, St. Alkmands, St. Marys, and St. Chads. The town was in ancient times well fortified, and had a strong castle towards the north, a part of which still remains, and the keep has been converted into a garden. There is a free grammar school, at present in high repute, for communicating classical instruction, which possesses some valuable exhibitions at Cambridge. It is well endowed, and has a good library and neat chapel connected with it. There is a county hall, a jail, two bridewells, and a house of industry. The streets are narrow, and some of them rather steep, and the greater part of the houses are of ancient construction and fashion. It is a borough, and the corporation has extensive judicial power within the liberty, though it is now commonly transferred to the assizes for the county, which are held here. Shrewsbury has some trade by the river Severn, and some by a canal, which connects it with Ellesmere, and other parts of the kingdom. The principal manufactory is that of flannels, many of which, indeed, are woven in Montgomeryshire, and brought to Shrewsbury to be finished, but many are made within the town, and of late years machinery has been extended for that purpose. There are likewise some linens, and some coarse woollen cloths made. The country around is highly fertile, and the two markets, on Wednesday and Saturday, are most abundantly supplied. The town returns two members to parliament, and gives the title of earl to the ancient family of Talbot. The population was, in 1801, 14,739; in 1811, 16,606; in 1821, 19,854; and in 1831, 21,227.
