SISTRUM, or Cistrum, a kind of ancient musical instrument used by the priests of Isis and Osiris. It is described by Spon as of an oval form; in manner of a racket, with three sticks traversing it breadthwise, which playing[7:20:370] freely by the agitation of the whole instrument, yielded a kind of sound which to them seemed melodious. Mr. Malcom takes the sistrum to be no better than a kind of rattle. Oiselius observes, that the sistrum is found represented on several medals, and on talismans.

Sistrum , or Cistrum, an ancient Egyptian musical instrument of percussion. A similar instrument, consisting of moveable metal rods passing through holes in a metal plate, is used in modem military bands.
