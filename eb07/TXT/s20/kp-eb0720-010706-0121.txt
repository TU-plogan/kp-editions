SERGEANT, or S erjeant, at Law, or of the Coif, is the highest degree, taken at the common law, as that of doctor is of the civil law; and as these are supposed to be the most learned and experienced in the practice of the courts, there is one court appointed for them to plead in by themselves, which is the Common Pleas, where the common law of England is most strictly observed. But they are not restricted from pleading in any other court, where the judges, who cannot have that honour till they have taken the degree of sergeant-at-law, call them brothers.

Sergean-tat-Arms, or Mace, an officer appointed to attend the person of the king, to arrest traitors and such persons of quality as offend, and to attend the lord high steward when sitting in judgment on a traitor.

There are four other sergeants-at-arms, created in the same manners one, who attends the lord chancellor; a second, the lord treasurer; a third, the speaker of the House of Commons; and a fourth, the lord mayor of London on solemn occasions.

common Sergeant, an officer in the city of London, who attends the lord mayor and court of aldermen on court days, and is in council with them on all occasions, within and without the precincts or liberties of the city. He takes care of orphansâ€™ estates, either by taking account of them, or by signing their indentures, before these pass the lord mayor and court of aldermen; and he likewise lets and manages the orphan estates, according to his judgment, to the best advantage.
