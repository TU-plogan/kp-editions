SERAPH, or Seraphim, spirits of the highest rank in the hierarchy of angels, who are so called from their being supposed to be the most inflamed with divine love, by their nearer and more immediate attendance at the throne of God, and to communicate their fervour to the remoter and inferior orders. Seraphim is the Hebrew plural of seraph.
