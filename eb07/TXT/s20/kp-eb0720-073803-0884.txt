STOURBRIDGE, a town in the hundred of Halfshire and county of Worcester, 123 miles from London. It stands on the river Stour, over which is a good stone bridge. By a canal it has communication with most parts of the kingdom, and thus distributes its productions, which consist of glass-ware, ironmongery, and pottery. From some excellent clay to be found in the vicinity, the inhabitants make a great number of crucibles. It is an ancient borough, governed by bailiffs and other officers, but sends no members to parliament. It has a market on Fridays. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3431, in 1811 to 4072, in 1821 to 5090, and in 1831 to 6148.
