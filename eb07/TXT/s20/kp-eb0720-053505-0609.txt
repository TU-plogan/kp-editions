SPHEROID, in Geometry, a solid approaching to the figure of a sphere. It is generated by the entire revolution of a semi-ellipsis about its axis. When the revolution is made round the largest axis, the spheroid is called prolate; and when round the shortest, oblate. This last is the figure of the earth, and probably of all the planets.
