STOLE, a sacerdotal ornament worn by the Romish parish priests above their surplice, as a mark of superiority in their respective churches; and by other priests over the alb, at celebrating of mass, in which case it goes across the stomach; and by deacons over the left shoulder, in the form of a scarf. The stole is a broad swath, or slip of stuff, hanging from the neck to the feet, and is marked with three crosses.

Groom of the Stole, the eldest gentleman of the king’s bedchamber, whose office it was to present and put on his majesty’s first garment, or shirt, every morning, and to order the things in the chamber.
