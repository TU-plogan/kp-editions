ULVERSTONE, a market-town in the hundred of Lonsdale, and county of Lancaster, 273 miles from London. It is pleasantly situate, and consists principally of four spacious and well-built streets. Its trade is considcrable, is on the increase, and consists of ore, pig, and bar iron, copper ore, cotton, hats, and other fabrics. The trade has been greatly facilitated by the canal which communicates with the river Leven. There is a yard for ship-building. Besides the parochial church, there are places of worship for various bodies of dissenters. There is a good weekly market, and two fairs are held yearly. The population amounted in 1821 to 4315, and in 1831 to 4876.
