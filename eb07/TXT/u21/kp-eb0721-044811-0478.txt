UNICORN, an animal famous among the ancients, and thought to be the same with the rhinoceros. Sparmann informs us that the figure of the unicon described by the ancients has been found delineated by the Snese Hottentots on the plain surface of a rock in Caftraria, and therefore conjectures that such an animal either does exist at present in the interior parts of Africa, or at least once did so. Father Lobo affirms that he has seen it. Sir John Barrow, in his Travels in Southern Africa, affords additional reason to believe in the existence of this curious animal.
