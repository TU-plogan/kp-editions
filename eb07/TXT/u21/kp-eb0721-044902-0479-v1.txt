UNITED Bretheren, or Unitras Fratrum, a society of Christians, whose chief residence is at Herrnhut, in Saxony. They arc commonly called Moravians, from their original country, and Herrnhuters, from their chief place of residence. Some account of this society has already been given under Herrnhut ; but as that account may not be deemed sufficiently full, we shall here add a summary of their institutions, derived from a communication by one of their own clergy.

Though the church of the United Brethren is episcopal, their bishops possess no elevation of rank or pre-eminent authority, their church being governed by synods or consistories from all the congregations, and by subordinate bodies called conferences. The synods are generally held once in seven years. In the first sitting a president is chosen; and the elders appointed by the former synod to superintend the unity lay down their office, though they still form a part of the assembly, as well ns the bishops, the lay elders, and those ministers who have the inspection of several congregations in one province. Questions of importance, or of which the consequences cannot be foreseen, are decided by lot, though tills is never used till after mature deliberation and fervent prayer. In the synods, the state of the unity, and the concerns of the congregations and missions, are taken into consideration. Towards the conclusion of every synod, a kind of executive board is appointed, called the elders' conference of the unity, consisting of thirteen eiders, and divided into four committees or departments, one for superintending missions into heathen countries, a second for watching over the conduct of congregations, a third for managing the economical concerns of the unity, and a fourth for maintaining the discipline of the society. These conferences are however amenable to a higher committee, called the elders’ conference, the powers of which are very extensive. It appoints and removes every servant in the unity, authorizes the bishops to ordain presbyters or deacons, and to consecrate other bishops, and, in short, possesses the supreme executive power over the whole society.

A bishop of the United Brethren can discharge no office but by the appointment of the synod or of the elders’ conference. Indeed their deacons can perform every office of the bishops except ordination, and appear to confirm young persons when they first become candidates for the communion. Deaconesses are employed for the purpose of privately admonishing their own sex, and visiting them in cases of sickness. There are also lay elders, whose business it is to watch over the constitution and discipline of the unity, to enforce the observance of the laws of the country in which missions are established, and to guard the privileges conferred on the brethren by the government under which they live.

On Sunday, besides the public prayers, one or two sermons are preached in every church; and after the morning service, an exhortation is given to the children. Previously to the holy communion, which is administered on some Sunday once a month, and on Maunday Thursday, each person, before he communicates, must converse on the state of his soul with one of the elders. Love-feasts are frequent; and on Maunday Thursday the society have a solemn footwashing.

Our limits will not permit us to give a systematic view of the doctrinal tenets of the Brethren. Though they acknowledge no other standard of truth than the sacred Scriptures, they adhere to the Augsburg Confession, and speak respectfully of the thirty-nine articles of the church of England. They profess to believe that the kingdom of Christ is not confined to any particular party, community, or church; and they consider themselves as spiritually joined in the bond of Christian love to all who are taught of God, and belong to the universal church of Christ, however much they may differ in forms, which they deem non-essentials. Fora fuller account of this society, see Crantz’s Ancient and Modern History of the Protestant Church of the United Brethren, London, 1780; and An Exposition of Christian Doctrine, as taught in the Protestant Church of the United Brethren, London, 1784.
