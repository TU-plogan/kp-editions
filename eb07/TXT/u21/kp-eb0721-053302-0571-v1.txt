UTRECHT, one of the provinces of the kingdom of Holland. It extends in north latitude from 51° 58' to 52° 17', and in east longitude from 4° 41' to 5° 32'. It is bounded on the north by the province of Holland and by the Zuyder Zee, on the east by Gueldres, on the south by Gueldres and by Holland, and on the west by Holland. It contains 535 square miles, is divided into two circles, those of Utrecht and Amersfort, and the population in 1838 amounted to 140,574. About two thirds of the people are of the Calvinist church, and one third adhere to the Romish communion. In the northern and western parts, and on the borders of the Lech, the land is low and flat; but in the eastern part, between the towns of Utrecht and Amersfort, is a range of hills of slight elevation. The soil in the low parts is rich and fertile, having, like Holland, roost productive meadows, and ploughed land yielding abundant crops of corn. Here and there are some woods, filled with shrubs rather than trees, and several extensive heaths. The chief occupation is agriculture, with breeding cattle, and the making of butter and cheese. The province has a surplus of corn, and that, with the products of the dairy, forms the chief exports. Besides these, they send to other districts honey, wax, wool, tobacco, madder, and some other articles. The tobacco is much valued, especially that of Amersfort, though it is chiefly mixed with the tobacco of America, to give it a peculiar flavour. There are in the towns manufactories of woollen, silk, linen, and cotton goods. Abundance of fuel is supplied by the turf, and transmitted with facility by means of canals. The capital of the province is the city of the same name, as it also is of a circle subdivided into nine cantons. It stands in a pleasant situation on the Old Rhine, which has here become a small stream, by the separation from it of the great body of its water. It is however still navigable for small craft, and is connected by a canal with Amsterdam. The environs, especially near the river, are adorned by many beautiful country-seats, belonging to the rich class of merchants of Amsterdam; and the gardens around them are laid out with great care and taste. The city is large, well built, and fortified; but its defences have been neglected, and are now useless. The most remarkable buildings are, the Dome Kirk, with its lofty tower, from which is an extensive prospect; the royal palace, where, in 1579, the union with Holland was signed, and the peace of 1713, which bears the name of the city; the town-hall, the mint, and the foundling hospital. There are fifteen churches, seven of which belong to the Calvinists, three to the Catholics, and one each to the French Protestants, to the English, to the Remonstrants, to the Lutherans, and to the Mennonites. There is a celebrated university, with nineteen professors and about 600 students; and attached to it is a library, a botanic garden, an observatory, and several museums. The inhabitants amounted in 1838 to 20,390 males and 23,017 females, making together 43,407 persons. The commerce has much declined from its former state, but of late years has received a revival from the introduction of new articles of manufacture, especially those of cotton, of silk, and of goods composed of these two materials together. Here they also make some needles, stockings, serges, refined sugar, and sailcloth. Long. 5. 1. 12. E. Lat. 52. 5. 12. N.
