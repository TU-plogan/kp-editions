URBINO and Pesaro, a delegation or province of the papal dominion in Italy, formed out of the ancient dukedom of Urbino. It is bounded on the north by Forli and the republic of St Marino, on the north-east by the Adriatic Sea, on the south-east by Ancona, on the southwest by Perugia, and on the west by Tuscany. It extends over 1733 square miles, comprehending twelve cities, sixteen market-towns, and 410 hamlets and villages. The population amounts to 216,071 persons. As it extends over a great portion of the Apennines, it is necessarily mountainous. It produces, on the sides of the hills and in the valleys, silk, wine, corn, hemp, flax, fruit, cattle, wax, and honey. The capital is the city of Urbino, which is situated on a hill, and is surrounded with ancient walls and towers. Being the seat of a bishop, it has a cathedral and also several other churches, ten monasteries, and six nunneries. A university was founded here by Pope Clement X., but it has disappeared, though a college is still left, and one of the oldest academies of Italy. The population amounts to 12,200 persons. This city is remarkable as the birth-place of the celebrated artist Raphael. Long. 12. 31. 5. E. Lat. 43. 43. 36. N.
