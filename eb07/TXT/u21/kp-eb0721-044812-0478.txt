UNIEH, a seaport of Asia Minor, on the coast of the Black Sea, situated on a bay, with a range of finely wooded mountains behind. It is mostly built of wood, and, like all eastern towns, is extremely filthy; forming a striking contrast with the beauty of the environs. The inhabitants consist of Turks, Greeks, and Armenians, who carry on a considerable trade with Constantinople and the Crimea. Its exports are cotton stuffs from Tocat and Diarbekir, fruits, and wine; the imports corn and oil from the Crimea, coffee, sugar, and European manufactures from Constantinople. A number of vessels belongs to the port, though none of them exceeds 200 tons burden. Unieh is forty miles east of Samsoon.
