UPTON-ON-SEVERN, a market-town of the county of Worcester, in the hundred of Pershore, 109 miles from London and ten from Worcester. It stands on the right bank of the Severn, over which is a stone bridge of six arches. The town is well built, and has a very neat church, erected in 1758. There is a weekly market on Thursdays, and three annual fairs; but the chief trade is owing to the navigable river on whose bank it is built. The population amounted in 1821 to 2319, and in 1831 to 2343.
