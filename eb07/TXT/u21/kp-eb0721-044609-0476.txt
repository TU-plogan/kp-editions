ULEY, a town of the hundred of Berkeley, in the county of Gloucester, two miles from Dursley and 105 from London. Near to it, on the side of a hill, are the remains of a Roman encampment. The chief occupation is making broad cloths for the East India market, which are afterwards dyed and finished in London. The population amounted in 1821 to 2655, and in 1831 to 2641.
