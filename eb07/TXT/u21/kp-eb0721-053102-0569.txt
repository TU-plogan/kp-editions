URGUNGE, or Urghenz, an extensive tract of territory situated on the Lower Oxus, near its junction with the Aral, and between the lake and the Caspian. It is a wild and desolate tract, traversed by wandering and predatory hordes of Turkomans. The bulk of the population is collected in fortified towns, and is maintained by a few fertile spots. The principal of these is called the “region,” and is about four miles in circuit, surrounded by walls of earth; and the houses are built of the same material. A market is formed by one long street, which is covered above, and here the little trade of the surrounding country is carried on. It has been almost ruined by the devastations of war.
