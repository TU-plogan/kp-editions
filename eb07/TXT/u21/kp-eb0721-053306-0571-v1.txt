UZ, or Uτz, the country and place of residence of Job. In the genealogy of the patriarchs, there are three persons called Uz, any of whom might give this district its name. The first was the grandson of Shem, by his son Aram (Gen. xxii. 23), who, according to Josephus, occupied the Trachonitis and Damascus, to the north of Palestine; but Job was among the sons of the East. Another Uz was the son of Nahor, Abraham’s brother (Gen. x. 21), who, after passing the Euphrates, appears to have removed from Haran of Mesopotamia to Arabia Deserta. The third Uz was a Horite, from Mount Seir (Gen. xxxvi. 28), and thus not of Eber’s posterity. Now the question is, from which of these the country of Job took its name. Not from the first, as is already shown; nor from the second, because his country is always called Seir, or Edom, never Uz; and then called a south, not an east, country, in Scripture. It therefore remains that we look for the country and place of residence of Job in Arabia Deserta, for which there are very probable reasons. The plunderers of Job are called Chaldeans and Sabeans, next neighbours to him. These Sabeans came not from Arabia Felix, but from a nearer Sabe in Arabia Deserta (Ptolemy); and bis friends, except Eliphaz the Themanite, were of Arabia Deserta.
