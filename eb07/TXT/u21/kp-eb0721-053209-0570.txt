USTJUG-WELIKI, a circle of the Russian province Wologda, extending in north latitude from 59° 40' to 64° 40 ’, and in east longitude from 43° 19' to 48° 40'. It is bounded on the north by Solwytschegodsk, on the east by Ustsysolsk, on the south-east by Wiatka, on the south by Nikolsk, and on the west by Totma and Welsk. It comprehends 8338 square miles, and contains 68,350 inhabitants. It is chiefly an elevated plain, the source of most of those streams which unite to form the river Dwina. The climate is raw and the soil poor. It produces flax and hemp, some barley, but the chief products are timber, tar, and pitch. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on the river Suchona, at its junction with the Jug. It is a large place, built after the old Russian fashion, containing five monasteries, twenty-three churches, 2000 houses, and 11,500 inhabitants, employed in coarse manufactures of linen and cloth. It is 1076 miles from St Petersburg. Long. 45. 43. E. Lat. 60. 10. N.
