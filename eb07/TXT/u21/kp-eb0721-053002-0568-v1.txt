UNTERWALDEN, one of the cantons of Switzerland, and one of the most ancient of the confederacy, having been established as an independent state in the year 1308. It is bounded on the north by Lucerne and the lake Lucerne, on the east by Uri, on the south by Berne, and on the west by Lucerne. The extent of it is 198 geographical square miles. It is divided into two parts, called Obwalden and Nidwalden, or the upper and lower forest. The capital of the former is Samen, with 2000 inhabitants. The capital of the latter is Stanz, with a population of 2000. These two divisions form separate states, having similar democratic constitutions, but distinct administrations; and they alternately send deputies to the general assembly of the confederation.

The inhabitants of both are of German origin, and speak a patois of that language. They are a simple pastoral people, attached to their ancient customs, and bigoted to their faith, which is that of the Romish church, under the episcopal jurisdiction of the bishop of Constance. There are thirteen parish churches, and five churches in the same number of monasteries. In 1838 the population amounted to 22,571.

The sovereignty is in the whole of the males above twenty years of age, who assemble on the last Sunday in April, when the government is appointed, and the laws which are proposed by the executive power are agreed to or rejected. Each man is taught the use of arms, and is enrolled as a soldier in the militia. The tax paid to the general confederacy is 1910 francs, and the contingent of men is 383. The chief, called the landammann, is chosen yearly; and the members of the council also resign their offices each year, but are almost always re-chosen. This description of the government applies to both the states which form the canton, though there are some trifling variations between the two divisions.

On the borders of the canton are some of the lofty elevations of the Alps, the most remarkable of which is the Titlis, whose snowy peak is 10,700 feet. Next to it are the Wellenstock and the Jockberge, 1000 feet lower; and several of inferior height, as the Geisburg and Bruning on the boundary of Berne; the Nesselstock and the Pilatus on the frontier of Lucerne; and the Engelberg, the Rothstock, and the Brozen on the borders of Uri. The interior has only lower Alps, ranging from 3000 to 5500 feet in height. There are few rivers of much consequence. The most considerable is the Welch, issuing from the lake of Sarnen, and, after uniting with the Aa, losing itself in the lake of the Four Cantons. The chief productions are potatoes and hemp, with some corn in the valleys, but scarcely sufficient for the consumption. On the side of the Alps, and at a great height, in the summer, there is good pasture, and many cows are bred, and their milk made into cheese. The forests yield much timber. The only trade is the export of butter, cheese, hides, chestnuts, and wood, with which are purchased iron, spirits, and the few foreign articles that are used. There are not any manufactures; and besides keeping the flocks and herds, and cutting the wood, there is no occupation except that of fishing on the lakes. There are several mineral springs; one impregnated with sulphur, at Schwendel, is much frequented. The climate is severe, very hot in the short summer, and dreadfully cold in winter. Fruit trees cease to bear above the elevation of 4000 feet; but chestnuts, which are abundant, are to be found higher than that level.
