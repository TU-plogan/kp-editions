ULM, a city of the kingdom of Wurtemburg, the capital of a circle of the same name in the province of the Danube. It stands on the river Danube, at the point where the Iller and the Blau discharge their waters into that river, and the Danube thus becomes navigable. On [7:21:447]the western side are some lofty hills, which were once crowned with fortifications, but when attacked, were found insufficient means of defence, and whose capture in 1805 led to the disgraceful surrender of an Austrian army of 30,000 men, under General Mack, to the French, commanded by Bonaparte. The town is divided by the rivers, over which are eight bridges. It is an ancient city, contains three Lutheran and two Catholic churches, 1620 houses, and 12,049 inhabitants. Some of the public buildings are remarkable, especially the cathedral, whose interior is very striking, being 417 feet in length and 160 in breadth. It is ornamented with a tower 340 feet in height. The proportions and construction are objects of great admiration. It is furnished with an organ of extraordinary power, having 2952 pipes. Some of the ancient paintings in it are fine specimens of the skill of the Germans in that art at a very early period. The stadthouse, with its mechanical clock and its paintings, is curious and interesting. The trade of Ulm has much declined from its former state when it was one of the Hanse Towns. There is some trade down the Danube, and some barges are built here for that purpose. There are some linen manufactories and some tanneries; but the chief trade is in flour, which is ground at several mills on the three streams that run through and unite in the city. Horticulture is a favourite pursuit of the inhabitants, and furnishes the best of fruits and of culinary vegetables. Long. 9. 53. 1. E. Lat. 48. 23. 45. N.
