UNCTION, in matters of religion, is used for the character conferred on sacred things by anointing them with oil. Unctions are very frequent among the Hebrews. They anointed both their kings and high priests at the ceremony of their inauguration. They also anointed the sacred vessels of the tabernacle and temple, to sanctify and consecrate them to the service of God. The unction of kings is supposed to be a ceremony introduced very late among the Christian princes. It is said that none of the emperors was ever anointed before Justinian or Justin. The emperors of Germany borrowed the practice from those of the eastern empire. King Pepin of France was the first who received the unction. In the ancient Christian church, unction always accompanied the ceremonies of baptism and confirmation. Extreme unction, or the anointing persons in the article of death, was also practised by the ancient Christians, in compliance with the precept of St James, v. 14, 15; and this extreme unction the Romish church has advanced to the dignity of a sacrament. It is administered to none but such as are affected with some mortal disease, or in a decrepit age. It is refused to impenitent persons, as also to criminals. The parts to be anointed are the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the hands, the feet, and the reins. The laity are anointed in the palms of the hands, but priests on the back of them; because the palms of their hands have been already consecrated by ordination. The oil with which the sick person is anointed represents the grace of God, which is poured down into the soul, and the prayer used at the time of anointing expresses tire remission of sins thereby granted to the sick person; for the prayer is this: â€œBy this holy unction, and his own most pious mercy, may the Almighty God forgive thee whatever sins thou hast committed by the sight," when the eyes are anointed; by the hearing, when the ears are anointed; and so of the other senses.
