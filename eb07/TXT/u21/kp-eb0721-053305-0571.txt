UXBRIDGE, a market-town of the county of Middlesex, fifteen miles from London. It is a part of the parish of Hillingdon, in the hundred of Elthorne. It is tolerably built, well paved, and lighted. The river Colne here joins the Grand Junction Canal, and thus forms a water communication with the metropolis. There is an extensive com market on Thursday, and many mills in the vicinity are employed in grinding it, and in preparing the flour for the supply of London. This place is remarkable as the scene of the treaty attempted between Charles I. and his parliament. The house then uÎ²ed has been preserved, but is now occupied as an inn. Near the town are the remains, on Heiling Down, of an ancient encampment, commonly supposed to have been the work of the Britons. This town gives the title of earl to the eldest son of the marquis of Anglesea. The population amounted in 1821 to 2750, and in 1831 to 3043.
