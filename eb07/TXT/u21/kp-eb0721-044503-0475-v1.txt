UBIQUIRARIANS, a word formed from ubique, everywhere, denotes a sect of Lutherans which arose and spread itself in Germany, and whose distinguishing doctrine was, that the body of Jesus Christ is everywhere, or in every place. Brentius, one of the earliest reformers, is said to have first broached this error in 1560. Luther himself in his controversy with Zuinglius, had used some unguarded expressions, which seemed to imply a belief of the omnipresence of the body of Christ; but he afterwards became sensible that this opinion was attended with great difficulties, and particularly that it ought not to be made use of as a proof of Christ’s corporal presence in the eucharist After the death of Luther, this absurd hypothesis was exhibited in a specious and plausible form by Brentius, Chemnitius, and Andreas, who maintained the communication of the properties of Christ’s divinity to his human nature. It is indeed obvious, that every Lutheran who believes the doctrine of consubstantiation, whatever he may pretend, must be an Ubiquitarian. See Supper of the Lord.
