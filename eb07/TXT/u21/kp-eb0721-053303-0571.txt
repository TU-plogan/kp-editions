UTTOXETER, a market-town of the hundred of Tot-monslow, in the county of Stafford, 135 miles from London. It stands on a rising ground on the river Dove, in a district abounding with woods. It is moderately well built; and the church is distinguished by the loftiness of its spire. There is much trade in some branches of hardware, and, by means of the navigable canals, much interchange of commodities with all parts of the kingdom. There is a well-frequented market on Wednesday, and four annual fairs. The population amounted in 1821 to 4658, and in 1831 to 4864.
