UDINE, a city of Austrian Lombardy, the capital of the delegation of Friuli, in the government of Venice. It is surrounded with walls, and stands on the river Roja di Palma, in a hilly country, 350 feet above the level of the sea. It is a well-built city, and kept in good order, but, from the narrowness and crookedness of the streets, has a gloomy appearance. There is however a fine plaza or marketplace, ornamented with a column and statue to commemorate the peace of Campoforraio, which was signed in a village near this city in 1797. It is the seat of an archbishop, has a cathcdral, twelve churches, and several oratories or chapels. The episcopal palace is a fine building, and so is the opera-house; and some others are worthy of notice, though almost hidden by the meaner buildings that surround them. There are public institutions for charitable and educational purposes, but they are for the most part on a contracted scale. The population in 1830 amounted to 17,560 persons, whose chief occupation arises from the breeding of silk-worms, and from the labour of winding and spinning. There are also some manufactures of linen goods, considerable tanneries, and a few paper-mills. The gloomy appearance of the city is somewhat relieved by several fine promenades in the contiguous suburbs. Long. 13. 8. 57. E. Lat. 46. 3. 14. N.
