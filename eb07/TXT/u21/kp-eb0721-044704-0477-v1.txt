ULTRAMONTANE, something beyond the mountains. The term is principally applied in relation to France and Italy, which are separated by the Alps.

ÜLUGH-BEIGH, a learned Tartarian prince, was born in 1393. His real name was Mohammed Taragai; Ulugh-Beigh being only a descriptive appellation, signifying great lord or prince. His father was the sultan Shah Rok, the son of the celebrated Timur, who, after the death of that conqueror, ruled many years in Iran and Turan, that is, Persia and Tartary. In 1407, while his father was yet living, he entered upon the administration of the government, and notwithstanding his youth, acquitted himself in such a manner as to acquire general esteem. He was a remarkable person for the age in which he lived, and was particularly distinguished by his skill in astronomy. The termination of his life was unhappy. His eldest son having rebelled against him, defeated him in a bloody battle fought near Samarcand. To this unworthy son he afterwards ventured to present himself, in the hope of recalling his sense of duty; but such a hope was delusive, and the son ordered him to be put to death. This event, according to D’Herbelot, took place in the year 1450. Of his works, some portions have been printed. Greaves published “Binae Tabulae Geographicaw, una Nassir Eddini, altera Uiug-Beigi.” Lond. 1648, 4to. These tables, in Arabic and Latin, were reprinted in Dr Hudson’s Geographiae Veteris Scriptores Graeci minores, tom. iii. Greaves likewise published, in the same language, “Epochae celebriores, astronomie, historicis, chronologie, Chataiorum, Syro-Graecorum, Arabum, Persarum, Chorasmiorum usitatae: ex traditione Ulugh-Beigi.” Lond. 1650, 4to. From a collation of three Persic manuscripts, Dr Hyde edited “Tabulae Longitudinis et Latitudinis Stellarum Fixarum, cx observatione Vlugbbeighi.” Oxon. 1665, 4to.
