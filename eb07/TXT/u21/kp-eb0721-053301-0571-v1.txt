UTICA, a town of ancient Africa Propria, on the Mediterranean. It was founded by a Tyrian colony, and was older than Carthage; its name, according to Bochart, denoting old. After the destruction of Carthage, it became the capital of all the Roman territories in Africa. According to Strabo, it stood on the same bay with Carthage, at one of the promontories called Apollonium, bounding the bay on the west side, the other to the east, called Hermeia, being at Carthage. Utica became famous by the death of Cato, called Cato Uticensis.
