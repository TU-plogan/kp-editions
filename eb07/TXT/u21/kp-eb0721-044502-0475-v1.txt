UBEDA, a city of Spain, in the province of Andalusia, in the division called the kingdom of Jaen. It is situated in a fertile district, on a gentle elevation, but is well protected from the cold north winds by the loftier elevations of the Sierra Nevada. The vegetable products are, corn, grapes, olives, and especially figs; but from the want of even passable roads, and of access to any of the great cities, there is little inducement to cultivate beyond the demands of the immediate vicinity. The breed of horses is highly valued, as the only article sold beyond the limits of the district. Being a frontier town between the Moors and the Christians so long as the former maintained themselves in Granada, it was the scene of numerous and sanguinary conflicts. Like the other cities in this part of Spain, it has, or perhaps had, a very great number of churches, convents, and nunneries. The inhabitants are stated to be about 16,000, a few of whom are occupied in making coarse woollen stuffs for domestic use. Ubeda is thirty miles from the city of Jaen, and fifty-four miles from Granada. Long. 3. 18. W. Lat. 38.3. N.
