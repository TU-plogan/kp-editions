ZONARAS, Joannes, a miscellaneous Greek writer of considerable note, flourished at Constantinople about the beginning of the twelfth century. Under the emperor Alexius Comnenus, who died in 1118, he rose to the distinction of being nominated great drungarius, ^[1. See Du Cange, Glossarium ad Scriptores Mediae et Inifimae Graecitatis, tom. i. col. 334, voc. Δ goυγγάgιος.] and chief secretary; but after the death of his wife, he retired to a monastery, and there closed his earthly career. His principal work is his X govιχὸν , or Annals, deduced from the creation of the world to the death of his imperial patron. The earlier portion of it we cannot easily suppose to be very important; but that which relates to the history of the Greek empire is not without a considerable share of historical value. The editio princeps was published by Wolfius, Basil. 1557, 3 tom. fol. This was succeeded by the valuable edition of Du Cange, Paris. 1686, 2 tom. fol.; which was reprinted in the Venice edition of the Byzantine historians. Zonaras is well known to canonists by his work, “In Canones S. S. Apostolorum et sacrorum Conciliorum Commentarii.” Lut. Paris. 1618, fol. These commentaries are inserted in Bishop Beveridge’s Pandectae. Some of his works, one in verse, may be found in other collections. See particularly Cotelerii “Ecclesiae Graecae Monumenta,” tom. ii. p. 483, tom. iii. p. 465. A publication more interesting to philologers remains to be specified: “Jo. Zonarae et Photii Lexica, ex codicibus manuscriptis nunc primum edita, observationibus illustrata, et indicibus instructa.’’ Lipsiae, 1808, 3 tom. 4to. The first two volumes contain the lexicon of Zonaras edited by Tittmann; the third volume contains that of Photius edited by Hermann. In the article Photius , this and another important publication have both been overlooked. *** “Φωr∕'ou vo2 ∏αrja⅛ζou Aiξiωv 2uvαγωγη. E codice Galeano descripsit Ricardus Porsonus.” Lond. 1822, 2 part. 8vo.
