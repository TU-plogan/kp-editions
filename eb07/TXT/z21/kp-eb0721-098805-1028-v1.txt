ZINZENDQRF, NIcholas Lewis, Count of, the noted founder of the German religious sect called Moravians or Herrnhutters, or, as they pretend, the restorer of that society, was born in the year 1700. From his own narrative it appears, that when he came of age in 1721, his thoughts were wholly bent on gathering together a little society of believers, among whom he might live, and who should entirely employ themselves in exercises of devotion under him. He accordingly purchased an estate at Ber-tholsdorf in Upper Lusatia, where, being joined by some followers, he gave the cure of the village to a person of his own complexion; and Bertholsdorf soon became conspicuous for a new mode of piety. One Christian David, a carpenter, brought a few proselytes from Moravia: they began a new town about half a league from the village, where Count Zinzendorf fixed his residence among them, and whither great numbers of Moravians flocked and established themselves under his protection; so that in 1732 their number amounted to 600. An adjacent hill, called the Huthberg, gave occasion to these colonists to call their new settlement Huth des Herrn, and afterwards Herrnhuth; which may be interpreted “The guard or protection of the Lord ;” and from this the whole sect have taken their name. The count spared neither pains nor money to propagate his opinions: he went himself over all Europe, and at least twice to America; and sent missionaries throughout the world. He died at Herrnhutt on the 9th of May 1760.
