ZYMOSIMETER (formed from ζύμωσις , fermentation, and μέτϑον , measure) is the name given to an instrument described by Swammerdam in his book De Respiratione, and intended to measure the degree of fermentation occasioned by the mixture of different matters, and the degree of heat which those matters acquire in fermenting. The same instrument has been employed to ascertain the heat or temperament of the blood of animals.
