ZARAGOZA, a city of Spain, in the corregimiento of that name, and the capital of the ancient kingdom of Aragon, It was built by the Roman colonists, and bore the name of Caesar Augusta. It is about 175 miles from Madrid, and the same distance from Valencia. It stands on the right bank of the Ebro, over which are two bridges connecting the city with the suburbs. The streets are narrow, except one, the Cozo or Cosso, which runs the whole length of the town; and the houses are old, and, though not lofty, are highly ornamented. Zaragoza is the seat of an archbishop, and, besides a cathedral, had seventeen churches, and forty religious houses of different orders, for males and for females. One of the churches, called Our Lady of the Pillar, was the most celebrated in Spain, and, except that of Loretto, in Europe, from the number of pilgrims that every year resorted to it for devotional purposes. On a lofty pillar of jasper is an image of the holy virgin, the great object of adoration, and excitement to delusive feelings of devotion. In the rich and highly cultivated plain that surrounds the city, stand the ancient palace of the Alguferia, the residence of the kings of Aragon, and several monasteries.

A little below the city, that magnificent work the Canal of Aragon joins the river Ebro, which runs about 100 miles parallel to that river, and connects the provinces of Aragon and Navarre with the Mediterranean Sea. It is designed to assist commerce as a means of conveyance, and to supply to agriculture water for irrigating the fields. This canal has been constructed by the eminent civil engineer Don Ramon Pignatelli, and 3,250,000 livres had been expended when it was stopped. Had it been continued to Biscay, it would have brought the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Seas into commercial contact.

The great celebrity of this city arises from the firm defences made during two sieges, in the years 1808 and 1809, when the courageous and enduring spirit of an undisciplined and ill-armed population was assailed by two successive French armies, furnished with all that science could contribute to the art of war, and commanded by some of the most distinguished officers belonging to the armies of France.

From the latest accounts of this city, the actual population scarcely amounts to 40,000 persons, though it is capable of housing 150,000.

ZEALAND , one of the provinces of the kingdom of Denmark. It comprehends the large island of that name, in which is Copenhagen, the capital of the kingdom, and the smaller islands of Amak, Saltholm, Syeroe, Omoe, and Aggersoe, near to it, and also the more extensive ones of Moen, Samsoe, and Bornholm. The island is 2790 square miles in extent, and the whole province 3140.

The island is generally a level plain, with few elevations, but is deeply penetrated by arms of the sea, called fiordes, which in appearance are lakes, and, where their shores are clothed with woods, present pleasing prospects. The soil is evidently composed of coral and mussel-shells, which the course of ages has converted into calcareous substances. This is mixed with sand, pebbles, clay, and vegetable matter, and thus is highly fertile in many parts, especially on the south and south-east coasts. It yields moderate crops of wheat and rye, but better of barley and pulse. Flax, rape, and some tobacco, are cultivated; but neither these plants nor the grain is sufficient for the consumption. Butter and cheese, with swine’s flesh, are more abundant, and indeed the dairy is an important branch of rural application. The fishery on the coasts is, next to agriculture, the chief occupation. The chief trade is in the capital, Copenhagen; and the other towns are inconsiderable, except Roskilda, Elsineur, and Kioge, in the former of which, in the cathedral, is the burial-place of the royal family. The climate of the island is very variable, especially in winter, and not generally favourable to longevity. The population in 1834 amounted to 464,607, being an increase since 1801 of 28 per cent.

Zealand , a province of the kingdom of Holland, which, besides the group of islands formed in the river Scheldt, includes a section of the continental dominions. The province extends in north latitude from 51° 14' to 51° 45', and in east longitude from 3° 8' to 4° 2'. The whole extent is 667 square miles. The surface is flat and low, being but a few feet higher than the water at half-flood tide. As the shore in this province is not, as in some others, protected against the sea by sand-hills or downs, it has been found necessary to defend it by artificial walls, which are from fourteen to sixteen feet in height, with a gentle declivity towards the sea, and nearly perpendicular on the land side. In front they have placed stakes, which, by dividing the waves, in some measure break their force.

The soil of the island is uniformly rich; being clayey, with a fruitful loam, which requires but little manure, and scarcely ever disappoints the hopes of the husbandman. All kinds of corn and green crops come to perfection in these soils. As agriculture is thus productive, there is every year a surplus of food. The wheat, especially in South Beveland, is considered the best in the kingdom; besides which, much rye is cultivated, and likewise harley, which is of peculiar excellence for malting. Beans and pease are raised in great quantities, chiefly for export; and flax is raised to a great extent both for home use and for foreign trade. Madder is a valuable article of cultivation, and that of the island Schouwen is in the highest estimation. The annual export of this dye amounts to more than 20,000 quintals. The dairies yield large portions of good cheese and butter, and fatten swine, whose flesh, when pickled, furnishes provision for the shipping. The sheep are small, and their wool indifferently fine. The horses are a heavy breed, but strong and tolerably hardy.

The climate is heavy, moist, and variable, and for strangers very unhealthy, but much less so for the natives. It snows and freezes much less on the islands than on the mainland.

The inhabitants consisted in 1833 of 67,059 males, and 70,203 females; thus making together 137,262, of whom 43,145 were found in the cities, and 94,117 in the villages. The divisions of religion shew 100,747 Protestants, 36,060 Roman Catholics, and 455 Jews. The population had increased in 1837 to 145,542; and, on the whole, they are supposed to be in as easy circumstances as any in the kingdom. They adhere to their ancient customs, manners, and dress, and speak a peculiar dialect of Dutch, nearly approaching to that of the Flemings. Many of them are engaged in fishing and other marine pursuits. Their manufacturing industry is chiefly applied to spinning fine linen yarn; and there are many distilleries, breweries, oil-mills, limekilns, salt-refineries, and establishments for ship-building. The capital is the city of Middelburg, in the island of Walcheren, containing 14,700 inhabitants.
