ZOSIMUS, a historian of Constantinople, who has had various editors, is supposed to have written in the fifth century. He is described as “comes et exadvocatus fisci and from his own work it is evident that he was not a Christian. He wrote the history of the Roman empire from the reign of Augustus to the year 410. The first book contains brief notices of the earlier emperors, ending with Diocletian; but in the other five books his details are more ample. A Latin version of this history was published by Leunclavius in 1576; and in 1581 H. Stephanus added the Greek text of the first two books to his edition of Herodian. All the six books were published by Sylburgius in the third volume of his “Romanae Historiae Scriptores Graeci Minores.” Francof. 1590, fol. This was followed by other editions, of which the best is that of Reitemeier, Lipsiae, 1784, 8vo; Bonnae, 1837, 8vo. The latter impression, forming a volume of Niebuhr’s “Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae,” was superintended by Bekker, who has corrected the errors of the former edition, and has omitted such critical notes as he did not approve. In both these impressions, some annotations of Heyne are added to those of Reitemeier.
