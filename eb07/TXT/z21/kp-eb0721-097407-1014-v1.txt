ZALEUCUS, a famous legislator of the Locrians, and the disciple of Pythagoras, flourished 500 years b. c. He made a law, by which he punished adulterers with the loss of both their eyes; and his son offending, was not absolved from this punishment; yet, to shew the father as well as the just lawgiver, he put out his own right, and his son’s left eye. This example of justice and severity made so strong an impression on the minds of his subjects, that no instance was found of the commission of that crime during the reign of the legislator. It is added, that Zaleucus forbade any wine being given to the sick, on pain of death, unless it was prescribed by the physicians; and that he was so jealous of his laws, that he ordered, that whoever was desirous of changing them, should be obliged, when he made the proposal, to have a cord about his neck, in order that he might be immediately strangled if those alterations were esteemed no better than the laws already established. Diodorus Siculus attributes the same thing to Charondas, legislator of the Sybarites.
