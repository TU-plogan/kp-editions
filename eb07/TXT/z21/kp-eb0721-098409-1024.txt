ZEMPLIN, a circle of Hungary, in the province of the Hither Theiss. It is bounded on the north by Gallicia; on the east by Unghvar and Garasch; on the west by Borsod, Abouigvar, and Saroch; and on the south by Szabolts. It extends over 2244 square miles, and contains twenty-four market-towns and 428 villages, with 27,199 houses, and 233,604 inhabitants, of whom four fifths are catholics, and the remainder of the protestant church. The northern part includes a portion of the Carpathian Mountains, and is sterile; but in the south the soil is good, yielding, among other products, some of the best wine. The capital is the town of the same name, on the river Bodrog. It has an ancient castle, a catholic and a protestant church, and 2800 inhabitants, whose chief trade is in wine. Long. 21. 43. E.
