ZWEIBRUCKEN, better known under the name of Deux Ponts, a beautiful city, once the capital of a principality, but now belonging to the Rhenish province of the kingdom of Bavaria. It stands on the river Erblach, and is surrounded with walls. It is well and regularly built, in a fine situation, with hills and woods around it. The princely residence is in a ruinous condition, and a part of it is converted into a catholic church. Two of the churches are celebrated as fine specimens of architecture. The city contains 7250 inhabitants, employed in making cloths, leather, snuff, and tobacco. The learned society which existed here during the last century, and published some of the best Greek and Roman classics, is extinct.
