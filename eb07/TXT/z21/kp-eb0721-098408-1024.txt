ZEMINDAR, in its original meaning, signifies a great landholder of Bengal; but it is now more strictly applicable to those who have their title constituted or confirmed by a patent or charter from government, by which they hold their lands or zemindaries upon certain conditions. It appears from history, that in times prior to the irruption of the Mahommedans, the rajahs who held their residence at Delhi, and possessed the sovereignty of Hindustan, deputed officers to collect their revenues. The word zemindar is Persian, and that language could have had no currency in the countries of India, until it was introduced by the people of Persia. When the emperor Shehab-ul-Dien Ghory conquered the empire of Hindustan at the end of the 12th century, he left Sultan Cutub-ul-Dien to be his viceroy at Delhi, and administer the government of Hindustan. From that time the customs and practices of the Mahommedans began gradually to be established in India: their armies were sent into the countries of the reduced rajahs, under the command of omrahs, in order to preserve the conquest; and lands were allotted to them to defray the expense. From hence arose the system of jaghiredary in Hindustan. But when these omrah jaghiredars had established their own strength, several of them rebelled against the imperial authority, and aspired to the crown. Thus circumstanced, the emperors, in order to obviate these mischiefs, thought it would be more politic to commit the management of the country to the native Hindus, who had most distinguished themselves by the readiness and constancy of their obedience to the sovereign power.

In pursuance of this plan, districts were allotted to num.

bers of them under a reasonable revenue (Jummah Mon√¢sib), which they were required to pay in money to the governors of the provinces, deputed from the emperor; and in case any one of the omrahs or provincial governors should swerve from his allegiance, the zemindars of that country were to exert themselves in such a manner as should check rebellion, and restore good government. For this purpose, grants of zemindary were severally conferred upon such of the Hindus as were obedient, describing their apportionment of the country; and every person who had received a grant under the authority of the crown, was thereby fully invested with the functions of zemindar.

The functions of a zemindar are, 1st, the preservation and defence of their respective boundaries from traitors and insurgents; 2dly, the tranquillity of the subjects, the abundance of cultivators, and increase of his revenue; 3dly, the punishment of thieves and robbers, the prevention of crimes, and the destruction of highwaymen. The accomplishment of these objects is considered in the royal grant as the discharge of office to the sovereign; and on that account the word office (khidmut) is employed in the Dewanny Sunnud for a zemindary. See Hindustan.
