ZULLICHAU, a city of Prussia, the capital of the circle of the same name in the government of Frankfort on the Oder, and the province of Brandenburg. It stands on a fertile plain, is surrounded with walls and ditches, and contains 760 houses, with 5900 industrious inhabitants, who are employed in making fine cloths, linens, hats, and hosiery, and in breweries and distilleries. It is the place where, of late years, many large and cheap editions of the most popular books in the English language have been printed very correctly; and it furnishes Germany with the writings of Scott, Byron, and others, at a price greatly inferior to that at which they can be imported, and thus contributes to extend the knowledge of our language and literature.
