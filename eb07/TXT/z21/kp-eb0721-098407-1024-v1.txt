ZEMBLA, Nova, a large island in the Arctic Ocean, belonging to Russia, lying between 55° and 77° E. long, and 70° and 78° N. lat. It is about 700 miles in length, with an average breadth of seventy-five miles. No part of this dreary region has any permanent inhabitants, but some districts on the west and south coasts are occasionally visited by fishermen and hunters. The island is intersected in two places by narrow straits, and a prolongation of the Uralian Mountains runs along it from south to north. It chiefly consists of a marshy moss-clad plain, the undisturbed possession of bears, white foxes, and other wild beasts.
