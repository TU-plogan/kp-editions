ZION, or Sion, a very famous mountain, standing on the north side of the city of Jerusalem (Psalm xlviii. 2), containing the upper city, built by King David, where stood the royal palace (Josephus. Psalm xlviii. 2). A part of Zion, situated at its extremity, was called Millo, of or in the city of David (2 Chron. xxxii. 5). Modern travellers who have examined the spot say that Zion is the whole of the mountain on which Jerusalem stands at this day, though not to the extent in which it anciently stood on the same mountain, as appears Psal. ix. 12, 15; lxv. 1; lxxxvii. 2, 3; Is. lxii. 1. It is swelled into several eminences or tops, as Moriah, Acra Bezetha, and Zion, a particular eminence or mount, and Zion proper, &c., encompassed on three sides, east, west, and south, with one continued deep and steep valley; by means of which it was impregnablc on these three sides, and always attacked and taken, according to Josephus, by the enemy on the north side, where Mount Zion became level, and the vales of Gihon and Jehoshaphat gradually lose themselves. This deep and steep valley incontestably constitutes the compass of the old Jerusalem on those three sides, as plainly appears to any person who has been upon the spot. In opposition to the opinion of former travellers, Dr Clarke thinks that the proper Mount Zion is an eminence entirely without the city, on the south side; and in the valley between this and the city he places the holy sepulchre. That part of the valley which lay to the east was called Jehoshaphat’s, having Mount Olivet lying beyond it; that to the south Gehin-non, and that to the west Gihon, from cognominal mountains lying beyond them. At the west end of Gihon, [7:21:989] without the city, stood Golgotha or Calvary. The same traveller thinks that very little credit is due to the names given to the different places and objects by the monks.

There is another Zion, the same with Hermon.
