ZEBID, a city of Arabia, once the capital of Yemen; but its port having fallen into a state of decay, the principal city of the province is now Mocha. The old mosques and minarets still give to the place a magnificent appearance from a distance, and it is still distinguished by an academy, much resorted to by the youth of Yemen. But it is gradually falling into ruins, so that it has become an employment for the people to carry off the stones, which are sold to be elsewhere applied to the purposes of building. Zebid is 52 miles north of Mocha.
