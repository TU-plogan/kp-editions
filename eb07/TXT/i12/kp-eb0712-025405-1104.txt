IMMERSION, that act by which a thing is plunged into water or any other fluid.

Immersion, in Astronomy, is when a star or planet is so near the sun, with regard to our observations, that we cannot see it; being, as it were, enveloped and hid in the rays of that luminary. It also denotes the beginning of an eclipse of the moon, or that moment when the moon begins to be darkened, and to enter into the shadow of the earth.
