ILANCE, a town of Switzerland, in the canton of the Grisons. Though small, it is a kind of capital, being the place where the authorities of the canton assemble. It is in a most picturesque situation, at the foot of a mountain, where the river Glenner falls into the Rhine. It has little or no trade, and the population scarcely amounts to 1000. It is, however, a city, being surrounded with walls.
