ICHTHYOCOLLA, Isinglass, a preparation from the fish known by the name of huso. The word is Greek, formed of 7χSυj, fish, and %oλλα, glue. The method of making isinglass was long a secret in the hands of the Russians. The following account of it was published by Mr Humphrey Jackson, in the 63d volume of the Philosophical Transactions.

“All authors who have hitherto delivered processes for making ichthyocolla, fish-glue, or isinglass, have greatly mistaken both its constituent matter and preparation. To prove this assertion, it may not be improper to recite what Pomet says upon the subject, as he appears to be the principal author, whom the rest have copied. After describing the fish, and referring to a cut engraved from an original in his custody, he says, ‘ As to the manner of making the isinglass, the sinewy parts of the fish are boiled in water till all of them be dissolved that will dissolve; then the gluey liquor is strained, and set to cool. Being cold, the fat is carefully taken off, and the liquor itself boiled to a just consistency, then cut to pieces and made into a twist, bent in form of a crescent as commonly sold; then hung upon a string and carefully dried.’

“From this account, it might be rationally concluded that every species of fish which contained gelatinous principles would yield isinglass; and this parity of reasoning seems to have given rise to the hasty conclusions of those who strenuously vouch for the extraction of isinglass from sturgeon; but as that fish is easily procurable, the negligence of ascertaining the fact by experiment seems inexcusable.

“In my first attempt to discover the constituent parts and manufacture of isinglass, relying too much upon the authority of some chemical authors whose veracity I had experienced in many other instances, I found myself constantly disappointed. Glue, not isinglass, was the result of every process; and although, in the same view, a journey to Russia proved fruitless, yet a steady perseverance in the research proved not only successful as to this object, but in the pursuit to discover a resinous matter plentifully procurable in the British fisheries, which has been found by ample experience to answer similar purposes. It is now no longer a secret that the lakes and rivers in North America are stocked with immense quantities of fish, said to be the same species with those in Muscovy, and yielding the finest isinglass; the fisheries whereof, under due encouragement, would doubtless supply all Europe with this valuable article.

“No artificial heat is necessary to the production of isinglass, neither is the matter dissolved for this purpose; for, as the continuity of its fibres would be destroyed by solution, the mass would become brittle in drying, and snap short asunder, which is always the case with glue, but never with isinglass. The latter, indeed, may be resolved into glue with boiling water; but its fibrous recomposition would be found impractlcable afterwards, and a fibrous texture is one of the most distinguishing characteristics of genuine isinglass.

“A due consideration that an imperfect solution of isinglass, called fining by the brewers, possessed a peculiar property of clarifying malt liquors, induced me to attempt its analysis in cold subacid menstruums. One ounce and a half of good isinglass, steeped a few days in a gallon of stale beer, was converted into good fining, of a remarkable thick consistence; the same quantity of glue, under similar treatment, yielded only a mucilaginous liquor, resembling diluted gum-water, which, instead of clarifying beer, increased both its tenacity and turbidness, and communicated other properties in no respect corresponding with those of genuine fining. On commixing three spoonfuls of the solution of isinglass with a gallon of malt liquor, in a tall cylindrical glass, a vast number of curdly masses became presently formed, by the reciprocal attraction of the particles of isinglass and the feculencies of the beer, which increasing in magnitude and specific gravity, arranged themselves accordingly, and fell in a combined state to the bottom, through the well-known laws of gravitation; for in this case there is no elective attraction, as some have imagined, which bears the least affinity with what frequently occurs in chemical decompositions.

“If what is commercially termed long or short stapled isinglass be steeped a few hours in fair cold water, the untwisted membranes will expand, and re-assume their original beautiful hue,^[1. If the transparent isinglass be held in certain positions to the light, it frequently exhibits beautiful prismatic colours. ] and, by a dexterous address, may be perfectly unfolded. By this simple operation we find that isinglass is nothing more than certain membranous parts of fishes, divested of their native mucosity, rolled and twisted into the forms above mentioned, and dried in open air.

“The sounds or air-bladders of fresh-water fish in general are preferred for this purpose, as being the most transparent, flexible, delicate substances. These constitute the finest sorts of isinglass; those called booh and ordinary staple are made of the intestines, and probably of the peritoneum of the fish. The belluga yields the greatest quantity, as being the largest and most plentiful fish in the Muscovy rivers; but the sounds of all fresh-water fish yield, more or less, fine isinglass, particularly the smaller sorts, found in prodigious quantities in the Caspian Sea, and several hundred miles beyond Astracan, in the Wolga, Yaik, Don, and even as far as Siberia, where it is called kle or kla by the natives, which implies a glutinous matter; it is the basis of the Russian glue, which is preferred to all other kinds for its strength.

“The sounds, which yield the finer isinglass, consist of parallel fibres, and are easily rent longitudinally; but the ordinary sorts are found composed of double membranes, whose fibres cross each other obliquely, resembling the coats of a bladder; hence the former are more readily pervaded and divided with subacid liquors; but the latter, through a peculiar kind of interwoven texture, are with great difficulty torn asunder, and long resist the power of the same menstruum; yet, when duly resolved, are found to act with equal energy in clarifying liquors.

“Isinglass receives its different shapes in the following manner: The parts of which it is composed, particularly the sound, are taken from the fish while sweet and fresh, slit open, washed from their slimy sordes, divested of every thin membrane which envelopes the sound, and then exposed to stiffen a little in the air. In this state they are formed into rolls about the thickness of a finger, and in length according to the intended size of the staple. A thin membrane is generally selected for the centre of the roll, round which the rest are folded alternately; and about half an inch of each extremity of the roll is turned inwards. The due dimensions being thus obtained, the two ends of what is called short staple are pinned together with a small wooden peg; the middle of the roll is then pressed a little downwards, which gives it the resemblance of a heart-shape; and thus it is laid on boards, or hung up in the air to dry. The sounds which compose the long [7:12:150]staple are longer than the former; but the operator lengthens this sort at pleasure, by interfolding the ends of one or more pieces of the sound with each other. The extremities are fastened with a peg, like the former; but the middle part of the roll is bent more considerably downwards, and, in order to preserve the shape of the three obtuse angles thus formed, a piece of round stick, about a quarter of an inch diameter, is fastened in each angle with small wooden pegs, in the same manner as the ends. In this state it is permitted to dry long enough to retain its form, when the pegs and sticks are taken out, and the drying completed; lastly, the pieces of isinglass are colligated in rows, by running pack-thread through the peg-holes, for convenience of package and exportation.

“The membranes of the book sort, being thick and refractory, will not admit a similar formation with the preceding; the pieces, therefore, after their sides are folded inwardly, are bent in the centre, in such manner that the opposite sides resemble the cover of a book, from whence its name; a peg being run across the middle, fastens the sides together, and thus it is dried like the former. This sort is interleaved, and the pegs run across the ends, the better to prevent its unfolding.

“That called cake∙isinglass is formed of the bits and fragments of the staple sorts, put into a flat metalline pan, with a very little water, and heated just enough to make the parts cohere like a pancake when it is dried; but frequently it is overheated, and such pieces, as before observed, are useless in the business of fining. Experience has taught the consumers to reject them.

“Isinglass is best made in the summer, as frost gives it a disagreeable colour, deprives it of weight, and impairs its gelatinous principles; its fashionable forms are unnecessary, and frequently injurious to its native qualities. It is common to find oily putrid matter, and exuvicε of insects, between the implicated membranes, which, through the inattention of the cellarman, often contaminate wines and malt liquors in the act of clarification. These peculiar shapes might probably be introduced originally with a view to conceal and disguise the real substance of isinglass and preserve the monopoly; but, as the mask is now taken off, it cannot be doubted to answer every purpose more effectually in its native state, without any subsequent manufacture whatever, especially to the principal consumers, who hence will be enabled to procure sufficient supply from the British colonies. Until this laudable end can be fully accomplished, and as a species of isinglass more easily produceable from the marine fisheries may probably be more immediately encouraged, it maybe manufactured as follows:

“The sounds of cod and ling bear great analogy with those of the accipenser genus of Linnaeus and Artedi, and are in general so well known as to require no particular description. The Newfoundland and Iceland fishermen split open the fish as soon as taken, and throw the backbones with the sounds annexed in a heap; but previous to incipient putrefaction, the sounds are cut out, washed from their slimes, and salted for use. In cutting out the sounds, the intercostal parts are left behind, which are much the best; the Iceland fishermen are so sensible of this, that they beat the bone upon a block with a thick stick, till the pockets, as they term them, come out easily, and thus preserve the sound entire. If the sounds have been cured with salt, that must be dissolved by steeping them in water before they are prepared for isinglass; the fresh sound must then be laid upon a block of wood, whose surface is a little elliptical, to the end of which a small hair-brush is nailed, and with a saw-knife the membranes on each side of the sound must be scraped off. The knife is rubbed upon the brush occasionally, to clear its teeth; the pockets are cut open with scissars, and perfectly cleansed of the mucous matter with a coarse cloth; the sounds are afterwards washed a few minutes in lime-water, in order to absorb their oily principle, and lastly in clear water. They are then laid upon nets to dry in the air; but if intended to resemble the foreign isinglass, the sounds of cod will only admit of that called book, but those of ling both shapes. The thicker the sounds are, the better the isinglass, colour excepted; but this is immaterial to the brewer, who is its chief consumer.

“This isinglass resolves into fining, like the other sorts, in subacid liquors, as stale beer, cider, old hock, and the like, and in equal quantities produces similar effects upon turbid liquors, except that it falls speedier and closer to the bottom of the vessel, as may be demonstrated in tall cylindrical glasses; but foreign isinglass retains the consistency of fining preferably in warm weather, owing to the greater tenacity of its native mucilage. “Vegetable acids are in every respect best adapted to fining; the mineral acids are too corrosive, and even insalubrious, in common beverage.

“It is remarkable, that during the conversion of isinglass into fining, the acidity of the menstruum seems greatly diminished, at least to taste, not on account of any alkaline property in the isinglass, probably, but by its enveloping the acid particles. It is likewise reduced into jelly with alkaline liquors, which indeed are solvents of all animal matters; even cold lime-water dissolves it into a pulpous magma. Notwithstanding this is inadmissible as fining, on account of the menstruum, it produces admirable effects in other respects; for, on commixture with compositions of plaster, lime, &c. for ornamenting walls exposed to vicissitudes of weather, it adds firmness and permanency to the cement; and if common brick-mortar be worked up with this jelly, it soon becomes almost as hard as the brick itself; but for this purpose it is more commodiously prepared by dissolving it in cold water acidulated with vitriolic acid, in which case the acid quits the jelly, and forms with the lime a selenitic mass, while, at the same time, the jelly being deprived in some measure of its moisture, through the formation of an indissoluble concrete amongst its parts, soon dries, and hardens into a firm body; whence its superior strength and durability are easily comprehended.

“It has long been a prevalent opinion, that sturgeon, on account of its cartilaginous nature, would yield great quantities of isinglass; but, on examination, no part of this fish, except the inner coat of the sound, promised the least success. This being full of rugae, adheres so firmly to the external membrane, which is useless, that the labour of separating them supersedes the advantage. The intestines, however, which in the larger fish extend several yards in length, being cleansed from their mucus and dried, were found surprisingly strong and elastic, resembling cords made with the intestines of other animals, commonly called catgut, and, from some trials, promised superior advantages whcruapplied to mechanic operations.”
