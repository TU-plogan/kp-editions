ISLINGTON, a large parish in the hundred of Ossulton, in the county of Middlesex, one mile and a half from London. It rises in a gentle declivity from the metropolis, but, by the houses connecting with it, appears to be only a prolongation of the city. It is chiefly occupied by persons carrying on trade in London, or by those who have retired from commerce. It contains no very splendid mansions, but a great number of respectable and comfortable dwellings. It contains the hamlets of Upper and Lower Holloway, and part of Newington Green and Kingsland. Being on the great north road, carriages are passing through it at all hours. Besides the parish church it has three others, and chapels for sectaries of every description. The New River passes through the parish, and the Regent’s Canal. The latter, by a tunnel, goes under the principal street, and under the New River, and thus conveys coals and other heavy articles from the Thames at a cheap rate. The New River head, from which a great part of the metropolis is supplied with water, is in this parish, as well as the minor theatre known as Sadler’s Wells. A mineral water here was once frequented for its medicinal qualities, but the fashion seems to be changed, as it is now rarely resorted to. A collegiate institution has been lately founded at Highbury in this parish, for the education of dissenting ministers of the class of Independents. The population of the parish amounted in 1801 to 10,212, in 1811 to 15,065, in 1821 to 22,417, and in 1831 to 37,316.
