INSTITUTES, a book containing the elements of the Roman law. See Civil Law. National Institute of France, was founded by a decree of the new constitution, and opened on the 7th of December 1795. The abolition of royalty naturally suggested to the democratic rulers of France, that it would likewise be proper to abolish every thing which had the remotest connexion with it. Condorcet therefore proposed that the seven old academies, which had the term royal prefixed to them should give way to the establishment of one new academy of arts and sciences, under the title of the National Institute.

The Academy, or Institute, was to consist of two hundred and eighty-eight members, the half of whom were to have their residence in Paris, and the rest in the different departments, with twenty-four foreign members.

This academy was divided into three classes; these were subdivided into sections, and each of these again consisted of twelve members. The first class, consisting of ten sections, were to preside over mathematics, mechanical arts, astronomy, experimental philosophy, chemistrynatural history, botany, anatomy and animal history, medicine and surgery, animal economy, and the veterinary science. The second class, having for its department morality and politics, consisted of six sections, viz. analysis of sensations and ideas, morals, legislature, political economy, history, and geography. The third class, consisting of eight sections, presided over literature and the fine arts, viz. universal grammar, ancient languages, poetry, antiquities, painting, sculpture, architecture, and music. Several volumes of memoirs have been published by each of the classes.

The Institute was new-modelled by Napoleon in 1806, and again on the return of the Bourbons. By a decree of the 21 st of March 1816, it was ordered that the Institute should be composed of four academies; viz. the French Academy, the Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, the Royal Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Some alterations were at the same time made in the number of members, and in other particulars.
