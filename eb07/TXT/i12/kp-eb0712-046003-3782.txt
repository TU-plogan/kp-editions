ISLAMABAD, a town of Bengal, in the district of Chittagong, of which it is the capital. It is situated on the western bank of the Chittagon, near about ten miles from its junction with the sea. It carries on a considerable trade, and ships are also built there, and sent to Calcutta for sale. This town was early known to the Portuguese, by whom it was called Porto Grando. It was taken from the rajah of Arracan by the Moguls in 1666; and was at that period well fortified with 1200 cannon. Its name was changed from Chittagong to Islamabad. In 1689, the English made an unsuccessful assault upon it. Since it was ceded to the British in 1760, the fortifications have been allowed to go into decay. The entrance to the river is dangerous without a pilot, as it has only four fathoms over the bar, and afterwards deepens to from five to seven fathoms. The entrance to the river is in 22° 13 , N. The town stands in long. 91° 42 , E.; lat. 22° 22′ N. This is also the name of a considerable town of Cashmeer, situated on the north side of the river Ihytyur, over which is a wooden bridge eighty yards in length. Its houses are built of stone, with gardens on their roofs; and its principal manufacture is shawls. Lat. 34° 6′ N.; Long. 74° 7′ E.
