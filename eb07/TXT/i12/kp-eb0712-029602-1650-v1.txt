INSTALMENT, a settling or instating any person in a dignity. The word is derived from the Latin in and stallum, a term used for a seat in church, in the choir, or a seat or bench in a court of justice, though Vossius is of opinion that the word is of German origin.

Instalment is likewise used for the ceremony by which the Knights of the Garter are placed in their rank, in the chapel of St George at Windsor.
