ISIACI, priests of the goddess Isis. Dioscorides tells us, that they bore a branch of sea wormwood in their hands instead of olive. They sung the praises of the goddess twice a-day, namely, at the rising of the sun, when they opened her temple, after which they begged alms the rest of the day, and returning at night, they repeated their orisons, and shut up the temple. The Isiaci never covered their feet with any thing but the thin bark of the plant papyrus, which occasioned Prudentius and others to say that they went barefooted. They wore no garments except linen, because Isis was the first who taught mankind the mode of preparing this commodity.
