INCIDENT, in Law, is a thing appertaining to or following another which is principal. A court baron is inseparably incident to a manor, and a court of pie-powders to a fair.

Incident Diligence, in Scotch Law, a warrant granted by a lord ordinary in the Court of Session, for citing witnesses for proving any point, or for production of any writing necessary for preparing the cause for a final determination, or before it goes to a general proof.
