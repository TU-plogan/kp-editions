INSTITUTION, in general, signifies the establishing or founding of something. In the canon and common law, it signifies the investing a clerk with the spiritualities of a rectory or other preferment, which is done by the bishop, who uses the following formula: “I institute you rector of such a church with the cure of souls, and receive your care and mine.”

Institutions, in literary matters, denote a system of elements or rules of any art or science. Thus physical or medical institutions are such as teach the praecognita ne cessary to the practice of medicine, or to the cure of diseases.
