ICKENILD Street is that old Roman highway, so denominated from the Icemans, which extended from Yarmouth in Norfolk, the eastern part of the kingdom of the Iceni, to Barley in Hertfordshire, giving name in the way to several villages, as Ickworth, Icklingham, and Ickleton, in that kingdom. From Barley to Royston it divides the counties of Cambridge and Hertford; from IÏ‚kleford it runs by Tring, crosses Bucks and Oxfordshire, passes the Thames at Goring, and extends to the west, part of England.
