IMAUS, in Ancient Geography, the largest mountain of Asia, and part of Taurus, from which the whole of India runs off into a vast plain, resembling Egypt. It extends through Scythia, as far as to the Mare Glaciale, dividing it into Scythia intra Imaum, and Scythia extra Irnaurn ; and also stretching out along the north of India to the Eastern Ocean, separates it from Scythia.
