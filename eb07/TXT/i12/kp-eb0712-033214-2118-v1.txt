INVENTION denotes the art of finding any thi∏αr new, or even the thing thus found. Thus we say, the invention of gunpowder, the invention of printing, and so on.

Invention is also used for the finding of a thing hidden. The Roman Catholic church celebrates a feast on the 4th of May, under the title of the invention of the holy cross.

Invention is also used for subtilty of mind, or something peculiar to a man’s genius, which leads him to discover things new; in which sense we say, a man of invention. Invention, in Painting, is the choice which the painter makes of the objects that are to enter into the composition of his piece.

Invention, in Poetry, is applied to whatever the poet adds to the history of the subject he has chosen, as well as to the new turn he gives it.

Invention, in Phetoric, signifies the finding out and choosing of certain arguments which the orator is to use for proving or illustrating his point, moving the passions or conciliating the minds of his hearers. Invention, according to Cicero, is the principal part of oratory; and be wrote four books De Inventione, of which we have but two remaining.
