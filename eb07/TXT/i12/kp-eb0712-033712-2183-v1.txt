IOLAIA, a festival at Thebes, the same as that called Heracleia. It was instituted in honour of Hercules and his friend Iolas, who assisted him in conquering the hydra. It continued during several days, on the first of which were offered solemn sacrifices; the next day horse-races and athletic exercises were exhibited; the following day was set apart for wrestling; and the victors were crowned with garlands of myrtle generally used at funeral solemnities. But they were sometimes rewarded with tripods of brass. The place where the exercises were exhibited was called Iolaion, where were to be seen the monument of Amphitryon and the cenotaph of Iolas, who was buried in Sardinia. These monuments were covered with garlands and flowers on the day of the festival.

Iolas, or Iolaus, in Fabulous History, a son of Iphiclus, king of Thessaly, who assisted Hercules in conquering the hydra, and burned with a hot iron the place where the heads had been cut off, to prevent the growth of others. He was restored to youth and vigour by Hebe, at the request of his friend Hercules. Some time afterwards Iolas assisted the Heracleidae against Eurystheus, and killed the tyrant with his own hand. According to Plutarch, Iolas [7:12:338] had a monument in Boeotia and Phocis, where lovers used to go and bind themselves by the most solemn oaths of fidelity, considering the place as sacred to love and friendship. According to Diodorus and Pausanias, Iolas died and was buried in Sardinia, where he had gone to make a settlement at the head of the sons of Hercules by the fifty daughters of Thespius.
