IMPEDIMENTS, in Law, are such hindrances as put a stop or stay to a personâ€™s seeking his right by due course of law. Persons under impediments are those under age or coverture, non compos mentis, in prison, beyond sea, and the like, who, by a saving in our laws, have time to claim and prosecute their rights, after the impediments are removed.
