IONIC Order. See Architecture. Ionic Dialect, in Grammar, a manner of speaking peculiar to the people of Ionia.

Ionic Sect was the first of the ancient sects of philosophers; the others were the Italic and the Eleatic. The founder of the Ionic sect was Thales, a native of Miletus, in Ionia, whence his followers assumed the appellation of Ionic. Thales was succeeded by Anaximander, and the latter by Anaximenes, both of Miletus. Anaxagoras Clazomenius succeeded them, and removed his school from Asia to Athens, where Socrates was his scholar. It was the distinguishing tenet of this sect that water was the principle of all natural things.
