INTEGRAL, or Integrant, in Philosophy, appellations given to parts of bodies which are of a similar nature with the whole. Thus filings of iron have the same nature and properties as bars of iron.

Bodies may be reduced into their integrant parts by triture or grinding, limation or filing, solution, amalgamation, and other processes.

Integral Calculus, in the new analysis, is the reverse of the differential calculus, and is the finding of the integral from a given differential, being similar to the inverse method of fluxions. See Fluxions.
