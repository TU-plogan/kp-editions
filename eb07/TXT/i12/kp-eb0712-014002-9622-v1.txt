IAMBIC, in ancient poetry, a sort of verse, so called from its consisting either wholly, or in a great measure, of iambuses. See Iambus.

Ruddiman makes two kinds of iambic verse, viz. dimeter and trimeter; the former containing four feet, and the latter six. And as to the variety of feet, they consist wholly of iambuses, as in the two following verses of Horace:

Dim. ĩnarļsit aeļstuoļsius|

Trim. Suis[et ijpsa 1lojma viļribusjruit.

Or a dactyle, spondee, anapest, and sometimes a tribrachys, obtain in the odd places; and the tribrachys also in the even places, excepting the last. Examples of all this may be seen in Horace. Thus,
