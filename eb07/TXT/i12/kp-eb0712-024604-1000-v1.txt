ILDEFONSO, a town of Spain, in the province of Segovia. It is situated on the northern declivity of the Guadarama Mountains, 3000 feet above the level of the sea. It contains about 5000 inhabitants, who are mostly employed in making glass in a royal manufactory, which during the Peninsular war was abandoned, but has since been re-established. It was long celebrated for the large size of the mirrors fabricated in it, some of which were twelve feet high and seven feet wide. Here is also a royal palace, generally inhabited by the court in the few hottest months of summer. This palace, called the Granja, from having been originally a barn, has been highly decorated by a valuable gallery of pictures, and many other curiosities. It has also a fine garden laid out in the French taste, and embellished with all kinds of water-works, resembling those constructed at Versailles, but superior, from the river Eresma, which supplies them, descending with great rapidity from the mountain. This place is about forty miles north-west from Madrid, and six miles from Segovia.
