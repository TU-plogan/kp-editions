INCH, a well-known measure of length, being the twelfth part of a foot, and equal to three barleycorns in length.

Inch (contracted from the Gaelic innis, an island), a word prefixed to the names of different places in Scotland and Ireland.

ĪNCH-Colm, or Columba, the isle of Columba, an island situated in the Frith of Forth in Scotland, and famous for its monastery. See Forth.

This monastery was founded about 1123, by Alexander I. In passing the Frith of Forth he was overtaken by a violent storm, which drove him to this island, where he met with the most hospitable reception from a poor hermit, then residing in the chapel of St Columba, and who, for the three days during which the king remained there tempest-bound, entertained him with the milk of his cow and a few shell-fish. His majesty, from the sense of the danger which he had escaped, and in gratitude to the saint to whom he attributed his safety, vowed some token of respect, and accordingly founded here a monastery of Augustines, and dedicated it to St Columba. Allan de Mortimer, lord of Aberdour, who attended Edward III. in his Scotch expedition, bestowed half of those lands on the monks of this island, for the privilege of a family burial-place in their church. The buildings erected in consequence of the piety of Alexander were considerable; and there is still to be seen a large square tower belonging to the church, with the ruins of the church, and of several other buildings. The wealth of this place in the time of Edward III. proved so strong a temptation to his fleet, then lying in the Forth, as to suppress all the horror of sacrilege and respect to the sanctity of the inhabitants. The English landed, and spared not even the furniture more immediately consecrated to divine worship. But due vengeance overtook them; for, in a storm which instantly followed, many of them perished; and those who escaped, struck with the justice of the judgment, vowed to make ample recompense to the injured saint. The tempest ceased, and they performed the promised atonement.

ĪNCH-Keith, a small island situated in the same frith, about midway between the port of Leith and Kinghorn on the opposite shore. See Forth.

This island is said to derive its name from the gallant Keith, who so greatly signalized himself by his valour in 1010, in the battle of Barry, in Angus, against the Danes; after which he received in reward the barony of Keith, in Lothian, and this little island. In 1549 the English fleet, sent by Edward VI. to assist the lords of the congregation against the queen-dowager, landed, and began to fortify this island, the importance of which they became sensible of, after their neglect of securing the port of Leith, so lately in their power. They left here five companies to cover the workmen, under the command of Cotterel; but their operations were soon interrupted by Μ. Desse, general of the French auxiliaries, who took the place, after a gallant defence on the part of the English. The Scotch kept possession of the island for some years; [7:12:258] but at last the fortifications were destroyed by act of parliament, to prevent it from being of any use to the former. The French gave it the name of Lisle des Chevaux, from its property of fattening horses. A light-house, which has proved highly beneficial to the shipping frequenting the Forth, was erected on the island in 1805.

Inch- Garvie, a small island, also lying in the Frith of Forth, near Queensferry. See Forth.
