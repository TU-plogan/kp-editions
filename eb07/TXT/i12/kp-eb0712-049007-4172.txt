IVISA, or IVICA, one of the Balearic Islands, in the Mediterranean Sea, belonging to the crown of Spain. Its inhabitants amount to 15,200. It is about sixteen leagues to the eastward of Cape St Antonia, on the coast of Valencia. Its figure is an irregular polygon, stretching from north-west to south-east twenty-eight miles, and being in breadth fourteen miles. Its capital, of the same name, forms a good port, and is very well fortified. It is well built, and contains, including the suburb called Marina, about 3500 inhabitants. It yields wheat, oil, wine, flax, hemp, figs, almonds, raisins, oranges, lemons, cotton, and esparto, which are exported; but its principal commerce is in salt, which is most copiously formed in the various salt lagunes which surround the coast of the island. There are yearly produced from 130,000 to 170,000 cwts. The inhabitants are more attached to fishing than to agriculture, and the greater portion of the men follow that employment, leaving the care of cultivation to the females, who are robust and industrious. The capital is situated in north latitude 38. 53. 16. and east longitude from London 1. 57. 56.
