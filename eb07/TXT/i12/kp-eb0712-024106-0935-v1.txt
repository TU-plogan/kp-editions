IDA, in Ancient Geography, a mountain situated in the [7:12:242] heart of Crete, being the highest in the island, round, and in compass about sixty stadia (Strabo); the nursing place of Jupiter, and where his tomb was visited in Varro’s time. There was another Ida, a mountain of Mysia, or rather a chain of mountains, extending from Zeleia, on the south of the territory of Cyzicus, to Lectum, the utmost promontory of Troas. The abundance of its waters became the source of many rivers, and particularly of the Simois, Scamander, Aesopus, and Granicus. It was covered with green wood, and the elevation of its top opened an extensive view of the Hellespont, and the adjacent countries; for which reason it was, according to Homer, frequented by the gods during the Trojan war. The top was called Gargara, and celebrated by the poets for the judgment of Paris on the beauty of the three goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus.
