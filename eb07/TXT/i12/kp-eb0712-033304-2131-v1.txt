INVERNESS, the only large town in the county, and usually styled the capital of the Highlands, is finely situated on the banks of the river Ness, where it falls into the Moray Frith. The ancient and principal part of the town is on the east side of the river; but, since the construction of the Caledonian Canal, houses and streets are extending towards the west. Some writers have invested Inverness with a fabulous antiquity. It is certain that it was one of the Pictish capitals, was early incorporated as a free town, and received four charters from William the Lion. In 1412, Inverness was burned by Donald, Lord of the Isles, on his march to the battle of Harlaw. A castle stood to the east of the town, in which Macbeth is said to have murdered King Duncan. This fortress was razed to the ground by Malcolm Ceanmore, and another built on an eminence by the river side, which continued as a royal fortress till blown up by the troops of the Pretender in 1746. This hill is now the site of a beautiful castellated structure, containing the court-house, county-rooms, and record office, built in 1835. In the centre of the burgh is the town-hall, erected in 1708, in front of which is placed the ancient cross of the burgh, and a large circular stone, or collection of stones, bound round with iron hoops, called Clach~na-cuden, or Stone of the Tubs, on which the servants used to rest their pails in carrying water from the river. At the northern extremity of the town are the remains of a fort built by Oliver Cromwell, capable of accommodating 1000 men. The site of this erection, part of the ramparts of which still remain, has been converted into a manufactory for thread and sacks. There are two bridges over the river Ness i one a handsome stone bridge of seven arches, built by public subscription in 1685, and the other a strong wooden bridge, erected about twenty years ago. In 1826, gas was introduced for lighting the town; and in 1830, the supplying it with water, conveyed in pipes from the river, was carried into effect. In 1831 the streets of [7:12:334] Inverness were paved anew with granite, and common sewers made, the whole costing about L.6000. The jail, which is small and inconvenient, was built in 1791, at an expense of L. 1800, and is ornamented with a fine spire, which cost L.1600 more. There are two churches belonging to the establishment, one for English and the other for Gaelic, which is still spoken by the lower class of the inhabitants, especially in the country. It is in contemplation to erect a new church, for which large subscriptions have been received. A handsome Catholic chapcl was erected in 1835. There is a neat Episcopalian chapel, and places of worship for the Seceders, the Independents, and Methodists. Inverness has also a royal academy, at which about 250 pupils attend. Races were formerly held here, but they have been discontinued for several years. There are assembly rooms, elegantly fitted up. There are four banking establishments in Inverness, two weekly newspapers, and two public reading-rooms. No town has improved so rapidly in the arts and embellishments of social life; but its admirable situation for trade has not been sufficiently improved. The steam-boats between Inverness and Glasgow have increased the traffic in this direction; and were a woollen manufactory, or other undertaking of a similar nature, established, the Caledonian Canal and the Moray Frith, affording an unlimited command of water-power in every direction, might be turned to great advantage. The population of the town and parish in 1831 amounted to 14,324, that of the town alonc being 9663. Of the present population, 529 families are chiefly engaged in agriculture, 1015 families employed in trade, and 1766 not included in cither of these classes.
