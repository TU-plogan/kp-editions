INCEST, the crime of illicit commerce between persons who are related in a degree in which marriage is prohibited by the laws of the country. Most nations look on incest with horror.

Incest, Spiritual, a crime committed in like manner between persons who have a spiritual alliance by means of baptism or confirmation.

Spiritual incest is also understood of a vicar, or other beneficiary, who holds two benefices, the one of which depends upon the collation of the other. Such a spiritual incest renders both of these benefices vacant.
