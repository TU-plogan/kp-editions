ICHNOGRAPHY, in perspective, the view of any thing cut off by a plane parallel to the horizon, just at the base of it. The word is derived from the Greek ∕χwf, footstep, and γοαφω, I write, as being a description of the footsteps or traces of a work. Amongst painters it signifies a description of images or of ancient statues of marble and copper, of busts and semibusts, of paintings in fresco, mosaic works, and ancient pieces of miniature.

Ichnography, in Architecture, is a transverse or horizontal section of a building, exhibiting the plot of the whole edifice, and of the several rooms and apartments in any storey, together with the thickness of the walls and partitions; the dimensions of the doors, windows, and chim [7:12:149]neys; and the projectures of the columns and piers, with every thing visible in such a section.
