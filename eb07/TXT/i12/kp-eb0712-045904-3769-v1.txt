ISIAC Table, is one of the most considerable monuments of antiquity discovered at Rome in 1525, and supposed, by the various figures in bas-relief upon it, to represent the feats of Isis, and other Egyptian deities. There have been various opinions as to the antiquity of this monument. Some have supposed that it was engraved long before the time when the Egyptians worshipped the figures of men and women; but others, amongst whom is Bishop Warburton, apprehend that it was made at Rome by persons attached to the worship of Isis. Dr Warburton considers it as one of the most modern of the Egyptian monuments, on account of the great mixture of hieroglyphic characters which it bears.
