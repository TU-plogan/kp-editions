INDULT, in the church of Rome, the power of presenting to benefices granted to certain persons by the pope. Of this kind is the indult of kings and sovereign princes in the Roman Catholic communion, and that of the parliament of Paris granted by several popes. By the concordat for the abolition of the pragmatic sanction, made between Francis I. and Leo X. in 1516, the French king had the power of nominating to bishoprics, and other consistorial benefices within his realm. At the same time, by a particular bull, the pope granted to him the privilege of nominating to the churches of Bretagne and Provence. In 1648 Pope Alexander VIII., and in 1668 Clement IX., granted the king an indult for the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, which had been yielded to him by the treaty of Munster; and in 1668 the same Pope Clement IX. granted him an indult for the benefices in the counties of Rousillon, Artois, and the Netherlands. The cardinals likewise have an indult granted them by agreement between Pope Paul IV. and the sacred college in 1555, which is always confirmed by the popes at the time of their election. By this treaty the cardinals have the free disposal of all the benefices depending on them, and are empowered likewise to bestow a benefice in commendam.
