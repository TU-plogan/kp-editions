INJUNCTION, in Law, a writ generally grounded upon an interlocutory order or decree out of the Court of Chancery or Exchequer, sometimes to give possession to the plaintiff, for want of the defendant’s appearance; some ∙ times to the King’s Ordinary Court, and sometimes to the Court-Christian, to stop proceedings in a cause, upon suggestion made, that the rigour of the law, if it take place, will be against equity and conscience in that case, that the complainant is not able to make his defence in these courts, for want of witnesses. &c., or that they act erroneously, denying him some just advantage. The writ of injunction is directed not only to the party himself, but to all and singular his counsellors, attorneys, and solicitors; and if any attorney, after having been served with an injunction, proceeds afterwards contrary to it, the Court of Chancery will commit the attorney to the Fleet for contempt. But if an injunction be granted by the Court of Chancery in a criminal matter, the Court of King’s Bench may break it, and protect any who proceed in contempt of it.
