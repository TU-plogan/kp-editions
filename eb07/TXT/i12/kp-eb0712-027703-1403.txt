INITIATED, a term properly used in speaking of the religion of the ancient heathens, where it signifies being admitted to the participation of the sacred mysteries. The word comes from the Latin initiatus, from initiare, initiari, which properly signifies to begin sacrificing, or to receive or admit a person to the beginning of the mysteries, or of ceremonies of less importance.

The ancients never discovered the deeper mysteries of their religion, nor even permitted some of their temples to be opened, to any but those who had been initiated. See Mystery.
