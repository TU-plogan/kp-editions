INNUENDO (from innuo, I nod or beckon), is a word frequently used in writs, declarations, and pleadings, to ascertain a person or thing which was named before, but left doubtful, as, he (innuendo, the plaintiff) did so and so; mention being before made of another person. In common conversation or writing, an innuendo denotes an oblique hint or distant reference, in contradistinction to a direct and positive charge.
