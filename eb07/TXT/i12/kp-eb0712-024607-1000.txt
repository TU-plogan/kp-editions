ILFORD, a hamlet properly, but really a town, of the county of Essex, in the hundred of Beacontree. It is within the parish of Barking, but is a chapelry, with its own church. It stands on the great road from London to Yarmouth and Ipswich, at the distance of seven miles from Whitechapel church. The river Roding runs through it in its way to the Thames, in several branches, over which bridges are thrown. The population amounted in 1801 to 1724, in 1811 to 2462, in 1821 to 2972, and in 1831 to 3512.
