ISSUE, in common law, has various applications, being sometimes taken for the children begotten between a man and his wife; sometimes for profits growing from amercements or fines; sometimes for profits of lands and tenements; but more frequently for the point of matter depending in suit, upon which the parties join, and put their cause to the trial of the jury. In all these occasions, issue has but one signification, which is, an effect of a cause preceding; as the children are the effect of the marriage between the parents; the profits growing to the king or lord, from the punishment of any man’s offence, are the effect of his transgression; and the point referred to the trial of twelve men is the effect of pleading, or process.
