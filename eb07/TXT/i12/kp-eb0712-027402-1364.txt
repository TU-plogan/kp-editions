INFRALAPSARII, the name of a sect of predestinarians, who maintain, that God has created a certain number of men only to be damned, without allowing them the means necessary to save themselves, if they would; and they are thus called, because they hold that Godâ€™s decrees were formed infra lapsum, after his knowledge of the fall, and in consequence thereof. The Infralapsarians are contradistinguished from the Supralapsarians.
