INFRALAPSARII, the name of a sect of predestinarians, who maintain, that God has created a certain number of men only to be damned, without allowing them the means necessary to save themselves, if they would; and they are thus called, because they hold that God’s decrees were formed infra lapsum, after his knowledge of the fall, and in consequence thereof. The Infralapsarians are contradistinguished from the Supralapsarians.
