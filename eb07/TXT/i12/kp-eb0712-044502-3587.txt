IROQUOIS, the name given by the French to the confederacy of North American Indians, called by the English the five, and afterwards the six nations. They occupied an extensive tract of country near Lake Ontario, and make a considerable figure in the early history of British America. They are now very greatly reduced. Some of the tribes are extinct; others have made considerable advances in civilization; and others, again, have fallen into a state of squalid misery.
