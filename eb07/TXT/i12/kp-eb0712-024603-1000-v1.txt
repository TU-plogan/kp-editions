ILCHESTER, a small borough town of the county of Somerset, in the hundred of Tintinhull, 122 miles from London. It stands upon the river Ivel, one of the branches of the Parel, which is navigable within three miles of the town. It was once a fortified city, and the remains of the Roman fortifications may still be traced. It is the town where county elections are held, where the jail stands, and where criminals are executed; but the assizes are removed to the larger towns, Wells, Taunton, and Bridgewater. It formerly returned two members to the House of Commons, chosen by the householders, but was disfranchised in 1832. It is remarkable as the birth-place of Roger Bacon. There is a small market on Wednesday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 817, in 1811 to 610, in 1821 to 802, and in 1831 to 1095.
