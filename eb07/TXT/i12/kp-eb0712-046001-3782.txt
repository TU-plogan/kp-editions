ISLA de Leon, a city of Spain, in the kingdom of Seville, and in the province of Andalusia. It is a place generally containing 40,000 inhabitants, but from being within the line of defence of the Spanish troops and the garrison of Cadiz, during the siege it was supposed to contain more than double that number. When the French armies were in possession of the rest of Spain, this city became the refuge of the loyal party, the place of assembly for the national representatives, and the seat of the government. From being near the arsenal of Caraccas, the officers and workmen employed there, found it convenient to take up their residence in this city. The streets are wide, the houses large, the public buildings splendid, and its whole appearance gives it an air of great magnificence. It is separated from the continent by the narrow but navigable river Sante Petri, over which is an ancient bridge called Puente de Zuarzo, generally, but erroneously, believed to have been built by Julius Caesar; it is, however, known to have been erected by Cornelius Balbo the younger, seventeen years before the Christian era. The foundations are now the same as then existed, but the upper works, and some of the arches, were built in 1437∙ On both sides, but especially towards the continent, the river has extensive and boggy marshes, which can only be crossed by means of a narrow causeway, exposed to the attacks of several heavy batteries. The strength of this place, and the secure retreat from it to Cadiz, of still greater strength in case of emergency, made it the natural and valuable asylum of all that remained of freedom in Spain from the year 1810, till the result of the battle of Salamanca compelled the French to evacuate Andalusia. The marshes on the banks of the Sante Petri afford prodigious quantities of salt, crystallized by the heat of the sun. It is piled in heaps of a pyramidical form; and when the rain dissolves the upper part, the sun crystallizes it again, and thus forms a roof of a solid cake of salt, and defends the heap from the future effects of any bad weather. It is permitted to be exported on payment of a very trifling duty, and numerous ships are loaded with it. What is conveyed to the interior becomes the subject of a royal monopoly, and is subject to a very heavy tax. Lat. 38° 53′ 16 ″ N.; Long. 5° 40′ 31" W.
