ISRAEL, the name which the angel gave to Jacob, after having wrestled with him all night at Mahanaim or Penuel (Gen. xxxii. 1, 2, and 28, 29, 30, and Hosea xii. 3). It signifies “a conqueror of God,” or “a prince of God,” or, according to many of the ancients, “a man who sees God.” By the name of Israel is sometimes understood the person of Jacob; sometimes the whole people of Israel, or the whole race of Jacob; and sometimes the kingdom of Israel, or of the ten tribes, distinct from the kingdom of Judah.
