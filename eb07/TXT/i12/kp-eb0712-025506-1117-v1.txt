IMPOSITION of Hands, an ecclesiastical action, by which a bishop lays his hand on the head of a person, in ordination, confirmation, or in benediction. This practice is also observed by the dissenters at the ordination of their ministers, when all the ministers present place their hands on the head of him whom they are ordaining, whilst 1t one of them prays for a blessing on him and his future labours. This they retain as an ancient practice, justified by the example of the apostles, when no extraordinary gifts are conveyed. However, they are not all agreed as to the propriety of this ceremony, nor do they consider it as an essential part of ordination.

Imposition of hands was a Jewish ceremony, introduced not by any divine authority, but by custom; it having been the practice amongst that people, whenever they prayed to God for any person, to lay their hands on his head. Our Saviour observed the same custom, both when he conferred his blessing on children, and when he cured the sick. The apostles likewise laid hands on those upon whom they bestowed the Holy Ghost. The priests observed the same custom when any one was received into their body; and the apostles themselves underwent the imposition of hands afresh every time they entered upon any new design.
