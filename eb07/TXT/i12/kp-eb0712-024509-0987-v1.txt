ILA, Ilay, or Islay, a large island belonging to Argyleshire, and the most southerly of those called the Hebrides. It lies in a westerly direction from the peninsula of Kintyre, distant from it about twelve miles, and is separated on the north from the island of Jura by a small channel. It is twenty-eight miles in length, and at the broadest measures eighteen miles across. Oats and barley are the principal crops raised, and much of the grain is used in the distillation of whisky, for which the island [7:12:246] is celebrated. There are about fourteen distilleries upon it, and the trade thus carried on has been the means of greatly improving the condition of Islay. In 1821 the population amounted to 11,008, and in 1831 to 19,780. See Scotland.
