INDIVISIBLE, amongst metaphysicians. A thing is said to be absolutely indivisible, that is, a simple being, when it consists of no parts into which it can be divided. Thus, God is indivisible in all respects; as is also the human mind, not having extension, nor' other properties of body.

Indivisibles, in Geometry, the elements or principles into which any body or figure may be ultimately resolved, which elements are supposed to be infinitely small. Thus, a line may be said to consist of points, a surface of parallel lines, and a solid of parallel and similar surfaces.
