IRENAEUS, St, a bishop of Lyons, was born in Greece about the year 120 of our era. He was the disciple of Pappias and Polycarp, by whom, it is said, he was sent into Gaul in 157∙ He lived at Lyons, where he performed the office of a priest; and in 178 was sent to Rome, where he disputed with Valentinus, and his two disciples Florinus and Blastus. At his return to Lyons, he succeeded Photinus, bishop of that city; and suffered.martyrdom in 202, under the reign of Severus. He wrote many books in Greek, but there only remains a barbarous Latin version of his five books against heretics, some Greek fragments in different authors, and Pope Victor’s letter mentioned by Eusebius. The best editions of his works are those of Erasmus, in 1526; of Grabe, in 1702; and of Father Massuet, in 1710.

He ought not to be confounded with St Irenaeus the deacon, who, in 275, suffered martyrdom in Tuscany, under the reign of Aurelian; nor with St Irenaeus, bishop of Sir-mich, who suffered martyrdom on the 25th of March 304, during the persecution of Diocletian and Maximianus.
