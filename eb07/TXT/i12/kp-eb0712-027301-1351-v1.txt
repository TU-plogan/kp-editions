INFINITE, that which has neither beginning nor end; in which sense God alone is infinite.

Infinite is also used to signify that which has had a beginning, but will have no end, as angels and human souls. This makes what the schoolmen call infinitum a partepost ; as, on the contrary, by infinitum a parte ante, they mean that which has an end, but had no beginning.

Infinite Quantities. The very idea of magnitudes infinitely great, or such as exceed any assignable quantities, includes a negation of limits; yet if we examine this notion, we shall find that such magnitudes are not equal amongst themselves, but that there are really, besides infinite length and infinite area, three several sorts of infinite solidity, all of which are quantitates sui generis, and that those of each species are in given proportions.

Infinite length, or a line infinitely long, is to be considered either as beginning at a point, and so infinitely extended one way, or else both ways from the same point; m which case the one, which is a beginning infinity, is the one-half of the whole, which is the sum of the beginning and ceasing infinity; or, as may be said, of infinity aparte ante and a parte post, which is analogous to eternity in time and duration, in which there is always as much to follow as is past, from any point or moment of time; nor does the addition or subtraction of finite length, or space of time, alter the case either in infinity or eternity, since both the one or the other cannot be any part of the whole.
