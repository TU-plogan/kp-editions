INTERCESSOR (from inter and cedo, I go between), a person who prays, expostulates, or intercedes, in behalf of another. In the Roman law, intercessor was the name of an officer, whom the governors of provinces appointed principally to raise taxes and other duties.

Intercessor is also a term which was heretofore applied to such bishops as, during the vacancy of a see, administered the bishopric till a successor to the deceased prelate had been elected. The third council of Carthage calls these interventors.
