INFULA, in antiquity, was a mitre worn upon the head by the Grecian and Roman priests, and from which on each side hung a riband. The covering of the head with a mitre was rather a Roman than a Grecian custom, introduced into Italy by Aeneas, who covered his head and face at the performance of sacrifice, lest any ill-boding omen should disturb the rites. The infulae were commonly made of wool, and were not only worn by the priests, but were put upon the horns of the victims, upon the altar and the temple. The infulae were also called υittcc.
