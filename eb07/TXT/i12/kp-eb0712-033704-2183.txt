INVERURY, a royal burgh of Scotland, in the county of Aberdeen, and capital of a parish of the same name. It is pleasantly situated in the angle of land near the confluence of the Urie and Don, at the distance of sixteen miles north-west of Aberdeen. The oldest charter is a Ã¬iovodamus by Queen Mary, narrating that Inverury had been a royal burgh from time immemorial, but that the charter had been lost during the civil wars. Tradition relates that it was granted by Robert Bruce, after he had gained a battle over the English at this place, the first of that series of victories by which that monarch achieved the independence of his country. The town is small, and its trade is only in manufactures for local use. Besides the parish church, there are two dissenting meeting-houses. The population of the burgh and parish amounted in 1821 to 1129, and in 1831 to 14A9.
