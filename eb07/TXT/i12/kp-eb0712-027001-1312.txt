INEBRIANTS, are defined to be such things as affect the nerves in a particular and agreeable manner, and through them alter and disturb the functions of the mind. They are properly divided into natural and artificial; the former being chiefly in use amongst the oriental and other nations, the latter principally amongst those of Europe.

Natural Inebriants, are, 1. Opium, which is in use all over the East; 2. Pcganum harmala, or Syrian rue, the seeds of which are sold in Turkey for this purpose; 3. Maslac of the Turks, or bangue of the Persians, prepared from the dust of the male-flower of hemp, or from the leaves; 4. Bangue of the Indians, from the leaves of the Hibiscus sabdarissa; 5. Seeds of various species of the datura, or thorn-apple; 6. Pinang, or betel of the Indians; 7. Roots of black henbane; 8. The Hyoscyamus physaloides ; 9. Berries of the deadly nightshade; 10. Leaves of milfoil, used by the Da-lekarlians to render their beer intoxicating; 11. Tobacco, and several others less material, such as clary, saffron, and darnel.

Artificial Inebriants, are fermented liquors from farinaceous seeds; and wines and spirits drawn by distillation. With these are ranked the nectar of the gods, and the anodyne medicine of Homer, commonly called nepenthe.
