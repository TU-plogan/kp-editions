IPHICRATES, one of the most celebrated generals of the Athenians, was a man of low origin, who raised himself to the highest rank by his prudence and military talents. The exact date of his birth and death is unknown; but he began to take an active part in the affairs of his country in 392, b. c. when he proceeded with Conon to oppose Agesilaus, who began to threaten the independence of Athens. At this time he defeated a mora of the Lacedemonians, a body of men then the most active and vigorous in Greece. (Xen. Hell. iv. 5, 11—18.) On the death of Thrasybulus, b. c. 389, Iphicrates was appointed to succeed him in the command of the troops on the Hellespont, and there laid siege to Abydos, which was commanded by Nicolochus, the Spartan general; but the result of the siege is not known, (v. 1, 6-7.) For many years we lose sight of Iphicrates; nor does he again appear on the stage till B. c. 374, when we find him commanding the mercenary troops of Persia in Egypt. Next year, when Corcyra was threatened by the united fleets of Sparta and Syracuse, Athens sent to the assistance of this island a fleet of sixty vessels, commanded, first by Timotheus, and afterwards by Iphicrates. The latter, assisted by the orator Callistratus, and Chabrias, attacked and defeated the Syracusans, (vi. 2.) History again fails us, and we hear nothing more of Iphicrates till b. c. 355, when he was sent, along with Timotheus and Chares, to recover Byzantium and some other cities which had revolted. 1he fleet commanded by these three generals was soon in presence of the enemy; and they were preparing to offer battle when a tempest dispersed part of their vessels. Chares wished, nevertheless, that they should engage in battle, but Iphicrates and Timotheus opposed the proposal. On this account they were recalled, and, being accused by Chares and Aristophon of treachery, Timotheus was most unjustly condemned, whilst Iphicrates, who defended himself, not only by his eloquence, but by arming a number of his friends, was acquitted (Nepos, Timoth. et Iphicr.) From that time he quitted the military service of his country. He was married to the daughter of Cotys, king of Thrace, and had by hcr a son named Menestheus.
