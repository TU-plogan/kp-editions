IMMERITTA, or Imiretta, or, as it is sometimes called, Iberia, a country of Asia, to the north of Persia, bounded on the east by Georgia, and on the south by the Mossain Hills; on the north it extends as far as the principal chain of the Caucasus, and on the west the Euxine and the Hippus are the frontier lines. It lies between the 43d and 44th degrees of north latitude. It is in general of a rich soil, but is greatly depopulated and neglected; the few inhabitants in the country being as little inclined to industry as the other inhabitants of the Caucasus. In 1784 it acknowledged the supremacy of Russia, but it is in a great measure independent in its internal government. The manners of the natives are rude and simple. They generally inhabit some secluded spot in woody hills or in pleasant valleys; and here, in contented solitude, the native of Immeritia avoids the incursions of his enemies in his secret retreat. They have a method, however, of calling each other together on important occasions, by means of deep-sounding tones; and on this signal being given, hundreds of people issue from places where no one could have supposed there had been a single creature. They are chiefly of Georgian origin. The principal town is Cotatis, situated on the left bank of the Phasis river; an inconsiderable place, inhabited by about eighty Jewish, Armenian, and Turkish families. The Quirilia is the only river of consequence in Immeritia. It takes its rise in the Soani ridges, and being greatly increased by the snow-streams which descend from the Georgian side of the Caucasus, enters the Phasis in the neighbourhood of Cotatis.
