INVESTITURE, in Law, a giving livery of seisin or possession. There was anciently a great variety of ceremonies used upon investitures, which at first were made by a certain form of words, and afterwards by such things as had the greatest resemblance to the thing to be transferred. Thus, where lands were intended to pass, a turf was delivered by the granter to the grantee. In the church, it was customary for princes to make investiture of ecclesiastical benefices, by delivering to the person they had chosen a pastoral staff and a ring.
