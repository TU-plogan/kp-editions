INTERDICT, an ecclesiastical censure, by which the church of Rome forbids the performance of divine service in a kingdom, province, or town. This censure has frequently been enforced in France, Italy, and Germany; and, in the year 1170, Pope Alexander III. put all England under an interdict, forbidding the clergy to perform any part of divine service, except baptizing infants, taking confessions, and giving absolution to dying penitents. But this censure being liable to the evil consequences of promoting libertinism and a neglect of religion, the succeeding popes have very seldom had recourse to it.

There was also an interdict of persons, who were deprived of the benefit of attending at divine service. Particular persons were also anciently interdicted the use of fire and water, which signified a banishment for some particular offence. By this censure no person was permitted to receive them, or allow them the use of fire or water; and being thus wholly deprived of the two necessary elements of life, they were doubtless under a sentence of proscription.
