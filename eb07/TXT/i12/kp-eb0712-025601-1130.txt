IMPRESSION is applied to the species of objects which are supposed to make some mark or impression on the senses, the mind, and the memory. The peripatetics assert, that bodies emit species resembling them, which are conveyed to the common sensorium, and there rendered intelligible by the active intellect; and, when thus spiritualized, they are called expressions, or express species, as being expressed from the others.

Impression also denotes the edition of a book, meaning thereby the mechanical part only; whereas edition, besides this, includes the care of the editor, who corrected or augmented the copy, adding notes and illustrations to render the work more useful.
