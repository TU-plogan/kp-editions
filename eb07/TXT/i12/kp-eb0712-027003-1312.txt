IN ESSE is applied to things which are actually existing. Authors make a difference between a thing in esse, and a thing in posse. A thing that is not, but may be, they say is in posse, or potentia; but a thing apparent and visible, they say is in esse, that is, it has a real being eÎ¿ instanti, whereas the other is casual, and at best but a possibility.
