IMPOTENCE, or Impotency, in general, denotes want of strength, power, or means, to perform any thing.

Divines and philosophers distinguish two sorts of impotency, natural and moral. The first is a want of some physical principle, necessary to an action, or where a being is absolutely defective, or not free and at liberty to act; the second only imports a great difficulty, as a strong habit to the contrary, a violent passion, or the like.

ImFotency is a term more particularly used to signify a natural inability for coition. Impotence with respect to men is the same as sterility in women There are many causes of impotence, as, a natural defect in the organs of generation, which seldom admits of a cure, and accidents or diseases; in which cases impotence may or may not be remedied, according as these are curable or otherwise. On this subject some curious and original observations by Mr John Hunter may be found in his Treatise on the Venereal Disease. He considers impotency as depending upon two causes, one of which he refers to the mind, and the other to the organs.

Impotency is a canonical disability, to avoid marriage in the spiritual court. The marriage is not void ab initio, but voidable only by sentence of separation during the life of the parties.
