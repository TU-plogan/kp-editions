INNISHIRKAN, an island situated between Cape Clear Island and Baltimore Bay, in the county of Cork, and province of Munster. In this island stood the castle of Dunelong, possessed by the O’Driscolls, which was surrendered to Captain Harvey on the 23d of February 1602, after the defeat of the Spaniards. There was afterwards a regular fortification erected on part of the island, which was garrisoned in Queen Anne’s time, but it has long been dismantled. About a mile to the south are the remains of an ancient abbey, founded 1460, for Franciscans, by Florence O’Driscoll.
