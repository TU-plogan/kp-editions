INDEX, in Anatomy, denotes the fore finger. It is so called from indico I point or direct, because that finger is generally so used; and hence also the extensor indicis is called indicator. Index, in Arithmetic and Algebra, shows to what power any quantity is involved, and is otherwise called its exponent. See Algebra. Index of a Book, is that part annexed to a book, referring to the particular matter or passages therein contained.

Index of a Globe, is a little style fitted on to the north pole, and turning round with it, pointing to certain divisions in the hour-circle. It is sometimes also called gnomon. See Globe. Index Expurgatorius, a catalogue of prohibited books at Rome.
