IGNOMINIA, a species of punishment amongst the Romans, by which the offender suffered public shame, either by virtue of the praetorâ€™s edict, or by order of the censor. This punishment, besides the disgrace, deprived the party of the privilege of bearing any offices, and of almost all the other rights of a Roman citizen.
