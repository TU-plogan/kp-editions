IDLENESS, a reluctance in people to be employed in any kind of work.

Idleness in any person whatsoever is a high offence against the public economy. In China it is a maxim, that if there be a man who does not work, or a woman that is idle, in the empire, somebody mu 1 ,i suffer cold or hunger upon that account, the produce of the lands not being more than sufficient, with culture, to maintain the inhabitants; and therefore, though the idle person may shift off the want from himself, yet it must in the end fall somewhere. The court of Areopagus at Athens likewise punished idleness, and exerted a right of examining every citizen as to the manner in which he spent his time; the intention of this being, that the Athenians, knowing they were to give an account of their occupations, should follow only such as were laudable, and that there might be no room left for those who lived by unlawful arts. The civil law expelled all sturdy vagrant from the city; and, in the English law, all idle persons or vagabonds, whom our ancient statutes describe to be “such as wake on the night and sleep on the day, and haunt customable taverns and ale-houses, and routs about; and no man wot from whence they come, ne whether they go ;” or such as are more particularly described by the statute 17 Geo. II. c. 5, and divided into three classes, namely, idle and disorderly persons, rogues and vagabonds, and incorrigible rogues; all these are offenders against the good order, and blemishes in the government, of any kingdom. They are therefore all punishable by the statute last mentioned; idle and disorderly persons with one month’s imprisonment in the house of correction; rogues and vagabonds w>ith whipping, and imprisonment not exceeding six months; and incorrigible rogues with the like discipline, and confinement not exceeding two years. Persons harbouring vagrants are liable to a fine of forty shillings, and to pay all expenses brought upon the parish thereby; in the same manner as, by our ancient laws, whoever harboured any stranger for more than two nights, was answerable to the public for any offence that might be committed by his inmate.
