INGENUOUS, in a general sense, signifies open, fair, and candid. Ingenuous (fngenuus), in Roman antiquity, an appellation given to persons born of free parents, włļo had never been slaves. The children of the liberti, or persons who had obtained their liberty, were called libertini, not ingenui ; this appellation of ingenuus being reserved for their children, or the third generation.
