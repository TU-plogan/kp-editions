ISSACHAR, one of the divisions of Palestine by tribes, situated to the south of Zabulon, and by a narrow slip reaches the Jordan, between Zabulon and Manassch (Joshua, xix). But whether it reached to the sea, is uncertain. Some hold that it did; but this is an assertion not easy to be proved, as Joshua makes no mention of the sea in this tribe, nor does Josephus extend it farther than to Mount Carmel; and in Joshua (xvii. 10) Asher is said to touch Manassch on the north, which could not be if Issachar extended to the sea.
