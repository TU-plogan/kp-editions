IRVINE, a seaport town and royal burgh of Scotland, in the bailiwick of Cunningham, and county of Ayr; it is agreeably situated at the mouth of a river of the same name on the Frith of Clyde, at the distance of eleven miles north of Ayr, sixty-seven from Edinburgh, twenty-five south-southwest of Glasgow, and six and a half west of Kilmarnock. It is a town of considerable antiquity, as appears by the records of the burgh, Alexander II. having granted a charter to the burgesses, confirming some other royal grants. It is a small but thriving place, consisting, besides smaller streets, of one broad street, running from south-east to northwest the whole length of the town, on the south side of the river, but connected with the town by a bridge. The road leading to the harbour is lined by a row of houses on either side, and mostly inhabited by seafaring people; and the road leading to Ayr is provided with houses in the same way. The bridge of Irvine is the widest and handsomest in the county. This burgh possesses a town-house, a parish church, and three other places of worship. There is an excellent academy, in which the higher branches are taught, a subscription free-school, several private schools, a newsroom, and a subscription library. This port had formerly employed in the herring fishery several busses, that is, vessels fitted out under certain regulations to entitle them to a bounty. At present there are about one hundred vessels belonging to the port, tonnage 11,000, navigated by about seven hundred and thirty men. About twenty-one of these vessels are employed in the North American trade, three or four in the Mediterranean, one to India, and the remainder in the Irish or coast trade. There is a considerable timber and grain trade at this port, and a very extensive coal-trade. In 1834, the quantity of coal exported, principally to Ireland, was 91,462 chalders, equal to about 137,600 tons. The annual revenue of customs is from L.3000 to L.4000. Ship-building, chain, cable, and ropemaking are carried on to some extent in Irvine. As a [7:12:458] royal burgh it is governed by a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, treasurer, and twelve councillors. The population of the town and parish was 7007 in 1821, and 7200 in 1831.
