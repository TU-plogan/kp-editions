INTRENCHMENT, in the military art, is any work which fortifies a post against the attack of an enemy. It is generally taken for a ditch or trench with a parapet. 1ntrenchments are sometimes made of fascines with earth thrown over them, or of gabions, hogsheads, or bags filled with earth, to cover the men from the enemyâ€™s fire.
