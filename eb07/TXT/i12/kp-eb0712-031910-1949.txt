INTERCESSION (intercession was used in ancient Rome for the act of a tribune of the people, or other magistrate, by which he inhibited the acts of other magistrates; and even, in the case of the tribunes, the decrees of the senate. Veto was the solemn word used by the tribunes when they inhibited any decree of the senate, or law proposed to the people. The general principle of these intercessions was, that any magistrate might inhibit the acts of his equal or inferior; but the tribunes had the sole prerogative of controlling the acts of every other magistrate, yet could not themselves be controlled by any.
