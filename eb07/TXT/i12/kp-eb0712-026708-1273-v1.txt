INDIGO, a dye prepared from the leaves and small branches of the Indigofera tiηctoria.

This plant requires a smooth rich soil, well tilled, and not too dry. The seed of it, which, in figure and colour, resembles gunpowder, is sown in little furrows that are about the breadth of the hoe, two or three inches deep, at the distance of a foot from each other, and in as straight a line as possible. Continual attention is required to pluck up the weeds, which would soon choke the plant. Though it may be sown in all seasons, the spring is commonly preferred. Moisture causes this plant to shoot above the surface in three or four days. It is ripe at the end of two months. When it begins to flower, it is cut with pruning-knives; and cut again at the end of every six weeks, if the weather, happen to be a little rainy. It lasts about two years, after which term it degenerates, and is then plucked up, and planted afresh. As this plant soon exhausts the soil, because it does not absorb a sufficient quantity of air and dew to moisten the earth, it is of advantage to the planter to have a vast space which may remain covered with trees, till it become necessary to fell them in order to make room for the indigo.

Indigo is distinguished into two kinds; the true and the bastard. Though tlιe first is sold at a higher price on ac [7:12:268] count of its superiority, it is usually advantageous to cultivate the other, because it is heavier. The first will grow in many different soils; the second succeeds best in those which are most exposed to the rain. Both are liable to great accidents. Sometimes the plant becomes dry, and is destroyed by an insect frequently found on it; at other times, the leaves, which are the valuable part of the plant, are devoured in the space of twenty-four hours by caterpillars. This last misfortune, which is but too common, has given occasion to the saying, that the planters of indigo go to bed rich, and rise in the morning totally ruined.

This production ought to be gathered in with great precaution, for fear of making the farina that lies on the leaves, and is very valuable, fall off by shaking it. When gathered, it is thrown into the steeping-vat, which is a large tub filIed. with water. Here it undergoes a fermentation, which in twenty-four hours at furthest is completed. A cock is then turned to let the water run into the second tub, called the mortar or pounding-dub. The steeping-vat is then cleaned out, that fresh plants may be thrown in; and thus the work is continued without interruption.

The water which has run into the pounding-tub is found impregnated with a very subtile earth, which alone constitutes the dregs or blue substance that is the object of this process, and which must be separated from the useless salt of the plant, because this makes the dregs swim on the surface. To effect this, the water is forcibly agitated with wooden buckets, which are full of holes and fixed to a long handle. This part of the process requires the greatest precautions. If the agitation be discontinued too soon, the part that is used in dyeing, not being sufficiently separated from the salt, would be lost. If, on the other hand, the dye were to be agitated too long after the complete separation, the parts would be brought together again, and form a new combination; and the salt reacting on the dregs would excite a second fermentation, that would alter the dye, spoil its colour, and make what is called burnt indigo. These accidents are prevented by a close attention to the least alterations which the dye undergoes, and by the precaution which the workmen take to draw out a little of it from time to time in a clean vessel. When they perceive that the coloured particles collect by separating from the rest of the liquor, they leave off shaking the buckets, in order to allow time to the blue dregs to precipitate to the bottom of the tub, where they are left to settle till the water is quite clear. Holes made in the tub, at different heights, are then opened one after another, and the useless water is let out.

The blue dregs remaining at the bottom having acquired the consistence of a thick muddy liquid, cocks are then opened, which draw it off into the settler. After it is still more cleared of much superfluous water in this third and last tub, it is drained into sacks, from which, w’hen water no longer filters through the cloth, this matter, now become of a thicker consistence, is put into chests, where it entirely loses its moisture. At the end of three months the indigo is fit for sale.

It is used, in washing, to give a bluish colour to linen; painters also employ it in their water colours; and dyers cannot make fine blue without indigo. The ancients procured it from the East Indies; in modern times, it has been transplanted into America.
