INCA, or Ynca, a name given by the natives of Peru to their kings and princes of the blood. Pedro de Cieca, in his Chronicles of Peru, speaking of the origin of the Incas, states that that country was, for a long time, the theatre of all manner of crimes, of war, dissension, and the most dreadful disorders, till at last two brothers appeared, one of whom, called Mangocapa, having built the city of Cusco, made laws, and established order and harmony by his wise regulations, took the name of Inca, which signifies king or great lord; and this name descended to his posterity.
