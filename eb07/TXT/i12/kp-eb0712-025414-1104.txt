IMPEACHMENT, an accusation and prosecution for treason and other high crimes and misdemeanours. Any member of the lower house of parliament may impeach any one belonging either to that body or to the House of Lords. The method of proceeding is to exhibit articles on behalf of the Commons, by whom managers are appointed to make good their charge. These articles are carried to the Lords, by whom every person impeached by the Commons is always tried; and if they find him guilty, no pardon under the great seal can be pleaded to such an impeachment. 12 Will. III. cap. ii.
