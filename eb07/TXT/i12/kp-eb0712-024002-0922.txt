ICHTHYPERIA, a term in Natural History, applied to the bony palates and mouths of fishes, usually met with either fossil, in single pieces, or in fragments. They are of the same substance with the bufonitae; and are of various figures, some being broad and short, others longer and slender, some gibbose, and others plainly arched. They are likewise of various sizes, from the tenth of an inch to two inches in length, and an inch in breadth.
