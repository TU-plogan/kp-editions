IDOMENEUS, in fabulous history, succeeded his father Deucalion on the throne of Crete. He accompanied the Greeks to the Trojan war with a fleet of ninety ships. During this celebrated war he rendered himself famous by his valour, and slaughtered many of the enemy. At his return from the Trojan war, he made a vow to Neptune in a tempest, that if he escaped from the fury of the seas and storms, he would offer to the god whatever living creature first presented itself to his eye on the Cretan shore. This was no other than his own son, who came to congratulate his father upon his safe return. Idomeneus performed his promise to the god; and thę inhumanity and rashness of this sacrifice rendered him so odious in the eyes of his subjects, that he left Crete, and having gone in quest of a settlement, landed in Italy, where he founded a city on the coast of Calabria, which he called Salentum. He died in extreme old age, after he had had the satisfaction of seeing his new kingdom flourish, and [7:12:244] his subjects happy. According to the Greek scholiast of Lycophron (v. 1217), Idomeneus, during his absence in the Trojan war, intrusted the management of his kingdom to Leucos, to whom he promised his daughter Clisithere in marriage at his return. Leucos at first governed with moderation, but he was persuaded by Nauplius, king of Euboea, to put to death Meda, the wife of his master, with her daughter Clisithere, and to seize the kingdom. By these violent measures he so strengthened himself on the throne of Crete, that Idomeneus at his return found it impossible to expel the usurper.
