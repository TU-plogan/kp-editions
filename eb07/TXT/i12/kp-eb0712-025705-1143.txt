INCENSE, or Frankincense, in the Materia Medica, a dry resinous substance, known amongst authors by the names tus and olibanum.

Incense is a perfume with which the Pagans and the Roman Catholics still perfume their temples and altars. The word comes from the Latin incensum, that is, burned, by taking the effect for the thing itself.

The burning of incense formed part of the daily service of the ancient Jewish church. The priests having drawn lots to ascertain who should offer it, the person destined took a large silver dish, in which was a censer full of incense; and being accompanied by another priest carrying some live coals from the altar, went into the temple, where, in order to give notice to the people, they struck upon an instrument of brass placed between the temple and the altar; and being returned to the altar, he who brought the fire left it there, and went away. Then the offerer of incense having said a prayer or two, waited the signal, which was the burning of the holocaust; immediately after which he set fire to the incense, the multitude continuing all the time in prayer.
