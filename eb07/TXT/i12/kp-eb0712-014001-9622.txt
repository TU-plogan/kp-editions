I or i, the ninth letter and third vowel of the alphabet, is pronounced by throwing the breath suddenly against the palate, as it conies out of the larynx, with a small hollowing of the tongue, and nearly the same opening of the lips as in pronouncing a or e. Its sound varies; in some wordsit is long, as high, mind ; in others short, as bid, hid, sin ; in others, again, it is pronounced like y, as in collier, onion ; and in a few it sounds like ee, as in machine, magazine, and the like. No English word ends in i, e being either added to it, or else the i turned into y. But besides the vowel, there is the jod consonant, which, because of its different pronunciation, has likewise a different form, thus, J, j. In English it has the soft sound of g; nor is it used excepting when g soft is required before vowels, where g is usually hard. Thus we say, jack, jet, join, instead of gach, get, goin, which would be contrary to the genius of the English language.

I, used as a numeral, signifies one, and stands for as many units as it is times repeated: thus I. one, II. two, III. three; and when put before a higher numeral, it subtracts itself, as IV. four, IX. nine, and so on. But when placed after it, as many are added to the higher numeral as there are l’s added. Thus, VI. is 5 + 1, or six; VII. 5+2, or seven; VIII. 5 + 3, or eight. The ancient Romans likewise used IƆ for 500, CIƆ for 1000, IƆƆ for 5000, CCIƆƆ for 10,000. Further than this they did not go in their notation, but, when necessary, repeated the last number, as CCCI333, CCCIƆƆ3, for 200,000; CCCIƆ3D, CCCI33Ɔ, CCCIƆƆ3, for 300,000; and so on. The ancients sometimes changed i into u; as decumus for decimus ; maxumus for maxirnus, and so on. According to Plato, the vowel i is proper to express delicate but humble things, as in the verse of Virgil:

Accipiunt inimicum imbrem, rimisque fatiscunt.

I, used as an abbreviature, is often substituted for the word Iesus, of which it is the first letter.
