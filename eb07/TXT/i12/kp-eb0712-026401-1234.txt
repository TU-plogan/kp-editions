INDERABIA, or Anderabia, a small island near the mouth of the Persian Gulf. It is separated from the mainland by a strait about three miles in length, three in breadth, and free from danger. It is a low, level, and narrow island, about three miles in length. Ships running for shelter under this island must not come within a mile of its south end, until a remarkable tree, which will be distinguished by itself, bears west-north-west. Lat. 26. 40. N.
