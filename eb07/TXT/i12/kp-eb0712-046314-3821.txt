ISTHMUS, a narrow neck or slip of land, which connects two continents; or joins a peninsula to the terra firma, and separates two seas. The most celebrated isthmuses are that of Panama or Darien, which joins North and South America; that of Suez, which connects Asia and Africa; that of Corinth, which unites the Morea with Western Greece; that of Crim-Tartary, otherwise called Taurica Chersonesus; and that of the peninsula Romania, and Erisso, or the isthmus of the Thracian Chersonesus, twelve furlongs broad, being that which Xerxes undertook to cut through.
