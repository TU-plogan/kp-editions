DELEGATE, in a general sense, a deputy or commissioner appointed for a specific purpose.

Delegates, commissioners appointed by the king under the great seal, to hear and determine appeals from the ecclesiastical court.

Court of Delegates, the great court of appeal in all ecclesiastical causes. These delegates are appointed by the king’s commission under his great seal, issued out of chancery, in order to represent his royal person, and to hear all appeals to him made by virtue of the statute 25 Henry VIII. c. 19. This commission is usually composed of lords spiritual and temporal, judges of the courts at Westminster, and doctors of the civil law. Appeals to Rome were always looked upon by the English nation, even in the times of popery, with an evil eye, as being contrary to the liberty of the subject, the honour of the crown, and the independence of the realm, and were first introduced, in very turbulent times, in the sixteenth year of King Stephen; at the same period, as Sir Henry Spelman observes, that the civil and canon laws were first imported into England. But in a few years afterwards, in order to obviate this growing practice, the constitutions made at Clarendon on account of the disturbances raised by Archbishop Becket and other zealots of the holy see, expressly declared that appeals in causes ecclesiastical ought to lie from the archdeacon to the diocesan, from the diocesan to the archbishop of the province, and from the archbishop to the king; and that they were not to proceed any further without special license from the crown. But the unhappy advantage which was given in the reign of King John, and his son Iĭénry III. to the encroaching power of the pope, ever vigilant to improve all opportunities of extending his jurisdiction to Britain, at length rivetted so strongly the custom of appealing to Rome in causes ecclesiastical, that it never could be thoroughly broken off till the grand rupture happened in the reign of Henry VIII. when all the jurisdiction usurped by the pope in matters ecclesiastical was restored to the crown, to which it had originally belonged; so that the statute 25 Henry VIII. was in fact only declaratory of the ancient law of the realm. But in case the king himself be a party in any of these suits, the appeal does not then lie to him in chancery, which would be absurd, but, by the 24 Henry VIII. c. 12, to all the bishops of the realm, assembled in the upper house of convocation.
