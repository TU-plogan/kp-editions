DIAGNOSIS (from δ∕αyι>α∣ffκω, to discern or distinguish), the diagnostics or the signs of a disease. They are of two kinds, namely, the adjunct and the pathognomonic; the former being common to several diseases, serve only to point out the difference between diseases of the same species; but the latter being those which always attend the disease, distinguish it from all others.
