DIAGORAS, surnamed the Atheist, lived in the 91st Olympiad. He was not a native of Athens, but he philosophised in that city. He delighted in making verses; and having composed a poem which a certain poet stole from him, he sued the thief; but the latter swore it was his own composition, and got credit by the work. This tempted Diagoras to deny a Providence; and the Athenians summoned him to give an account of his doctrine. He fled, and they set a price upon his head, promising a reward to any one who should kill him; but he took shipping, and was cast away.
