DAPIFER, the dignity or office of grand master of a princeâ€™s household. This title was given by the Emperor of Constantinople to the Czar of Russia as a testimony of favour. In France the analogous officer was instituted by Charlemagne; and the dignity of dapifer still, we believe, subsists in Germany.
