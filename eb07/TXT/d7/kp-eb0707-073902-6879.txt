DESCANT, in Music, the art of composing in several parts. Descant is threefold; plain, figurative, and double. Plain descant is the groundwork and foundation of all musical compositions, consisting altogether in the orderly placing of many concords, answering to simple counterpoint. Figurative or florid descant is that part of an air of music in which some discords are concerned, as well, though not so much, as concords. This may be termed the ornamental and rhetorical part of music, in regard that there are introduced all the varieties of points, syncopes, diversities of measures, and whatever is capable of adorning the composition. Descant double is when the parts are so contrived that the treble, or any high part, may be made the bass; and, on the contrary, the bass the treble.
