DESERT, a large extent of country entirely barren, and producing nothing. In this sense some are sandy deserts; as those of Lop, Xamo, Arabia, and several others in Asia; and in Africa those of Libya and Sahara; whilst others are stony, as the desert of Pharan in Arabia Petraea.

The Desert, properly so called, is that part of Arabia, south of the Holy Land, where the children of Israel wandered during forty years.
