DECEMPEDA, ∆eκα∙rouς, ten-feet rod, an instrument used by the ancients in measuring.

The decempeda was a rule or rod divided into ten feet; and hence its name, from decem, ten, and pes, foot. The foot was subdivided into twelve inches, and each inch into ten'digits. The decempeda was used both in the measuring of land, like the chain among us; and by architects in giving the proper dimensions and proportions to the parts of their buildings, which use it still retains. Horace (lib. ii. od. 15), blaming the magnificence and delicacy of the buildings of his time, observes, that it was otherwise in the times of Romulus and Cato; that in the houses of private persons there were not then known any porticos measured out with the decempeda, nor turned to the north to admit the cool air.
