DEVAPRAYAGA, a town of Northern Hindustan, in the province of Serinagur, situated at the junction of the Bhagarathi and Alcanando rivers, the union of which forms that part of the Ganges held most sacred by the Hindus, the bathing in which is supposed to purify them from all their sins. This is one of the five principal prayags, or holy points where two rivers meet, mentioned in the Shastras, and is considered as peculiarly sacred. The town stands on a scarp of the mountain, about a hundred feet above the water. It contains only two hundred and fifty houses, which are built of stone, two stories high, and covered with shingles. In the upper part of the town stands the celebrated temple of Ramachandra, constructed of large blocks of cut stone, piled up without mortar to the height of sixty feet. The presiding deity is an image about six feet high, cut in black stone, the lower part of which is painted red. The town is chiefly inhabited by Brahmins of different sects, who draw rich contributions from the superstition of the pilgrims; besides which they have an estate consisting of twenty-five villages. The town and temple suffered much by an earthquake in the year 1803. The latter was repaired at the expense of Dowlut Rao Scindia. Long. 78. 31. E. Lat. 30. 3. N.
