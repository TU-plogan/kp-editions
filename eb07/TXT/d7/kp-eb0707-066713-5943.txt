DEFEND, in general, signifies much the same with protecting or warding off injuries offered to any person either by enemies or otherwise.

Defend, in our ancient laws and statutes, signifies to prohibit or forbid; as Usuarios defendit quoque rex Edwardus ne remanerent in regno. L. L. Edw. Conf. c. 38, and 5 Rich. IL c. 7. In this sense Chaucer also uses the following passage:

Where can, you say in any manner, age, That ever God defended marriage.

In 7 Edward I. there is a statute entitled “Statutum de defensione portandi arma? &c. And “it is defended by law to distrain on the highway.”
