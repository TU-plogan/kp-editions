DALKEITH, a town of Scotland, in the county of Edinburgh. It is situated on a narrow strip of land between the two Esks, the banks of which are beautifully wooded, and embellished with the seats of families of the first distinction. The origin of Dalkeith is referred to a respectable antiquity, having gradually risen into existence from the proximity of a castle long known as one of the chief baronial strongholds south of the Forth. The town has been very much improved in appearance within the last thirty years. It is tolerably well built, and the principal street is spacious. In it stands the town-church, an old Gothic edifice, partly in ruins. It was originally the chapel of the castle, and in 1406 was raised to the dignity of a collegiate church; but after the Reformation it became the parish kirk. Besides the established church, there are several dissenting meeting houses. Dalkeith is the largest country town in the county of Edinburgh. It is chiefly supported by an industrious population in the near neighbourhood, employed at the collieries, which are numerous, or in agriculture. Besides all the common trades, there are manufactories of leather and candles, an iron foundery, and a brewery. The largest market for grain in Scotland is held here every Thursday; also a meal market on the Mondays, and one for fat cattle and sheep on the Tuesdays; and there is likewise an annual fair for horses in May. The town has an excellent subscription library, a grammar school, and a number of beneficent and religious associations, with a poor-house for the destitute. Dalkeith is a burgh of barony under the Duke of Buccleuch, who appoints a bailie to superintend its affairs. The seat of that nobleman is in the immediate neighbourhood. It is erected on the site of an ancient castle which belonged to the Regent Morton, who suffered in 1581. The trade of the town is assisted by branches of the National, Commercial[7:7:595], and Leith Banks. The population of the town and parish amounted in 1821 to 5169, and in 1831 to 5586.
