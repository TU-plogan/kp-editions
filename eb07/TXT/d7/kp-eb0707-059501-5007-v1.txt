DALMATIA, a province of the Austrian dominions, and commonly denominated a kingdom. It was first added to the Roman empire by Augustus. After the fall of the western empire it became part of the kingdom of the Goths, until 620, when it was overrun by the Sclavonians, who founded a kingdom which existed till the beginning of the eleventh century, when it came under the power or protection of the Venetians, and part of it remained subject to that state as long as it continued an independent power; hut the portion of it which lies beyond the Zermania was seized by the Turks, and has now lost the name of Dal- :matĩa, forming the province of Hersuk.

The present kingdom of Dalmatia is situated between 12° 15' and 44° 54' north latitude, and 18° 10' and 18° 48' east longitude. It is extended along the shores of the Adriatic, but not continuously, as the small part of the Turkish territory near Mount Xaba interposes between the northern part and Ragusa, where it reaches to the shore of the Adriatic. The extent of Dalmatia is 6600 square miles, or 4,225,000 English acres. The number of its inhabitants in 1821 amounted to 344,055, most of whom are of Sclavonic origin; but in the cities there are some Germans and Italians. The Roman Catholic is the prevailing religion, though about 60,000 persons are of the Greek communion. The character of the greater part of the inhabitants is original, and has undergone but little change during many centuries. The mountaineers, especially near Ragusa, are almost in the savage state.

The greater part of this narrow and long district on the shore is defended by a succession of islands, with excellent natural canals, navigable, between them and the mainland. There are numerous good havens, which are well defended against storms by these islands. The land on the coast is generally intersected by lofty mountains, between which are valleys of greater or less extent, which are highly fertile when cultivated; but from the thin population and the few wants of the inhabitants, the greater part of the kingdom is left in a state of nature.

The climate is mild, and nearly of the same character as that of the south of Italy; but the many marshes on the coast, especially in the vicinity of Zara, and near the mouths of the Narenta, produce much malaria, and engender many fevers. Frost and snow are rarely seen, and are quite unknown in the valleys. The winter scarcely lasts more than six weeks, and is accompanied with much rain, so that the passion-flower and the verbena triphylla grow in the open air throughout summer and winter.

The chief products are horses of a small size, but strong and active, sheep of the woolled kind, goats, cows, swine, game, both sea and river fish, silk worms, and cantharides. It scarcely grows sufficient corn for the consumption, but exchanges for it a wine very strong and fiery, olives, raisins, currants, and timber. There is marble and alabaster raised from the quarries, and abundance of fossil, coal, and some iron from mines. The rivers of Dalmatia are of short course, but deep and rapid. The Zermagna or Zeπnania rises in the mountain Wellebith, and empties itself into the sea in the Bay of Morlachia. The Kerka springs in a grotto above Knin, and forms five most beautiful cascades before it falls into the Bay of Sebenico. The

Settina has one waterfall of more than 150 feet, and a 1 second at Mala Gubowitza before it reaches the sea. The other rivers are, the Narenta, the Suikorina, and the Om-bla. There are several fresh-water lakes; the largest are those of Novigrad, Narin, Trocklean, and Prelosatz.

The divisions of the kingdom are into five provinces, namely, Zara, Spalatro, Makarska, Ragusa, and Cattaro, which are subdivided into districts. The government remains as under the Venetians, but some parts seem to have a kind of rude independence of Austria, as they formerly had of Venice. The district of Poglezza forms a state within the state, having 16,000 warriors, who maintain their right to choose their own general and other officers every year. They pay no taxes, but make a present as suits them, according to the state of the harvests. This republican privilege has hitherto been respected by the emperor, who finds his account in the military inhabitants being always in readiness to repel any hostility on the part of their neighbours the Turks.

The cities and thcir population are as follow; Zara 4856, Spalatro 6750, Ragusa 6500, and Cattaro 2250.
