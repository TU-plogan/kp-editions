DARDANELLES, two old and strong castles on the straits of Gallipoli, or the Hellespont, sometimes called from them the Strait of the Dardanelles, between the Sea of Marmora and the Grecian Archipelago. The one is situated in Europe, and is called Sestos, or the Castle of Romania; the other stands on the Asiatic side of the strait, and is called Abydos, or the Castle of Natolia. There are on each side fourteen great guns, adapted to discharge balls of granite; they are made of brass, and have chambers like mortars, and their bore is from twenty-five to twenty-eight inches in diameter. These castles are called the Old Dardanelles, to distinguish them from two others built at the entrance of the strait, about ten miles to the [7:7:624]south-west, one of which stands also in Europe and another in Asia. These are called the New Dardanelles. Long, of the old castlcs 26. 19. 30. E. Lat. 40. 9. 8. N.
