DEMISE, in Law, is applied to an estate either in fee simple, fee tail, or for a term of life or years; and so it is commonly taken in many writs. The king’s death is in law termed the demise of the king.

Demise and Redemise, denote a conveyance where there are mutual leases made from one to another of the same land, or something out of it.
