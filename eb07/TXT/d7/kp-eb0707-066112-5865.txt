DECAPOLIS, in Ancient Geography, a district beyond Jordan, almost all of it belonging to the half tribe of Manassch; before the captivity called Bethsan, but afterwards occupied by the heathen, who could not be driven out of it. It comprised, as the name denotes, ten principal cities on the other side the Jordan, if we except Scythopolis, which stood on this side, but had its territory on the other.
