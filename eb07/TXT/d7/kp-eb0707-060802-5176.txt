DAMASKEENING, or Damasking, the art or operation of beautifying iron, steel, and some other metals, by making incisions therein, and filling them up with gold or silver. It is chiefly used for adorning sword-blades, guards, locks of pistols, and the like.

Damaskeening partakes of the mosaic, of engraving, and of carving. Like the mosaic, it has inlaid work; like engraving, it cuts the metal, representing divers figures; and, as in chasing, gold and silver are wrought in relief. There are two ways of damasking; the one, which is the finest, is when the metal is cut deep with proper instruments, and inlaid with gold and silver wire; the other is superficial only.
