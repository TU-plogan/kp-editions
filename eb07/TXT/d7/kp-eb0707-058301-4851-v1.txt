DACTYLIOMANCY (JDactyliomantia), a sort of divination performed by means of a ring. The word is composed of the Greek δακτυλ/o;, a ring, from δακn∣λog, a finger, and μαvτnα, divination.

Dactyliomancy consisted principally in holding a ring, suspended by a fine thread, over a round table, on the edge of which were made various marks with the twenty-four letters of the alphabet. The ring, in shaking or vibrating over the table, stopped over certain of the letters, which, being joined together, composed the answer required. But the operation was preceded and accompanied by several superstitious ceremonies; for the ring was consecrated with a great deal of mystery. The person who held it was required to be clad in linen garments to the very shoes, his head was to be shaved all round, and in his hand he was to hold vervain; and before he proceeded, the gods were first to be appeased by a formulary of prayers or liturgy. Ammianus Marcellin us gives the process at large in his twenty-ninth book.
