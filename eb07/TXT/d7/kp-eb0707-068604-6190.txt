DELIBERATIVE, an appellation given to a branch of rhetoric, employed in proving a proposition, or in convincing an assembly that it ought to be put in execution.

To have a deliberative voice in an assembly is to have a right to give oneâ€™s advice and vote therein. In councils the bishops have deliberative voices; but those beneath them have only consultative voices.
