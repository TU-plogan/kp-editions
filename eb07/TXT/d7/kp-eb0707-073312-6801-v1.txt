DEPRIVATION, in the common law, is the act of bereaving, divesting, or taking away a spiritual promotion or dignity; as when a bishop, vicar, prebend, or the like, is deposed or deprived of his preferment, for some matter or fault, in fact or in law. See Deposition.

Deprivation is of two kinds, namely, a beneficio, and ab officio. Deprivation a beneficio is, when for some great crime a minister is wholly and for ever deprived of his living or preferment; which differs from suspension, in that the latter is only temporary.

Deprivation ab officio is, when a minister is for ever deprived of his order, which is the same, in reality, with what we otherwise call deposition and degradation. Deprivation is usually awarded for some heinous crime deserving death, and is performed by the bishop in a solemn manner. See Degradation.
