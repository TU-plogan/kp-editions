DAMON, the name of several illustrious ancients, particularly of a Pythagorean philosopher very intimate with Pythias. When he had been condemned to death by Dionysius, he obtained from the tyrant leave to go and settle his domestic affairs, on promise of returning at a stated hour to the place of execution. Pythias pledged himself to undergo the punishment which was to be inflicted on Damon, should he not return in time, and he consequently delivered himself into the hands of the tyrant. Damon returned at the appointed moment, and Dionysius was so struck with the fidelity of those two friends, that having remitted the punishment, he entreated them to [7:7:610]permit him to share their friendship and enjoy their con* fidence.
