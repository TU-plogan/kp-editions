DESCENSION, in Astronomy, is either right or oblique. Right Descension is an arch of the equinoctial, intercepted between the next equinoctial point and the intersection of the meridian, passing through the centre of the object, at its setting, in a right sphere.

Oblique Descension is an arch of the equinoctial, intercepted between the next equinoctial point and the horizon, passing through the centre of the object, at its setting, in an oblique sphere.
