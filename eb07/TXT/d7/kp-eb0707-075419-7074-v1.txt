DIACRH, in Antiquity, was the name of a party or faction at Athens. That city was divided into two parties; the one of which favoured an oligarchy, and the other consisted of such as were for a democratical or popular [7:7:755] government, in which the whole people should have a share. The first were called diacrii, and the latter pe-diaci ; because the one inhabited the lower, and the other the az¢ov or upper part of the city. The laws of Solon imported, that Peisistratus should be the chief of the diacrii; though the scholiast on Aristophanes’s comedy of The Wasps affirms that Pandion distributed the quarter of the diacrii among his sons, and put Lycus at their head.
