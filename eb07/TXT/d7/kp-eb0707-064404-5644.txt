DEAD Reckoning, in Navigation, the judgment or estimation which is made of the place where a ship is situated, without any observation of the heavenly bodies. It is discovered by keeping an account of the distance she has run by the log, and of her course steered by the compass, and by rectifying these data by the usual allowance for drift, lee-way, and so forth, according to the shipâ€™s known trim. This reckoning, however, is always to be corrected as often as any good observation of the sun can be obtained.

Dead Sea. See Asphaltites. Deadly Feud, in English law-books, a profession of irreconcilable hostility, till a person is revenged by the death of his enemy. The word feud is derived from the German feud, which, as Hottoman observes, signifies modo bellum, modo capitales inimicitiae. Such enmity and revenge were allowed by the law in the time of the Saxons. If any man was killed, and a pecuniary satisfaction was not made to the kindred, it became lawful for them to take up arms and revenge themselves on the murderer; which was called deadly feud.
