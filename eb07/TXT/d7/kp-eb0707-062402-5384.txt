DARES, a Phrygian, who lived during the Trojan war, in which he was engaged, and of which he wrote the history in Greek. This history was extant in the age of Aelian; but the Latin translation, which is all that is known of it, is generally allowed to be spurious, though it is attributed by some to Cornelius Nepos. This translation first made its appearance in the year 1477, at Milan. Homer mentions him in the Iliad.
