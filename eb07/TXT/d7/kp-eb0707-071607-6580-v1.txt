DENBIGH, a town, the capital of the county of that name, in North Wales, 218 miles from London. It stands at the foot of a craggy elevation near the centre of the beautiful Vale of Clwyd. The town is well built, and the views around it are very delightful, especially from the ruins of an ancient castle demolished in the year 1646. It is a corporate town; and, conjointly with Ruthin, Wrexham, and Holt, returns one member to parliament. There is a good market on Thursdays. The only manufactures are shoes, leather, and gloves, which employ one third of the population. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2391, in 1811 to 2714, in 1821 to 3195, and in 1831 to 3786.
