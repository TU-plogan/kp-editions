DEFINITE, in Grammar, is applied to an article which has a precise determinate signification, such as the article the in English, le and la in French, which fix and ascertain the noun they belong to, to some particular, as the king, le roi; whereas, in the quality of king, de roi, the articles of and de mark nothing precise, and are therefore indefinite.
