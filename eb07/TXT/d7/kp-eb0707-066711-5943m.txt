DEFECTIVE, in general, an appellation given to things which want some of the properties that they ought naturally to possess. Thus, Defective, or Deficient Nouns, in Grammar, are such as want either a whole number, a particular case, or are totally indeclinable. The term defective is also applied to a verb which has not all its moods and tenses.
