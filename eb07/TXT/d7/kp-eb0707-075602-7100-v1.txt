DIALITHA, in the writings of the ancients, a word used to express the elegant ornaments of the Greeks and Romans, composed of gold and gems. They also called these lithocolla, cemented stones or gems; the gold being in this case as a cement to hold the stones together. They wore bracelets and other ornamental articles thus made about their habits; and their cups and table-furniture, for magnificent feasts, were of this kind. The green stones were found to succeed best; and the emerald and greenish topaz, or, as we call it, chrysolite, were most in esteem for this purpose. Such a use of stones explains what Pliny very often says of them in his description: Nihil jucundius aurum decet, nothing becomes gold better. This he says of the green topaz or chrysolite; and the expression has greatly perplexed the critics, who did not hit upon the true explanation.
