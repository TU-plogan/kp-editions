DELLAMCOTTA, a fortress of Northern Hindustan, in the province of Bootan. It is situated on a range of lofty mountains, which rises about a mile and a half above the plains of Bengal, and commands the principal pass into Bootan. It was stormed by the British troops in 1773, which so alarmed the Booteans that they petitioned for peace. The fortress was then restored to them.
