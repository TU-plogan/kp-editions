DAKIR, in our statutes, is used for the twentieth part of a last of hides; According to the statute of 51 Henry III. De compositione ponderum et mensurarum, a last of hides consists of twenty dakirs, and every dakir of ten hides. But by 1 Jac. cap. 33, a last of hides or skins is equal to twelve dozen.
