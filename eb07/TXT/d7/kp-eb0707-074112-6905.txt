DESULTOR, in Antiquity, a vaulter or leaper, who, leading one horse by the bridle and riding another, jumped from the back of one to the other, as the custom then was, after they had run several courses or heats. This practice required great dexterity, being performed before the use of either saddles or stirrups. The custom was practised in the army when necessity required it, but chiefly amongst the Numidians, who always carried with them two horses at least for that purpose, changing them as occasion required. The Greeks and Romans borrowed the practice from this people, but only used it at races, games, and the like. The Sarmatae were great masters of this exercise, and the hussars have still some remains of it.
