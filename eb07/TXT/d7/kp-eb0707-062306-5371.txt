DARAPORAM, or Dharma-puram, a town of Hindustan, situated on the river Amarawati, in the province of South Coimbetoor. It was formerly a larger place, but declined greatly during the internal wars of the country in the latter part of the last century. It was visited by Dr Buchanan in 1800, when the plan of a new town had been laid out, and the buildings were already advancing. There is a large mud fort at this place, and in the vicinity are two fine canals, which irrigate much rice land in a good state of cultivation. The principal article cultivated is tobacco, and a crop of grain is also procured afterwards from the same ground. This place was taken from Tippoo by the southern army in June 1783, but restored at the peace of 1784.
