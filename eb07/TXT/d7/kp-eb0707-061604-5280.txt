DANET, Peter, abbot of St Nicholas de Verdun, was one of the persons chosen by the Duke of Montausier to write on the classics for the use of the dauphin. He had a share in Phaedrus, which he published with notes and explanations in Latin. He also wrote a dictionary in Latin and French, and another in French and Latin. He died at Paris in 1709.
