DENOMINATOR, in Arithmetic, a term used in speaking of fractions.

Denominator of a Patio is the quotient arising from the division of the antecedent by the consequent. Thus 6 is the denominator of the ratio 30 to 5; because 30 divided by 5 gives 6. This is otherwise called the exponent of the ratio.
