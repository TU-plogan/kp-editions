DACHAU, a bailiwick in the circle of the Isar, in the kingdom of Bavaria. It extends over 264 square miles, or 168,960 English acres, and contains 21,556 inhabitants, in two towns, 142 villages, and a great number of single farms and gentlemenâ€™s houses. The greater part of the district is of moderate fertility, and watered by the rivers Amber, Maisach, and Glow; but there is an extensive moor, which, in spite of efforts to cultivate it by colonists, still remains in an unproductive state. The capital is of the same name, and contains only 1100 inhabitants.
