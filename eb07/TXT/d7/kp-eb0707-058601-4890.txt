DAGELET’S Island, in the Sea of Japan, was so named by La Perouse, who landed there in 1787. It is about nine miles in circumference, of the most precipitous aspect, being environed, except at some small sandy creeks, with a rampart of bare rocks as perpendicular as a wall. Perouse’s men saw in some of these creeks boats resembling those of the Chinese in their construction, but the carpenters all fled into the forest as soon as they saw the French navigators doubling the west point of the island. Perouse conjectured that they resorted thither from Corea, which is not more than sixty miles distant, for the purpose of building boats, which they sell on the continent. The island is covered in the highest part with wood. Long. 131. 22. E. Lat. 37. 25. N.
