DANTZICK, Dantzik, or Dantzig, one of the provincial governments of West Prussia. It is bounded by Königsberg'on the east, by Marienwerder on the south, by Koslin on the west, and by the Baltic on the north. It extends over 3322 square miles, or 2,126,000 English acres. It comprehends eleven cities, seven market-towns, and 1856 villages and hamlets. The inhabitants amounted in the year 1817 to 237,323, and in 1826 to 316,340. At the first period the Protestants were 142,041, the Catholics 97,530, the Menonites 9122, and the remainder Jews. It is a level country, with rather a sandy soil; but near the Vistula the soil is excellent, and produces abundant crops of wheat, rye, barley, and oats. On the meadows many oxen are fattened, and on the uplands numerous flocks of sheep are grazed.

Dantzick, a city, the capital of the government of that name in the province of West Prussia. It was an independent city, one of the Hans Towns, in ancient times, but under the protection of the kings of Poland. After the division of that country, Dantzick became subject to Prussia, and was united to it in 1793. It is a fortified city, rendered strong by its narrow front, covered by powerful batteries on the rising grounds which extend across it, and by the broad stream of the Vistula and its extensive marshes. It has been twice taken during the late war, but both times by famine rather than by the military assailants. The city, with its suburbs, contains 45,450 inhabitants, almost all of whom are engaged in commerce. The chief trade is in corn, which is brought down the Vistula from the Polish and Prussian districts on both sides of the stream. It is conveyed in open barges, landed near the city, and exposed to the sun and air till it is perfectly dry, when it is stored in vast magazines denominated Speicher, till it is required for distant markets. There is also a considerable trade carried on in timber, which is also floated down from Poland. The city has been of long existence, and many of the houses exhibit the fashion of antiquity. There are appropriate institutions for education, for the poor, and for the sick. The manufactures are numerous, but all on a small scale, and chiefly for the supply of the city and its vicinity. The haven admits only vessels of small burden, or very flat bottoms. Long. 18. 33. 40. E. Lat. 54. 21. 5. N.
