DANCALI, an extensive territory of Eastern Africa, situated between Abyssinia and the Red Sea, the coast of which it occupies from the bay of Azab to that called by Lord Valentia Annesley Bay, leaving only a small portion of sea-coast, which is properly Abyssinian. This [7:7:613]tract is in general arid and barren, and it is only in the rainy season that the channels of its rivers are filled so as to reach the sea. The inhabitants are all black; but only some of them have the woolly hair which is characteristic of the negro race. They profess the religion of Mahommed; but know little more of it than the name, as they have neither priests nor mosques. They are divided into a number of separate tribes, the principal of which are called Drumhoeta, Belesna, and Hadarem. They formerly united with Adel, or Adaiel, in their wars against Abyssinia; but the interposition of a tribe of Galla has now separated them. They can muster about 6000 men, but their poverty is such that only one man in ten possesses a spear. On their western frontier is situated the great plain from which all Abyssinia is supplied with fossil salt. The Dancali tribes are partly employed in cutting out and conveying this salt; but others follow the ruder pursuit of attacking the caravans by which it is carried into the interior.
