DACIA, in Ancient Geography, a country which Trajan, who reduced it into the form of a province, joined to Moesia by a bridge. This country extended between the Danube and Carpathian Mountains, and from the river Tibiscus to the mouth of the Danube and to the Euxine; on the north side, next the Carpates, it was terminated by the river Hierasus, now the Pruth, and on the west by the Tibiscus or Teiss; and it comprehended a part of Upper Hungary, all Transylvania and Wallachia, and a part of Moldavia. There was a Dacia Aureliana, part of Illyricum, which was divided into the eastern and western, Sirmium being the capital of the latter, and Sardica of the former; but this belonged to the lower age.
