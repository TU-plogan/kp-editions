DEEG, a town and celebrated fortress in the province of Agra, belonging to the Jauts. In 1760 this place was occupied and strongly fortified by Soorag Mull, the rajah of the Jauts. In 1776 it was taken from that tribe by Nujuff Khan, after a siege of twelve months, but was soon afterwards restored to them. In 1805, the Mahratta army, commanded by Holkar, was defeated under its walls by Lord Lake, who, to the great astonishment of all the Indian powers, took this place, supposed to be impregnable, by storm. At the conclusion of peace, it was restored to the Rajah Runjeet Sing. Long. 77. 17. E. Lat. 27. 30. N.
