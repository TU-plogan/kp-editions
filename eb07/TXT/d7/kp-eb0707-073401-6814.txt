DERBY, a town, the capital of the county of that name. It is 126 miles from London, being situated in a beautiful and fertile valley watered by the river Derwent, which is navigable to the Trent. It consists of five parishes, with their respective churches. The houses are well built, the market-place is a fine square, and the town-hall, assembly room, and the church of All Saints, are respectable edifices. The first silk-mill was erected here, and continues to prepare the raw material for the subsequent processes of the manufacture. There is also an establishment for making china, some of which is very beautiful. The cotton trade, and especially the hosiery branch of it, is an object of pursuit to numerous persons. In this town too are many workers in jewellery and in small articles of gold and silver. The town returns two members to parliament. There is a well-supplied market held on Friday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 10,882, in 1811 to 13,043, in 1821 to 17,423, and in 1831 to 23,607.
