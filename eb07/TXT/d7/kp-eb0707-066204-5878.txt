DECHALES, Claudius Frances Milliet, a mathematician, mechanic, and astronomer, descended from a noble family, and born at Chambery in 1611. His principal performances are an edition of Euclidâ€™s Elements of Geometry, in which the unserviceable propositions are rejected, and the uses of those retained annexed; a discourse on fortification, and another on navigation. These, with some other pieces, were collected, first in three volumes folio, and afterwards in four, under the title of Mundus Mathematicus ; being indeed a complete course of mathematics. He died in 1678, being then professor of mathematics in the university of Turin.
