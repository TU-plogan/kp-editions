DAN, or Jor-dan, which last literally denotes the river Dan; so named from the district where it has its source, which is a lake called Phiala, from its round figure, to the north of its apparent rising in the mountain Panium or Paneum, as was discovered by Philip, tetrarch of Trachonites; for on throwing light bodies into the Phiala, he found them to emerge again at Paneum. From Paneum it runs in a direct course to a lake called Samachonites, to which it is called Jordan the Less ; thence to the lake of Genesarcth, or of Tiberias, where it becomes increased by the lake Samachonites and its springs, and is called the Greater Jordan ; and continuing its direct course southwards, it falls into the Asphaltites.

Dan, in Ancient Geography, a town to the west of the source of the Jordan; formerly called Lais. This was the northern, as Beersheba was the southern, boundary of the Israelites; as appears from the common expression in Scripture, from Dan to Beersheba.

Dan, the tribe, extended itself westward of Judah, and was terminated by Azotas and Dora on the Mediterranean.
