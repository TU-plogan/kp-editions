DANAUS, in fabulous history, a son of Belus and Anchinoe, who, after his father’s death, reigned conjointly with his brother Aegyptus on the throne of Egypt. Some time afterwards, a difference arose between the brothers, and Danaus set sail with his fifty daughters in quest of a settlement. He visited Rhodes, where he consecrated a statue to Minerva, and arrived safely on the coast of Peloponnesus, where he was hospitably received by Gelanor, king of Argos. Gelanor had but newly ascended the throne, and the first years of his reign were marked by dissensions with his subjects. Danaus took advantage of Gelanor’s unpopularity, and obliged him to renounce the crown. In Gelanor the race of the Inachidae was extinguished, and in Danaus the Belides began to reign at Argos. Some authors say that Gelanor voluntarily resigned the crown to Danaus, on account of the wrath of Neptune, who had dried up all the waters of Argolis, in order to punish the impiety of Inachus. The success of Danaus invited the fifty sons of Aegyptus to embark for Greece. They were kindly received by their uncle; who, either apprehensive of their number, or terrified by an. oracle which threatened his ruin by one of his sons-in-law, caused his daughters, to whom they were promised in marriage, to murder them the first night of their nuptials. His order was executed. Hypermnestra alone spared the life of Lynceus. Danaus at first persecuted Lynceus with unremitted fury; but he was afterwards reconciled to him, and he acknowledged him as his son-in-law and successor after a reign of fifty years. He began his reign about 1586 years before the Christian era; and after his death he was honoured with a splendid monument in the town of Argos, which existed in the age of Fausanias. According to Aeschylus, Danaus left Egypt not to be present at the marriage of his daughters with the sons of his brother, a connection which he deemed unlawful and impious.
