DENTATUS, Curius, a renowned and highly disinterested Roman general, whose virtues render him more memorable than even his great military reputation, flourished 272 years ß. c. He was thrice consul; he conquered the Samnites, Sabines, and Lucanians; and he gave each citizen forty acres of land, reserving no more for himself. The ambassadors of the Samnites having paid him a visit, found him boiling turnips in a pipkin, upon which they offered him gold to eome over to their interest; but he told them that his design was not to grow rich, but to command those who were so. He defeated Pyrrhus near Tarentum, and received the honour of a triumph.
