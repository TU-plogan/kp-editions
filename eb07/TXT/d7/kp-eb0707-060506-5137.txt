DAMASCIUS, a celebrated heathen philosopher, born at Damascus in the year 540, when the Goths reigned in Italy. He wrote the life of his master Isidorus, and dedicated it to Theodora, a learned and philosophical lady, who had also been a pupil to Isidorus. In this life, which was copiously written, he frequently made oblique attacks on the Christian religion. We have nothing remaining of it, however, except some extracts preserved by Photius. Damascius succeeded Theon in the rhetorical school, and Isidorus in that of philosophy, at Athens.
