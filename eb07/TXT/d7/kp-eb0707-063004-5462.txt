DARTMOUTH, a borough and sea-port of the hundred of Coleridge, in the county of Devon, thirty miles from Exeter, and 203 from London. It is a long town, facing the quay. It has three churches, and several good charity schools. The harbour is one of the finest on the southern coast of this island, but difficult to sail from with an easterly wind. There are many ships equipped here for the Newfoundland fishery. Two members were formerly returned to parliament, but there is now only one. The fish-market is held daily, and is most abundantly supplied. The general market is held on Friday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3211, in 1811 to 3412, in 1821 to 3876, and in 1831 to 4597.
