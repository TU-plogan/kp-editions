DELPHOS, or Castri as it is most frequently named by the inhabitants, a wretched village in the province of Livadia, consisting of about seventy houses, which occupy the site of the ancient city of Delphi. The remains of the gymnasium, stadium, and other buildings, are still extant in its vicinity; but except these, and the stories connected with them, it has now little to recommend it to the notice of travellers beyond the splendid prospect which it commands of the surrounding country.
