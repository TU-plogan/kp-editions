DARAH, or Dras, a river of Northern Africa, which rises on the southern side of the great range of the Atlas, and runs through the country of the same name. It is now ascertained that this river, instead of falling into the Atlantic, as was supposed, after pursuing a course of about three hundred miles, divides into various branches, which either form small lakes, or are absorbed in the thirsty sands of the desert.

Darah, a country of Northern Africa, watered by the river above described. It is bounded on the north and west by the great Atlas, which divides it from Morocco, on the east by Tafilet, and on the south by the great desert. The soil holds a middle place between the fertile and well-irrigated plains skirting the sea, and the barren sands of the Sahara. The chief product is dates, but copper, iron, and antimony are found in the mountains which border it. The southern part of this territory, at Akka and Tatta, forms the rendezvous of the great caravan which proceeds from Morocco to Timbuctoo.
