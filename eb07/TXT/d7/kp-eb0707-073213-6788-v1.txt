DEODHUR, a town of Hindustan, situated on the northwest frontier of Gujerat. It consists of about a thousand houses, inhabited principally by Rajpoots and Coolies, who subsist principally by plundering their neighbours. It possesses a citadel 150 yards square, which is well fortified, and is surrounded by a wall and deep ditch. The town labours under a great deficiency of water, and is hemmed in by the jungle, which comes up close to the houses. It is the property of a Rajpoot chief, who has eight other villages under his authority, and who frequently lays his neighbours and travellers under contribution. Deodhur is 173 miles from Moorshedabad. Long. 88. 32. E. Lat. 26. 59. N.
