DELIQUIUM, or Deliquium Animi (from delinquo, to swoon), a swooning or fainting away; called also syncope, lipothymia, lipopsychia, eclysis, and asphyxia. Deliquium (from deliquesco, to dissolve), in Chemistry, is the dissolution or melting of a salt by suspending it in a moist cellar. Salt of tartar, or any fixed alkali, placed in a cellar or other cool and moist situation, and in an open vessel, resolves or runs into a kind of liquor called by the older chemists oil of tartar per deliquium.
