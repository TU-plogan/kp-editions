DESPOT, a term sometimes used for an absolute prince or sovereign. The word originally signified the same thing with the Latin herus, and the English master ; but in time it underwent the fate upon medals, which, among the Latins, Caesar did with regard to Augustus; BACIΛETC answering to Augustus, and ΔECΠOTHC, despotes, to Caesar. Thus Nicephorus having ordered his son Stauracius to be crowned, the son, out of respect, would only take the title of ΔECΠOTHC, leaving to his father that of BACIΛEYC. This delicacy, however, did not last long; for the following emperors preferred the quality of ΔECΠOTHC to that of BACIΛEYC, particularly Constantine, Michael Ducas, Nicephorus Botoniates, Romanus Diogenes, the Comneni, and some others. In imitation of the princes, the princesses likewise assumed the title of ΔECΠOINA. It was the Emperor Alexius, surnamed the angel, who created the dignity of despot, and made it the first after that of emperor, and superior to that of Augustus or Sebastocrator and Caesar. The despots were usually the emperors’ sons or sons-in-law, and their colleagues or co-partners in the empire, as well as their presumptive heirs. The despots who were sons of the emperors had more privileges and authority than those who were only sons-in-law. Under the successors of Constantine the Great, the title “despot of Sparta” was given to the emperor’s son or brother, who had the city of Sparta or Lacedaemon by way of appanage.
