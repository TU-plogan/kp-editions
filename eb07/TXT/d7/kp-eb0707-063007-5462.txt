DARWAR, a district of Hindustan, in the nizamâ€™s dominions, in the province of Aurungabad, situated between the eighteenth and nineteenth degrees of north latitude. The chief towns are Darwar and Renapoor, the former situated in long. 76. 35. E. and lat. 18. 40. N.

Darwar, called also Naperabad, a town and fortress of Hindustan, province of Bejapoor. The town is situated to the south of the fort, and is protected by a weak wall and ditch against any sudden incursions. The fort is strong, though not a regular fortification; and the ditches are particularly good. This place has often changed masters. In the year 1685 it was taken from the king of Be-japore by the armies of Aurungzebe, and soon after the decease of that monarch fell into the hands of the Mahrattas, from whom it was taken by Tippoo Sultan in 1784. It was retaken by the Mahrattas, aided by the British, after a siege of twenty-nine weeks, in the course of which it was almost totally destroyed, along with the surrounding country, which was previously rich and highly cultivated.
