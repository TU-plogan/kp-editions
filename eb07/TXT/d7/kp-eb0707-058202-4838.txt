DACTYLI Idaei, the Fingers of Mount Ida. Concerning these, Pagan theology and fable give very different accounts. The Cretans paid divine worship to them, as the persons who had nursed and brought up the god Jupiter; and hence it appears that they were the same as the Corybantes and Curetes. Nevertheless Strabo makes them different, and says, that the tradition in Phrygia was, that the Curetes and Corybantes were descended from the Dactyli Idaei; that there were originally an hundred men in the island, who were called Dactyli Idaei, from whom sprang nine Curetes, and each of these nine produced ten men, as many as the fingers of a man’s two hands; and that this gave the name to the ancestors of the Dactyli Idaei. He relates another opinion, which is, that there were but five Dactyli Idaei, who, according to Sophocles, were the inventors of iron; that these five brothers had five sisters, and that from this number they received the name of Fingers of Mount Ida, because they were ten in number, and worked at the foot of this mountain. Diodorus Siculus, however, represents the matter a little differently. He says that the first inhabitants of the island of Crete were the Dactyli Idaei, who had their residence on Mount Ida; that some said they were an hundred, others only five in number, equal to the fingers of a man’s hand, whence they had the name of Dactyli ; that they were magicians, and addicted to mystical ceremonies; that Orpheus was their disciple, and carried their mysteries into Greece; that the Dactyli invented the use of iron and of fire; and that they had been recompensed with divine honours. Diomedes the grammarian states, that the Dactyli Idaei were priests of the goddess Cybele, and that they were called Idaei, because that goddess was chiefly worshipped on Mount Ida in Phrygia, and Dactyli, because, in order to prevent Saturn from hearing the cries of the infant Jupiter, whom Cybele had committed to their custody, they used to sing certain verses of their own invention, in the Dactylic measure.
