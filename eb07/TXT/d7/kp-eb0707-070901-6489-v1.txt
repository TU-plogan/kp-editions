DEMOIVRE, Abraham, an eminent mathematician, was born at Vitry, in Champagne, on the 26 th of May 1667. The revocation of the edict of Nantz, in 1685, determined him to fly into England rather than abandon the religion of his fathers. Having laid the foundation of his mathematical studies in France, he perfected himself at London, where a mediocrity of fortune obliged him to employ his talents in this way, and to read public lectures for his support. The Principia Mathematica of Newton, which chance threw in his way, made him comprehend at once how little he had advanced in the science which he professed. But he fell to work with vigour; succeeded as lie went along; and soon became connected with and distinguished among the first-rate mathematicians. His eminence and abilities opened to him an entrance into the Royal Society of London, and afterwards into the academies of Berlin and Paris. His merit was so well known and acknowledged by the Royal Society, that they judged him a fit person to decide the famous contest between Newton and Leibnitz concerning the invention of fluxions. The collection of the academy of Paris contains no memoir of this author, who died at London on the 27th of November 1754, soon after his admission into that body; but the Philosophical Transactions of London contain several of his papers, all of them interesting. He also published some excellent works, such as Miscellanea Aηalytica, de Seriebus et Quadraturis, 1730, in 4to. But perhaps he has been more generally known by his Doctrine of Chances, or Method of calculating the Probabilities of Events at Play. This work was first printed in 1618, in 4to, and dedicated to Sir Isaac Newton; it was reprinted in 1738, with great alterations and improvements; and a third edition was afterwards published with additions. He likewise" gave to the world a Treatise on Annuities, 1724. in 8vo, dedicated to Lord Carpenter.
