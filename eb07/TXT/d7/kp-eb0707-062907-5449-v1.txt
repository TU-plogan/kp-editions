DARMSTADT, a city, the capital of the grand duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt, in Germany. It is situated on a small river of the same name, and is divided into the old and the new town. The former is surrounded with thick walls, and is gloomy and unsightly; the latter has good broad streets, well built, paved, and lighted, and has a cleanly appearance. In the palace is the ducal library, containing 90,000 volumes, a cabinet of natural history, and a small but select gallery of pictures. There is a gymnasium and other institutions for education; and the buildings for recreation and for charitable purposes are respectable and appropriate. The inhabitants, including the students and the military, are 14,500. It is merely the capital, and has no other commerce or manufactures than what arises from its relation to the rest of the dominions of which it is the centre. The environs of the city are well cultivated, and towards the neighbouring mountains are romantic. It is in long. 8. 28. 25. E. and lat. 49. 56. 24. N.
