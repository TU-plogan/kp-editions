DANUBE, Upper, one of the circles of the kingdom of Bavaria. It is composed of several portions, which have been secularized or mediatized of late years, namely, of the ecclesiastical states Augsburg, Kempten, and some smaller territories, and of the temporal states Augsburg, Lindau, Mindelheim, Schwabeck, of the lordships of the Count Fuggar, of Truchses Waldburg and Rothenfels. The whole, as it now exists, extends over 3770 square miles, or 2,412,800 English acres. The entire circle is a very mountainous country, being a prolongation of the Rhaetian Alps, some of whose peaks are 9000 feet in height; but there are exceptions in the northern part, where the land is level and the soil fertile. The inhabitants are 438,146, and chiefly depend on agriculture. Except in the capital of the province, Augsburg, there is little trade, and only a few manufactures; but that city is still rich and flourishing from both those sources of wealth.

Danube, Lower, one of the circles into which the kingdom of Bavaria is divided. It is composed of part of the ancient dukedom of Bavaria, with the addition of the secularized principality of Passau and the county of Neuberg. It extends over 4340 square miles, or 2,777,600 English acres. The inhabitants amount to 355,546, in twelve cities, forty-six market-towns, and 2048 villages, besides hamlets and scattered farms. The river Danube passes through the circle from west to east. On the south side of that river the country is mountainous and sterile, but on the north it is more level, better cultivated, and moderately productive of corn. It produces some wine, much common fruit, and abundance of wood and potashes. As the rivers Danube, Iser, and Inn are navigable, the surplus produce is mostly conveyed to the Austrian dominions.
