+=====================================================================+


DEMOCRITUS, one of the greatest philosophers of antiquity, was born at Abdera, a town of Thrace, about the 80th Olympiad, that is, about 460 years before Christ. His father, says Valerius Maximus, was able to entertain the whole army of Xerxes; and Diogenes Laertius adds, upon the testimony of Herodotus, that the king, in requital, presented him with some Magi and Chaldeans. From these Magi and Chaldeans Democritus received the rudiments of his education; and from them also, whilst yet a boy, he learned theology and astronomy. He next applied to Leucippus, and acquired from him a knowledge of the system of atoms and a vacuum. When his father died, the three sons, for there were so many of them, divided the estate. Democritus made choice of that part which consisted in money, as being, though the least share, the most convenient for travelling; and it is said that his portion amounted to above a thousand talents, or about L.20,000 sterling. His extraordinary inclination for the sciences and for knowledge induced him to travel into all parts of the world where he hoped to find learned men. He went to visit the priests of Egypt, from whom he learned geometry; he consulted the Chaldean and the Persian philosophers; and it is said thåt he penetrated even into India and Ethiopia, to confer with the gymnosophists. In these travels he wasted his substance, after which, at his return, he was obliged to be maintained by his brother; and if he had not given proofs of the greatest understanding, and thereby procured for himself the highest honours, and the strongest interest of his country, he would have incurred the penalty of that law which denied interment in the family sepulchre to those who had wasted their patrimony. After his return from his travels, he lived at Abdera, and governed there in a most [7:7:709] absolute manner, by means of his consummate wisdom. The magistrates of that city made him a present of five hundred talents, and erected statues to him even in his lifetime; but being naturally more inclined to contemplation than delighted with public honours and employments, he withdrew into solitude and retirement. Democritus incessantly laughed at human life as a continued farce, and he carried this so far that the inhabitants of Abdera thought him mad, and sent Hippocrates to cure him; but that celebrated physician having discoursed with the philosopher, told the Abderians that he had a great veneration for Democritus, and that, in his opinion, those who esteemed themselves the most healthy were the most distempered. Democritus died, according to Diogenes Laertius, in the 361st year before the Christian era, aged a hundred and nine years. It is said tlιat he put out his eyes, in order that he might meditate more profoundly on philosophical subjects; but this is by no means probable. He was the author of many books, which are lost, but from which Epicurus borrowed his philosophy.
