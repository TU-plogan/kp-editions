DAVENANT, Sir William, a poet and dramatic writer of the seventeenth century, was born at Oxford in 1605. After some stay at the university, he entered into the service of Frances, first duchess of Richmond, and afterwards of Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, who having an excellent taste for poetry, was much charmed with him. He obtained great reputation by writing poems and plays; and upon the death of Ben Jonson he was created poet-laureat. He wrote the greater part of his poem Gondibert at Paris, but published it in England, where, however, it excited but little interest. He formed a design for carrying out a considerable number of artificers, especially weavers, to Virginia, having been encouraged thereto by Henrietta Maria, the queen-mother of England, who obtained leave for him of the king of France. But he and his company were seized by some parliament ships, and he carried prisoner, first to the Isle of Wight, and then to the Tower of London. By the mediation of Milton and others, however, he was allowed to go about as a prisoner at large, and by [7:7:635]degrees obtained complete liberation. As at this time tragedies and comedies were prohibited, he contrived to set up an opera, which was to consist of declamation and music. This opera commenced in Rutland-house, Charter-house-yard, in 1656; but it was afterwards removed to the Cockpit in Drury Lane, and was much frequented for many years. In 1648, his Madagascar, and other poems, were printed. He died in 1668. On his gravestone is inscribed, in imitation of Ben Jonson’s short epitaph, “0 rare Sir William Davenant.”

Davenant, Or Charles, an eminent civilian and writer, eldest son of the preceding, and educated at Cambridge. He wrote several political tracts, and likewise plays. In 1685 he was, along with the master of the revels, empowered to inspect the plays designed for the stage, in order that no immoralities might be presented. His Essays on Trade are in high esteem, and were reprinted, in 5 vols. 8vo, in 1771. Dr Davenant was inspector-general of exports and imports. He died in 1714.
