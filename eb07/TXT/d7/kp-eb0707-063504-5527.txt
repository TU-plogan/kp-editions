DAVIDISTS, Davidici, or David-Georgians, a sect of heretics, the adherents of David George, a native of Delft, who in 1525 began to preach a new doctrine, publishing himself as the true Messiah, and declaring that he was sent thither to fill heaven, which was quite empty for want of people to deserve it. He is likewise said to have denied the existence of angels, good or evil, and of heaven and hell, and to have rejected the doctrine of a future judgment. He rejected marriage, with the Adamites; held, with Manes, that the soul was not defiled by sin; and laughed at the self-denial so much recommended by Jesus Christ. Such were his principal heresies. He made his escape from Delft, and retired first to Friesland, and then to Basil, where he changed his name, assuming that of John Bruck, and died in 1556.
