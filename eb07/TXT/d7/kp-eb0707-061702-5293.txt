DANMONH, an ancient British nation, supposed to have inhabited that tract of country which is now called Cornwall and Devonshire, bounded on the south by the British Ocean, on the west by St George’s Channel, on the north by the Severn, and on the east by the country of the Durotriges. Some other British tribes were also seated within these limits, as the Cossini and Ostidamnii; and, according to Mr Baxter, they were the keepers of their flocks and herds. As the several tribes of the Danmonii submitted without much resistance to the Romans, and never joined in any revolt against them, that people were under no necessity of building many forts, or keeping many garrisons in their country. This is the reason why so few Roman antiquities have been found in that counfry, and so little mention is made of it and its ancient inhabitants by Roman writers. Ptolemy names a few places, both on the sea-coasts and in the inland parts of this country, which were known to and frequented by the Romans. The most considerable of these places are the two famous promontories of Bolerium and Ocrinum, now the Land’s End and the Lizard; and the towns of Isea Danmoniorum and Tamare, now Exeter and Saltash. As the Danmonii submitted so tamely to the Romans, the latter perhaps permitted them to live, for some time at least, under their own princes and their own laws; a privilege which we know they granted to some other British states. In the most perfect state of the Roman government in Britain, the country of the Danmonii formed part of the province called Flavia Caesariensis, and was governed by the president of that province. After the departure of the Romans, kingly government was immediately revived among the Danmonii in the person of Vortigern, who was perhaps descended from the race of their ancient princes, as his name signifies in the British language a chieftain, or the head of a family.
