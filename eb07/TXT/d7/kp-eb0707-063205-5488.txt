DATIVE, in Grammar, the third case in the declension , of nouns, expressing the state or relation of a thing to [7:7:633]which some other thing is referred. It is called dative, because usually governed by a verb, implying something to be given to some person. As commodare Socrati, to lend to Socrates; utilis reipuhlicae, useful to the commonwealth; perniciosus ecclesiae, injurious to the church. In English, where we have properly no cases, this relation is expressed by the sign to or for.
