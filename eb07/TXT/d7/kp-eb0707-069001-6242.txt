DELPHINIA, in Antiquity, feasts which the inhabitants of Aegina celebrated in honour of Apollo, surnamed Delphinius, as is pretended, because he assumed the form of a dolphin, in order to conduct Castilius and his colony from the isle of Crete to the Sinus Crissoeus Delphinium, one of the courts of judicature of the Athenians, which derived its name from the proximity of the place where they held their assemblies to the temple of Apollo Delphinius.
