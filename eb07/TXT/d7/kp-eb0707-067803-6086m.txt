DEIPHON, in fabulous history, a brother of Triptolemus, son of Celeus and Metanira. When Ceres travelled over the world, she stopped at his father’s court, and undertook to nurse him and bring him up. In order to reward the hospitality of Celeus, the goddess began to make his son immortal, and every evening she placed him on burning coals to purify him from whatever mortal particles he still possessed. The uncommon growth of Deiphon astonished Metanira, who wished to see what Ceres had done to make him so vigorous. But she became frightened to see her son on burning coals, and the shrieks which she uttered having disturbed the mysterious operations of the goddess, Deiphon perished in the flames.
