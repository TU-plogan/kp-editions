DAGHESTAN, a country of Asia, on the west coast of the Caspian Sea, lying between the rivers Koisin and Rubas. It is about 134 miles in length, by between thirty and forty in breadth. It is almost entirely mountainous, as its name, Daghestan, implies, the plain that runs along the shore being a narrow strip. It is usually divided into the following small states, namely, Lesgestan, Schamgal, the khanship of Derbunđ, and the domain of Tabasseran. Lesgestan is a stupendous range of mountains running in a south-east direction, of great length, but inconsiderable in breadth, and forming the whole north-east frontier of Georgia. The inhabitants are a wild and savage banditti, divided into different tribes, whose habitations arc secluded in the depths of the mountains, on the loftiest summits, or on the most frightful precipices. The country is rugged and impracticable; the soil is scanty; and the level ground being insufficient to enable the proprietor to raise the means of subsistence, he increases the surface to the very summit of the heights, by graduated terraces. Those rude tribes of the mountains are the terror and the scourge of all the neighbouring countries, as they sally down from their mountains, ’ laying waste the villages, and carrying off or murdering the inhabitants. They are said to be Mahommedans; but such is their ignorance that they never change the object of their veneration, which is either the sun, moon, or stars. They are lightly dressed, according to the custom of the Tartars, and are armed with a gun, pistols, dagger, and sabre. Their women surpass in beauty all the females of Mount Caucasus, and fetch the highest prices in the markets of Constantinople. The other districts are of the same mountainous character; that of Tabasseran is covered with wood; but the valleys are beautiful and fertile. All over the country are the ruins of many forts, built by some unsuccessful rebel, and left to decay as soon as he was quelled. At one time, according to Morier, the country[7:7:587] was more prosperous, but it has been long declining. It contains many places without inhabitants, or such only as are the wretched remains of the former flourishing families. Nadir Shah was obliged to withdraw his forces from this country in 1743, leaving it unsubdued. The Russians claim the dominion over it, but their sway is not acknowledged by the inhabitants. It has in latcr times been a scene of contest between them and the Persians.
