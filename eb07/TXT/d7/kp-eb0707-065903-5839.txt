DEAL, a market-town of the hundred of Cornilo, in the county of Kent, seventy-four miles from London. It is situated on the sea-shore, facing the road-stead of the Downs, and is celebrated as the landing-place of Julius Caesar, and at a later period as that of Perkin Warbeck. It consists of one long street, on the shore, and of another which runs parallel to it. The chief trade consists in supplying the ships at anchor in the Downs, and in smuggling. It has markets on Tuesday and Wednesday. It is also a borough, but sends no member to parliament. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 5420, in 1811 to 7351, in 1821 to 6811, and in 1831 to 7268.
