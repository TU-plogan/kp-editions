DAPHNE, a daughter of the river Peneus, by the goddess Terra, of whom Apollo became enamoured. This passion had been raised by Cupid, with whom Apollo, proud of his late conquest of the serpent Python, had disputed the power of his darts. Daphne heard with horror the addresses of the god, and endeavoured to remove herself from his importunities by flight. Apollo pursued her, and Daphne, fearful of being caught, entreated the assistance of the gods, who changed her into a laurel. Apollo crowned his head with the leaves of the laurel, and for ever ordered that that tree should be sacred to his divinity. Some say that Daphne was admired by Leucippus, son of Oenomaus, king of Pisa, who, to enjoy her company, disguised his sex, and attended her in the woods in the [7:7:623]habit of a huntress. Leucippus gained Daphne’s esteem and love; but Apollo, who was his powerful rival, discovered his sex, and Leücippus was killed by the companions of Diana. Daphne was also the name of a daughter of Tiresias, priestess in the temple of Delphi. She was consecrated to the service of Apollo by the Epigoni, or, according to others, by the goddess Tellus. She was called Sibyl, on account of the wildness of her looks and expressions when she delivered oracles. Her oracles were generally in verse; and Homer, according to some accounts, has introduced much of her poetry into his com-ι positions.
