DEVIZES, a market-town of the hundred of Pottern and Canning, in Wiltshire, ninety miles from London, containing two parishes. It is situated at the foot of the chalk hills, in a healthy and fertile district, and is an ancient town. It was formerly fortified, and, from its situation, must have been very strong. The market-place is open and well built, but the streets are mostly narrow, and in an ancient fashion. Some woollen trade is carried on, but to a less extent than formerly. Two members are returned to parliament, who are chosen by the freemen. There are two weekly markets, on Mondays and Thursdays. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3547, in 1811 to 3750, in 1821 to 4208, and in 1831 to 4562.
