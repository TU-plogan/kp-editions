DAZE, in Natural History, a name given by our miners to a glittering sort of stone, which often occurs in their works; and as it is an unprofitable substance, it is one of those things they call weeds. The word daze, in their phraseology, includes every stone that is hard and glittering, and therefore it comprehends the whole genus of the telangia or stony nodules which have flakes of talc in [7:7:644]their substance, and which, according to the colour of the stony matter they are embedded in, and their own colour, give the names of black, white, red, and yellow daze, to these stones.
