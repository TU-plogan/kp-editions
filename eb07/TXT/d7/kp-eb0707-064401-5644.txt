DEACON (Diaconus), a person in the lowest degree of holy orders, whose business it is to baptize, read in the church, and assistat the celebration of the eucharist. The word is formed from the Latin diaconus, of the Greek διάκονος, minister, servant. Deacons were instituted, seven in number, by the apostles (Acts, chap, vi.), which number was retained for a long time in several churches. Their office was to serve in the Agapae, and to distribute the bread and wine to the communicants. Another part of the office of deacons was to be a sort of monitors and directors to the people in the exercise of their public devotions in the church; for which purpose they made use of certain known forms of words, to give notice when each part of the service began: and hence they are sometimes called hierokerukes, the holy criers of the church.

Deacons had, by license and authority from the bishop, a power to preach, to reconcile penitents and grant them absolution, and to represent their bishops in general councils. Their office out of the church was to take care of the necessitous, such as widows, orphans, prisoners, and all the poor and sick who had any title to be maintained out of the revenues of the church; to inquire into the morals and conversation of the people, and to make their report thereof to the bishop. On account of the variety of business, it was therefore usual to have several deacons in the same church.

In the Roman Catholic church it is the deacon’s office to incense the officiating priest or prelate; to lay the corporal on the altar; to receive the patten or cup from the subdeacon, and present it to the person officiating; to incense the choir; to receive the pix from the officiating prelate, and carry it to the subdeacon; and at the pontifical mass, when the bishop gives the blessing, to put the mitre on his head, and to take off the archbishop’s pall and lay it on the altar. In England, the form of ordaining deacons declares that it is their office to assist the priest in the distribution of the holy communion; in which, agreeably to the practice of the ancient church, they are confined to the administering of the wine to the communicants. A deacon in England is not capable of any ecclesiastical promotion, yet he may be a chaplain to a family, curate to a beneficed clergyman, or lecturer to a parish-church. He maybe ordained at twenty-three years of age, anno currente ; but it is expressly provided that the bishop shall not ordain tile same person a priest and deacon in the same day. Deacons, according to StPaul, shouldbe chaste, sincere, and blameless; neither immoderate drinkers, nor given to filthy lucre: they should hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, and should be well approved before they are admitted to the ministry. In the church of Scotland, the deacon’s office is only to take care of the poor.
