DENINA, Charles John Maria, an eminent Italian writer, was born at Revel, in the principality of Piedmont, in the year 1731. Having studied at Saluzzo, he was about to enter into the order of the Grand Augustines at Ceva, at the age of fifteen, when one of his uncles appointed him to a benefice. He accordingly assumed the ecclesiastical habit, and remained two years at Saluzzo, where he learned a little divinity, and acquired a knowledge of the French language through the medium of a Swiss officer. In 1748 he obtained an exhibition, which enabled him to prosecute his studies at the provincial college in the University of Turin. Some time afterwards he took orders, and in 1753 he was appointed professor of humanity at Pignerol. In consequence, however, of a quarrel with the Jesuits, he was obliged to quit Pignerol and the royal schools, and was sent to the schools of an inferior order. In 1756, on taking his degree of doctor in theology at the Palatine schools of Milan, he printed his first work, which was a theological tract. After this he was restored to the royal schools, and appointed extraordinary professor of humanity and rhetoric at the Superior College of Turin; and six months afterwards he had the offer of the situation of an ordinary professor at Chambéry, which he refused. About this period he projected, but did not execute, a work on the literary history of Piedmont. His discourse On the vicissitudes of Literature, which was printed in 1760, attracted a considerable degree of attention, and drew upon him the vengeance of Voltaire, who attacked him in his Homme aux quarante ecus, published in 1767. The publication of the first volume of his great work On the Revolutions of Italy obtained for him the professorship of rhetoric in the Superior College of Turin; and twelve months afterwards, on the publication of the second volume, he was preferred to the chair of Italian eloquence, and of the Greek language, at the university. The third volume, which was published in 1771, was still more favourably received than the preceding; while at the same time it tended to augment the number and to increase the virulence of his enemies. The misfortune, however, which he now experienced, was partly occasioned by his own indiscretion. A manuscript, containing some obnoxious opinions, which he had entrusted to Cambiagi at Florence, having been published by authority of the Tuscan censors, but without that of the censors of Turin, Denina was declared to be guilty of an infraction of the Piedmontese laws, and punished with great severity. His book was suppressed, and he was compelled to pay the costs. He was then banished to Vercelli, and afterwards received orders to retire to his native province. Denina’s friend, the Abbé Costa d’Arignan, undertook his defence, and procured the restoration of part of his annual pensions, with permission to return to Turin.

In 1782 he repaired to Berlin, having before his departure received the honorary title of librarian to the king of Sardinia. On his arrival at Berlin, Frederick II. appointed him a member of the Royal Academy, but he never became a favourite of that prince. He continued to reside in Germany for many years, where he occupied himself with literary pursuits, and published a variety of works. Being at Mentz in 1804, he was noticed by Napoleon Bonaparte, who, in the month of October of that year, appointed him his librarian. Denina accordingly went to Paris, where he continued to reside until his death, on the 5th of December 1813.

Denina is esteemed one of the most distinguished of the later Italian authors.. The work upon which his reputation is principally founded is his History of the Revolutions of Italy, of which an improved edition was published at Turin in 1782, in five volumes 4to. In this work the facts are related with accuracy, and the narrative exhibits considerable talents for history. Some able critics in the Italian language have remarked that there is a great difference between the style of this work and that of the other writings of the same author; and Denina acknowledged that he had submitted his history to the review of his friend the Abbé Costa d’Arignan, afterwards Cardinal and Archbishop of Turin, who made a good many judicious corrections.
