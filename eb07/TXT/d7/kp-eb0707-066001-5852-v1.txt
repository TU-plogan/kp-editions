DEAN, an ecclesiastical dignitary in cathedral and collegiate churches, and head of the chapter.

The Rural-DsAN, called also Arch-Presbyter, originally exercised jurisdiction over ten churches in the country, and afterwards became only the bishop’s substitute, in order to grant letters of administration, probate of wills, and the like; to convocate the clergy, and signify to them, sometimes by letter, the bishop’s will; and to give induction to the archdeacon. The office is now merged in that of the archdeacons and chancellors.

Dean of a Monastery, was a superior established under thď abbot, to assist him in taking care of the monks; from which he was called decanus. Dean and Chapter, are the council of the bishop, to assist him with their advice in affairs of religion, and also in the temporal concerns of his see. When the rest of the clergy were settled in the several parishes of each diocese, these were reserved for the celebration of divine service in the bishop’s own cathedral; and the chief of them, who presided over the rest, obtained the name of decanus or dean, being probably at first appointed to superintend ten canons or prebendaries.

All ancient deans are elected by the chapter by conge délire from the king, and letters missive of recommendation, in the same manner as bishops; but in those chapters which were founded by Henry VIII. out of the spoils of the dissolved monasteries, the deanery is donative, and the installation merely by the king’s letters patent. The chapter, consisting of canons or prebendaries, is sometimes appointed by the king, sometimes by the bishop, and sometimes elected.

The dean and chapter arc the nominal electors of a bishop. The bishop is their ordinary and immediate superior; and has, generally speaking, the power of visiting them, and of correcting their excesses and enormities. They had also a check on the bishop at common law; for until the statute of 32 Hen. VIII. c. 28, his grant or lease would not have bound his successors, unless it had been confirmed by the dean and chapter.
