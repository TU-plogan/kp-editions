DAHALAK, or Dahlak, an island in the Red Sea, off the coast of Abyssinia, nearly opposite to Massuah. It is about twenty-five miles in length, and twelve in breadth. It was once populous, and carried on a considerable trade. The principal port was called Dahalak-el-Kibar; and vestiges of its former importance still remain, but the water is scarcely sufficient to admit small vessels. There is still, however, a little trade between the island and Massuah.
