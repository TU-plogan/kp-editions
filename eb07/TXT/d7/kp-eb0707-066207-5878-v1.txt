DECIMAL Arithmetic, the art of computing by decimal fractions. See Arithmetic. Circulating Decimals, called also recurring or repeating decimals, are those in which a figure or several figures are continually repeated. They are distinguished into single and multiple, and these again into pure and mixed.

A pure single circulate is that in which one figure only is repeated; as ∙222, &c. and is marked thus ∙2.

A pure multiple circulate is that in which several figures are continually repeated; as ∙232323, &c. marked ∙23; and •524524, &c. marked ∙524.

A mixed single circulate is that which consists of a terminate part and a single repeating figure; as 4∙222, &c. or 4∙2. And

A mixed multiple circulate is that which contains a terminate part with several repeating figures; as 45∙524.

That part of the circulate which repeats is called there-petcnd ; and the whole repetend, supposed to be infinitely continued, is equal to a vulgar fraction whose numerator [7:7:663] is the repeating number or figures, and its denominator the same number of nines; so ∙2 is = §; and ∙23 is and ∙524 is =

, Dr Wallis, it appears, was the first who distinctly considered or treated of infinite’circulating decimals, as he himself informs us in his Treatise of Infinites.
