DANEGELT, an annual tax imposed on the Anglo-Saxons, for every hide of land throughout the realm, in order to maintain such a number of forces as were thought sufficient to clear the British seas of Danish pirates, who heretofore had greatly annoyed our coasts.

Danegelt was first imposed as a standing yearly tax on the whole nation under King Ethelred, A. d. 991, That prince, says Camden, much distressed by the continued invasions of the Danes, in order to procure a peace, wascom-pelled to charge his people with heavy taxes called done-gelt. Edward the Confessor remitted this tax, but William I. and II. resumed it occasionally. In the reign of Henry I, it was accounted among the king’s standing revenues; but King Stephen, on his coronation-day, abrogated it forever. No church or church-land paid a penny to the danegelt; because, as is set forth in an ancient Saxon law, the people of England placed more confidence in the prayers of the church than in any military defence they could make.
