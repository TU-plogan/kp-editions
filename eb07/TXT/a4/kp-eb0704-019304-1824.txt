AULCESTER, a market-town in the county of Warwick, distant 103 miles from London and 14 from Warwick. It stands at the junction of the two rivers Alne and Arrow. It was formerly a place of more importance, and the residence of some of our monarchs in remote periods. It still has a church, which is a fine Gothic structure. The market is held on Tuesday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1625, in 1811 to 1862, and in 1821 to 2229.
