+====================================================================+


AYLMER, John, bishop of London in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was born in the year 1521, at Ayhner-hall, in the parish of Tilney, in the county of Norfolk. Whilst a boy, he was distinguished for his quick parts by the marquis of Dorset, afterwards duke of Suffolk, who sent him to Cambridge, and made him his chaplain, and tutor to his children. One of these children was the unfortunate Lady Jane Grey, who soon became perfectly acquainted with the Latin and Greek languages. His first preferment was to the archdeaconry of Stow, in the diocese of Lincoln; which gave him a seat in the convocation held in the first year of Queen Mary, where he resolutely opposed the return to popery, to which the generality of the clergy were inclined. He was soon after obliged to flee his country and take shelter among the Protestants in Switzerland. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth he returned to England. In 1562, he obtained the archdeaconry of Lincoln, and was a member of the famous synod of that year, which reformed and settled the doctrine and discipline of the church of England. In the year 1576, he was consecrated bishop of London. He died in the year 1594, aged 73, and was buried in St Paul’s. He was a learned man, a zealous father of the church, and a bitter enemy to the Puritans. He published a piece entitled Mn Harborowefor Faithfull and Trewe Subjects against the late blowne Blaste concerning the Government of Women, &c. This was written whilst he was abroad, in answer to Knox, who published a book in Geneva under this title, The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment and Empire of Women. He is supposed by Strype to have published Lady Jane Grey’s letter to Harding. He also assisted Fox in translating his History of Martyrs into Latin.
