AVISON, Charles, organist of Newcastle, and a disciple of Geminiani, was the author of an essay on musical expression, published in the year 1752, in which are some judicious reflections on music in general. Throughout his book he celebrates Marcello andGeminiani; the latter frequently to the prejudice of Mr Handel. In the year 1753 came out Remarks on Mr Avison’s Essay on Musical Expression, the author whereof first points out sundry errors against the rules of composition in the works of A vison. In the same year Avisen republished his essay, with a reply to the author of the remarks; and a letter, containing a number of loose particulars relating to music, collected in a course of various reading, unquestionably written by Dr Jortin. Avison promoted and assisted in the publication of Marcello’s music to the Psalms, adapted to English words. Of his own composition there are extant five collections of concertos for violins, forty-four in number, and two sets of sonatas for the harpsichord and two violins, a species of composition little known in England till his time. The music of Avison is light and elegant, but it wants originality; a necessary consequence of his too close attachment to the style of Geminiani, which in a few particulars only he was able to imitate.
