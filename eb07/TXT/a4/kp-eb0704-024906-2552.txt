AVEIRON or Aveyron, a department so called from the river of the same name, which runs through it from east to west. It is bounded on the north by the department of Cantal, on the north-cast by that of Lozère, on the east by that of the Gard, on the south-east by that of Hérault, on the south-west by that of the Tarn, and on the west by that of Lot. It extends over 3740 square miles, or 2,393,000 acres. The face of the country is mountainous and woody; and hence, though corn and wine are produced, and much cattle fed, the chief productions are fish, game, and wood. It contains mines of copper, iron, lead, alum, sulphur, and coal. The capital is Rodez. The population at the last census amounted to 327,424, and it sends to the legislative assembly three representatives.
