AUGUSTUS, Fort, a small fortress seated on a plain at the head of Loch Ness, in Scotland, between the rivers Tarf and Oich.

Augustus, the appellation conferred upon Caesar Octavianus, the first Roman emperor. The obscure name Octavianus, Mr Gibbon observes, he derived from a mean family in the little town of Aricia. It was stained with the blood of the proscription; and he was desirous, had it been possible, to eraze all memory of his former life. The illustrious surname of Caesar he had assumed, as the adopted son of the dictator; but he had too much good sense either to hope to be confounded, or to wish to be compared, with that extraordinary man. It was proposed in the senate to dignify their minister with a new appellation; and, after a very serious discussion, that of Augustus was chosen from among several others, as being the most expressive of the character of peace and sanctity which he uniformly affected. Augustus was therefore a personal, Caesar a family, distinction. The former should naturally have expired with the prince on whom it was bestowed; and, however the latter was diffused by adoption and female alliance, Nero was the last prince who could allege any hereditary claim to the honours of the Julian line. But at the time of his death the practice of a century had inseparably connected those appellations with the imperial dignity, and they have been preserved by a long succession of emperors, Romans, Greeks, Franks, and Germans, from the fall of the republic to the present time. A distinction was, however, soon introduced. The sacred title of Augustus was always reserved for the monarch; the name of Caesar was more freely communicated to his relations, and, from the reign of Hadrian at least, became appropriated to the second person in the state, who was considered the presumptive heir of the empire.
