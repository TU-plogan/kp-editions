AVENUE, in Gardening, a walk planted on each side with trees, and leading to a house, garden-gate, wood, &c. and generally terminated by some distant object. The trees most proper for avenues with us are the English elm, the lime, the horse-chestnut, the common chestnut, the beech, and the abele. The English elm will do in all grounds, except such as are very wet and shallow; and this is preferred to all other trees, because it will bear cutting, heading, or lopping in any manner, better than most others. The rough or smooth Dutch elm is approved by some, because of its quick growth. This is a tree which will bear removing very well; it is also green almost as soon as any plant whatever in spring, and continues so as long as any; it makes an incomparable hedge, and is preferable to all other trees for lofty espaliers. The lime is valued for its natural growth and fine shade. The horse-chestnut is proper for all places that are not too much exposed to rough winds. The common chestnut will do very well in a good soil, and rises to a considerable height when planted somewhat close, though when it stands single it is rather inclined to spread than to grow tall. The beech is a beautiful tree, and naturally grows well with us in its wild state; but it is less to be chosen for avenues than the before-mentioned, because it does not bear transplanting well, and is very subject to miscarry. Lastly, the abele is fit for any soil, and is the quickest grower of any forest tree. It seldom fails in transplanting, and succeeds very well in wet soils, in which the others are apt to fail. The oak is but little used for avenues, because of its slow growth.
