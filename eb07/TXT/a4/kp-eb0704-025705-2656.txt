AXIM, a small territory on the Gold Coast of Africa, due east of Apollonia. The climate in this part is so excessively moist that it is proverbially said to rain eleven months and twenty-nine days of the year. This excessive moisture renders it very unhealthy, but it produces great quantities of rice, water melons, lemons, oranges, &c. Here are also produced vast numbers of black cattle, goats, sheep, tame pigeons, &c. The whole country is filled with beautiful and populous villages, and the intermediate lands are well cultivated; besides which the natives are very wealthy, from the constant traffic carried on with them by Europeans for their gold. The capital, which is also called Axim, by some Achambone, stands under the cannon of the Dutch fort St Antonio. This fort is commodious, in an agreeable and commanding position, and vessels may land with perfect safety. Behind, it is secured by a thick wood that covers the whole declivity of a neighbouring hill. Between the town and the sea runs an even and spacious shore of beautiful white sand. All the houses are separated by groves of cocoa and other fruit trees, planted in parallel lines, each of an equal width, and forming an elegant vista. The little river Axim crosses the town, and the coast is defended by a number of small pointed rocks which project from the shore, and render all access to it dangerous. The capital is situated in long. 24. 0. W. lat. 5. 0. N. This canton is a kind of republic, the government being divided between Ate Caboceroes or chief men, and Manaceroes or young men. It must be observed, however, that in their courts there is not even a pretence of justice; whoever makes the most valuable presents to the judges is sure to gain the cause, the judges themselves alleging the gratitude due for the bribes received as a reason; and if both parties happen to make presents of nearly equal value, they absolutely refuse to give the cause a hearing. âˆ™
