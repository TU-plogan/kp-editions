ATHENAEUM, in Antiquity, a public place wherein the professors of the liberal arts held their assemblies, the rhetoricians declaimed, and the poets rehearsed their performances. The three most celebrated Athenaea were those at Athens, at Rome, and at Lyons; the second of which was built by the emperor Adrian.
