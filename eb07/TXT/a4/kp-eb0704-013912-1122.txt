ATTACHMENT, in English Law, implies the taking or apprehending of a person by virtue of a writ or precept. It is distinguished from an arrest by proceeding out of a higher court by precept or writ; wher t eas the latter proceeds out of an inferior court by precept only. An arrest lies only against the body of a man; whereas an attachment lies often against the goods only, and sometimes against the body and goods. An attachment by writ differs from distress in not extending to lands; and a distress touches not the body, as an attachment does.
