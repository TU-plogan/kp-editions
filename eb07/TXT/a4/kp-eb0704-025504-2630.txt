AVES, one of the Carribbee Islands, 451 miles south of Porto Rico with a good harbour for the careening of ships. It is so called from the great number of birds that frequent it. There is another of the same name lying to the northward of this, in lat. 15. 0. N.; and a third near the eastern coast of Newfoundland, in lat. 50. 5. N.
