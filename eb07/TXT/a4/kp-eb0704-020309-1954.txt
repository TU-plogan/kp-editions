AUSTERLITZ, a small town of Moravia, situated twelve miles south-east of Brunn. It contains hardly 2000 inhabitants, but has been rendered memorable by the great victory obtained in its vicinity, on the 2d December 1805, by the French under Napoleon, over the united forces of Austria and Russia under their respective emperors.
