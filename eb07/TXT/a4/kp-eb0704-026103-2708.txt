AZAZEL. This word relates to the history of the scape-goat, under the Jewish religion. Some call the goat itself by this name, as St Jerome and Theodoret. Dr Spenser says, the scape-goat was to be sent to Azazel, by which is meant the devil. Îœ. Le Clerc translates it proecipitium, making it that steep and inaccessible place to which the goat was sent, and where it was supposed to perish.
