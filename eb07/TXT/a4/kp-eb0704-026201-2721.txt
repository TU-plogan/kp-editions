AZONI, in Ancient Mythology, a name applied by the Greeks to such of the gods as were deities at large, not appropriated to the worship of any particular town or country, but acknowledged in general by all countries, and worshipped by every nation. These the Latins called dii communes. Of this sort were the Sun, Mars, Luna, &c.
