AZËRBIJAN, a province of Persia, part of the ancient Media. It is separated from Armenia on the north by the river Araxes, and from Irak on the south by the Kizilozein or Golden stream. It has the Caspian Sea and Ghilan on the east, and Armenia and Kurdistan on the west, lhe country is superior to the southern provinces of Persia, being richly diversified with wood and water. It differs entirely from the provinces of Fars and Irak, as it consists of a regular succession of undulating eminences, partially cultivated, and opening into plains, such as Anjan, Tabreez, and Urumea or Ooroomea or Van. To the south the mountains of Sahund rise in an accumulated mass to the clouds; and on the north the black rocks of the district of Karabang disappear in the luxuriant vegetation of the plain of Mogam, which is 225 miles in length by seventy-five in breadth, and famed for its luxuriant pastures. Azerbijan is a fertile country, and of a most pleasing aspect. It is reckoned one of the most productive provinces

Persia, and the villages have a more pleasing appear- ail ce than those of Irak. The orchards and gardens, in W ∏ch they are for the most part embosomed, yield delicious fruits of almost every description. Provisions are c leap and abundant, and wine is made in considerable quantities. This province is watered by several considerable rivers, namely, the Araxes, the Kizilozein, and the Jugatty, which issues from the mountains of Ardelan, and is perhaps larger than either. The other rivers are the Yezdican, which has its source sixty miles east of Lake Urumea, and joins the Araxes; the Agi, whose waters are drained away in irrigation; and the Shar, which falls into the lake of Urumea. This is a great lake, about 300 miles in circumference. Its waters are more intensely salt than the sea. It is surrounded by some of the most fertile districts in Persia. The country to the north and west, namely, the districts of Ooroomea and Selmart, contains, the first 400 villages, and the second between 300 and 400 villages, flourishing and populous. This is the most picturesque and the most prosperous part of Azerbijan; yet even here the traveller from the more civilized regions of Europe laments at every step the sloth and want of enterprise among the inhabitants, who entirely neglect the natural advantages of their country. There are many rivers which fall into the lake, by which the produce of the rich and well-cultivated valleys through which they run might be transported across its waters, and dispersed among the different towns in the province. But there is not a single boat on this extensive expanse of water. The truth is, that individual exertion is damped by the tyranny of the government; the inhabitants fearing, that if boats were constructed for the navigation of the lake, they would be subjected to heavy duties, or arbitrarily impressed into the service of government. The bulk of the people are so held down by their rulers, that, in the hope of bettering their condition, they would hail with pleasure the approach of a Russian army. Lead, copper, saltpetre, and sulphur, are found within the confines of Azerbijan; also a kind of beautiful transparent marble or jasper, which takes the highest polish, and is usedin the buildings ofTabreez, Schiraz,and1spahan, under the name of Tabreez marble. The province is divided into twelve districts. The chief towns are Tabriz or Tabreez, containing 30,000 inhabitants; Meanna, Ardebil, Shebus-ter; Tasouj, in ruins; Selmart, with 2000 inhabitants; Khoee, with 25,000; Ooroomea, with 12,000; andMaraga, with 15,000. The climate is healthful, in summer and autumn hot, but cold in winter, which is severely felt by the lower orders, owing to the want of fuel, for which there is no substitute except dried cow-dung mixed with straw. The spring is temperate and delightful in the plains, but on the mountains snow lies for eight months in the year; and hail storms are so violent as frequently to destroy cattle in the fields. The best soils yield from fifty to sixty fold when abundantly irrigated; and supplies of water for this purpose are drawn from the many small rivers by which the province is intersected. Oxen are generally used to draw the plough. (Kinneir’s Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire ; Fraser’s Travels and Adventures in the Persian Provinces on the Caspian Sea.)
