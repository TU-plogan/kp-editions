AYSCUE, Sir George, a gallant English admiral, descended from a good family in Lincolnshire. He obtained the honour of knighthood from King Charles L which, however, did not withhold him from adhering to the parliament in the civil war. He was by them constituted admiral of the Irish seas, where he is said to have done great service to the Protestant interest, and to have contributed much to the reduction of the whole island. In 1651 he reduced Barbadoes and Virginia, then held for the king, to the obedience of the parliament; and soon [7:4:261] after the Restoration behaved with much gallantry in the war with the Dutch. In the famous engagement in the ' beginning of June 1666, when Sir George was admiral of ' the white squadron, his ship, the Royal Prince, ran upon the Gallop-sand, where, being surrounded with enemies, his men obliged him to strike. He went no more to sea after this, but spent the rest of his days in retirement.
