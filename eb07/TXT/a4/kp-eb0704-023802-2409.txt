AUTOCRATOR, a person vested with an absolute independent power, by which he is rendered unaccountable to any other for his actions. The power of the Athenian generals or commanders was usually limited; so that, at the expiration of their office, they were liable to render an account of their administration. But, on some extraordinary occasions, they were exempted from this restraint, and sent with a full and uncontrollable authority; in which sense they were styled Αυτοx,ξα,τοξi1. The same people also applied the name to some of their ambassadors, who were vested with a full power of determining matters according [7:4:239]to their own discretion. These were denominated Τϊξΐσβιις hurο×ζaτοξiζ, and resembled our plenipotentiaries.
