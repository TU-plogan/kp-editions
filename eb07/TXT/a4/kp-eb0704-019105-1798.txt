AUGSBURG, a city of Bavaria, the capital of the circle of the Upper Danube, celebrated in all the periods of German history. It is built on a beautiful plain between the rivers Lech and Wertach, and is surrounded with walls and ditches; but these form very imperfect defences against an enemy. The city is generally ill built, and most of the streets are narrow; but the Max street is very magnificent, both for its breadth and the grandeur of the buildings. The public buildings especially are very noble edifices. The inhabitants amount to 28,900, of whom 16,800 are Catholics, and 12,060 Lutherans. The manufactures are respectable, and produce, though in diminished quantities, silver goods, linen, parchment, tobacco, leather, paper, silk goods, looking-glasses, soap, sealing-wax, and printed cottons. The commerce is still very respectable, as this city is the centre of communication between the south of Germany and Italy. Long. 11. 0. 14. E. Lat. 48. 21. 24. N.

Augsburg Confession denotes a celebrated confession of faith drawn up by Luther and Melanchthon, on behalf of themselves and other reformers, and presented in 1530 to the emperor Charles V. at the diet of Augusta or Augsburg, in the name of the evangelic body. This confession contains twenty-eight chapters, of which the greater part is employed in representing, with perspicuity and truth, the religious opinions of the Protestants, and the rest in pointing out the errors and abuses that occasioned their separation from the church of Rome.
