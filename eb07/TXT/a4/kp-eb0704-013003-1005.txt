ATHOL, the most northern district of Perthshire, in Scotland, extending about 45 miles in length by 40 in breadth. It is bordered on the north by Badenoch, on the west by Lochaber, on the east and south-east by Mar and Gowrie, on the south by Stratherne and Perth Proper, and on the south-west by Breadalbane. This district is rough and mountainous, interspersed with woods and valleys, but withal beautiful and romantic. In Blair, amidst a wilderness of old trees, stands Blair Castle, the principal seat of the duke of Athol. In the same neighbourhood is situated the pass of Killicranky, memorable as being the scene of action between the troops of William III. under General Mâ€˜Kay, and the highland adherents of James II. under the celebrated Viscount Dundee. Athol possesses a few villages; but it is destitute of towns of any importance.
