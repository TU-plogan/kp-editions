ATHELSTAN, a Saxon king of England, natural son of Edward the Elder, and grandson of the great Alfred. He succeeded to the crown in 925, and reigned 16 years. There was a remarkable law passed by this prince, which shows his just sentiments of the advantages of commerce, as well as the early attention to it in this country. It declared, that any merchant who made three voyages on his own account beyond the British channel or narrow seas, should be entitled to the privilege of a thane or gentleman.
