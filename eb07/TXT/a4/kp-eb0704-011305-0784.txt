ATHEIST, a person who does not believe the existence of a Deity. Many, both ancient and modern, have pretended to atheism, or have been reckoned atheists by the world; but it may be justly questioned whether any man ever seriously adopted such a principle. Among us, the greatest philosophers have been the principal advocates for the existence of a Deity. So true is the saying of Lord Bacon, that though a smattering of philosophy may lead a man into atheism, a deep draught will certainly bring him back again to the belief of a God and Providence.
