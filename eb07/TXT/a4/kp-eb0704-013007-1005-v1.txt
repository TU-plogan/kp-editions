ATKYNS, Richard, was born of a good family at Tuffleigh, in Gloucestershire, in the year 1615. He was educated at Oxford, from whence he removed to Lincoln’s inn. During the civil wars he distinguished himself by his loyalty to King Charles I., and raised for him a troop of horse at his own expense. At the restoration he was made one of the deputy-lieutenants of Gloucestershire, and was remarkable for his attachment to the government. But at length being committed prisoner to the Marshalsea, in Southwark, for debt, he died there on the 14th of September 1677. He wrote several pieces, particularly a treatise On the Original and Growth of Printing.
