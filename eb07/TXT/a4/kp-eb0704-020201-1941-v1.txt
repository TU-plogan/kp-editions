AURUNGABAD, a large province of Hindostan, in the Deccan, about 300 miles in length by 160 in average breadth. It is situated principally between the 18th and 19th degrees of north latitude, and is bounded on the north by Gujerat, Khandeish, and Berar; on the east by Beeder; on the south by Bejapoor, from which it is separated by the Neera and Beema rivers; and on the west by the Indian Ocean. The great chain of the Ghauts runs through this province in a direction north and south, at the distance of about 100 miles from the Indian Ocean, and rises to a very considerable elevation; and the surface of the country, particularly in their neighbourhood, is irregular, and in general mountainous. The rivers which rise on the western declivity of these mountains, and flow into the Indian Ocean, have necessarily a short course, and are inconsiderable in size; while those again which have their sources on the eastern declivity of the mountains, and flow eastward into the Bay of Bengal, such as the Beema, the Neera, and the Godavery, do not attain any considerable size until they are beyond the limits of this province. Rice is the great staple of agriculture, especially in the lower districts, which are in general fertile, and, besides supplying the wants of the inhabitants, yield a surplus for exportation. A different mode of agriculture is however followed in the higher districts. The other vegetable productions, besides rice, are the same as in other parts of Ĥindostan. Horses of a hardy breed are reared in great numbers for the Mahratta caValry; but they are neither strong nor handsome, though they suit the light weight of the riders for whom they are intended. A great proportion oí this province, and almost all the sea-coast, were long in possession of the Mahrattas, who were pirates by sea as well as robbers by land: they seldom ventured on the ocean except as pirates, and they continued their predatory habits by sea and by land until they were restrained by the strong arm of British power. Three-fourths or the province were formerly subject to the Peishwa, and the remainder to the Nizam; with the exception of the islands of Bombay, Salsette, and a few tracts on the main land. 1he inhabitants are not supposed to exceed six millions, of whom not above one-twentieth are of the Mahometan persuasion. The language commonly used is the Mahratta, but there are besides various provincial dialects.

Aurungλbad, the capital of the above province, which [7:4:203] was formerly named Guřka. It was the capital of the Mogul conquests; and having become the favourite residence of Aurungzebe during his viceroyalty of the Deccan, it received the name of Aurungabad, from which the name of the province was derived. The city contained the capital of the modern Nizams after they became independent of Delhi, until they quitted it for Hyderabad. The city has fallen from its ancient grandeur. The interior is but half peopled and in ruins, and presents all the appearances of desertion and decay. The population is, however, still considerable; and in the bazaar, which is very extensive, are exposed for sale various kinds of commodities, European and Indian, particularly silks and shawls. The walls are similar in their construction to those of all the other cities in this quarter in India, being rather low, with round towers. The travelling distance from Poona is 186 miles, from Bombay by Poona 284, from Hyderabad 295, from Madras 647, from Delhi 750, and from Calcutta 1022 miles. Long. 75. 33. E. Lat. 19. 54. N.
