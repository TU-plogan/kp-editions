AYLESBURY, a market and borough town of the hundred of the same name, in the county of Buckingham, and thirty-nine miles from London. It stands on a gentle hill in the centre of a fertile vale, through which one of those small streams runs, the waters of which contribute to form the Thames. It is favoured by the extension to it of the Grand Junction Canal, which affords water-carriage for coals and other heavy substances from Staffordshire, and brings it into connection with the metropolis. There is but little employment in manufactures, which are almost wholly confined to bone lace. The county jail is here, and the elections for the county are also held at Aylesbury, as well as the sessions, and in alternate times the assizes. The market is held on Saturday. The population in 1801 amounted to 3186, in 1811 to 3447, and in 1821 to 4404.
