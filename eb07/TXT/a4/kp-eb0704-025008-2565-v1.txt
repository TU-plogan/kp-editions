AVENZOAR, Abu Merwan Abdalmalec ebn Zohr, an eminent Arabian physician, who flourished about the end of the eleventh or the beginning of the twelfth century. FIe was of noble descent, and born at Seville, the capital of Andalusia, where he exercised his profession with great reputation. He was contemporary with Averroes, who, according to Leo Africanus, heard his lectures and learned physic of him. This seems the more probable, because Averroes more than once gives Avenzoar very high and deserved praise, calling him admirable, glorious, the treasure of all hnowledge, and the most supreme in physic from the time of Galen to his own. Avenzoar, notwithstanding, is by the generality of writers reckoned an empiric; but Dr Freind observes that this character suits him less than any of the rest of the Arabians. He wrote a book entitled The Method of Preparing Medicines and Diet, which was translated into Hebrew in the year 1280, and thence into Latin by Paravicius, whose version has passed through several editions.
