AXMINSTER, a market-town in the hundred of the same name, in the county of Devon. It takes its name from the river Axe, on which it stands, and the ancient abbey church or minster which ornaments the centre of the town, and which was built by King Athelstane to commemorate a victory over the Danes. It is 147 miles from London, on the great road to Exeter, from which it is twenty-six miles distant. It is distinguished for its manufactory of the best and most costly description of carpets; and besides that, there is some trade in making gloves, tapes, and druggets. The market is held on Saturday. The population in 1801 amounted to 2154, in 1811 to 2387, and in 1821 to 2742.
