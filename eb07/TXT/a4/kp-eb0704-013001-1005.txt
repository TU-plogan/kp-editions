ATHLETAE, in Antiquity, persons of strength and agility, disciplined to perform in the public games. The word is originally Greek, c0ληr>jς, formed from c0λoς, certamen, combat; whence also, αSλoμ, the prize or reward adjudged to the victor. Under athletae were comprehended wrestlers, boxers, runners, leapers, throwers of the disk, and those practised-in other exercises exhibited in the Olympic, Pythian, and other solemn sports.
