AUXILIARY, whatever is aiding or helping to another.

Auxiliary Verbs, in Grammar, are such as help to form or conjugate others; that is, are prefixed to them, to form or denote the modes or tenses thereof; as, to have and to be in the English; Ãªtre and avoir in the French; ho and sono in the Italian, &c. In the English language the auxiliary verb am supplies the want of passive verbs.
