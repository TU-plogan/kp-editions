AUŢOPYROS, from aυτoς, and <nvgoς, wheat; in the ancient diet, an epithet given to a species of bread, wherein the whole substance of the wheat was retained, without retrenching any part of the bran. Galen describes it otherwise, viz. as bread where only the coarser bran was taken out; and thus it was a medium between the finest bread, called similagineus, and the coarsest, called furfu-raceus. This was also called autopyrites and syncomistus.
