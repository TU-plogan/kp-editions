AZAMOR, a small sea-port of the kingdom of Morocco, in Africa. It is situated on the river Morbeya, in the province of Duguella, at a considerable distance from its mouth. This town, though formerly very considerable, is ill fitted for maritime commerce, the entrance of the river being very dangerous. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Portuguese in 1508; it was taken, however, in 1513, by the duke of Braganza, but abandoned about the end of the sixteenth century. According to Mr Jackson, the present population does not exceed 1000. Long. 8. 15. W. Lat. 33. 20. N.
