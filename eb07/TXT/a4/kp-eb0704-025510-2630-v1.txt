AVIGNON, an arrondissement in the department of Vaucluse, in France, the extent of which is 174 square miles, or 117,360 acres. It comprehends five cantons, divided into 21 communes, containing 52,504 inhabitants. The capital of the arrondissement is of the same name, and situated in a beautiful valley on the left bank of the Rhone. The city is surrounded by walls planted with trees, which form an agreeable promenade. The houses are old but large, the streets narrow and crooked, but some of the public edifices are magnificent. The dwellings at the last census were 2800, and the inhabitants 23,789. The chief object of industry is the preparation of silk and the manufacture of goods dependent on that substance. There are, besides, manufactures of paper, leather, hats, jewellery, and some other articles. Up to the French revolution the city belonged to the papal see, and was the residence of the several popes from 1303 to 1376. By an act of atrocious injustice it was seized by the republicans, and after some barbarous proceedings was at length united to France. Long. 4. 52. 20. E. Lat. 43. 56. 58. N.
