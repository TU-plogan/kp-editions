AUTOMATON (from avτος, ipse, and μaoμaι, excitor), a self-moving machine, or one so constructed, by means of weights, levers, pulleys, and other mechanism, as to move for a considerable time as if endowed with animal life. According to this description, clocks, watches, and all machines of that kind, are automata.

Under the article Androïdes, it was observed that the highest perfection to which automata could be carried was to imitate exactly the motions and actions of living creatures, especially of mankind, which are with more difficulty imitated than those of other animals. Very surprising imitations, however, have been made of other creatures. So long ago as 400 years before Christ, Archytas of Tarentum is said to have made a wooden pigeon that could fly; nor will this appear at all incredible, when we consider the flute-player made by Μ. Vaucanson, and the chessplayer made by Μ. Kempel. Dr Hooke is also said to have made the model of a flying chariot, capable of supporting itself in the air. But Μ. Vaucanson above mentioned distinguished himself still more eminently. That gentleman, encouraged by the favourable reception of his fluteplayer, made a duck, which was capable of eating, drinking, and imitating exactly the natural voice of that fowl. Nay, what is still more surprising, the food it swallowed was evacuated in a digested state; not that it was really in a state of natural excrement, but only considerably altered from what it was when swallowed; and this digestion was performed on the principle of solution, not of trituration. The wings, viscera, and bones, of this artificial duck, were also formed so as very strongly to resemble those of a living animal. Even in the actions of eating and drinking this resemblance was preserved; the artificial duck swallowed with avidity and with quick motions of the head and throat, and likewise muddled the water with its bill, exactly like a natural one. See Androïdes.
