AUSI, an ancient and very savage people of Libya. Herodotus tells us that they were unacquainted with marriage, and had all their women in common. The children were brought up by their mothers till they were able to walk; after which they were introduced to an assembly of the men, who met every three months, and the man to whom any child first spoke acknowledged himself its father. They celebrated annually a feast in honour of Minerva, in which the girls, dividing into two companies, foughtwith sticks and stones, and those who died of their wounds were concluded not to have been virgins.
