AUTOCHTHONES, an appellation assumed by some nations, importing that they sprung, or were produced, from the same soil which they still inhabited. In this sense Autochthones is nearly synonymous with Aborigines. The Athenians valued themselves on their being Autochthones, self-born, or γr i γοκις, earth-born ; it being the prevailing opinion among the ancients, that, in the beginning, the earth, by some prolific power, produced men, as it still does plants. The proper Autochthones were those primitive men who had no other parent beside the earth; but the name was also assumed by the descendants of these men, provided they never changed their ancient state, nor suffered other nations to mix with them. In this sense it was that the Greeks, and especially the Athenians, pretended to be Autochthones, and, as a badge of this distinction, wore a golden grasshopper woven in their hair, an insect supposed to have the same origin.
