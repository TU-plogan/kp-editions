AVLONA, a Turkish European paschalic, comprehending a part of the ancient Albania, and a province on the sea-coast. It is bounded on the north and north-east by the paschalic of Ilbessan, on the south-east by Yanina, on the south by Delonia, and on the west by the Adriatic Sea. I he climate and soil resemble that of the south of France, and the productions are similar. The woods abound with game, and the rivers and coasts with fish. The chief trade is the export of corn, salt, and pitch, with some live cattle. The inhabitants amount to about 250,000, of whom two thirds are Arnauts and Greeks of the Greek church, and one third Arnauts and Turks of the Mahommeđan faith. The Kimariots are few in number, but lead a wild life among the mountains, in a kind of savage republican state of equality. Most of them are of the Greek faith, but some are Mahommedans. It extends from long. 19. 38. to 20. 25. E. and from lat. 39. 50. to 40. 51. N.

Avlona, or Valona, a city, the chief place of the province of the same name, deriving its name from the bay on which it is situated. The harbour is sheltered from all winds, and the anchorage is good, with never less than fifteen nor more than twenty-three fathoms in depth. It has about 5000 inhabitants, many of whom are employed in making arms of different kinds to supply the Arnauts. It is the seat of a Greek bishop.
