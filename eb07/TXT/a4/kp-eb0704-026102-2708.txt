AZARIAH, or Uzzian, a king of Judah, succeeded his father Amaziah, 810 years before Christ. He assembled an army of above 300,000 men, with which he conquered the Philistines, demolishing the walls of Gath, Jabniel, and Ashdod, and built up the walls of Jerusalem, furnished the city with conduits, and planted gardens and vineyards; but at last, being elated with his prosperity, and resolving to usurp the office of high-priest, he was struck with leprosy, which obliged him to remain shut up in his palace for the rest of his days. He died about 759 years before the Christian era, and was succeeded by Jotham his son. There are several other persons of this name mentioned in the sacred Scriptures.
