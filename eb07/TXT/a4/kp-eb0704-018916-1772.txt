AUDE, a department of France, taking its name from the river, which rises in the Eastern Pyrenees, and runs through it in two branches to the Mediterranean Sea. It is bounded by the department of Hérault on the northeast, that of the Tarn on the north, by the Mediterranean on the east, and by the department of the Arriège on the west. Its extent is 2550 square miles, or 1,632,000 acres. It is divided into four circles, viz. Narbonne, Limoux, Carcassonne, and Castelnaudry; which are again divided into 31 cantons, and these subdivided into 436 communes or parishes. The inhabitants by the last census amounted to 262,190. The soil produces corn, fruit, wine, olives, and mulberry trees. The manufactures are of linen, woollen, and silk. The canal of Languedoc, which passes through the department, is highly beneficial to its trade. The chief city is Carcassonne. The department sends two members to the legislative assembly.
