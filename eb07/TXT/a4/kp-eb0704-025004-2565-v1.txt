AVENTINE, John, author of the Annals of Bavaria, was born in the year 1466, at Abensperg, in the country just named. He studied first at Ingoldstadt, and afterwards in the university of Paris. In 1503, he privately taught eloquence and poetry at Vienna, and, in 1507, he publicly taught Greek at Cracow in Poland. In 1509, he read lectures on some of Cicero’s works at Ingoldstadt, and, in 1512, was appointed preceptor to Prince Louis and Prince Ernest, sons of Albert the Wise, duke of Bavaria, and travelled with the latter of these princes. After this he undertook to write the Annals of Bavaria, being encouraged by the dukes of that name, who settled a pension upon him, and gave him hopes that they would defray the charges of the book. This work, which gained its author great reputation, was first published in 1554, by Jerome Zieglerus, professor of poetry in the university of Ingoldstadt; and afterwards at Basil, in 1580, by Nicholas Cisner. He died in 1534, aged 68.
