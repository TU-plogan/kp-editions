AUCKLAND-BISHOPS, a market-town in the ward of Darlington and county of Durham, 257 miles from London and 12 from the city of Durham. It stands on the banks of the river Wear, at its confluence with the Gaun-less or Wandless. Its name is derived from the great number of oak-trees that formerly surrounded it, and from the palace belonging to the bishop of Durham. The town is remarkably well built. The parish church, a Gothic structure, is one mile from the town, at Auckland St Andrews. It has some manufactures of muslins and other cotton goods. The market is held on Thursday. The population in 1801 amounted to 1961, in 1811 to 2007, and in 1821 to 2180.
