ATKINS, Sir Robert, lord chief baron of the exchequer, was born in 1621, and educated at the university of Oxford, from whence he removed to the inns of court, and became eminent in the law. He was made knight of the bath, with many other persons of the first distinction, at the coronation of King Charles II. In 1672 he was appointed one of the judges of common pleas, in which honourable station he continued till 1679, when, foreseeing the troubles that soon afterwards ensued, he resigned his office, and retired into the country. In 1689 he was made lord chief baron of the exchequer by King William; and about the same time held the office of speaker to the house of lords, which had been previously refused by the marquis of Halifax. He distinguished himself by an unshaken zeal for the laws and liberties of his country. He wrote several pieces, which have been collected into an octavo volume, under the title of Parliamentary and Political Tracts. It has been remarked, that whoever wishes thorough information on the true constitution of his country, on the grounds and reasons of the revolution, and on the danger of suffering prerogative to jostle law, cannot read a better or plainer book than those tracts. He died in 1709, aged 88.

Atkins, Sir Robert, son of the preceding, was born in 1646. He wrote The Ancient and Present State of Gloucestershire, in one large folio volume. He died October 29, 1711.
