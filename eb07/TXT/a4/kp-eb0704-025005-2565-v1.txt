AVENTINUS Mons, one of the seven hills on which ancient Rome stood. The origin of the name Aventinus is uncertain; but this hill was also called Murcius, from Murcia, the goddess of sloth, who had a little chapel there; and Collis Dianae, from the temple of Diana; likewise Remonius, from Remus, who wanted to build the city, and who was buried there. It was taken within the compass of the city by Ancus Martius. To the east it had the city walls, to the south the Campus Figulinus, to the west the Tiber, and to the north Mons Palatinus; in circuit two miles and a quarter.
