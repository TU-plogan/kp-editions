AVILA, one of the four provinces into which Old Castile in Spain is divided. It is the least of the four, and most thinly peopled. The extent is 215 square leagues, and the population 118,061 souls. The high ridge of the mountains of Guadarrama separates it from the province.of Madrid. The principal river which waters it is the Adaja, on which the capital Avila, a small and insignificant city, though the see of a bishop, is built. This province, once flourishing, has gradually declined in wealth and population during the last two centuries, and the exertions of industry have not been directed of late to improvement. The principal production is the wool of the Merino sheep, a great number of which are shorn in this province; and the fleeces, after being washed and sorted, are sent to the northern ports to be shipped to the different countries where they are consumed. It contains one city, 82 towns, 202 villages, 299 parishes, 28 monasteries, and 19 nunneries. The inhabitants obtain of wine 150,000, of brandy 2000, and of oil 3000 arobas, and of silk 300 cwt. It is situated between long. 4. 14. and 5. 55. W. and lat. 30. 48. and 4L 18. N.
