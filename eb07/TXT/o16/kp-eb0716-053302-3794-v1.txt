ORGANO-LYRICON, a musical instrument invented at Paris in 1810, by Μ. de Saint Pern. Its height is about eight feet two inches English, its breadth six feet six and a half inches, its depth about four feet four inches. It consists of apiano-forte, coupled with twelve different windinstruments, viz. three kinds of flutes, an oboe, a clarinet, a bassoon, horns, trumpet, and fife. It has two rows of finger-keys. The lower row belongs to the piano-forte; but, by an ingenious mechanism, and according to the depression of the keys by the performer, it may be made to sound either the piano-forte alone, or a flute, or an oboe, or to unite them all. The upper row of finger-keys has no action on the piano-forte; but, by management of the pressure, it causes the German flute or the oboe to sound, and produces τinforzi by the gradual re-union of several wind-instruments. Independently of these functions, this row of finger-keys is destined for a great church-organ placed above it. The correspondence between the two rows of finger-keys is such, that they may, at the will of the performer, act together or separately, or even partially. The finger-keys are singularly light in their touch, even at their maximum of depression. At the bottom of [7:16:534] the instrument there are pedals for the double bass, and for other combinations. The wind-chests are numerous, and of such capacity that the wind of the large bellows which fill them cannot produce in them any augmentation injurious to the purity of the timbre and the trueness of the intonation. In this instrument, by means of ingenious contrivances, the inconveniences of an irregular supply of wind have been carefully avoided. A double pedal for the right foot enables the performer to work the bellows himself when he is alone. An adjacent pedal, turned the opposite way, enables an assistant to do this. But, to avoid the trouble of these pedals, Μ. de Saint Pern placed in an adjoining room a large piece of clock-work, moved by a weight of fifty pounds, which served instead of a bellows-blower. The performer has beside him a mechanism that communicates with the clock-work, and, by means of a click and spring, leaves the weight going, or stops it at pleasure. See Report read to the French Institute on the 10th of September 1810; also Report of the French Conservatory of Music, 12th of August 1810, where it is said that “Μ. de Saint Pern’s organo-lyricon might, in a large room or a chapel, hold the place of an orchestra, and imitate nearly all the effects of one.”
