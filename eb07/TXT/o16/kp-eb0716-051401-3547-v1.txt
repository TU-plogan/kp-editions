OPTIMATES, one of the divisions of the Roman people, and opposed to populares. It is not easy to ascertain the characteristic differences of these two parties. Some say the optimates were warm supporters of the dignity of the chief magistrate, and promoters of the grandeur of the state, caring not if the inferior members suffered, provided the superior powers were advanced; whereas the populares boldly contended for the rights of the people, claimed larger privileges, and laboured to bring matters nearer to an equality. In short, according to this account, they resembled the court and country parties amongst the people of this island. Cicero says that the optimates were the best citizens, who wished to deserve the approbation of the better sort; and that the populares courted the favour of the populace, not so much considering what was right, as what would please the people and gratify their own thirst of vain-glory and applause.
