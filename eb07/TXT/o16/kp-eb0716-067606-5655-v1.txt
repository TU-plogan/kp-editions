OUGHTRED, William, an eminent mathematician, was born at Eton in 1573, and educated in the school there, whence he was elected to King’s College, Cambridge, of which he afterwards became fellow. Being admitted to holy orders, he left the university about the year 1603, and was presented to the rectory of Aldbury, near Guildford in Surrey; and about the year 1628 he was appointed by the Earl of Arundel to instruct his son in the mathematics. He kept a correspondence by letters with some of the most eminent scholars of his time on mathematical subjects; and the most celebrated mathematicians of the age owed most of their skill to him, his house being full of young gentlemen who came from all parts to receive his instruction. It is said that, upon hearing the news of the vote at Westminster for the restoration of Charles II. he expired in a sudden transport of joy, at the age of eighty-eight. He wrote, 1. Clavis Mathematical which was afterwards published in England; 2. A Description of the Double Horizontal Dial; 3. Opuscula Mathematica ; and several other works.
