ORELLANA, Francisco, the first European, as is commonly thought, who discovered the river Amazons. In 1539, he embarked, near Quito, upon the river Coca, which farther down takes the name of Napo. From this he fell in with another large river; and, leaving himself entirely to the direction of the current, he arrived at Cape North, on the coast of Guiana, after sailing nearly eighteen hundred leagues. Orellana perished ten years afterwards, with three vessels which had been intrusted to him in Spain, without being able to discover the mouth of this river. In sailing down the river, he met with some armed women, against whom an Indian cacique had told him to be on his guard; and he thence named it “the river of the Amazons.”
