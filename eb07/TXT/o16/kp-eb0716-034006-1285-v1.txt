ONEIROCRITICS, a title given to the interpreters of dreams, or those who judged of events from the circumstances of dreams. No great regard is to be paid to those Greek books called oneirocritics ; nor do we know why the patriarch of Constantinople, and others,shouldhave amused themselves with writing on so pitiful a subject. Rigault has given us a collection of the Greek and Latin works of this kind; one attributed to Astrampsichus, and another to Nicephorus, patriarch of Constantinople; and to these are added the treatises of Artemidorus and Achmet. But the books themselves are little else than reveries; a kind of waking dreams, to explain and account for sleeping ones. According to them, all the secrets of oneirocriticism consists in the relation supposed to exist between the dream and the thing signified; but they are far from keeping to the relations of agreement and similitude, and frequently have recourse to others of dissimilitude and contrariety. Concerning oneirocritics and oneirocritica, the unlearned reader will find much information in Warburton’s Divine Legation of Moses, and in the works to which he refers.
