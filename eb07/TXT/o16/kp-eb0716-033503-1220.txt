OLONEZ, a government or stadtholderate of Russia, so called from the city of the same name, and also the river which empties itself into the Lake of Ladoga. It extends in north latitude from 60. 29. to 66. 30., and in east longitude from 29.45. to 4L 37., and has a superficies of 83,314 square miles. It is very thinly peopled, containing not more than 350,000 inhabitants. The southern part of the province is level, and abounds in lakes and morasses, including in the former the large Lake of Ladoga. In the northern part a portion of the Scandinavian range of mountains enters from Sweden and Norway. The soil is generally sterile, and the climate ungenial; but the former produces some rye, barley, and oats, though the harvests rarely afford four times the quantity of seed that is sown. The most important products, besides grain, are derived from the forests, which are extensive, and, besides fuel, supply timber for building, as well as tar and pitch. There are some few mines of iron worked, and the quarries yield marble and other kinds of stone, enormous blocks of which are conveyed to St Petersburg for building. The province is divided into eight circles, which contain eight cities and 227 parishes.
