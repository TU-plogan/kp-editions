OVAL, an oblong curvilinear figure, otherwise called ellipse. The proper oval, or egg shape, however, differs considerably from that of the ellipse, being an irregular figure, narrower at one end than at another; whereas the ellipse or mathematical oval is equally broad at each end. But it must be owned that these two are commonly confounded, even geometricians calling the oval a false ellipse.
