OARISTUS, or Oaristys, a term in Greek poetry, signifying a dialogue between a husband and his wife; as that in the sixth book of the Iliad, between Hector and Andromache. Scaliger observes, that the oaristus is not properly any particular little poem, or entire piece of poetry, but always a part of a great one; and that the passage in Homer here referred to is the only proper oaristus extant in ancient poetry.
