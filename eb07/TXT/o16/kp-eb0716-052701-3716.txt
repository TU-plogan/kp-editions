OREL, or Orlow, a government of Russia in Europe. It is situated in north latitude between 51. 49. and 54. 59. and in east longitude between 32. 49. and 38. 57., and extends over 16,610 square miles. It is divided into twelve circles, and contains 1,270,000 inhabitants. It is rather a level district, having no mountains, and only some ranges of chalk hills, between which are valleys and some woods, that render the face of the country more pleasing to view than most other parts of Russia. The rivers and rivulets are numerous, and empty themselves, some into the Wolga, and others into the Dnieper. The chief of the streams is the Desna, which arises in the province of Smolensko; and the next is the Oka, which originates in Kursk, and runs through the whole province. The soil is the most fruitful of any of the ancient divisions of Russia, and, though not well cultivated, yields crops of all the common grains, more than is required for domestic consumption. The surplus of corn, as well as spirits distilled from it, forms a branch of the export trade; but it is exceeded by the manufactured goods, which consist of linen, iron, and steel articles, raw hides and leather, tallow and soap, glass wares, hemp, flax, linseed oil, mats, butter, hams, and wool. The only mines are those of iron; but there are quarries of alabaster, and some yielding excellent millstones. Orel, the capital of the government, as well as of the circle in which it stands, is a city situated on the banks of the river Oka, at the spot where the Orlik joins that stream, and becomes navigable for barges. It is the seat of a bishop, and is surrounded by palisades, and protected by a citadel. It is a gloomy city, built chiefly of wood, and contains 2871 houses, with about 20,000 inhabitants, depending on the trade, which, from the whole province, centres in it. It is 732 miles from St Petersburg. Long. 35. 52. 2. E. Lat. 52. 56. 40. N.
