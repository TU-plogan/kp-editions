+====================================================================+


OWEN, Dr John, an eminent and learned dissenting minister, was born in 1616, at Hadham, in Oxfordshire, of which place his father was vicar. He made such surprising proficiency in learning, that at twelve years of age he was admitted into Queen’s College, Oxford; and in 1635 he was made master of arts. Having disapproved of the new regulations introduced by Archbishop Laud, the chancellor, he refused to comply with them, and in 1637 was obliged to leave the university. When he took orders he became chaplain to Sir Robert Dormer of Ascot, in Oxfordshire, and was at the same time tutor to his eldest son. He was afterwards chaplain to John Lord Lovelace of Hurley, in Berkshire. When the civil war broke out, he openly espoused the cause of the parliament; which was so resented by an uncle who had intended to leave him his estate, that he discarded him, and left it to another. Yet though Lord Lovelace joined the king, he treated his chaplain with great civility; but on his taking the field with the royal army, Mr Owen went to London, and soon afterwards joined the nonconformists. In the year 1642 he published his book entitled a Display of Arminianism, which laid the foundation of his future advancement. The committee for purging the church of scandalous ministers were so pleased with this work, that Mr White, their chairman, sent him a presentation to the living of Fordham in Essex; but after he had been there about a year and a half, the patron, hearing that the sequestered incumbent was dead, presented another to the living, upon which the Earl of Warwick gave Mr Owen the living of Coggeshal. He had not, however, been long at that town before he left the Presbyterians, and, joining the Independents, formed a church there. He was sent for several times to preach before the parliament, particularly on the 28th of February 1648-49, the day' of humiliation for the intended expedition to Ireland. Cromwell, who was present at this last discourse, and had never heard him before, was so extremely pleased with it that he desired the preacher to accompany him into Ireland, at the same time offering to provide him with a residence in the College of Dublin. Mr Owen accepted the offer, but returned in about half a year. Soon afterwards Cromwell sent him into Scotland, [7:16:682]but he also returned from thence after about half a year’s residence at Edinburgh. He was then promoted to the deanery of Christ-Church, Oxford, whither he went in 1651; and Cromwell, being now chancellor of the university, nominated him his vice-chancellor. The next year he was created doctor of divinity by diploma. Dr Owen held the post of vice-chancellor five years, during which he behaved with the greatest moderation; for, although often solicited, he never molested the meeting of the royalists at the house of Dr Willis the physician, where divine service was performed according to the liturgy of the Church of England; and though he was a commissioner for ejecting scandalous ministers, he frequently overruled his brethren in favour of those royalists who were distinguished by their merit. At the death of Cromwell he was removed from the vice-chancellorship; and at the Restoration he was ejected from his deanery of Christ-Church. But he had provided himself a comfortable retreat at an estate he had purchased at Hadham. He now employed himself in preaching as often as he had an opportunity, and in writing books; one of which, entitled Fiat Lux, falling into the hands of Lord Clarendon, he was so pleased with it, or from policy pretended to be so, that he sent for Dr Owen, and acknowledging the service he had done by it to the Protestant religion, offered to prefer him in the church if he would conform; but he respectfully desired to be excused. His moderation secured him respect from persons of opposite principles; and in the number of his friends were Dr Wilkins, bishop of Chester, and Dr Barlow, bishop of London. He died at Ealing in 1683. His works are printed in seven volumes folio.
