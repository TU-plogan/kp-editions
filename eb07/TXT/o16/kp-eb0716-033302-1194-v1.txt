OLDHAM, one of those towns which, within the present generation, have grown up with rapidity since the establishment of the cotton manufacture. It is situated in the hundred of Salford, in the county of Lancaster, eight miles from Manchester, and 186 from London. It stands on the river Medlock, very near the source of that and of another stream called the Irk, in a district abounding in coal. Oldham had been created into a market-town; and was by the reform act constituted a borough, with the power of returning two members to the House of Commons. It is parochially united with Prestwick, and these places comprehend ten townships, extending over 21,160 acres, with a population, in 1831, of 67,579 persons. The whole is a [7:16:334] manufacturing district, making fustians and spinning cotton yarn, and also haying a great trade in making hats. The town of Oldham is, for the most part, of very recent erection, containing many large piles of buildings destined for manufacturing purposes, and a proportional number of small dwellings for the workmen; but all are discoloured by the smoke which issues from numerous steam-engines, few of the proprietors of which reside within the town. It has a fine large parish church, and, as is usual with such a population, a very great variety of places of worship for the several discordant and dissenting sects. At the first election for this borough, it was distinguished by its selection of Mr Cobbett as one of its representatives. The population of the township of Oldham amounted in the vear 1801 to 12,024, in 1811 to 16,690, in 1821 to 21,662,"and in 1831 to 32,381.

Oldham, John, an eminent English poet of the seventeenth century, was educated under his father, a nonconformist minister, and then sent to Edmund Hall in Oxford. He afterwards became usher to the free school at Croydon in Surrey, where he received a visit from the Earls of Rochester and Dorset, Sir Charles Sedley, and other persons of distinction, merely on account of some verses of his which they had seen in manuscript. He was successively tutor to the sons of several gentlemen; and having saved a small sum of money, he came to London, where, being an agreeable companion, he became a perfect votary to the bottle. He was quickly found out by the noblemen who had visited him at Croydon, and who made him acquainted with Dryden, He lived mostly with the Earl of Kingston, at Holme Pierr-point. in Nottinghamshire, where he died of the smallpox in 1683, in the thirtieth year of his age. His acquaintance with learned authors appears, by his satires against the Jesuits, to have been considerable; and Dryden esteemed him highly. His works, which are printed in two vols. 12mo, consist chiefly of satires, odes, translations, paraphrases of Horace and other authors, elegiac verses, imitations, parodies, and familiar epistles.
