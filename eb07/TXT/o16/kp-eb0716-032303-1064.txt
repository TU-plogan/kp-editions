ODIN, in Mythology, called also, in the dialect of the Anglo-Saxons, Woden or Wodan, a name given by the ancient Scythians to their supreme god, and assumed, about seventy years before the Christian era, by Sigge, a Scythian prince, who conquered the northern nations, made great changes in their government, manners, religion, and had even divine honours paid him. According to the account given of this conqueror by Snorro, the ancient historian of Norway, and his commentator Torfaeus, Odin was [7:16:324]a Scythian, who withdrew himselfby flight, alongwith many others in his train, from the vengeance of the Romans, under the conduct of Pompey; and having officiated as a priest in his own country, he assumed the direction of the religious worship as well as the civil government of the nations which he had conquered. Having subdued Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, he retired to Sweden, where he died. There is nothing certain in this account; but it is probable that the god whose prophet or priest this Scythian pretended to be, was named Odin, and that the ignorance of succeeding ages confounded the deity with his priest, composing out of the attributes of the one and the history of the other the character of the northern conqueror. He deluded the people by his enchantments and his skill in magic. Having cut off the head of one Mimer, who in his lifetime enjoyed great reputation for wisdom, he caused it to be embalmed, and persuaded the Scandinavians that he had restored it to the use of speech, and caused it to pronounce whatever oracles he wanted. The Icelandic chronicles or sagas represent Odin as the most eloquent and persuasive of men; they ascribe to him the introduction of the art of poetry amongst the Scandinavians, and likewise the invention of the Runic characters. He had also the address to persuade his followers that he could run over the world in the twinkling of an eye; that he had the direction of the air and the tempests; that he could transform himself into all sorts of shapes, raise the dead, foretell things to come, deprive his enemies by enchantment of health and vigour, and discover all the treasures which were concealed in the earth. They add, that by his tender and melodious airs he could make the plains and mountains open and expand with delight; and that the ghosts, thus attracted, would leave their infernal caverns, and stand motionless about him. Nor was he less dreadful and furious in battle; changing himself into the shape of a bear, a wild bull, or a lion, and amidst ranks of enemies committing the most horrid devastation, without receiving any wound in return.
