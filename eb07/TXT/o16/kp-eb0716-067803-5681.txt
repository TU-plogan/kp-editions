OUTCHANG-FOU, a city of China, of the first rank, situated on the great river Yang-tse-kiang, at its junction with the Han. It is the capital of the province of Houquang, and when joined to Hang-yang-fou, situated on the opposite side of the river, and forming properly one with it, it ranks with the largest cities in China, or in the world. From its position at the junction of the great river Yang-tse-kiang with the Han, it enjoys an easy commercial intercourse with almost every port of China. Though nearly 500 miles from the sea, the river is deep enough to float the largest vessels; and, for some miles in the vicinity of the city, it is entirely covered with barks, amounting to 8000 or 10,000, many of which form the only habitation of numerous Chinese families. This interminable prospect and forest of masts presents one of the most striking scenes in the world. The surrounding country is noted for the excellence of the tea which it produces; and the bamboo paper manufactured here is very highly celebrated all over China.
