ORIBASUS, a celebrated physician, greatly esteemed by the Emperor Julian, in whose reign he flourished. At the request of the emperor, he abridged the works of Galen, and of all the most respectable writers on physic; and he accompanied Julian into the East, but his skill proved ineffectual in the attempt to cure the fatal wound which his benefactor had received. After Julianâ€™s death he fell into the hands of the barbarians.
