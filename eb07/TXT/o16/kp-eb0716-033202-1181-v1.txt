OISE, a department of the north of France, formed out of the ancient Isle of France, and the districts of Beauvaisis and Valois. It extends in north latitude from 49. 7. to 49. 38. and in east longitude from 1. 28. to 3. 4. It is bounded on the north by the Somme, on the east by the Aisne, on the south by the Seine and Marne and the Seine and Oise, and on the west by the Eure; and it is divided into four arrondissements, which are subdivided into thirty-five cantons and 738 communes. It extends over 2428 square miles, and, according to the census of 1836, contains 398,641 inhabitants, and elects three deputies to the national representative body. The face of the country is plain or undulating, with a chain of calcareous hills of moderate height, of which Mount Caesar on the eastern part is the highest. The soil is various, being in some parts clayey and in others sandy with marl, and generally a calcareous subsoil, except in the marshy portions near the streams. The Oise runs through it till it falls into the Seine, and it is navigable for barges. The Aisne, another navigable river, passes through a part of this department before it joins the Oise. There are a great number of smaller streams, some with and some without a name, all of which reach the sea ultimately through the Seine. The climate is dry and healthy, except in the marshy parts and near the woods, which cover about one seventh part of the whole surface. The agriculture is tolerably conducted; but the paucity of manure causes a great part of the land to be left fallow; yet it yields more corn than is required for the consumption, and in average years can spare one fourth of its growth for the supply of the surrounding departments. Besides corn, it yields a vast quantity of fruit, especially cherries, which can be conveyed by the rivers to Paris and other large cities. A great quantity of apples is converted into cider. The vines in general produce only a weak wine, not capable of being long preserved, except some of Ancerville and of Villars-Saint-Sepulcre, which are preferred to all the others of Picardy. The breeding of horses is carefully attended to, and some excellent ones are reared. The stock of oxen and sheep is low for the extent of country; but the races of the latter have been recently improved by the crossings with Merinos, and some fine wool is now iurnished to the manufacturers. There are fabrics of linen, woollen, and cotton goods in several places; a considerable quantity of thread lace is made by the females; and there are also many tanneries and potteries. There is a considerable transit trade on the rivers, and they, as well as the rivulets, afford much fish.
