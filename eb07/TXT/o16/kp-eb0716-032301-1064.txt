ODEUM, in Grecian antiquity, a theatre for music built by Pericles, the inside of which was filled with seats and ranges of pillars, and on the outside the roof descended shelving downwards from a point in the centre, with many bendings, in imitation of the king of Persiaâ€™s pavilion. Here the musical prizes were contended for; and here, also, according to Aristophanes, there was a tribunal.
