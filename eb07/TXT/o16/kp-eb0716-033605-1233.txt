OMAR Ebn al Khattab, the successor of Abu-Bekr. We are informed that Omar was miraculously converted to the Mahommedan faith. Before this event he is said to have been truly respectable, and in particular a violent opposer of the Arabian prophet. Mahommed, it seems, felt this opposition, and regretted it; he, therefore, with all the fervour, and, as it happened, with all the success of [7:16:337]a true prophet, as his followers pretend, prayed for the conversion of his dangerous antagonist. Omar is said to have no sooner read the twentieth chapter of the Koran than he was convinced; upon which he instantly repaired to Mahommed and his followers, and declared his conversion. On the death of Abu-Bekr, who had succeeded the impostor himself, he was promoted to the regal and pontifical dignity. The title first assigned him was the “caliph of the caliph of the apostle of God or in other words, “the successor of the successor of Mohammed but the Arabs, considering that this title, by the addition to be annexed to it at the accession of every future caliph, would be too long, they, by universal consent, saluted him “the emperor of the believers ;” which illustrious title, conferred at this juncture upon Omar, descended afterwards to all the successors of that prince. He was assassinated by a Persian slave, who stabbed him in the mosque at Medina. This event took place in the twenty-third year of the Hegira, which began in the year of Christ 643. His extensive conquests rendered the Moslem empire one of the most powerful and formidable monarchies in the world.
