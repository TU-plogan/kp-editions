ORMSKIRK, a market-town of the hundred of West Derby, in the county of Lancaster, twelve miles from Liverpool, and 210 from London. The parish is very extensive, comprehending six townships and one chapelry. The town is well built, consisting of four streets crossing each other at right angles. Its church is a handsome Gothic structure, and is remarkable for having the tower and the steeple detached from each other, so as to appear like two churches. There is a good market on Thursday, and considerable trade at all times, arising from the navigable canals, to which there is easy access. The population of Ormskirk township amounted in 1801 to 2554, in 1811 to 3064, in 1821 to 3838, and in 1831 to 4251.
