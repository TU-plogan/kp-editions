OCTAVIA, the daughter of Cains Octavius, and sister of Augustus Caesar. She was one of the most illustrious ladies of ancient Rome, being equally conspicuous for virtue and beauty. The death of Marcellus, her son by her first husband Claudius Marcellus, constantly preyed upon her mind, and shedied of grief or melancholy, about eleven years before the Christian era. Her brother paid great honours to her memory, and pronounced her funeral oration. The Roman people also showed their respect for her virtues, by wishing to pay her divine honours.
