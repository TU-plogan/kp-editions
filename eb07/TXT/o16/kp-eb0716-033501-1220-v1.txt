OLMUTZ, a city of the Austrian province of Moravia, the capital of a circle of the same name, which extends over 2090 square miles, and comprehends twenty-seven cities, twenty market-towns, and 795 villages, with 410,000 inhabitants. It is for the most part a mountainous country, and the principal rivers of the province have their sources in it. The southern part is the least hilly, and is a very fertile and well-cultivated district. The city, which stands on the river March, is fortified, and defended by a citadel, in which Lafayette was long a prisoner. It is a well-built place, being the see of an archbishop, and the seat of the administration of the province; and it has a lyceum, with a good library, twenty-six professors, and about 800 students, who are admitted to graduate in the four faculties of law, philosophy, medicine, and theology. It contains 680 houses, and, besides the military, about 12,000 inhabitants. It has little trade, and none but small manufactories. Long. 14. 4.45. E. Lat. 49. 32. 43. N.
