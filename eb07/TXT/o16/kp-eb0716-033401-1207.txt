OLDMIXON, John, a violent party-writer and ill-natured critic, who would scarcely have been remembered, if Pope, in resentment of his abuse, had not condemned him to immortality in the Dunciad. His party-writings procured him a place in the revenue at Liverpool, where he died at an advanced age, in the year 1745. Besides his fugitive pieces, he wrote a History of the Stuarts, in folio; a Critical History of England, in two vols. Svo; a volume of Poems; and some dramatic pieces.
