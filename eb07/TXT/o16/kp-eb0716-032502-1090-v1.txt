OEREBRO, one of the provinces of the kingdom of Sweden, being the westernmost part of Westmanland. It extends in north latitude from 58. 40. to 60. 6. and in east longitude from 14. 6. to 15. 42., and contains a superficies of 3784 square miles. It is divided into four districts or bailiwicks, viz. Osterwick, Westrericke, Nora cum Linne, and Leke cum Carlscrona, and contains 110,000 inhabitants. It is surrounded with mountains, but none of them higher than 2000 feet, and the interior is flat or undulating. It is an internal province, but connected with Stockholm by means of the river Heilmaren. It contains a great number of fresh-water lakes. The climate is raw and cold, but in the short summer vegetation is surprisingly rapid. The best agriculture is in the southern part, but there the seed rarely produces more than four-fold. The chief grains are rye, oats, and barley; and of late potatoes and turnips have been introduced. The chief production is timber, and the cutting and preparing of it for market is the principal occupation. There are some mines of iron and of copper worked. The capital is the city of the same name, situated at the entrance of the river Svartelf into the Heilmaren. It is chiefly built of wood, has a good market, a church, and an hospital, and contains 750 dwellings, with 3240 inhabitants, a few of whom are employed in making cloths, hosiery, and ironmongery articles. Long. 15. 4. 5. E. Lat. 59. Ì5. 14. N.
