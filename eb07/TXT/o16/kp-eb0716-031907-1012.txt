OCANA, a town of Spain, in the province of Toledo, the capital of a partida of the same name, about'thirty miles to the south-east of Madrid. It stands on a fertile plain, and is surrounded with an ancient and now a dilapidated wall, the buildings bearing more marks of antiquity than of beauty. It has four churches and eleven religious houses, and is adorned with two fountains, one of them of great beauty. The actual population does not much exceed 5000 persons, and the only occupations, besides that of cultivating the surrounding land, consist in making soap, tanning leather, and making a few silk goods. This place has been rendered remarkable by the great battle fought there in November 1809, when the Spanish army of 50,000 was defeated and dispersed by a French force of considerably less than half that number.
