OKEHAM, or Okham, a market-town, the capital of the county of Rutland, and situated in a rich valley called the vale of Cadmus. It is ninety-five miles from London, and has a good market on Saturday. It has an ancient castle, now converted into an assize-hall and a county jail. The parish church, dedicated to All-Saints, is a fine old structure, with a lofty spire, which is visible a great way around it. It has no corporation; but whatever power of a municipal nature is exercised is derived from the Earl of Wmchelsea or the Dean of westminster, who are lords of the two manors into which the town is divided. Near to it is Burleigh-on-the-Hill, a noble mansion of the Earl of Winchelsea. The population amounted in 1801 to 1613, in 1811 to 1719, in 1821 to 2160, and in 1831 to 2440.
