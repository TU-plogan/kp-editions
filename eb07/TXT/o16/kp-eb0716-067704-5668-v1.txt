OUROOMIA, or Ooromia, the chief town of a district or government of the same name, in Persia, situated on a large lake, also of the same name, in the province of Azerbijan. It is an ancient city, which, according to Sir Robert K. Porter, once bore the name of Thebarma; and is mentioned as a place of some consequence by Strabo. It is surrounded with walls and towers, which are at present in a very ruinous state, though, with a shallow ditch, they constitute its only means of defence. It is, however, beautifully situated amidst the most extensive and luxuriant gardens, producing almost every European and Asiatic fruit in the greatest plenty and perfection. The town contains, according to Frazer, about 20,000 inhabitants, who are of disorderly habits, being mostly the immediate retainers of chiefs who, having their property in the neighbourhood, reside in large palaces within the town. The latter have constant feuds with each other, in which their retainers take part; and the governor, who is a chief of the Affshar tribe, being quite unable to restrain them, more murders are committed in the town of Ouroomia than in any other city of Persia. It is sixty miles west of Tabreez. Long. 46. 12. E. Lat. 37 58. N.

Ol t roomia, Lake, a noble expanse of water, about 100 miles in length, stretching nearly north and south, and about forty miles in breadth. It is surrounded by picturesque mountains, and valleys which are fertile and well filled with villages. It lies to the south-east of Koiy, at no great distance from the city; and is generally considered as the Spauto and Marcianus of Strabo and Ptolemy. Its waters, like those ofthe%ea, appear of a dark blue colour, streaked with green, according as the light falls on them; they are perfectly clear, and intensely salt. According to an experiment by the late Mr Brown, they were found to contain one third more salt than the sea. A great quantity of salt is also deposited on the shores, and on the bottom, which is seen fora considerable distance, from the clearness of the water. In some places there is an incrustation of salt towards the margin, from under which, when broken, thick concentrated brine rushes out; and the deposition of salt and saline efflorescence extends in some places many hundred yards from the water’s edge, encircling it with a belt of glittering white. No fish or living thing, says Frazer, as far as is known, has been found in this fine lake. Within the last twelve or fourteen years, the same traveller was informed that the watershad gone back, and left the shore dry, in some places, to a distance of full 500 yards. From the village of Sheraff-Khaneh, built upon a bank once overhanging the water, it has retired, leaving a mud beach, covered with salt or saline efflorescence, of many hundred yards in breadth. A finer subject for inland navigation than this lake and its tributary streams can scarcely be conceived. The country fromTa-breez to its bank is level, and the river Adjai, which passes the town, could easily be converted into a canal, or made to feed one; and by this channel the valuable produce of all the districts around the lake ofOuroomia might be brought to the capital at a trifling expense. But the spirit of enterprise in Persia is broken under the influence of a despotic andunstable government; and hence it is in vain to expect that capital will ever be employed in any useful improvement. So little disposition is there to take advantage of thislake for inland navigation, that thereis not a single boat upon it. There were formerly two; but one was wrecked, with the loss of eight men, and the other was allowed to rot. The district or government of Ouroomia contains, according to Frazer, 400, and to Sir Robert K. Porter, 700 villages. It has been ruled by the present governor and his family for 200 years. Its revenue amounted for twenty-five years to 7000 tomaums, or about L. 15,000 annually. But since the rivalry of certain noblemen with each other for the government, it has been increased to L.100,000, which is wrung from the poor peasantry by the most cruel extortion.
