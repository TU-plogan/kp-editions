OELAND, or Oland, an island in the Baltic Sea, apart of the province of Calmar, in Sweden. It is about seventy miles in length from north to south, and about seven miles in breadth from east to west. The western side is flat, and the eastern rather hilly; but the centre is a level consisting of tolerably good soil, which yields barley, rye, and oats, and, from the mildness of the climate, brings the harvest two weeks earlier than on the opposite continent. It has some good pastures, which furnish dairies; and a considerable fishery is carried on upon the coast. It contains no market-town, but has eight parishes, and 24,000 inhabitants.
