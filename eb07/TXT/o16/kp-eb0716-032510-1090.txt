OGIVE, in Architecture, an arch or branch of a Gothic vault, which, instead of being circular, passes diagonally from one angle to another, and forms a cross with the other arches. The middle, where the ogives cross each other, is called the key, being cut in the form of a rose, or a cal de lampe. The members or mouldings of the ogives are called nerves, branches, or reins ; and the arches which separate the ogives, double arches.
