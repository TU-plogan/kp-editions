ONORE, formerly a seaport of Hindustan, and a place of great commerce, in the province of North Canara. It is situated at the mouth of a river which communicates with a fine salt-water lake, extending nearly as far to the I east as the foot of the mountains. In 1763 it was occu-; aied by Hyder Ali, who established dock-yards for building ships of war, which were found to have been demolished by Tippoo at the time the town was recovered by the treaty of Mangalore. Part of the town has been rebuilt, and there is now a custom-house here. A trade is carried on in rice, betel-nut, pepper, cocoa-nuts, and salt fish. This trade was carried on in boats, which were much harassed by pirates from the Mahratta coast; an evil that has always existed more or less on the shores of India, but has now nearly ceased, owing to the vigilance of the British marine. No manufactures ever existed to any extent, the trade having been destroyed by Tippoo. On the first arrival of the Portuguese in India, Onore was the capital of an independent rajah, who was subdued by them. It was subsequently taken from the Portuguese by the Dutch, who appear to have relinquished it; for, in 1763, when it came into the possession of Hyder Ali, it was considered as the property of the ranee of Bednore. In 1768 it was taken by the British, and was shortly afterwards regained by Hyder. It was taken in 1783 by General Matthews, and was restored to Tippoo at the conclusion of the year. It came under the dominion of the British, with the province of Canara, when Tippooâ€™s empire was overthrown, in 1799. Long. 74. 25. E. Lat. 14. 18. N.
