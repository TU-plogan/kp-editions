OSTEND, a city of Belgium, in the province of West Flanders, and circle of Bruges. It stands on the sea-shore, with a good harbour, and two basins. The entrance to the harbour is narrow, and only passable at high water; and at low water the vessels within are aground. The mouth of the haven is defended by two forts, and the town is surrounded with walls, and protected by two fortresses or citadels, being thus capable of defence against attacks either from the sea or from the land. It is well built; the streets are broad, and the houses good. It is connected by canals with Bruges and Nieuport, which are [7:16:667] continued from the latter place to Dunkirk. It contains 10,550 inhabitants, many of whom depend on the sea and the internal navigation, and particularly on the fishery. It has considerable occupation in building ships, and in making sail-cloth and linen goods, besides cables and small cordage. It has also salt-refineries and saw-mills. But it is deficient in good water, which is conveyed from a distance of more than a mile. The siege of this place in the war between the Netherlands and Spain is one of the most memorable that history has recorded. It began in 1601, and ended in 1604, when it was surrendered to the Spaniards, who had lost before it 100,000 men. Long. 2. 28.48. E. Lat. 51. 13. 37. N.
