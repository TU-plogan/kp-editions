ORURO, the name of a department, and also of a province, of the republic of Bolivia, in South America. The department so called contains the three provinces of Paria, Oruro, and Caraugas. The whole district forms part of a very high table-land, perfectly level, and elevated more than 12,000 feet above the level of the sea. The province is bounded on the cast by Cochabamba and Charcas; on the west by part of the great chain of the Andes, which separates it from Arequipa; on the north by La Paz; and on the south by Paria. That part of the Bolivian Andes in which Oruro is situated forms one of those metalliferous groups which are so common along the whole mountain chain. The silver mines here were formerly very rich and productive, but they are now nearly useless, being filled with water, which, in a country where machinery is little in use, proves an almost insurmountable barrier to mining operations. The city of Oruro stands in longitude 68.17. W. and latitude 17. 58. S., at an elevation of 12,441 feet above the level of the sea. The climate, although cold, is by no means unhealthy; but, from the rarity of the atmosphere, some difficulty of breathing is at first experienced by those who are not accustomed to respire at such altitudes, and the alternations of heat and cold during a single day are exceedingly disagreeable to all. The city and province of Oruro were formerly populous, but since the unfortunate struggle for Peruvian independence under Tupac Amaru, which was put an end to in the year 1782, the aboriginal population in particular has very considerably declined. The province contains about 15,000, and the city between 4000 and 5000 inhabitants.
