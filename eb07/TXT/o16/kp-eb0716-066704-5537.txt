OSTERVALD, John Frederic, a celebrated Protestant divine, was born at Neufchatel in 1663. He made such rapid progress in his studies that he became master of arts at Samur before he was sixteen years of age; and he afterwards studied at Orleans and at Paris. On his return to Neufchatel in 1699 he became pastor of the church there, and contracted a strict friendship with John Alphonsus Turretin of Geneva, and Samuel Werenfels of Basil; and the union of these three divines, which was called the Triumvirate of the Divines of Swisserland, lasted till his death. Ostervald acquired the highest reputation by his virtues, and his zeal in instructing his disciples; and he restored ecclesiastical discipline. He wrote many books in French, the principal of which are, 1. a Treatise concerning the Sources of Corruption; 2. a Catechism, or Instruction in the Christian Religion, translated into German, Dutch, and English, with an Abridgment of Sacred History prefixed to it; 3. a Treatise against Impurity; 4. an edition of the French Bible of Geneva, with Arguments and Reflections, folio; 5. Ethica Christiana; and, 6. Theologiae Compendium. Ostervald died in the year 1747, regretted by all who knew him.
