OSTIA, a town on the eastern coast of Italy, in the territory of the Roman see. It stands near that mouth of the river Tiber called Bocca del Fiumecino, in a marshy and unhealthy spot. It is the seat of a bishop, whose diocese is united* with that of Velletria, and contains a large and fine cathedral. It is not on the spot where stood the Ostium of the ancients and the principal maritime establishment of Rome, which was stated to have been three or four miles in circuit, but somewhat farther from the seashore. The remains of the ancient city are still visible in the ruins of aqueducts, temples, and other edifices, which must have been built by a rich and luxurious population. The chief occupation of the few inhabitants consists in collecting salt made by the heat of the sun alone, and with which the greater portion of the papal dominions is supplied. Long. 12. 10. 30. E. Lat. 41. 45. 38. N.
