ORTHOGRAPHY, that part of grammar which teaches the nature and affections of letters, and the just method of spelling or writing words, with all the proper and necessary letters. It forms one of the four great divisions or branches of grammar.

Orthography, in Geometry, the art of drawing or delineating the fore-right plan of any object, and of expressing[7:16:653] the heights or elevations of each part. It is called orthography, from its determining things by perpendicular lines falling on the geometrical plane.

Orthography, in Architecture, is the elevation of a building or edifice.

Orthography, in Perspective, is the fore-right side of any plane, that is, the side or plane which lies parallel to a straight line, that may be imagined to pass through the outward convex points of the eyes, continued to a convenient length.
