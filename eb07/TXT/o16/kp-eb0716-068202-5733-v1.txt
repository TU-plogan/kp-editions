OWLAH, a city of Hindustan, in the province of Delhi and district of Bareilly. It is pleasantly situated on the western bank of the Harowly River, and, with the adjoining district, came into the possession of the British in 1802. It is an ancient town, and was fixed upon in the early part of the last century by Aly Mohammed, one of the Rohilla chiefs, as the capital of his territories. On his death Owlah fell to the share of Futteh Khan, superintendent of the household, and after the death of the latter his son Ahmed Khan resided there. It was also the residence of many of the chiefs and their families, which conduced greatly to its grandeur and extent. But on the cruel extermination of the Rohilla nation by Snjah ud Dowlah, aided by the British, in 1774, it was forsaken by its principal inhabitants; and it has now fallen into decay and ruin. It is about sixteen miles north-west from the town of Bareilly. Long. 79. 35. E. Lat. 28. 10. N.
