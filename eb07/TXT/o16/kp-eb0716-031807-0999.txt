OBIT signifies a funeral solemnity, or office for the dead, most commonly performed when the corpse lies in the church uninterred; and also the anniversary office. The anniversary of any personâ€™s death was called the obit; and to observe such day with prayers and alms, or other commemoration, was the keeping of the obit. In religious houses they had a register, in which they entered the obits or obitual days of their founders and benefactors, and which was thence termed the obituary. The tenure of obit or chantry lands was taken away and extinguished by 1 Edw. VI. c. 14, and 15 Car. II. c. 9.
