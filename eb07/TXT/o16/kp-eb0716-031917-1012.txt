OCHRIDA, a town of Greece, in the province of Albania, the capital of a district of the same name, which it has derived from a lake near it, known to the ancients as the Lychnidus. It is situated on the declivity of Mount Maniana Petrin, on the great road formerly leading from Pella to Dyracchium; and near to it runs the river Drino. The inhabitants are descended from a Bulgarian colony, and they adhere to the Greek church, of which religion there is an archbishop in this place. In the vicinity there are mines of sulphur and of silver, the working of which forms the chief occupation of the population, which amounts, to about 4500 persons.
