OMPHALE, in fabulous history, a queen of Lydia, the daughter of Jardanus. She married Tmolus, who at his death left her mistress of his kingdom. Omphale having been informed of the great exploits of Hercules, wished to see so illustrious a hero; and her wish was soon gratified. After the murder of Eurytus, Hercules fell sick, and was ordered to be sold as a slave, that he might recover his health and the right use of his senses. Mercury was commissioned to sell him, but Omphale bought him, and restored him to liberty. The hero became enamoured of his mistress, and the queen having favoured his passion, had a son by him, whom some call Agelaus, and others Lamon. From the son in question were descended Gyges and Croesus; but this opinion is different from the account which represents these'Lydian monarchs as having sprung from Alcaeus, a son of Hercules by one of the female servants of Omphale. Hercules is represented by the poets as so desperately enamoured of the queen, that, to conciliate her esteem, he span by her side amongst her women, whilst she covered herself with the lionâ€™s skin, seized the club of the hero, and often struck him with her sandals for the uncouth manner in which he held the distaff.
