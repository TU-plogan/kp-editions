ONOSANDER, a Greek author and Platonic philosopher, who wrote Commentaries on Plato’s Politics, which are now lost. But his name is particularly famous for a treatise entitled Aογος 2τgατηγικος, a discourse on the duties and qualities of the general of an army, which has been translated into Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. The time when he lived is not precisely known, but he is imagined to have been contemporary with the Emperor Claudius.
