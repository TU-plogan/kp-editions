ORRERY, a curious machine for representing the motions or phases of the heavenly bodies. The ïcason of its being called an Orrery was this: Mr Rowley, a mathematical-instrument maker, having got one from Mr George Graham, the original inventor, to be sent abroad with some of his own instruments, he copied it, and made the first for the Earl of Orrery. Sir Richard Steele, who knew nothing of Mr Graham’s machines, thinking to do justice to the first encourager, as well as to the inventor of such a curious instrument, called it an Orrery, and gave Mr Rowley the praise which was due only to Mr Graham.
