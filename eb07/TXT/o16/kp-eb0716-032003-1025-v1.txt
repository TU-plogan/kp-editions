OCKZAKOFF, or Oczakow, a city, once of great importance and much historical interest, in European Russia, belonging to the government of Cherson. It stood on the Black Sea, and, from its commanding the navigation of the rivers Bug and Dnieper, it was strongly fortified by the Turks, and considered as an important barrier against the advancing progress of the Russians in that portion of their territory. The citadel connected with the town was of prodigious strength, and surrounded with a wall twenty-five feet in height. It was, however, unable to resist the military force with which the Russians attacked it in 1737. The siege was obstinate, but at length it was taken by assault, after a bloody contest, in which the victorious Russians lost more than 18,000 men. In the following year, the Turks, eager to retake the place, advanced with an army of 70,000 men; but they were repulsed with the loss of more than 20,000 of their number. Having accomplished and secured the conquest, the Russians razed the fortifications, and abandoned the spot. The Turks in 1743 constructed once more the works of defence, and maintained a powerful garrison within it till the year 1788, when the Russians again attacked it. The latter, commanded by Suwaroff, besieged it for a long time, and ultimately carried it by storm, with a tremendous loss of life to both armies. By the peace of 1791, the whole district was ceded to Russia, upon which the fortifications were demolished. The establishment of Odessa within thirty miles of Ockzakoff has reduced the place to insignificance; though, from its position on the two navigable rivers, it is favourably situated for commerce, having good anchorage within the bar of the river Bug.
