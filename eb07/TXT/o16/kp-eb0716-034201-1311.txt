ONTINIENTE, a large town of Spain, in the province of Valencia, in the department of San Felipe. It is an open town, in the vicinity of the mountains, but stands in a fruitful spot, and is remarkable for the salubrity of its climate. Figs are cultivated near it of good quality, of which about 7000 quintals are annually collected and sent to other districts. The hilly parts in the vicinity produce excellent pears and apples, and near them is raised the best wheat in Spain. The inhabitants amount to 11,700, who, besides cultivation, have some employment in making linen and woollen goods, paper, and copper wares. Being inland, and out of any great road, it is a place very rarely visited by foreign travellers.
