ODOACER, according to Ennodius, was meanly born, and only a private man in the guards of the Emperor Augustulus, when, in the year 476, under the consulship of Basilicus and Armatus, the barbarians chose him for their leader. The barbarians thought that, as they often defended Italy, they had a right to at least part of it; but upon demanding this they were refused, and the consequence w as a revolt. Odoacer is said to have been a man of uncommon parts, capable alike of commanding an army or of governing a state. Having left his own country when he was very young, to serve in Italy, he was admitted amongst the emperor’s guards, and continued in that station till the above year; when, putting himself at the head of the barbarians in the Roman pay, who, although of different nations, had unanimously chosen him to be their leader, he marched against Orestes, and his son Augustulus, who still refused to share any of the lands in Italy. The Romans were inferior both in numbers and in valour, and were, therefore, easily conquered. Orestes was ordered to be slain; but the Emperor Augustulus was spared, and, although stripped of his dignity, was treated with humanity, and allowed a liberal sum for his own support and for that of his relations. Odoacer was proclaimed king of Italy, but assumed neither the purple nor any other mark of imperial consequence. He was afterwards defeated and slain by Theodoric the Ostrogoth.
