OVOLO, or Ovum, in Architecture, a round moulding, the profile or sweep of which, in the Ionic and Composite capitals, is usually a quadrant of a circle; and hence it is also commonly called the quarter-round. It is usually cut with representations of eggs and arrow-heads or anchors placed alternately.
