OAKINGHAM, or Wokingham, a market-town of the hundred of Sonning, in the county of Berks, but with the singularity, that a part of the town, including the church, is in the hundred of Amesbury, and the county of Wilts. It is thirty-two miles from London, and seven from Reading, and is situated on the border, within the boundary of the royal forest of Windsor. It consists of four streets meeting in the market-place, where is the town-hall. The church is an extensive structure, supported by handsome pillars, and adorned by many monuments. It has a good free school, and some charities, particularly one endowed by Archbishop Laud for female servants. A well-furnished market is held every Tuesday. The number of inhabitants, including the parts of both counties, amounted in 1801 to 2027, in 1811 to 2085, in 1821 to 2490, and in 1831 to 2692.
