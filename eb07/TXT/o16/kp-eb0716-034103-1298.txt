ONONDAGA, a post township and capital of Onondaga county, New York, a hundred and thirty miles westnorth-west of Albany, and fifty miles west of Utica. It is ten miles in length by nine in breadth. Through the eastern part a broad valley extends north and south, bounded on each side by high swelling ridges. This valley, which is of rich alluvion and exuberant fertility, is watered by Onondaga Creek, which flows northward to Onondaga Lake, in the town of Salina. The post borough of Onondaga, the seat of the county buildings, is situated on a delightful eminence. The post village of Onondaga Hollow stands about one mile east of the court-house. It has an arsenal belonging to the state, and many mechanical establishments. Onondaga Castle is the chief town of the remnant of the Onondaga tribe of Indians, after whom the township has been named. It is situated three miles south of the village of Onondaga Hollow, and contains about fifty Indian houses, which are built of logs. There are about a hundred and forty persons, who annually receive a thousand dollars from the state of New York. The whole township of Onondaga in 1831 contained 5668 inhabitants, and it does not seem to be rapidly increasing.
