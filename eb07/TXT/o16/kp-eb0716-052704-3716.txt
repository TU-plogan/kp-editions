ORENSE, a city of Spain, in the province of Galicia. It is situated in the higher part of the country, through which the Minho flows, over which there is a magnificent bridge. It was known to the Romans by the name of Aqua Calida, on account of three fountains of warm water which rise near it. It is situated in a very fertile district, which produces great quantities of wine; but, from the bad state of the roads, the expense of conveying it to a market is more than it would sell for when it arrived there. Orense is the see of a bishop, whose spiritual jurisdiction extends over a part of the contiguous province in Portugal. It possesses four churches, two monasteries, an hospital, and a population of 30,000 souls.
