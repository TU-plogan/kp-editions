OURAL Mountains, a remarkable and extensive range of mountains, which has its commencement in the interior of Asia, in the territory of the Kirghisses, between the Caspian and the Aral, and stretches about due north along the sources of the Oural, the Tobol, the Emba, the Petchora, and the Sosva, by a course very imperfectly known, but, it is supposed, nearly parallel to the course of the Obi, to the shores of the Northern Ocean, and across that ocean throughout the whole length of Nova Zembla. It forms, during the greater part of its course, the boundary between Northern Asia and Russia in Europe. The soil and the country are very various, great part of these mountains being little else than lofty and barren deserts. Hence this extensive tract is divided into the Oural of the Kirghisses, the mining district of the Oural, and the desert regions. No accurate information has been obtained, excepting regarding the mining district, which contains extensive mines of iron and copper, with several of gold and of platina. Great establishments have been formed in these desert parts for the working of the mines, the produce of which has been increasing in value for the last twenty years. Besides these metals, the Oural Mountains also produce varied and beautiful specimens of minerals, as jasper, quartz, petrosilex, agate, calcedony, rock crystal, topaz, amethyst, chrysolite, asbestos, amianthus, and others. The Oural Mountains slope much more on the western than on the eastern side; and on the former there is a collateral chain, which contains rich veins of copper. Many of the loftiest pinnacles are composed of granite, which appears below in large masses; and they reach above the level of perpetual snow. The sides, particularly the western, are composed of schistus, whilst, in the lower parts, calcareous rocks predominate. These mountains are covered in many parts with forests, in which are generally found pines, cedars, larches, and other natives of a northern climate; and in the southwest parts are found the oak and the ash. Between the mountains are seen fine pasture-grounds, rich valleys, and beautiful meadows, in which numerous herds of cattle are bred. The country is well watered, both by numerous rivers, and fine transparent lakes full of fish.

Oural, a large river of Asiatic Russia, formerly called by the name of Yaik. It received its present appellation in the year 1775. It has its rise in the Oural Mountains, in about 54° north latitude, and runs westward a great part of its course, after which it turns directly south, and falls into the Caspian, nearly in 47° north latitude, and 53° east longitude. It forms the boundary between the Kirghisses and the Baschkirs; has a rapid current, with a pure stream; and everywhere abounds with fish, the fisheries on its banks affording an inexhaustible source of wealth to the Cossacks. It has very steep and rocky banks whilst it is a mountain stream; but afterwards flows through a dry and saline plain.
