OOSCAT, a considerable town of Anatolia, in Asia Minor, situated in a hollow, surrounded on all sides by naked and barren hills. The houses are neatly constructed of brick and wood, painted like those in theother Turkish towns. The palace is a very extensive building of brick and wood, but only two stories high; and a handsome mosque has lately been erected, of hewn stone, in imitation of St Sophia. It is surrounded by a slight wall, built of sun-dried brick and mud. The inhabitants amount to 16,000, of whom the greater number are Turks, and the remainder Greeks, Armenians, and Jews. It is 110 miles east of Angora. Lat. 39. 42. N.
