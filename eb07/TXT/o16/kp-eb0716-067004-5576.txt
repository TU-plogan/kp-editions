OTRANTO, a province of the kingdom of Naples, on the Italian continent. It is the north-eastern corner of the kingdom, a kind of peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea, extending in north latitude from 39. 47. to 40. 48., and in east longitude from 16. 44. to 18. 41. The other boundaries on the land side are, on the north-west Bari, and on the south-west Basilicata. It is 1650 square miles in extent, and contains 292,100 inhabitants, of whom about 40,000 are said to be Arnauts and Greeks. A continuation of the Apennine chain runs through the centre of the province, but none of the points are very lofty, and they gradually decline in height till they terminate in the sea at Cape Leuca. On both sides of this ridge the land is of moderate quality, chiefly of a calcareous and clayey mixture; and when well fallowed, which, from a scarcity of manure, is the common practice, yields good crops of the common kinds of grain, and abundance of all sorts of pulse. Near to the shore, tobacco, cotton of a good qua lity, and much liquorice, are grown; and on the sides of the hills some very strong, if not well-flavoured wine, is produced, and also much olive oil. Silk is neglected, although the soil and climate are favourable to mulberry trees. Honey and wax are obtained in every village in plenty. There are no minerals, and the manufactures are insignificant. The chief city is Lecce.
