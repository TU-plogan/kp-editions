OMBROMETER, an instrument to measure the quantity of rain that falls. It consists of a tin funnel, the surface of which is an inch square, with a flat board, and a glass tube set into the middle of it in a groove. The rise of the water in the tube, the capacity of which at different times must be measured and marked, shows the quantity of rain that has fallen.
