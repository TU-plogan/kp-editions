ONEGLIA, a district of the province of Nice, in the kingdom of Sardinia, bounded on the south-east by the Gulf of Genoa, and on the other sides by the territory forming a part of that ancient republic. It is about ninety square miles in extent, and is almost covered with olive trees, which yield abundance of oil; besides which, wine, figs, silk, flax, and some corn, are produced. It was formerly considered as a principality, and gave the title of prince to the family of Doria. The principality was divided into three valleys; Oneglia, Maro, and Prela. The capital, bearing the name of the district, is about one mile to the eastward of Port Maurice, and a mile and three quarters from Cape Verde. It stands upon a plain on the sea-shore, and the river Impero falls into the Mediterranean Sea on its western side. It is surrounded with walls, and defended by three forts; one in the centre, and one at each end. The anchorage-ground is good, but open to the prevailing winds. There are several religious houses for both sexes, a gymnasium, and a governorâ€™s palace. It contains about 4000 inhabitants. Long. 8. 2. E. Lat. 43. 53. N.
