OTODINI, ancient Britons, who, as some suppose, occupied the countries now called Northumberland, Merse, and the Lothians, to the north-east of the Brigantes. As the Otodini are not mentioned by any of the Roman historians, and noticed only by Ptolemy, it is consequently uncertain whether they formed a distinct and independent state, or were united with the Brigantes. They were a considerable people, however, and possessed a long tract of the sea-coast, from the river Tyne to the Frith of Forth. Their name is derived by Baxter from the old British words Ot o dineu, signifying â€œa high and rocky shore and thus descriptive enough of their country. They were probably reduced by Agricoa at the same time with their more powerful neighbours the Brigantes; but as they lived without the wall of Severus, they were, like the rest of the Maeatae, engaged in frequent revolts. In the most perfect state of the Roman government in this island, the country of the Otodini formed a part of the Roman province called Valentia, which comprehended the large tract between the two walls. As this province was never long in the peaceable possession of the Romans, the latter had but few stations in the country of the Otodini, except those along the line of the wall of Severus. Various authors have derived the name of this people in various ways, and it is very differently spelled; and different opinions seem still to be entertained amongst the learned respecting their real situation. Indeed it is even doubtful whether their country was in England or in Scotland.
