OLIVETAN, Robert, a son of John Calvin. He printed, at Neufchatel, in 1535, folio, a version of the Bible into French, which had been translated from the original Hebrew and Greek. It is written in an uncouth and barbarous style, and is very far from being faithful. The characters in which it is printed are Gothic, and the language is scarcely less so. It is valued only because it is rare. Calvin is believed to have had a considerable share in this translation. Olivetan survived his publication only a short time. He died at Rome the year after, having, it is alleged, been poisoned on account of his translation. Olivetan’s Bible, revised by Calvin and Malinger, was reprinted at Geneva, in 1540, in 4to. This edition is still rarer than the former. It is called the Bible de l’Epée, because the printer had adopted the figure of a sword as his ensign.
