ODENATUS, a celebrated prince of Palmyra, who very early inured himself to bear fatigues, and, by hunting leopards and wild beasts, accustomed himself to the labours of a military life. He was a faithful friend to the Romans; and when Aurelian had been taken prisoner by Sapor king of Persia, Odenatus warmly interested himself in his cause, and solicited his release, by writing to the conqueror, and by sending him presents. The king of Persia was offended at this liberty of Odenatus; he tore the letter, and ordered the presents which were offered to be thrown into a river; and to punish Odenatus, who had the impudence, as he called it, to pay homage to so great a ^nonarch as himself, he commanded him to appear before him, on pain of being devoted to instant destruction with ill his family if he dared to refuse. But Odenatus despised the haughty summons of Sapor, and opposing force )y force, obtained some considerable advantages over the .roops of the Persian king, took his wife prisoner, and, betides, obtained a great and rich booty. These services were )bserved with gratitude by the Romans; and Gallienus, hen emperor, named Odenatus his colleague on the throne, ,ιnd gave the title of Augustus to his children, and to his I rife the celebrated Zenobia. Odenatus, invested with new I power, resolved to signalize himself more conspicuously, by

Onquering the barbarians of the north; but he perished py the dagger of one of his own relations, whom he had lightly offended at a domestic entertainment. He died ∣t Emessa, about the 267th year of the Christian era. Ze-ιobia succeeded to his titles and honours.
