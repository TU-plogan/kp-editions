ORENBURG, a government of Asiatic Russia, the most westerly of the whole, having on one side Russia in Europe, and on the other the government of Tobolsk. It is bounded on the south by Independent Tartary, and is traversed by the rude tribes of the Kirghisses and Kalmucks. The aspect of the country is mountainous, as it is intersected by the most elevated part of the great Uralian chain. Many parts are fertile, as the valleys and river banks, and yield grain, not merely for the subsistence of 'the natives, but for exportation. Numerous flocks and ∣ herds are fed on the abundant pastures; and even the caI aιel is bred upon the plains. The breeding of bees is pursued with activity, and is found an extremely profitable Ranch of industry. A great quantity of large fish and cadar taken in the Ural are exported. This province is rich n mineral wealth. Its mountains afford inexhaustible nines of copper and iron; besides which, it contains same lakes, which are very valuable. It is divided into welve districts, of which the principal are Orenburg proper and Oufa, the last of which contains the capital. On he Tartar frontier this province is exposed to the incur-ions of the Kirghisses and the Kalmuck hordes, against vhich a chain of forts has been erected. The popula-ion is stated at 629,426.

Orenburg, the capital of the province above described until 1702, when the government was transferred to Oufa. It is a considerable town, of an oval form, situated in one of the extended plains of Russia, and regularly fortified. It was originally built higher up the Ural range, but in 1739 was transferred 120 miles lower, and in 1742 fifty miles more. It contains nine churches and 2000 houses. It carries on an extensive trade with Tartary, Bukharia, and all the countries in the interior of Asia. One great drawback on this trade is the insecurity of travelling across the vast intervening steppes, which are inhabited by nomadic tribes, who subsist by plunder. Were this obstacle removed (and the influence of the Russian government has gone far to remove it), the trade must greatly increase. The exports consist of cloths of different qualities, particularly of a red or scarlet colour, velvets, Russia leather, linens blue and white, copper and iron utensils, sugar and other colonial produce, toys, and glass, and various species of ornaments. From Tartary these caravans bring cotton wool, India muslins and cottons, Persian silks, a little gold dust, lapis lazuli, and a few precious stones. Sheep to the number of 40,000 or 60,000, and horses to the amount of 10,000, are brought annually to the market of Orenburg. The horses are sent to Russia, and also the sheep, the tallow of which is exported from St Petersburg. A considerable trade is carried on in the sale of golden eagles, which are highly valued by the Kirghisses. Long. 52. 31. 10. E. Lat. 51. 46. N.
