OVILIA, or Septa, in ancient Rome, a place in the Campus Martins, at first railed in like a sheep-pen, but afterwards adorned with marble, and beautified with walks, galleries, and a tribunal or seat of justice. Within this preeinct or enclosure the people were called to give their suffrages for the election of magistrates. The ascent into the ovilia was not by stairs, but by pontes, or narrow boards, laid there for the occasion. On this account, de ponte dejici signified to be deprived of the privilege of voting; and persons thus dealt with were called depontani.
