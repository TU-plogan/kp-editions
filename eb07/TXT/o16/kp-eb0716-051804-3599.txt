ORATOR, amongst the Romans, differed from a patronus. The latter was allowed only to plead causes on behalf of his clients; whereas the former might quit the forum, and ascend the rostra or tribunal, to harangue the senate or the people. The orators had rarely a profound knowledge of the law; but they were eloquent, and their style was generally correct and concise. They were employed in causes of importance, instead of the common patrons. Orators, in the violence of elocution, used the utmost animation of gesture, and even walked backwardsand forwards with great heat and emotion. This it was which gave occasion to a witticism of Flavius Virginius, who asked one of these walking orators, Quot millia passuwn de-clamâsset ? “How many miles he had declaimed ?” Similar to the Roman orators were the Grecian rhetores.
