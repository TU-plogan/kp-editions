ODER, a river of Germany, which has its source near a town of the same name in Silesia, and upon the confines of Moravia. It runs northward through that province, and then into the marche of Brandenburg and Pomerania, where it forms a large lake, and afterwards falls into the Baltic Sea by three mouths, between which lie the islands of Usedom and Wolin. It passes by several towns, as Ratibor, Oppeln, Breslau, Glogau, and Grossen, in Silesia; Francfort, Lebus, and Custrin, in Brandenburg; and Gartz, Stettin, Cammin, Wallin, Usedom, and Wolgast, in Pomerania.
