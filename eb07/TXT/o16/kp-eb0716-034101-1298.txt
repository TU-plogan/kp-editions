ONOMANCIA, or rather Onomantia, a branch of divination, which foretells the good or bad fortune of a man from the letters in his name. Upon much the same principle the young Romans were accustomed to toast their mistresses as often as there were letters in their names. Hence Martial says,

Naevia sex cyathis, septem Justina bibatur.
