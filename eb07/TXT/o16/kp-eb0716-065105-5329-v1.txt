OROTAVA, a town of Teneriffe, one of the Canary Islands, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is situated on a very steep declivity, and, from the great abundance of water[7:16:652] which runs through the principal streets, it has a very pleasant appearance at a distance. The spring of Agua Mansa, collected into two large reservoirs, turns several mills, and is afterwards distributed amongst the vineyards of the adjacent hills. Orotava is the ancient Taoro of the Guanches. The houses are substantially built, but have a gloomy appearance; and the streets seem as if deserted. Near this town is the celebrated dragon-tree of Orotava, one of the most gigantic productions of the kind on the face of the globe. Its circumference near the roots is forty-five feet. Although Santa Cruz is the principal seaport, and the capital of Teneriffe, the riches and fertility of the island are to be found at Orotava; and here the wine is chiefly made, and also shipped when the weather allows.
