OELS, a circle of the Prussian province of Silesia, which has become remarkable on account of its having been bestowed on the Duke of Brunswick when expelled from his hereditary dominions by Bonaparte. It was formerly[7:16:325] a sovereignty, but is now mediatized; and the ancient race of its dukes has become extinct. It extends over 814 square miles, and contains nine cities and towns, 314 villages, and 164 hamlets, inhabited by about 95,000 persons. The chief place is the city of the same name situated on the river Oelse, which runs to the Weyda in its course to the Oder. It is surrounded with walls, and contains one Catholic and five Lutheran churches, 480 houses, and about 5000 inhabitants. In the ancient castle of the dukes is a numerous library and a cabinet of natural history. The chief employment of the inhabitants is in the linen trade.
