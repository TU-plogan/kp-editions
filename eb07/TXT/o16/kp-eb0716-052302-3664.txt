ORDINATION, the act of conferring holy orders, or of initiating a person into the priesthood, by prayer and the imposition of hands.

Ordination has always been esteemed a principal prerogative of bishops, and they still retain the function as a mark of spiritual sovereignty in their diocese. The ordination of bishops is properly called consecration. Ordination is one of the sacraments of the church of Rome. In the established church of Scotland, where there are no bishops, the power of ordination is lodged in the presbytery; and by the Independents, in the suffrage of the people.
