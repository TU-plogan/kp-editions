OAR, a long piece of timber, flat at one end and round or square at the other, and which being applied to the side of a floating vessel, serves to propel, or cause it to advance upon the water.

That part of the oar which is out of the vessel, and which enters into the water, is called the blade or wash-plot ; and that which is within board is termed the loom, the extremity of which, being small enough to be grasped by the rowers or persons managing the oars, is called the handle.
