ONGOLE, a district and town of Hindustan, in the province of the Carnatic, situated between the 15th and 16th degrees of north latitude. It was formerly dependent upon the principality of Cuddapah, and was afterwards incorporated with the Carnatic below the Ghauts, and in consequence came under the dominion of the nabob of Arcot, by whom it was transferred to the British in 1781. The principal rivers are the Mussy and the Gon· degamma; and the chief towns are Ongole, Courchier, and Sintalsheroo. Ongole was formerly a fortified town; but the fortifications, owing to the tranquil state of the country, have now been allowed to go to decay. It is 173 miles north by west from Madras. Long. 81. 1. E. Lat. 15. 31. N.
