ORDINARY, in general, signifies common, usual. Thus, an ambassador, or envoy, in ordinary, is one sent to reside statedly, and for a number of years, at the court of some foreign prince or state, in order to keep up a good understanding, and watch over the interest of his own nation.

Ordinary, in nautical language, denotes the establishment of the persons employed by government to take charge of the ships of war which are laid up in the several u ⅛ar- bours adjacent to the royal dock-yards. These are pri∏-, cipally composed of the warrant officers of the said jsħips, as the gunner, boatswain, carpenter, deputy-purser, and cook, with three servants. There is, besides, enrolled in [7:16:523] the list of the ordinary, a crew of labourers, who pass from ship to ship occasionally, to pump, moor, remove, or clean them, whenever it is necessary.

The term ordinary is also applied sometimes to the ships themselves; and it is likewise used to distinguish the inferior sailors from the most expert and diligent. The latter are rated able on the navy books, and have higher pay than those who are rated as ordinary. Ordinary of Assizes and Sessions, was a deputy of the bishop of the diocese, anciently appointed to give malefactors their neck-verses, and judge whether they read or not; to perform divine service for them, and assist in preparing them for death.

Ordinary of Newgate, is one who attends in ordinary upon the condemned malefactors in that prison, to prepare them for death, and who records the conduct and behaviour of such persons.
