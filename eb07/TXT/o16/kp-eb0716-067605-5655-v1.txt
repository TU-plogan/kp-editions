OUFA, a considerable city of Asiatic Russia, and capital of the government of Orenburg. It is situated on fhe banks of the Belaia, near its junction with the Oufa; part of it is a species of hollow resembling a cavern, and its site is intersected by numerous torrents and ravines. It was built in 1573, by the Czar Ivan Vassilievitch, as a station to collect the tribute of the Baschkirs, and as a barrier against the inroads of the Kirghisses. It was once fortified; but the fortifications have now fallen into decay, the danger of invasion having diminished with the extension of the frontier. This place is the residence of the primate, who bears the title of Archbishop of Orenburg and Oufa. It contains about 1000 houses, and nearly 2500 inhabitants of both sexes. It has seven churches, two convents, one of which is destined for nuns, an academy, and two schools. The surrounding country is fertile, abounding in forests and pastures, and well suited for the rearing of bees; and the Tartars who dwell in the neighbourhood, being the most diligent and industrious cultivators in Siberia, have acquired considerable wealth. It is asserted that there was formerly on the spot where Oufa stands a great Tartar city, the residence of the khans of the Nogais; and this tradition is confirmed by many ancient relics found near the city, amongst which are two mosques built of brick, and several remarkable sepulchral monuments, with Asiatic and Cufic inscriptions. Long. 56. 18. E. Lat. 54. 42. N.

Oufa, a considerable river of Russia, which rises in the Oural Mountains, and falls into the Belaia, near the city of Oufa. Its course is through a mountainous and fertile country; and several of its tributary streams have rich mines of iron on their banks.
