OSENEY Island, in England, is formed by the river Isis, in the meadows near Oxford, where a magnificent abbey was erected at the instigation of a concubine of Henry I. to atone for her sins; and the same king built a palace there, in which Richard I. was born, and which Edward II. converted into a monastery.
