ORLEANS, an arrondissement of the department of the Loiret, in France, extending over 1012 square miles. It comprises fourteen cantons, divided into 111 communes, and in 1836 contained 141,637 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, being the seat of a bishop, and of the departmental boards of the government and courts of law. It stands on the right bank of the Loire, over which there is a fine bridge of sixteen arches. It is surrounded with walls, which, being planted with trees, form pleasing promenades. In general, it contains anciently built houses, and narrow streets, though there is one exception in the suburbs. The cathedral is a fine old building, as well as the town-house, and the châtelet, formerly the residence of the Duke of Orleans. There are five hospitals, an exchange, an academy, a lyceum with a library of 36,000 volumes, and a theatre. The city contains 4600 houses, with 40,272 inhabitants. It is a place of extensive trade, having manufactories of serges and other woollens, several sugar-refineries, distilleries, breweries, and china-works. It is also a dépôt for the wines of Languedoc and Guienne, [7:16:542] and for brandies of its own preparation, as well as for those of Cognac, Chinan, Samur, and Blois. It has long given a title to a branch of the Bourbon family, and has been much celebrated for its defence under the famous Maid of Orleans. Long. 1. 49. 23. E. Lat. 47. 54. 10. N.

Orleans, New, a city of Louisiana, one of the United States of North America. See Louisiana. Orleans, Peter Joseph, a French Jesuit, was born at Bourges in 1641. He taught belles-lettres for some time in his society, but afterwards devoted himself to the writing of history; and this pursuit he continued till his death, which happened in the year 1698. He wrote a History of the Revolutions of England; a History of the Revolutions of Spain; a History of two conquering Tartars, Chunchi and Camhi; the Life of Father Coton; and some other pieces. His History of the Revolutions in England, under the family of the Stuarts, from the year 1603 to 1690, was translated in English, and published at London in 1711, one vol. 8vo; to which is prefixed an Introduction, by Mr Laurence Echard, who says, that “the great varieties and wonderful changes in these reigns are here judiciously comprised in a moderate volume, with no less perspicuity than strictness, and with a beautiful mixture of short characters, nice reflections, and noble sentences, which render the whole agreeable and instructive.”
