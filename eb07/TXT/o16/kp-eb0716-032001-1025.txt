OCHUS, a king of Persia, and son of Artaxerxes. He was cruel and avaricious, and, in order to strengthen himself on his throne, murdered all his brothers and sisters. His subjects revolted; but he reduced them to obedience, and added Egypt to his other dominions. Bagoas, his favourite eunuch, poisoned him for the insults which be had offered to Apis, the god of the Egyptians, gave his flesh to be eaten by cats, and caused handles for knives to be made with his bones.
