OBADIAH, or the Prophecy of Obadiah, a canonical book of the Old Testament, contained in a single chapter. It is partly an invective against the cruelty of the Edomites, who mocked and derided the children of Israel as they passed into captivity, and, with their confederates, invaded and oppressed these strangers, dividing the spoil amongst themselves; and partly a prediction of the deliverance of Israel, and of the victory and triumph which the church would gain over her enemies.
