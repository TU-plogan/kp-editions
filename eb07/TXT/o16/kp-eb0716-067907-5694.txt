OVERYSSEL, one of the provinces of the kingdom of the Netherlands. It extends in east longitude from 5. 44. to 6. 59âˆ™, and in north latitude from 52. 6. to 53. 52., and covers 1342 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Friesland and Drenthe, on the east by Hanover and Prussian Westphalia, on the south by Guelders, and on the west by Guelders and the Zuyder Zee. The face of the country is level, and the land sandy, a great part being covered with heaths, and other parts fertile land for grazing cattle, but marshy. The climate is foggy. This province is watered by the river Yssel and other smaller streams; and its productions are oats, buck-wheat, potatoes, apples, plums, flax, hemp, and turf for fuel. It breeds good horses. In 1831 the inhabitants amounted to 178,980, of whom 117,130 were Protestants, 59,360 Catholics, and the rest Jews. Zwolle is the capital.
