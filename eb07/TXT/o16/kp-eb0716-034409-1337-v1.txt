OPERA, a lyrical drama set to music in recitations, airs, duetts, trios, quartetts, choruses, and finales; preceded by an instrumental overture, and accompanied by an orchestra; and, when performed, enforced and embellished by action and declamation, and appropriate costumes and scenery. The opera appears to have originated at Florence about the end of the sixteenth century. (See Doni’s works, passim.') The Italians divide their operas into four kinds; the sacred opera, the serious opera, the semi-serious opera, and the opera buffa, or comic opera. The French have their grand'opera, in which the whole lyrical drama is sung; and the opera comique, in which the singing is intermingled with spoken dialogue. The Germans have a greater variety of such distinctions of operas; as the grand opera, the serious opera, the tragic opera, the heroic opera, the romantic opera, the allegorical opera, the military melodrama, the comic opera, and some others.

Much amusing and interesting matter relative to the rise and progress of the opera may be found in Dr Burney’s Tours, and History, in the Baron de Grimm’s Correspondence, and in various German periodicals conducted by musicians. See also Arteaga, Manfredini, Signorelli, &c. For some technicalities relative to operatic music, see the article Music.
