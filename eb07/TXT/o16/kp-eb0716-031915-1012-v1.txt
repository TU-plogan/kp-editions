OCEANUS, in pagan mythology, the son of Coelus and Terra, the husband of Thetis, and the father of the rivers and fountains. The ancients called him the “father of all things,” imagining that he was produced by Humidity, which, according to Thales, was the first principle whence every thing was produced. Homer describes Juno as visiting him at the remotest limits of the earth, and acknowledging him and Thetis as the parents of the gods. He was represented with a bull’s head, as an emblem of the rage and bellowing of the ocean when agitated by storms or tempests.
