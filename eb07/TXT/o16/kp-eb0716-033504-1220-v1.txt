OLOT, a large town in the north-east of Spain, in the province of Catalonia and district of Vique. It is situated on the river Fluvia, about twenty miles to the north-west of the city of Gerona, so celebrated for its gallant defence against the French. It is surrounded with walls, is tolerably well built, with several squares, and contains three parochial and two conventual churches, besides a large hospital. In the town there are 3000 houses, and about 15,000 inhabitants, and it is one of the most industrious places in the kingdom. It is particularly distinguished by its manufactures of silk goods, and of cotton and woollen stockings. It has, too, several establishments for making serges and corduroys, as well as coarser woollens; some mills for spinning cotton, several tanneries, some printed cotton works, several soap-making manufactories, and a large manufactory of cards. It also has a considerable trade in cork and in wool. Notwithstanding it has suffered severely by the loss of the trade to South America, and by the internal political dissensions, it has made considerable progress in all branches of industry.
