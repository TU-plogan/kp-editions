OSWESTRY, a market-town of the hundred of the same name, in the county of Salop, 182 miles from London, and seventeen from Shrewsbury. It is situated in a fertile district, and has a good market, which is held on Wednesday. Being a frontier town towards Wales, in ancient times it was an important place, frequently harassed, and often burned. The chief trade depends on the canal, which connects it with the Severn, the Dee, and the Mersey. It has a corporation of twelve aldermen and eighteen common councilmen. A recorder is chosen annually, who is generally the mayor of the preceding year. In 1801, the population amounted to 2672, in 1811 to 3479, in 1821 to 3910, and in 1831 to 4478; but the whole parish, at the last census, contained 8581 inhabitants.
