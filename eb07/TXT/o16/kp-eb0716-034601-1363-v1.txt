OPPELN forms one of three provincial governments of Prussia, into which the province of Silesia is divided. It is bounded on the north by the government of Breslau, on the east by the kingdom of Poland and the republic of Cracow, on the south-east by Gallicia, on the south and south-west by Moravia, or rather Austrian Silesia, and on the west by the province of Reichenbach. In extent it is 5230 square miles, comprehending fifty-four cities and towns, and 1492 villages; and it is divided into fifteen circles. The population, according to the census of 1817, amounted to 529,964 individuals, and, according to that of 1826, had increased to 660,756. Of these inhabitants, about nine tenths are Catholics, and the remainder is divided into various sects. It is drained by the river Oder, into which all the streams run. The soil is not very fertile, and its most valuable produce is derived from its extensive forests. The chief industry is applied to spinning and to making wooden ware. The city of Oppeln, the capital of the province, as well as of the circle of the same name, stands on the Oder, and contains 380 houses, with 4500 inhabitants. It is surrounded with walls, and defended by a castle; and it has some trade in linen, in timber, andin ironmongery.
