OFFENBACH, a city of the grand duchy of Hesse, in Germany, in the province of Darmstadt, and the capital of a bailiwick of the same name. It stands on the river Maine, and is well built, being on one side surrounded with a wall, and on the other with a ditch. It contains 530 houses, with 6950 inhabitants, who are chiefly occupied in making iron and hardware, and a variety of ornamental articles of steel, silver, and gold.

0I â€™ FERINGS. Amongst the Hebrews there were several kinds of offerings, which they presented at the temple. Some were free-will offerings, and others were offerings of obligation. The first fruits, the tenths, and the sin-offerings, were of obligation; the peace-offerings, vows, offerings of wine, oil, bread, salt, and other things, which were made to the temple or to the ministers of the Lord, were offerings of devotion. The Hebrews called offerings in general cor ban. But the offerings of bread, salt, fruits, and liquors, as wine and oil, which were presented at the temple, they termed mincha. The sacrifices are not properly offerings, nor are they commonly included under that name.
