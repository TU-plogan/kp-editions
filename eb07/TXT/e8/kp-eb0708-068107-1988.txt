EMDEN, a bailiwick of the province of West Friesland, in the kingdom of Hanover, extending over eighty-one square miles, and containing a city, a market-town, and thirty parishes, with 18,925 inhabitants. It is mostly marsh land, and is only preserved from inundation by powerful dikes or embankments, which are maintained at a vast expense; but the land is highly fertile, and more than adequate to defray these charges. It is especially productive in oats, and in butter and cheese. The capital, from which it takes its name, is situated on the river Ems, but a mile and a half distant, and is surrounded with walls, which, however, are indefensible. It contains four reformed, one Lutheran, and one Catholic church, a Menonite chapel, and a Jewsâ€™ synagogue, with 1808 houses, and 12,100 inhabitants. It is a place of great trade, as well for the export of oats, butter, cheese, and bacon, as for the herring fishery; and there are many breweries and distilleries, some ship-building, and other occupations of industry. It is, besides, the seat of government for East Friesland. Long. 7. 5. 35. E. Lat. 53. 22. 8. N.
