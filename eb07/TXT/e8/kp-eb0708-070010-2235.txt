ENGINEER, taken generally, is a term applied to those who are employed in devising or forming engines or machines, and in directing their applications. In a more restricted and appropriate sense, it denotes two very important professions; the one that of the military, the other that of the civil engineer.

The Military Engineer is an officer whose business it is to delineate the plans and direct the formation of military works, and to regulate attacks and defences. Those branches of knowledge which more particularly relate to his profession are treated, in this work, under the heads of Artillery, Fortification, Gunnery, and War.

The Civil Engineer is a person who applies the principles of mechanical and physical philosophy to the construction of the machines and public works by which the arts and accommodations of civil life are rendered more efficient, extensive, and secure. The subjects which more immediately belong to . his important calling are treated in this work under the heads of Bridge, Carpentry, Docks, Gas Lights, Harbours, Light-houses, Navigation, Navigation Inland, Railways, Roads, Tunnels, Water-works, &c. ; and also under the heads Dynamics, Hydrodynamics, Machinery, Mensuration, Resistance of Solids, Strength of Materials, &c.
