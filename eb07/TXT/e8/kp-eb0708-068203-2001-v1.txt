EMERY, a rich iron ore, found in large masses of no determinate shape or size, but extremely hard and very heavy. It is usually of a dusky-brownish red on the surface[7:8:683]; but when broken it is of a fine bright iron grey, though not without some tinge of redness, and is spangled all over with shining specks, which are small flakes of a foliaceous talc, highly impregnated with iron. It is found in some of the Greek islands, in Tuscany, and in some parts of Germany.
