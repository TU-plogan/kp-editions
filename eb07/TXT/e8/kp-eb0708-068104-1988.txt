EMBROIDERY, a work in gold, or silver, or silk thread, wrought by the needle upon cloth, stuffs, or muslin, into various figures. In embroidering stuffs, the work is performed in a kind of loom, because the more the piece is stretched the easier it is worked. As to muslin, it is spread upon a pattern ready designed, and sometimes, before it is stretched upon the pattern, it is starched, to make it more easy to be handled. Embroidery on the loom is less tedious than the other, in which, whilst the flowers are worked, all the threads of the muslin, both lengthwise and breadthwise, must be continually counted; but, on the other hand, this last is much richer in points, and susceptible of greater variety. Cloths too much milled are scarcely susceptible of this ornament, and in effect we seldom see them embroidered.

There are several kinds of embroidery, viz. 1. Embroidery on the stamp, where the figures are raised and rounded, having cotton or parchment put under them to support them. 2. Low embroidery, where the gold and silver lie low upon the sketch, and are stitched with silk of the same colour. 3. Guimped embroidery. This is performed either in gold or silver. A sketch is first made upon the cloth, then put on cut vellum, and afterwards sewed on the gold and silver with silk thread; and on this kind of embroidery are often put gold and silver cord, tinsel, and spangles. 4. Embroidery on both sides, that which appears on both sides of the stuff. 5. Plain embroidery, or where the figures are flat and even, without cords, spangles, or other ornaments.
