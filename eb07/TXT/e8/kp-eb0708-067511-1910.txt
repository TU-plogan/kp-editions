EMANATION, the act of flowing or proceeding from some source or origin. Such is the emanation of light from the sun; that of effluvia from odorous or fragrant bodies; of wisdom from God, and so on. The word is formed of the Latin e, out of, and manare, to flow or stream. Emanation is also used to signify that which proceeds, as well as the act of proceeding. The power given to a judge is an emanation from the royal authority; the reasonable soul is an emanation from the divinity.
