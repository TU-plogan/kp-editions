ELZEVIRS, celebrated printers at Amsterdam and Leyden, who greatly adorned the republic of letters with many beautiful editions of the best authors of antiquity. They were five in number, namely, Louis, Bonaventure, Abraham, Lewis, and Daniel. Louis began to be famous at Leyden in 1595, and was remarkable for being the first who observed the distinction between the v consonant and u vowel, which had been recommended by Ramus and other writers long before, but never regarded. Daniel died in 1680 or 1681; and though he left children who carried on the business, he nevertheless passes for the last of his family who excelled in printing.
