ELBING, a city in the province of West Prussia, and government of Dantzic, and the capital of a circle of the same name. It is situated on the river Elbing, which divides the suburb of Grubenhagen, and the part where the corn magazines are built, from the town. About five miles below the city that river joins the Nogat, which is navigable for large vessels. Elbing contains 11 churches, five hospitals, and several other public buildings, with 2110 houses and 22,200 inhabitants. It is, next to Dantzic, the greatest corn market of Europe, and a stock of wheat is generally kept there amounting to from forty to eighty thousand quarters. A great portion of the productions of Poland is exported from this city. These, besides corn, consist of potash, pearl ash, linen, wood, tallow, and wax; and that country receives a part of its supply of manufactured and coloured goods, of wine, of iron, of salt, and other articles, through the same channel. The city possesses some manufactories, such as refineries for sugar, soap-boiling, snuff-mills, breweries, and tanneries; and many ships are built and equipped. Long. 19. 16. 5. E. Lat. 54. 7. 54. N.
