EMBOLISMUS, Έ.μβο\ιδμος, in Chronology, signifies intercalation. The word is formed from i∕z,6αλλf∕v, to insert. As the Greeks made use of the lunar year, which is only 354 days, in order to bring it to the solar, which is 365 days, they had every two or three years an embolism, that is, they added a thirteenth lunar month every two or three years, which additional month they called embolimaeus, ιμβο∙ "λ ∣ μαιος, because inserted or intercalated.
