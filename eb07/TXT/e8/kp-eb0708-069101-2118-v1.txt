EMINENCE, in Geography, a little hillock or ascent above the level of the adjoining champaign country.

Eminence is also a title of honour given to cardinals. The decree of the pope, by which it was appointed that the cardinals should be addressed under the quality of eminence, bears date the 10th of January 1630. They then laid aside the titles of illustrissimi and reverendissimi, which they had before borne. The grand master of Malta was likewise addressed under the quality of eminence. The popes John VIII. and Gregory VII. gave the same title to the kings of France. The emperors have likewise borne it.
