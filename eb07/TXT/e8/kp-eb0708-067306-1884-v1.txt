ELLYS, Dr Anthony, who was born in 1693, and educated at Clarehall, Cambridge, after rising through many inferior degrees of dignity in the church of England, was in 1752 promoted to the see of St David’s. He died at Gloucester in 1761, and is mentioned here only on account of his works, which are but little known. They are as follow: 1. A Plea for the Sacramental Test as a just security to the Church established, and very conducive to the welfare of the State; 2. Remarks on Hume’s [7:8:674] Essay on Miracles; 3. Tracts on the Liberty spiritual and temporal of Protestants in England, addressed to J. N., Esq. at Aĩx-la-Chapelle, the first part of which was printed in 1763, and the second in 1765; besides occasional sermons. In these tracts, as the editors of them truly observe, he “discovers not only fine parts, extensive knowledge, and sound judgment, but a heart overflowing with benevolence and candour, and a most Christian temper; for he always thought a person, though on the right side of the question, with principles of persecution, to be a worse man than he that was on the wrong.” This amiable and respectable writer afforded in his own conduct a proof that a man may be steadily attached to a party without wishing to encroach upon the rights of others.
