ELBERFELD, a city of the Prussian province Clewe-Juliers, of the government of Dusseldorf, and the capital of a circle of the same name. It stands on the river Wipper, which falls into the Rhine a few miles from the city. It is a place the most celebrated for its activity and progress of any in the Prussian dominions. In 1817 the houses were 2400, and the inhabitants 15,681, and in 1830 the latter had increased to 25,000. It has more than 1000 looms at work in silk goods, many mills for spinning cotton, besides machines for weaving cottons, and most of the other inventions for facilitating manufacturing operations which are known in England. The value of the goods annually produced at and near to the city is said to amount to L.l,500,000 sterling. It is the chief seat of the Rhenish company, who export the various goods of Germany to the West Indies and all parts of North and South America.
