EGERIA, a nymph who assisted Numa in framing a code of laws for the people of Rome. The king and the nymph used to meet at night in a wood at the gates of Rome, then called Lucus Camaenarum, which is now, according to popular opinion, La Caffarella. When Numa died, Ëgeria was so violently affected with grief, that she frequently interrupted by her ¼'eeping the sacrifice of Diana, till the goddess in pity changed her into a fountain of the same name. (Ovid. Afe<. xv. 547; Liv. i. 19; Juv. V. 10.)
