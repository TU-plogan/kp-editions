EBRO, a river of Spain. It has its source in the province of Toro, about ten miles west of Reynosa, from out of the two springs of Fontibre, whence it runs south-east, divides Burgos and Soria from Alava and Navarre, passes through Aragon, becomes navigable near Logrono, and, after a course of 362 miles near Amposta, empties itself into the Gulf of Alfaques. Its tributary streams are the Tadorra, the Ega, the Quelles, the Alhama, the Xalon, the Gallega, the Guadalupe, and the Segre.
