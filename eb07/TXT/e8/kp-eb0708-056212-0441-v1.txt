ELATH, or Eloth, a port of Idumaea, situated upon the Red Sea, which David in his conquest of Edom took, and established there an extensive trade. His son, we are informed, built ships in Elath, whence they were dispatched to Ophir for gold. It continued in the possession of the Israelites till the time of Joram, when the Edomites recovered it; but it was wrested from them by Azariah, who left it to his son. It was afterwards taken from Ahaz by the Syrians, who held it a long time; and it passed at length into the hands of the all-subduing Romans.
