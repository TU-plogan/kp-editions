EBERHARD, John Augustus, an eminent German theologian and philosopher, was born at Halberstadt, in Lower Saxony, on the 31st of August 1739. His father was the singing-master at the church of St Martin’s in that town, and also teacher of the school of the same name; a man, it is said, of a lively disposition, and considerable literary attainments. Young Eberhard was educated partly at home and partly in the school above mentioned. In the seventh year of his age he repaired to the University of Halle, with the view of prosecuting his theological studies. Towards the end of the year 1759 he returned to his native town, and became tutor to the eldest son of the Baron Von der Horst, to whose family he attached himself for a number of years. In the year 1763 he was appointed con-rector of the school of St Martin’s, and second preacher in the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost; but he soon afterwards resigned these offices, and followed his patron to Berlin.

The advantages be enjoyed, in this family, of being introduced into the best company, tended to polish his manners, and to form, even at an early period, a style of writing which served as a model to many of his contemporaries. His residence at Berlin gave him an opportunity of extending his knowledge, and of cultivating the acquaintance of some of the most eminent literary characters in Germany. Amongst these were Nicholai and Mendelssohn, with whom he associated upon terms of intimate friendship.

In the year 1768 he accepted the situation of preacher or chaplain to the work-house at Berlin, along with that of preacher in the neighbouring fishing village of Stralow. The income from these livings was small; but his object was to continue at Berlin, and he had at the same time the promise of further preferment upon the first vacancy. He now applied, with renewed ardour, to the study of theology, philosophy, and history; and the first fruits of his talents and application soon appeared in his New Apology of Socrates; a work exhibiting such originality of thought and eloquence of style as at once established his character as a writer. This work was occasioned by an attack which was made on the sentiments contained in the fifteenth chapter of Marmontel’s Belisarius, by one Peter Hofstede, a clergyman of Rotterdam, who, with a contemptible industry, raked up the vices of the most celebrated characters in the pagan world, and even went so far as to maintain that the most virtuous amongst the heathen were no fit objects of divine mercy. He seemed particularly desirous to blacken the character of Socrates; and from this circumstance Eberhard was induced to give to his work the title which we have mentioned above. The greater part of it is occupied with an investigation of some of those peculiar doctrines which have been admitted as dogmas of the Christian church, upon the authority of some of the early fathers; and an examination of those texts of Scripture upon which they are founded. The Apology itself, which constitutes but a small part of the book, is esteemed a masterpiece of clear, dignified, and persuasive eloquence. The whole work exhibits much reading and philosophical reflection; but the liberality of his reasoning gave great offence to many of the strictly orthodox divines of his time, and is believed to have obstructed his preferment in the church.

In the year 1774 he was appointed to the living of Charlottenburg; and he employed the leisure he had in this situation in publishing a second volume of his Apology; in which he not only endeavours to obviate some objections which were taken to the former part, but continues his inquiries into the doctrines of the Christian religion, religious toleration, and the proper rules for interpreting the Scriptures. Perceiving that his further promotion in the church would be attended with difficulty he resolved, although reluctantly, to accept the situation of professor of philosophy at the University of Halle [7:8:393]which became vacant in 1778, by the death of G. F. Moier. But however excellent as a writer, and however just his ideas upon philosophical subjects, he does not appear to have been peculiarly qualified to excel as a teacher. He was highly esteemed, indeed, both by professors and students; but his lectures, although they attracted at first a considerable concourse, never acquired any degree of popularity. He continued, however, to lecture very regularly; and published several manuals for the use of nis pupils.

On his arrival at Halle, the philosophical faculty presented him with a diploma as doctor in philosophy and master of arts. In 1786 he was admitted a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences; and in 1805 the king of Prussia conferred upon him the honorary title of a privy councillor. In 1808 he obtained the degree of doctor in divinity, which was given him as a reward for his theological writings. He married in 1778, but had no children. He died on the 6th of January 1809, being then in the seventieth year of his age.

Eberhard’s attainments in philosophy and literature were extensive and profound. He was master of the learned languages, spoke and wrote French with facility and correctness, and understood English, Italian, and Dutch. He had read a great deal, was thoroughly versed in the philosophical sciences, and possessed a just and discriminating taste for the fine arts. He was a great lover of music, and was himself a proficient in that science. His manners were mild and unassuming; and his amiable and cheerful disposition, no less than his talents and virtues, endeared him to a numerous circle of friends.

The following is a list of his works:

Neue Apologie des Socrates, <⅛c. 2 vols. 8vo. The first volume was published in 1772, the second in 1778; both have been since republished.

Allgemeine Theorie des Denkens und Empfindens, &c. Berlin, 1776, 8vo. This essay obtained the prize assigned by the Royal Society of Berlin for that year. A new edition appeared in 1786.

Von dem Begriff der Philosophie und ihren Theilen, Berlin, 1778, 8vo. A short essay, in which he announced the plan of his lectures on being appointed to the professorship at Halle.

Lobschrift auf Herrn Johann Thunmann, Prof, der Weltweisheit und Beredsamkeit auf der Universitat zu Halle. Halle, 1779, 8vo.

Amyntor, eine Geschichte in Briefen. Berlin, 1782, 8vo. This work was written with the view of counteracting the influence of those sceptical and Epicurean principles in religion and morals which were then so prevalent in France, and thence rapidly spreading amongst the higher ranks in Germany. It is composed with great elegance and perspicuity, and exhibits much philosophical reflection, and knowledge of the world. The story is simple, and seems to have been merely intended as a vehicle for the sentiments.

Ueber die Zeichen der Aufklarung einer nation, &c. Halle, 1783, 8vo. A lecture delivered at Halle, in presence of his Serene Highness the reigning Duke of Wurtemberg.

Theorie der Schonen Künste und Wissenschaften, &c. Halle, 1783, 8vo. 3d ed. 1790.

Vermischte Schriften. Halle, 1784.

Neue vermischte Schriften. Ib. 1786.

Allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie, &c. Halle, 1788, 8vo; 2d ed. with a continuation and chronological tables, 1796. Eberhard published also an abridgment of this work in 1794.

Versuch einer Ailgemeinen-Deutschen Synonymik, &c. Halle and Leipsic, 1795-1802, 6 vols. 8vo. This is esteemed a classical work on the Synonymes of the German Language. An abridgment of it was published by ' the author in one large volume 8vo. Halle, 1802.

Handbuch der Aesthetik, &c. Halle, 1803-1805, 4 vols. 8vo. i

Besides the works above mentioned, Eberhard contributed a number of small tracts and essays to various periodical and scientific publications, and translated several foreign works. He was also the editor of the Philosophical Magazine, Halle, 1788-1792, and of the Philosophical Archives, Halle, 1793-1795. These two periodical works, which are now little read, were instituted for the purpose of controverting the metaphysical principles of Kant, and of vindicating the doctrines of Leibnitz and Wolf.

Frederick Nicoai published a Memoir on the life and character of Eberhard, Berlin and Stettin, 1810, 8vo. See also K. H. Jördens, Lexico Deutscher Dichter und Prosaisten ; and Biographie Universelle.

L’BERMANSTADT, a bailiwick of the circle of the Upper Maine, in the kingdom of Bavaria, extending over ninety-two square miles, containing one city, two markettowns, and thirty-three villages, with 9690 inhabitants.
