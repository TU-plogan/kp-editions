ELATEA, the largest and most important city of Phocis, situated on the declivity of a hill above the fertile plains of the river Cephissus. Behind it to the north rose a mountain ridge, which, issuing from Doris, stretched away to the south-east, and at its extremity was called by the name of Cnemis. Here dwelt the Locri EpicnemidiÎ¹. An enemy who wished to penetrate from Thermopylae by the most direct road into Greece required first to secure the mountain passes round Elatea, and to get possession of the city itself. Then the whole of Phocis and Boeotia lay open before him. Hence the alarm and consternation produced at Athens on the news reaching it of Elatea having fallen into the hands of Philip. (Demosth. Orat. de Cor. p. 284; Strab. ix. 424; Diodor. xvi. 84.) It was burnt to the ground by the Persians, and destroyed at the conclusion of the sacred war by order of the Amphictyonie council. Being afterwards rebuilt, it made a successful stand against the arms of Cassander, and was at last taken by the Romans from Philip, son of Demetrius. Its ruins are found on a site still called Elephta.
