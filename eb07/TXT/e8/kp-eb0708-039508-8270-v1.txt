ECCHELLENSIS, Abraham, a learned Maronite, whom the president Le Jai employed in the edition of his Polyglott Bible. Gabriel Sionita, his countryman, brought him to Paris in order to make him his fellow-labourer in publishing that Bible. But they quarrelled, upon which Gabriel complained to the parliament, and cruelly defamed his associate. This dispute made a great noise. The congregation de Propaganda Fide associated him in 1636 with those whom they had employed in making an Arabic translation of the Scriptures; they recalled him from Paris, and he laboured in that translation at Rome in the year 1652. Whilst he was professor of the oriental languages at Rome, he was selected by Duke Ferdinand II. to translate from Arabic into Latin the fifth, sixth, and seventh books of Apollonius's Conics; a task in which he was assisted by John Alphonso Borelli, who added commentaries to them. He died at Rome in 1644.
