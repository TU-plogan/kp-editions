ELAPHEBOLIA, in Grecian antiquity, a festival observed in honour of Diana the huntress. In the celebration of this mystery a cake was made in the form of a deer (iλαpoς), and offered to the goddess. It owed its institution to a notable circumstance. When the Phocians had been severely beaten by the Thessalians, they resolved, by the persuasion of one Deiphantus, to raise a pile of combustible materials, and to burn their wives, children, and effects, rather than submit to the enemy. This flaming resolution was unanimously approved os by the women, who decreed Deiphantus a crown for his magnanimity. But when every thing was prepared, and just before they had fired the pile, they engaged their enemies, whom they totally routed, and thus obtained a complete victory. In commemoration of this unexpected success, the festival was instituted, and observed with the greatest solemnity.
