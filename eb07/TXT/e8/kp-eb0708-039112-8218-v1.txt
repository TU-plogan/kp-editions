EASTBOURNE, a town on the coast of Sussex, in the hundred of that name, within the rape of Pavensey. It is 63 miles from London, and is one of those places which, from the prevalence of sea-bathing, has within the last fifty years been raised from a fishing village to be a large and populous town. It is situated in a chasm between two cliffs, through which runs a small stream. One of these, Beachy Head, is the loftiest headland on the English Channel. It consists of three distinct parts, each near half a mile from the other. The resident population amounted in 1801 to 1668, in 1811 to 1806, in 1821 to 2607, and in 1831 to 2726; but the visitors are said to be much more numerous during the bathing season.
