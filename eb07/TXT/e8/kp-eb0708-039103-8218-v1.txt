EAR. (See Anatomy.) The ear has its beauties, which a good painter ought by no means to disregard; and where it is well formed it would be an injury to the head were it hidden. Suetonius insists particularly on the beauty of Augustus's ears; and Aelian, describing the beauties of Aspasia, observes that she had short ears. Martial also ranks large ears amongst the number of deformities. Amongst the Athenians it was a mark of nobility to have the ears bored or perforated; but amongst the Hebrews and Romans this was a type of servitude.

Ear, in Music, denotes a kind of internal sense, by which we perceive and judge of harmony and musical sounds. In music we seem universally to acknowledge something like a sense distinct from the external one of hearing, and call it a good ear ; and a similar distinction we should probably acknowledge in other affairs, if we had distinct names by which to denote these powers of perception. Thus a greater capacity of perceiving the beauties of painting, sculpture, and architecture, is culled a Jìne laste.
