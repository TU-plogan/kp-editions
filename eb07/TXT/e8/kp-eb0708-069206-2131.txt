EMPALEMENT, an ancient punishment, which consisted in thrusting a stake through the fundament. The word comes from the French empaler, or the Italian im-palare; or rather, both are derived from the Latin palus, a stake, and the preposition in, in or into. We find mention made of empaling in Juvenal. It was frequently practised in the time of Nero, and continues to be so in Turkey.
