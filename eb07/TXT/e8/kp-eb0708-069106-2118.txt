EMMIUS, Ubbo, born at Gretha in East Friesland in 1547, was a very learned professor, and chosen rector of the college of Norden in 1579. This seminary flourished exceedingly under his care; but it declined as visibly after he was ejected, in 1587, for refusing to subscribe the confession of Augsburg. The year afterwards he was made rector of the co “ege of Leer; and when the city of Groningen confederated with the United Provinces, the magistrates appointed him rector of that college; which employment he filled with high reputation for nearly twenty[7:8:692] years, until the college was erected into an university, when he became the first rector, and one of its chief ornaments by his lectures, till his infirmities prevented his public appearance. His wisdom was equal to his learning, so that the governor of Friesland and Groningen often consulted him, and seldom failed to follow his advice. He wrote, 1. Opłis Chronologicum, Groningen, 1619, fol.; 2. Vetus Graecia illustrata, Leyden, 1626, 8vo; 3. Rerum Erisicarum Historia, Lcyden, 1616, fol.; 4. Historia Temporis nostri, Groningen, 1732, 4to; and other works. He died in 1625.
