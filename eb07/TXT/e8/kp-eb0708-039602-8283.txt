ECCLESIASTES, a canonical book of the Old Testament, the design of which is to show the vanity of all sublunary things. It was composed by Solomon, who enumerates the several objects on which men place their happiness, and then shows the insufficiency of all worldly enjoyments. The Talmudists made King Hezekiah the author of this book; while Grotius ascribes it to Zorobabel, and others to Isaiah; but the generality of commentators believe it to be the product of Solomonâ€™s repentance, after having experienced all the follies and pleasures of life.
