EARNEST (Arrhae), money advanced in order to bind the parties to the performance of a verbal bargain. By the civil law, he who recedes from his bargain loses his earnest, and if the person who received the earnest give back, he must return the earnest double. But with us, the person who gives it is in strictness obliged to abide by his bargain; and in case he decline it, he is not discharged uj>on forfeiting his earnest, but may be sued for the whole money stipulated.
