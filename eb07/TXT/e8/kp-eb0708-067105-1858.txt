ELLESMERE, a market-town of Shropshire, in the hundred of Pimhill, 242 miles from London. The name is derived from a beautiful lake or meer, near to which it is situated. From Ellesmere castle there is a fine prospect extending over the surrounding counties, none of which, it is said, can be seen from it. A navigable canal connects the town with the Mersey. The market is held on Tuesday. The population amounted in 1801 to 5553, in 1811 to 5639, in 1821 to 6056, and in 1831 to 6540.
