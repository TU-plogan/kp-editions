ENDYMION, in fabulous history, a shepherd, son of Aethlius and Calyce. It is said that he required of Jupiter to grant to him the privilege of being always young, and sleeping as much as he chose; whence came the proverb of Endymionis somnum dormire, to express a long sleep. Diana observed him naked as he slept on Mount Latinos, and was so struck with his beauty that she came down from heaven every night in order to enjoy his company. Endymion married Chromia, daughter of Itonus, by whom he had three sons, Paeon, Epeus, and Aeolus, and a daughter called Eurydice. The fable of Endymionâ€™s amours with Diana, or the moon, arose from his knowledge of astronomy; and as he passed the night on some high mountain in order to observe the heavenly bodies, it came to be reported that he was courted by the moon. Some suppose that there were two persons of this name; the son of a king of Elis, and the shepherd or astronomer of Caria. The people of Heraclea maintained that Endymion died on Mount Latmos; and the Eleans pretended to show his tomb at Olympia in Peloponnesus.
