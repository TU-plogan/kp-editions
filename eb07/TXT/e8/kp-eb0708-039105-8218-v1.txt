EARL, a British title of nobility, next below a marquis, and above a viscount. The title is so ancient, that its origin cannot now be clearly traced out. It seems tolerably certain, however, that amongst the Saxons they were called ealdormen, elder men, a word of the same signification with senior or senator among the Romans; and also schiremen, because they had each of them the civil government of a civil division or shire. On the irruption of the Danes they changed their names to eorels, which, according to Camden, had the same signification in their language. In Latin they are called comites, a title first used in the empire, from being the king’s attendants; a societate nomen sumpserunt, reges enim tales sibi associant. After the Norman conquest they were for some time called counts, from the French; but they did not long retain that name themselves, though their shires are thence denominated counties to this day. It is now become a mere title, the holders of which have nothing to do with the government of the county, that being now entirely devolved on the sheriff, the earl’s deputy or vicecomes. In writs, commissions, and other formal instruments, the king, when he mentions any peer of the degree of an earl, usually styles him trusty and well-beloved cousin; an appellation as ancient as the reign of Henry 1V., who being, either by h⅛ wife, his mother, or his sisters, actually related or allied to every earl in the kingdom, artfully and constantly acknowledged that connection in all his letters and other public acts; whence the usage descended to his successors, though the reason has long ago failed.
