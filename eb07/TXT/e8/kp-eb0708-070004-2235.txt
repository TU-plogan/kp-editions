ENGANO, or Pugniatan, an island in the Eastern Seas, lying off the south-west coast of Sumatra, being about thirty miles in circumference, and nearly eighteen miles in length. It is covered with trees, and has always a verdant appearance. The natives are taller and fairer than the Malays; the men have black hair, which they cut very short, while it is worn long by the women, and neatly turned up; and they are extremely savage in their manners, the men going entirely naked, and the women having no other covering than a slip of plantain leaf round the waist. Their houses are of a conical form, resembling bee-hives, supported on posts, and standing singly amidst their plantations, and their canoes are formed of two planks sewed together, pointed at each end, and provided with outriggers. An attempt was made by the Dutch in 1645 to commence an intercourse with these people; but it ended in a shameful act of treachery, by which they trepanned about sixty or seventy of the natives, many of whom died after arriving at Batavia. In 1771 another attempt was made by the English settled in Sumatra to gain some acquaintance of the people, but it failed. Long. 102. 20. E. Lat. 10. 20. S.
