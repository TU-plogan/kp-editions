EBION, the author of the heresy of the Ebionites, was a disciple of Cerinthus, and successor to that person. He improved upon the errors of his master, and added to them new absurdities of his own. He began his preaching [7:8:394]in Judea; and he taught in Asia, and even at Rome. Ä²is tenets infected the isle of Cyprus. St John opposed both Cerinthus and Ebion in Asia; and it is thought that this apostle wrote his gospel in the year 97 in order to overthrow this heresy.
