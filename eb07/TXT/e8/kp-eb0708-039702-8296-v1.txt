ECIJA, a city of Spain, in that division of Andalusia denominated the i 'kingdom of Seville. It is situated on the right bank of the river Xenil, which is here crossed by a neat bridge of modern erection. The surrounding country suffers much from a scarcity of water; but when the summer happens to be rainy, it is abundantly productive in grain of every kind, and in wine, and feeds considerable herds of cattle. It was a considerable city when the Romans ruled the peninsula, and was then called Astigi. Many inscriptions of ancient date are found in the city and its vicinity. It contains six churches, sixteen monasteries, fifteen hospitals, 6000 houses, and 28,176 inhabitants. There are some tanneries here, and a trade in leather is carried on. Cotton is grown in the surrounding country. It is thirty miles from Cordoba. Long. 4. 34. 19. W. Lat. 37. 31. 51. N.
