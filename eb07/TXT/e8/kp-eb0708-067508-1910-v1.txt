ELY, a city of Cambridgeshire, the chief place of a division of that county distinguished as the Isle of Ely, having a distinct jurisdiction, the chief justice and other magistrates of which arc nominated by the bishop. The city, though elevated somewhat above the surrounding country, is considered as unhealthy, from the marshy soil which surrounds it. It is not a well-built place, and consists chicfly of one street. The cathedral is an object of attraction as the work of several ages, displaying a mixture of the Anglo-Norman and English styles of architecture. It is upwards of 400 fect in length, and has a tower at the west end 270 feet in height. There are, besides, two parish churches. The bishopric is one of the most valuable in England, both on account of its income and its patronage. It is the only city which sends no members to the House of Commons. The land around it is highly fertile; much of it is appropriated by market-gardeners, and supplies the neighbourhood as far as Cambridge with culinary vegetables. The market is held on Saturday. It is sixty-six miles from London, and fourteen from Cambridge. The population amounted in 1801 to 3713, in 1811 to 4249, in 1821 to 5079, and in 1831 to 6189.
