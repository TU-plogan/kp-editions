ELORA, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Aurungabad, near the city of Dowletabad. In a mountain near this town there are some remarkable excavations, containing mythological symbols of the Hindu worship, and temples ornamented with representations and statues of many of the deities worshipped by the Hindus. The principal figures are those of Indra, the god of the firmament, and his consort Indranee. Besides these, there are some figures of the deities adored by the sectaries of Boodh and Parisinath; but all of them have been forsaken by the priests. The temples here are said to have been built by the rajah Edoo of Ellichpoor, who was cured of some cutaneous disorders by a spring near the place, and who in gratitude gave orders for the construction of the temple, which measures 138 feet in front, and in the interior extends 247 feet in length by 150 feet in breadth, and is in some places 100 feet high. The sixth volume of the Asiatic Researches contains a minute account of these curious antiquities. Long. 76. E. Lat. 19. 56. N.
