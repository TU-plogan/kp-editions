ELAM, in Ancient Geography, a country frequently mentioned in Scripture, and situated to the south-east of Shinar. In the time of Daniel (viii. 2) Susiana seems to have been part of that country; and before the captivity it does not appear that the Jews recognised Persia by any other name. Elymae and Elymais are frequently mentioned by the ancients. Ptolemy, although he makes Elymais a province of Media, yet places the Elymae in Susiana, and near to the sea; but Stephanus supposes it to have been part of Assyria, and Pliny and Josephus more properly part of Persia, whose inhabitants, we are informed by the latter, were descendants of the Elamites. The best commentators agree that the Elamites were sprung from Elam the son of Shem. It is likewise allowed that the most ancient amongst the inspired writers constantly allude to Persia when they speak of Elam and the kingdom of Elam.
