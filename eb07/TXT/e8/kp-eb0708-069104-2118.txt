EMMANUEL, or Immanuel, a Hebrew word, which signifies “God with us.” Isaiah (vii. 14), in that celebrated prophecy in which he declares to Ahaz the birth of the Messiah, who was to be born of a virgin, says, this child shall be called, and really be, Emmanuel, that is, God with us. The same prophet (viii. 8) repeats the same thing, whilst speaking of the enemy’s army, which, like a torrent, was to overspread Judea. “The stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, 0 Emmanuel.” The evangelist Matthew (i. 23) informs us, that this prophecy was accomplished in the birth of Christ, born of the virgin Mary; in whom the two natures, divine and human, were united, and so in this sense he was really Emmanuel, or God with us.
