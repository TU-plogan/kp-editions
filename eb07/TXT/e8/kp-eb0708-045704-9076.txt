EGNATIA, or Gnatia, a city of Peucetia, a province of Apulia, situated on the coast, the inhabitants of which are ridiculed by Horace for exciting the wonder of the ignorant multitude by burning incense on an altar without the process of ignition. Pliny, with the utmost gravity, makes the prodigy still more surprising, by stating that this sacred stone possessed the power of setting fire to any species of wood by mere juxtaposition (ii. 107). Attempts of this kind to impose on the credulity of a superstitious people were by no means uncommon amongst the ancients; and this trick, with some slight variations, was practised by the priests in very different parts of the world. Aristotle mentions a stone in Thrace from which, on being moistened with water, flames issued forth; and, according to Pliny, the same thing occurred in the country of the primitive Sabines. In Lydia, Pausanias was witness to a miracle of a somewhat similar nature. There was a small chapel set apart for this particular purpose; on entering he found the altar covered with ashes of a peculiar colour, and one of the magi having made his appearance, placed dry wood upon it, and his tiara on his head. He then repeated a few prayers, when a beautiful and brilliant flame issued from the altar without the application of fire. This city gave name to the Via Egnatia, which passed from Ðrundusium through Egnatia to Canusium. Its ruins are found at the Torre d’Agnazzo, where the inhabitants still pretend to show the temple alluded to by Horace.
