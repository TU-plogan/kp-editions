ECATOMBAeON, Exaroµĉa/w, in Chronology, the first month of the Athenian year. It consisted of thirty days, and began on the first new moon after the summer solstice, and consequently answered to the latter part of our June and beginning of July. The Boeotians called it Hippodromus, and the Macedonians Lous. The word is a derivation from the Greek ⅞xαroμC<ι, a hecatomb, because of the number of hecatombs sacrificed in it.
