ELPHINSTONE, William, a Scotish prelate and statesman of considerable eminence, was born at Glasgow in the year 1431. At the university of this city he received his education, and in the learning which distinguished the period he made extraordinary proficiency. He afterwards went to France, to make himself master of the civil and canon law in the university of Paris, where in due time he became a professor, and for the space of six years acquired reputation in the discharge of his duty. On his return to Scotland he entered into holy orders, was soon appointed official of Glasgow, and afterwards of St Andrews. He was admitted a member of the king’s council; and on a misunderstanding taking place between James III. of Scotland and Louis XI. of France, his powerful mediation at the latter court, in conjunction with the Bishop of Dunkeld and the Earl of Buchan, effected an amicable reconciliation. As Elphinstone on this occasion displayed much prudence and eloquence, the king was so grateful for his meritorious services that he rewarded him with the see of Ross, from which he was translated to that of Aberdeen about the year 1484. He was also appointed to the high office of chancellor of the kingdom, which he managed with so much moderation and equity that all parties esteemed and admired him. When the civil wars broke out between James and the discor tented nobility, Bishop Elphinstone appears to have declined all interference with public affairs of a political nature, and to have confined himself to the discharge of his episcopal duties. But when James IV. ascended the throne, his abilities as a statesman were again called forth, and he was chosen ambassador to the Emperor Maximilian, in order to ncgociate a marriage between his royal master and the emperor’s daughter; but she had been previously promised to another. Yet the bishop’s mission was not without its salutary effects, as he was the mean of terminating an enmity which had long existed between the Dutch and Scots. This he conducted in such a masterly manner, that James never undertook any thing of importance without first procuring the sanction of his approbation. He was equally the zealous patron of learning; and it is generally believed that the establishment of a university at Aberdeen was entirely owing to his influence with the [7:8:675]pope, from whom he obtained a bull for that purpose; and by his exertions was King’s College undertaken and completed. Having bequeathed a large sum of money for its support, he terminated his mortal career in 1514. Although he had attained the age of about eighty-three, his constitutional vigour was very little impaired, and all the faculties of bis mind were in full force; but the calamity which the nation sustained at Floddon-field had broken his heart. He wrote a history of his native country, which is among the manuscripts of Sir Thomas Fairfax, in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
