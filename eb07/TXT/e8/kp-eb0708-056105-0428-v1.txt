EICHSTEDT, a bailiwick of the circle of the Regen, in the kingdom of Bavaria. It was formerly under the dominion of the Duke of Leuchtenberg, but has been mediatised. It extends over 470 square miles, and comprehends four cities, nine market-towns, a hundred and eleven villages, and seventy hamlets, with 45,256 inhabitants. It is a well-watered and well-cultivated district. The mountains contain iron, slates, and marble.
