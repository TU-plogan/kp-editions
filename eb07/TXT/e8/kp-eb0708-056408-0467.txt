ELECTION, the choice that is made of any person or thing by which he or it is preferred to any other. There seems this difference, however, between choice and election, that election has usually a regard to a company or community which makes the choice; whereas choice is seldom used but when a single person makes it.

Election, in British polity, is the peopleâ€™s choice of their representatives in parliament. (See Parliament.) Election is also the state of a person who is left to his own free will, to take or do just what he pleases.

Election, in Theology, signifies the choice which God, of his good pleasure, makes of angels or men, as the objects of mercy and grace.

The election of the Jews was the choice God made of that people to be more immediately attached to his worship and service, and for the Messiah to be born of them. And thus particular nations were elected to the participation of the outward blessings of Christianity.

Election also, in the language of some divines, signifies a predestination to grace and glory, and sometimes to glory only. And it has been enjoined as an article of faith, that predestination to grace is gratuitous; gratia, quia gratis data. But the divines are much divided as to the point, whether election to glory be gratuitous, or whether it supposes obedience and good works; that is, whether it be before or after the provision of our obedience.
