EMOLUMENT is properly applied to the profits arising daily from an office or employment. The word is formed from the Latin emolumentum, which, according to some, primarily signifies the profits redounding to the miller from his mill. The patent, or other instrument, by which a person is preferred to an office, gives him a right to enjoy all the duties, honours, profits, and emoluments belonging thereto. Emolument is also used, with somewhat greater latitude, to signify profit or advantage in general.
