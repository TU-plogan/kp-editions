ELISION, in Grammar, the cutting off or suppressing a vowel at the end of a word, for the sake of sound or measure, the next word beginning with a vowel. Elisions are pretty frequently met with in English poetry, but oftener in the Latin, French, Italian, and other languages. They consist chiefly in the suppression of the a, e, and i, though an elision suppresses any of the other vowels.
