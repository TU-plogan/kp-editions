ENAMEL, in general, is a vitrified matter, betwixt the parts of which is dispersed some unvitrified matter; and hence enamel ought to have all the properties of glass except transparency.

Enamels have for their basis a pure crystal glass or frit, ground up with a fine calx of lead and tin prepared for the purpose, with the addition usually of white salt of tartar. These ingredients baked together are the matter of all enamels, which are made by adding colours to this matter, and melting or incorporating them together in a furnace.

For white enamel, Neri (De Arte Vitriar.) directs only manganese to be added to the matter which constitutes the basis; for azure, zaffer mixed with calx of brass; for green, calx of brass with scales of iron, or with crocus martis; for black, zaffer with manganese or with crocus martis, or manganese with tartar; for red, manganese, or calx of copper and red tartar; for purple, manganese with calx of brass; for yellow, tartar and manganese; and foi violet-coloured enamel, manganese with thrice-calcined brass.

In making these enamels, the following general cautions are necessary to be observed: 1. That the pots must be glazed with white glass, and must be such as will bear the fire. 2. The matter of enamels must be very nicely mixed with the colours. 3. When the enamel is good, and the colour well incorporated, it must be taken from the fire with a pair of tongs. 4. The general way of making the coloured enamel is this: Powder, sift, and grind all the colours very nicely, and first mix them with one another, and then with the common matter of enamels; next set them in pots in a furnace, and when they are well mixed and incorporated, cast them into water; when dry, set them in a furnace again to melt; and when melted, take a proof of the enamel. If too deep coloured, add more of the common matter of enamels; and if too pale, add more of the colours.

Enamels are used either in counterfeiting or imitating precious stones, and in painting in enamel; or by enamellers, jewellers, and goldsmiths, in gold, silver, and other metals. Tire first two kinds are usually prepared by the workmen themselves who are employed in these arts; that used by jewellers and others is brought chiefly from Venice or Holland, in little cakes of different sizes, commonly about four inches diameter, having the mark of the maker struck upon it with a puncheon.
