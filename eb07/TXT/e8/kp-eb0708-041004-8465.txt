ECTHESIS, in Ecclesiastical History, a confession of faith, in the form of an edict, published in the year 639 by the Emperor Heraclius, with a view to allay the troubles occasioned by the Eutychian heresy in the eastern church. However, the same prince revoked it, on being informed that Pope Severinus had condemned it, as favouring the Monothelites; declaring at the same time that Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople, was its author.
