ENCYCLOPAEDIA, a term nearly synonymous with Cyclopaedia, but adopted in preference to it in denominating the present work, as being more definite and of better authority. According to the observation of that learned printer Mr Bowyer, the preposition en makes the meaning of the word more precise. For Cyclopaedia ma; denote “the instruction of a circle,” as Cyrapaedia is “the instruction of Cyrus,” whereas in ENcyclopaedia the preposition determines the word to be from the dativ< of cyclus, “instruction iNacircle.” And Vossius, in his bool De Vitiis Sermonis, has observed, “that Cyclopaedia is usee by some authors, but Encyclopaedia by the best.” Some •account of the history and merits of the different Ency clopaedias which have appeared will be found in the Ge neral Preface to this work.
