EDOM, or Idumaea, in √4ncren∕ Geography, a district of Arabia Petraea. A great part also of the south of Judaea was called Idumaea, because it was occupied by the ldu-means, upon the Jewish captivity, as far as Hebron. But the proper Edom or Idumaea appears not to have been very extensive, from the march of the Israelites, in which they compassed it on the south-eastward, till they came to the country of the Moabites. Within this compass lies Mount Hor, where Aaron died, and marching from which the Israelites fought with King Arad the Canaanite, who came down the wilderness against them. This was the extent of the ldumaa Propria to the south of the Dead Sea; but in Solomon’s time it extended to the Red Sea. (1 Kings, ix. 26.)
