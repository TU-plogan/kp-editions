ELEUTHERIA, a festival celebrated at Plataea, in honour of Jupiter Eleutherizzs, or “the assertor of liberty,” by delegates from almost all the cities of Greece. Its institution originated thus: After the victory which the Grecians under Pausanias obtained over Mardonius the Persian general, in the country of Plataea, an altar and statue were erected to Jupiter Eleutherius, who had freed the Greeks from the tyranny of the barbarians. It was further agreed upon, ih a general assembly, by the advice of Aristides the Athenian, that deputies should be sent every fifth year from the different cities of Greece, to celebrate Eleutheria, or festivals of liberty. The Plataeans celebrated also an annual festival in memory of those who had lost their lives in that famous battle. It was celebrated thus: At break of day a procession moved forward, headed by a trumpeter, who sounded a signal for battle; and after him followed chariots loaded with myrrh, garlands, a black bull, and certain free young men, no signs of servility being permitted to appear during the solemnity, because they in whose honour the festival was instituted had died in the defence of their country. They carried libations of wine and milk in large-eared vessels, with jars of oil and precious ointments; and the rear was brought up by the chief magistrate, who, although not permitted at other times to touch iron, or wear garments of any colour but white, yet on this occasion appeared clad in purple, and taking a water-pot out of the city chamber, proceeded through the middle of the town towards the sepulchres, with a sword in his hand. There he drew water from a neighbouring spring, and washed and anointed the monuments; after which he sacrificed a bull upon a pile of wood, invoking Jupiter and Mercury, and inviting to the entertainment the souls of those happy heroes who had perished on the plains of Plataea. After this he filled a bowl with wine, saying, I drink to those who lost their lives in the defence of the liberties of Greece. There was also a festival of the same name observed by the Samians in honour of the god of love. Slaves, also, when they obtained their liberty, kept a holiday, which they called Eleutheria.

ĽLEUTHEROLACONES, or Independent Laconians, a name given to the twenty-four confederate towns of Laconia, the independence of which was confirmed by a decree of Augustus. At a much earlier date, when the power of Sparta had been broken and her freedom annihilated by the tyrant Nabis, Titus Quintius had detached the hamlets from all connection with Sparta, and placed them under the protection of the Achaean league. Augustus allowed these towns to be governed by their own laws, and to form a small distinct confederation. Of these twenty-four towns only eighteen are mentioned by Pausanias (iii. p. 21), probably because the others had gradually become depopulated.
