ECATESIA, Exarem, in Antiquity, an anniversary solemnity, observed by the Stratonicensians, in honour of Hecate. The Athenians likewise had a public entertainment or supper every new moon, in honour of the same goddess. The supper was provided at the charge of the more affluent; and it was no sooner brought to the accustomed place than the poor people carried all off, giving out that Hecate had devoured it. For the rest of the ceremonies observed on this occasion, see Potter, Arch. Groec. lib. ii. cap. 20.
