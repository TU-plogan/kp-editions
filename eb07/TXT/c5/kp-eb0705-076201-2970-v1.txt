C, THE third letter, and second consonant, of the alphabet, is pronounced like k before the vowels a, o, and u, and like s before e, i, and y. C is formed, according to Scaliger, from the κ of the Greeks, by retrenching the stem or upright line; though others derive it from the ב of the Hebrews, which has in effect the same form; only, that as the Hebrews read towards the left, and the Latins and other western nations towards the right, each, turned the letter their own way. However, the C not being the same as to sound with the Hebrew caph, ב, and it being certain that the Romans did not borrow their letters immediately from the Hebrews or other orientals, but from the Greeks, the derivation from the Greek κ is upon the whole the more probable. Indeed Montfaucon, in his Paloeographia, gives some forms of the Greek κ which approach very near to that of our C; and Suidas calls the C the Roman kappa. Before the first Punic war C held the place which is now occupied by G, as appears from the Duilian Column, where we meet with acnam for agnam, lccionern for legionem, and exfocioηt for effugiunt. The second sound of C resembles that of the Greek 2; and many instances occur of ancient inscriptions, in which Σ has the same form with’ our C. Grammarians are pretty generally agreed that the Romans pronounced their Q like our C, and their C like our K. Mabillon informs us that Charles the Great was the first who wrote his name with a C; whereas all his predecessors of the same name wrote it with a K; and the same difference is observable in their coins. As an abbreviature, C stands for Caius, Carolus, Caesar, condemno, &c., and CC represent consulibus. As a numeral, C signifies 100, CC 200, and so on. C, in Music, placed after the cleff, intimates that the music is in common time, which is either quick or slow as it is joined with allegro or adagio; but if alone, it is usually adagio. If the C be crossed or turned, the first, requires the air to be played quick, and the last very quick.
