CALABRIA Citeriore, one of the southern provinces into which the kingdom of Naples, in Italy, is divided. It is bounded on the south by Calabria Ulteriore, on the east by the Ionic Sea, on the north by Basilicata, and on the west by the Mediterranean. Its extent is 3652 square miles, or 2,337,280 English acres. The Appenines are continued into this province, but are inferior to the height they attain in Abruzzo. In the south the mountains of Silla extend over more than 220 square miles. The province is watered by numberless small streams, whose course is short, and commonly rapid. The climate is mild, and, except on the mountains, the snow never remains. The productive power of the soil is very various, but it yields sufficient corn for the inhabitants. The products are wheat, barley, beans, maize, rice, flax, and hemp; besides cotton, tobacco, saffron, liquorice, and wine of great strength. Oil and silk are also produced. The fishery is an important means of affording employment to numerous persons, who catch large quantities of the tunny, and of sardinias. There are scarcely any roads through the province, and of the few, some are nearly impassable; consequently there is little internal traffic. What little external commerce exists, centres in the capital Cosenza. The number of inhabitants, by a census of 1793, appeared to be 345,532; but in 1807, by the product of a tax on fire-places, the population was estimated at 374,000. It is divided into four districts, viz. Cösenza, Rossano, Amantea, and Castrovillari.

Calabria Ulteriore, a province of the Neapolitan kingdom of Italy. It is usually divided into two parts, numbered one and two, but these are here described together. The province is a peninsula, bearing a resemblance to the foot of the boot to which the map of Italy has been likened. It is surrounded by the sea, except on the north, where it is bounded by Calabria Citeriore. The extent is 3388 square miles, or 2,178,320 English acres.

Although the continuation of the ridge of the Appenines is obvious throughout the whole province, yet their elevation generally decreases towards the south. The soil is generally fertile; and the heat of the climate makes it a kind of forcing house as compared with the other parts of Italy. Snow and ice are scarcely known; and the aloe and date trees come to perfection in the open air. In summer, however, the whole province is burnt up, and the sirocco extends the scorching breath of Africa over all the land. The products are wheat, maize, barley, beans, rice, cotton, buck-wheat, sugar-canes, tobacco, licorice, and melons, with other fruits. Besides these, much silk of an excellent quality is raised; and pitch, tar, and turpentine, are made from the trees. The sheep and other cattle are by no means so abundant as in the other Calabria. There are marks of gold, silver, lead, and copper, but no mines are worked of any of these metals. Manufactures are at a low ebb, and confined to silk and wool. There are a few coasting vessels, and some fishing vessels belonging to the Calabrese, but there is no foreign trade. The whole population of the province amounts to about 450,000 individuals.
