CALASIO, Marius, a Franciscan, and professor of the Hebrew language at Rome, of whom there is very little to be said, but that he published there, in the year 1621, a concordance of the bible, which consisted of four great volumes in folio. This work has been highly approved and commended both by Protestants and Catholics, and is indeed a most admirable work; for, besides the Hebrew words of the bible, which compose the body of the book, with the Latin version over against them, there are in the margin the differences between the Septuagint version and the Vulgate; so that at one view may be seen wherein the three bibles agree, and wherein they differ. Moreover, at the beginning of every article there is a kind of dictionary, which gives the signification of each Hebrew word; affords an opportunity of comparing it with other oriental languages, viz. with the Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldee; and is extremely useful for determining more exactly the true meaning of the Hebrew words.
