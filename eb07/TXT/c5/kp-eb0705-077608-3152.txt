It is pleasantly situated at the end of a large bay on the northern shore of the Black Sea, and is defended by two forts. The harbour, although capacious, is shallow, and little sheltered from the south-east winds. This town has repeatedly changed masters, but it was finally incorporated with the Russian empire in 1783. Its trade consists principally in stuffs of Turkish manufacture, and in wine, rice, and coffee. Long. 35. 12. 45. E. Lat. 45. 6. 30. N.
