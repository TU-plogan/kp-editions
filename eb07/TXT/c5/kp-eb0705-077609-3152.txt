CAFFILA, a company of merchants or travellers, who join together in order to go with more security through various countries on the continent of the East Indies, and also Africa.

The caffila differs from a caravan, at least in Persia; for the caffila properly belongs to some sovereign, or to some powerful company in Europe; whereas a earavan is a company of particular merchants, each trading upon his own account. There arc also such caffilas which cross some parts of the deserts of Africa, particularly that called the Sahara.
