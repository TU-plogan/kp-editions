CAIUS, Kaye, or Keye, Dr John, the founder of Caius College in Cambridge, was born at Norwich in 1510. He was admitted very young a student in Gonville Hall in the above-mentioned university; and at the age of twenty-one translated from Greek into Latin some pieces of divinity, and into English Erasmus’s paraphrase on Jude, and other works. From these his juvenile labours, it seems probable that he first intended to prosecute the study of divinity. But be this as it may, he travelled into Italy, and at Padua studied physic under the celebrated Montanus. In that university he continued some time, where we are told he read Greek lectures with great applause. In 1543 he travelled through part of Italy, Germany, and France; and returning to England, commenced doctor of physic at Cambridge. He practised first at Shrewsbury, and afterwards at Norwich; but removing to London in 1547, he was admitted fellow of the college of physicians, of which he was several years president. In 1557, being then physician to Queen Mary, and in great favour, he obtained a license to advance Gonville-hall, where he had been educated, into a college, which he endowed with several considerable estates, adding an entire new square at the expense or L.1834. Of this college he accepted the mastership, which he held till within a short period of his death. He was physician to Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth. Towards the latter end of his life he retired to his own college at Cambridge, where having resigned the mastership to Dr Legge of Norwich, he spent the remainder of his life as a fellow commoner. He died in July 1573, aged sixty-three, and was buried in the chapel of his own college. Dr Caius was a learned, active, and benevolent man. In 1557 he erected a monument in St Paul’s, to the memory of the famous Linacre. In 1563 he obtained a grant for the college of physicians to take the bodies of two malefactors annually for dissection; and he was the inventor of the insignia which distinguish the president from the rest of the fellows. He wrote, 1. Annals of the College from 1555 to 1572. 2. Translation of several of Galen’s works, printed at different times abroad. 3. Hippocrates de Medicamentis ; first discovered and published by our author; also De Patione Victus, Lov. 1556, 8vo. 4. De Medendi Methodo, Basel, 1554; Lond. 1556, 8vo. 5. Account of the Sweating Sickness in England, Lond. 1556, 1721. It is entitled De Ephemera Britannica. 6. History of the University of Cambridge, Lond. 1568, 8vo; 1574, 4to, in Latin. 7. De Thermis Britannicis ; but it is doubtful whether this work was ever printed. 8. Of some Rare Plants and Animals, Lond. 1570. 9. De Canibus Britannicis, 1570, 1729. 10. De Pronumciatione Groecoeet Latinae Linguoe, Lond. 1574. 11. De Libris propriis, Lond. 1570. Besides many other works which never were printed.
