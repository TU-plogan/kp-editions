CAELIUS, Aureli anus,. an ancient physician, and the only one of the sect of the Methodists of whom we have any remains. He was a native of Sicca, a town of Numidia; but in what age he flourished cannot be. determined. It is probable, however, that he lived before Galen; since, though he carefully mentions all the physicians before him, [7:5:771]he takes no notice of Galen. He had read over very diligently the ancient physicians of all sects; and we are indebted to him for the knowledge of many dogmas which are not to be found but in his books De celcribus et tardis Passionibus. He wrote, as he himself tells us, several other works; but they have all perished.
