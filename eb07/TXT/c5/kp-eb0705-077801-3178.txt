CAIMACAN, or Kaimacam, in Turkish affairs, a dignity of the Ottoman empire, answering to lieutenant, or rather deputy, amongst us. There are usually two caimacans, one residing at Constantinople as governor of the capital, and the other attending the grand vizir in quality of lieutenant, secretary of state, and first minister of his council, and giving audience to ambassadors. Sometimes there is a third caimacan, who attends the sultan, whom he acquaints with any public disturbances, and receives his orders concerning them.
