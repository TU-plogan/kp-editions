CADMUS, in fabulous history, king of Thebes, the son of Agenor, king of Phoenicia, and the brother of Phoenix, Cilix, and Europa. According to tradition, he carried into Greece the sixteen simple letters of the Greek alphabet; and there built Thebes, in Boeotia. The poets say that he left his native country in search of his sister Europa, whom Jupiter had carried away in the form of a bull; and that, inquiring of the Delphic oracle for a settlement, he was answered, that he should follow the direction of a cow, and build a city where she lay down. Having arrived among the Phocians, he was met by a cow, which conducted him through Boeotia to the place where Thebes was afterwards built. But when he was about to sacrifice his guide to Pallas, he sent two of his company to the fountain Dirce for water, where they were devoured by a serpent or dragon; upon which Cadmus slew the monster, and afterwards, by the advice of Pallas, sowed his teeth, when there sprung up a number of armed soldiers, who prepared to revenge the death of the serpent; but on his casting a stone among these upstart warriors, they turned their weapons against each other with such animosity, that only five survived the combat, and this remnant assisted Cadmus in founding his new city. Afterwards, to recompense his labours, the gods gave him Harmonia, or Harmione, the daughter of Mars and Venus; and honoured his nuptials with presents, and peculiar marks of favour. But at length resigning Thebes to Pentheus, Cadmus and Harmione went to govern the Ecclellenses; and when they grew old they were transformed into serpents, or, as others say, sent to the Elysian fields in a chariot drawn by serpents.

Cadmus of Miletus, a celebrated Greek historian, was, according to Pliny, the first of the Greeks who wrote history in prose. He flourished about 550 before Christ.
