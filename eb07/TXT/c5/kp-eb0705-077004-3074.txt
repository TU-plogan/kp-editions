CADRITES, a sort of Mahommedan friars, who once a week spend a great part of the night in turning round, holding each otherâ€™s hands, and repeating incessantly the word liai, which signifies living, and is one of the attributes of God; during which one of them plays on a flute. They never cut their hair, nor cover their heads, and always go barefooted; they have also liberty to quit their convent when they please, and to marry.
