CADENCE, or Repose, in Music (from the Latin cadere, to fall or descend), the termination of an harmonical phrase on a repose, or on a perfect chord.

Cadence, in Reading, is a falling of the voice below the key-note at the close of every period. In reading, whether prose or verse, a certain tone is assumed, which is called the hey-note ; and in this tone the bulk of the words are sounded; but this note is generally lowered towards the close of every sentence.
