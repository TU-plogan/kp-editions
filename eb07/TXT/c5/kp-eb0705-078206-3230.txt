CAJUPUT OIL, a volatile oil obtained by distillation from a species of melaleuca, which has lately obtained the name of melaleuca cajuputi; cajuputi being its Malay name. This tree, or rather shrub, is a natlve of the island of Amboyna, and of the southern part of Borneo. Cajuput oil is prepared from the leaves which are collected in a hot dry day, macerated in water, and distilled after fermenting for a night. Five bags of the dried leaves, it is said, are required to produce one ounce of the oil, which when distilled is limpid; but being generally transported to Europe in copper vessels, attains a greenish colour. When imported in glass bottles, it is perfectly pellucid. As the real cajuput oil is high priced, it is much exposed to adulteration.

Cajuput oil should be free from colour, or of a bluish green: it is extremely pungent to the taste, and has the odour of a mixture of turpentine and camphor. When dropped in water, it diffuses itself over its surface, and then entirely evaporates. It should burn without leaving any residuum. It is very soluble in alcohol, and sparingly so in water. Like other volatile oils, the cajuput is a powerful stimulant, and is used medicinally where such medicines are required. Some practitioners have given it a high character as a remedy for the pestilence which is at present ravaging Europe. It does not appear, however, to have any claim as a specific in the treatment of cholera. The dose taken internally is about five drops. It is used externally .as a rubifacient, and is also resorted too ccasion-ally with advantage in toothach.
