CADUTINADA, a small district of Hindustan, in the province of Malabar. It is well cultivated, and is naturally a rich country, containing a large proportion of rice ground. But the grain which it produces is scarcely adequate to the support of its inhabitants; and a regular importation takes place from the southern parts of Malalaya, and from Mangalore. The plantations are numerous. The higher parts of the hills are overgrown with wood, which the Nairs formerly encouraged, as it afforded them protection against invaders. The female Nairs in this country, when children, go through the ceremony of marriage, which is, however, merely nominal, as the man and the wife never cohabit. When the girl attains to maturity, she is taken to live in the house of some other Nair. In 1761 a treaty was concluded by the Bombay government with the chief of this country, for the purchase of pepper. . .
