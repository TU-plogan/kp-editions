CAJETAN, Cardinal, was born at Cajeta, in the kingdom of Naples, in the year 1469. His proper name was Thomas de Vio, but he adopted that of Cajetan from the _place of his nativity. He defended the authority of the pope, which had suffered greatly at the council of Nice, in a work entitled Of the Power of the Pope ; and for this work he obtained the bishopric of Cajeta. He was afterwards raised to the archiépiscopal see of Palermo, and in 1517 was made a cardinal by Pope Leo X. The year after, he was sent as legate into Germany, to quiet the commotions raised against indulgences by Martin Luther; but Luther, under protection of Frederic elector of Saxony, set him at defiance; for though he obeyed the cardinal’s summons in repairing to Augsburg, yet he rendered all his proceedings ineffectual. Cajetan was employed in several other négociations and transactions, being as ready in business as in letters. He died in 1534. He wrote commentaries upon Aristotle’s philosophy, and upon Thomas Aquinas’s theology; and made a free translation of the Old and New Testaments.
