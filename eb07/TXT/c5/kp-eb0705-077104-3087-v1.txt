CAERMARTHEN, the capital town of the county of that name, in South Wales. It is situated in a beautiful valley on the river Towy, which is navigable to it. It is an ancient place, was oncc fortified, and is the best built town in the principality. In the reign of James I. it was incorporated as a town and county of itself. Near to it are some iron and tin works; but the commerce is inconsiderable for the population, who, in some measure, derive their occupation from its being a kind of capital for Wales, as relates to the Stannery courts and the great sessions. There are markets on Wednesday and Saturday. It confers the title of Marquis on the Huke of Leeds. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 7275, in 1821 to 8906, and in 1831 to 9995.
