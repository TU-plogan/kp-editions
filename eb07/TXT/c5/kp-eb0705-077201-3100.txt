CAERNARVON, the capital of the county of that name in South Wales. It is a very ancient town; and the castle, in which the first prince of Wales was born, is in better preservation than any other of the ancient edifices of that kind and age in the kingdom. The town, which is on the entrance of the Menai Strait, is finely situated, commanding a view of Anglesey and the mountain Snowdon. The principal trade to its port is for slate, which is found in abundance near it. A market is held on Saturday, and is well attended. The population amounted in 1811 to 4595, in 1821 to 5788, and in 1831 to 7642.
