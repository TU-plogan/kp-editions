CALAMY, Edmund, grandson to the preceding (by his eldest son, Mr Edmund Calamy, who was ejected from the living of Moxton in Essex, on St Bartholomew’s day 1662), was born in London on the 5th April 1671. After having learned the languages, and gone through a course of natural philosophy and logic at a private academy in England, he studied philosophy and civil law at the university of Utrecht, and attended the lectures of the learned Graevius. Whilst he resided there, an offer of a professor’s chair in the university of Edinburgh was made him

; by Mr Carstairs, principal of that university, sent over on . purpose to find a person properly qualified for such an I office. This he declined, and returned to England in 1691, . bringing with him letters from Graevius to Dr Pococke,! canon of Christ-church, and regius professor of Hebrew,

• and to Dr Bernard, Savilian professor of astronomy, who: obtained leave for him to prosecute his studies in the Bodleian Library. Having resolved to make divinity his prin-

, cipal study, he entered into an examination of the contro- l versy between the conformists and nonconformists, which determined him to join the latter, and, coming to London in 1692, he was unanimously chosen assistant to Mr Matthew Sylvester at Blackfriars; and in 1694 he was ordain- . ed at Mr Annesley’s meeting-house in Little St Helena, and soon afterwards was invited to become assistant to Mr Daniel Williams in Hand-Alley. In 1702 he was chosen one of the lecturers in Salters Hall; and in 1703 he suc-

• ceeded Mr Vincent Alsop as pastor of a great congregation in Westminster. He drew up the table of contents to Mr Baxter’s History of his Life and Tinies, which was sent to the press in 1696; made some remarks on the work itself, and added to it an index; and, reflecting on the usefulness of the book, he saw the expediency of continuing it, as Mr Baxter’s history came no lower than the year 1684. Accordingly he composed an abridgment of it, with an account of many other ministers who were ejected after the restoration of Charles II.; their apology, containing the grounds of their nonconformity and practice as to stated and occasional communion with the church of England; and a continuation of their history until the year 1691. This work was published in 1702. He afterwards published a moderate defence of nonconformity, in three tracts, in answer to some tracts of Dr Hoadley. In 1709 Mr Calamy made a tour to Scotland, and had the degree of doctor of divinity conferred on him by the universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Glasgow. In 1713 he published a second edition of his Abridgment of Mr Baxter’s History of his Life and Times; in which, among various additions, there is a continuation of the history through King W’illiam’s reign and Queen Anne’s, down to the passing of the occasional bill; and in the close is subjoined the reformed liturgy, which was drawn up and presented to the bishops in 1661, “that the world may judge,” as he says in his preface, “how fairly the ejected ministers have been often represented as irreconcilable enemies to all liturgies.” In 1718 he wrote a vindication of his grandfather, and several other persons, against certain reflections cast upon them by Mr Archdeacon Echard in his History of England; and in 1728 appeared his continuation of the account of the ministers, lecturers, masters, and fellows of colleges, and schoolmasters, who were ejected, after the Restoration in 1660, by or before the act of uniformity. He died on the 3d of June 1732, greatly regretted, not only by the dissenters, but also by the moderate members of the established church, both clergy and laity, with many of whom he lived in great intimacy. Besides the pieces already mentioned, he published a great many sermons on several subjects and occasions. Fie was twice married, and had thirteen children.
