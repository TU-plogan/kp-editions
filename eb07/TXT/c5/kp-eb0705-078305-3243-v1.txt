CALAIS, a city of the arrondissement of Boulogne, and department of Calais, in France. It is a place of importance from being the nearest point to England, and the landing place of those who pass from thence to the Continent. The harbour, which iş dry at low water, is only fit for the reception of small vessels. It is fortified strongly both on the land and sea sides. The walls form a pleasing, and indeed the only promenade. It is well built, with a good square, and with streets leading from it in straight lines. It contains 900 houses, besides barracks; and the inhabitants amount to 8500. The place suffers from want of good water.

Calais, Pas de, one of the departments of France, on the sea coast. It is bounded on the north by the British Channel, on the north-east by the department of the north, on the south by that of the Somme, and on the west by the Channel. It extends over 2596 square miles, and is divided into six arrondissements, and these are subdivided into forty-three cantons and 953 communes. The population amounts to 584,650. It is generally a level district, near the sea-coast, rather marshy, but remarkable for excellent pasture and dairy land. The greater portion of the land is under the plough, and is well cultivated on the Flemish system. The department is abundantly supplied with water, which is applied both to purposes of navigation and of irrigation. With a few exceptions, it is by far the best cultivated of any part of France, and in the greater part of the arrondissements of Arras, Bethune, and St Omer, it is scarcely possible to find a spot of land not highly productive. Green crops are abundantly raised, and the dung from the animals fed on them provides abundant manure for the corn land; while the mode of ploughing the land and furrowing it operates to prevent injury from too much rain. It is a manufacturing as well as an agricultural district. Woollen, linen, and cotton goods, hosiery, lace, leather, earthenware, beer, corn, spirits, paper, hats, and soap, are extensively produced, besides flax, hemp, and linseed oil. There are considerable fisheries on the sea-coast and in the several rivers.

Calais, St, an arrondissement in the department of the Sarthe, in France, extending over 465 square miles. It is divided into six cantons, and these again into sixty communes, containing 66,330 inhabitants. The chief place is a city of the same name, on the river Anille, in an unfruitful spot, containing 3646 inhabitants, occupied in manufacturing serges, flannels, and some kinds of linen goods.
