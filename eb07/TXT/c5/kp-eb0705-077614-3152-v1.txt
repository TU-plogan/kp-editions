It stands on the gulf of that name, and contains thirty ehurches, about 5000 houses, and 25,880 inhabitants. It is the residence of the viceroy, of an archbishop, and the place of assembling of the boards of administration and of the courts of justice. It has little commerce, which is chiefly confined to the sale of wine, corn, cheese, and especially of salt refined near it. Long. 9. 0. 25. E. Lat. 39. 15. 20. N.

Cagliari, Capo Di, one of the provinces into which the island of Sardinia is divided.

Cagliari, Paolo, called Paulo Veronese, an excellent painter, was born at Verona in the year 1532. Gabriel Cagliari, his father, was a sculptor, and Antonio Badile, his uncle, was his master in painting. He was not only esteemed - the best of all the Lombard painters, but by reason of his extensive talents in the art was peculiarly styled II Pittor felice, the happy painter; and there is scarcely a church in Venice where some of his performances are not to be seen. He died of a fever at Venice in 1588, and had a tomb and a statue of brass erected to his memory in the church of St Sebastian.
