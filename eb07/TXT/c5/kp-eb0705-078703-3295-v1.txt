CALC-SINER, or Stalactitic Carbonate of Lime. This occurs mamillated, or in long pendulous masses or tubes, commonly coating, or even entirely filling, the interior of caves. Though deposited from water loaded with particles of lime, and therefore in a constant state of formation, these stalactites (which outside are commonly of a yellowish-white colour, and present an infinity of different shapes and sizes) invariably afford when broken the most distinct cleavage. In this way the perfect rhomb, having the same angles as that of the calcareous spar, is easily produced from any portion of them. The extensive caverns of Adelsberg in Carniola derive their entire splendour from the thousands of these stalactites with which they are naturally ornamented in the shape of festoons, curtains, foliage, and whatever else a lively imagination may choose to invent out of the variety of fanciful and extraordinary forms they assume. These caverns constitute a labyrinth of many miles within the porous limestone rocks of the vicinity, and as yet but a small portion of them has been explored by man. The cave of Macallister, commonly called the Spar Cave, on Loch Sunert in the Isle of Skye, is another of the same description, though much inferior in extent and beauty to that of Adelsberg. The oriental alabaster, which is this same mineral in a massive state, was much prized by the ancients for statuary purposes.
