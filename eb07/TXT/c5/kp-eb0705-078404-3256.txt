CALAMY, Edmund, an eminent Presbyterian divine, born at London in the year 1600, and educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where his attachment to the Arminian party excluded him from a fellowship. Dr Felton, bishop of Ely, however, made him his chaplain; and in 1639 he was chosen minister of St Mary Aldermary, in the city of London. Upon the opening of the long parliament he distinguished himself in defence of the Presbyterian cause, and had a principal hand in writing the famous Smectymnus, which, he himself says, gave the first deadly blow to Episcopacy. The authors of this tract were five, the initials of whose names formed the name under which it was published, viz. Stephen Marshal, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Young, Mathew Newcomen, and William Sparstow. He was afterwards an active member in the assembly of divines, and a strenuous opposer of sectaries; and he used his utmost endeavours to prevent the violences which were committed after the king was brought from the Isle of W ight. In Cromwell’s time he lived privately, but was assiduous in promoting the king’s return; for which he was afterwards offered a bishopric, but refused it. He was ejected for nonconformity in 1662, and died of grief at the sight of the great fire of London.
