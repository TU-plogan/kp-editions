CALLAO, so called by its inhabitants, but more generally known to Europeans under the name of Campello, lies opposite to the coast of Cochin China, and about eight miles to the eastward of the mouth of a considerable river on the coast of Cochin China, upon the banks of which is situated the town of Faifoo, a place of some note, not far from the harbour of Turon. The only inhabited part of the island is on the south-west coast, upon a slip of ground rising gently to the east. This small spot, when the Chinese embassy visited the island, was beautifully laid out with neat houses, temples, clumps of trees, and small hillocks richly decorated with shrubbery. The houses, which amounted to about sixty, were very clean and decent; a few were built with stone, and covered with tiles. The depth of water in the bay and road is sufficient for ships of any burden; and there is a perfect shelter from every wind except the south-west. It is thirty miles south-east of the harbour of Turon. The extreme points of the island lie in longitude 108. 30. E. and latitude 15. 53. N.
