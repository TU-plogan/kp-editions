CLEMENS Romanus, bishop of Rome, where he is said to have been born, and to have been fellow-labourer with St Peter and St Paul. We have nothing remaining of his works that is clearly genuine, excepting one epistle, written to quiet some disturbances in the church of Corinth; which, next to holy writ, is esteemed as one of the most valuable remains of ecclesiastical antiquity.

Clemens Alexandrimιs, so called to distinguish him from the former, was an eminent father of the church, who flourished at the end of the second and beginning of the third centuries. He was the scholar of Pantaenus, and the instructor of Origen. A passage in the Stromates of this author, if it did not furnish the key to the modern discoveries connected with the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphics, at all events showed how that key should be used. The best edition of his works is that in two volumes folio, published in 1715, by ArchbHwp Potter.
