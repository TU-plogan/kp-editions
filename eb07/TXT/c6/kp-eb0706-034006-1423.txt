CHELMSFORD, a town in the hundred of the same name, in the county of Essex. It is twenty-nine miles from London, on the junction of the rivers Cann and Chel-mer. It is well built, and situated in a fine country, but has little trade. The assizes and sessions are held here, and the jail, of modern erection, is in this town. The market is held on Friday, and is well supplied. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 4649, in 1821 to 4994, and in 1831 to 5435.
