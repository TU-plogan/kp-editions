CAPONIERE, or Capponiere, in Fortification, a covered lodgment sunk four or five feet into the ground, encompassed with a little parapet about two feet high, serving to support several planks covered with earth. The caponiere is iarge enough to contain fifteen or twenty soldiers, and is usually placed in the glacis on the extremity of the counterscarp, and in dry moats; having little embrasures for the soldiers to fire through.
