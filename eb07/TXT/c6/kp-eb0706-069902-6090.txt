CINCINNATUS, a Roman dictator, who was taken from the plough to be advanced to the dignity of consul, in which office he restored public tranquillity, and then returned to his rural employments. Being called forth a second time to become dictator, he conquered the enemies of Rome, and, refusing all rewards, retired again to his farm, after he had been dictator only sixteen days. The same circumstance occurred once more in the eightieth year of his age. He died 376 years before Christ.
