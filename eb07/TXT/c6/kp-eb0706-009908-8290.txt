CANTEMIR, Demetrius, son of a prince of Moldavia. Disappointed in not succeeding his father in that dignity, which was held under the Ottoman Porte, he went over with his army to the Czar Peter the Great, against whom he had been sent by the Grand Signior. He signalized himself in the czar’s service, and in the republic of letters by a Latin history of the origin and decline of the Ottoman empire. He died in 1723.

Ćantemir, Antiochus, esteemed the founder of the Russian poetry, was the youngest son of the preceding. Under the most ingenious professors, whom the czar had invited to Petersburg, he learned mathematics, physic, history, moral philosophy, and polite literature, without neglecting the study of the Holy Scriptures, to which he had a great inclination. Scarce had he finished his academic course, when he printed a Concordance of the Psalms in the Russian language, and was elected member of the academy. The affairs of state in which he was soon afterwards engaged did not make him neglect his literary pursuits. To render himself useful to his fellow-citizens, he composed his satires, inorder to ridicule certain prejudices which had got footing among them. When only twenty-four years of age he was nominated as minister to the court of Great Britain, and his dexterity in the management of public affairs was as much admired as his taste for the sciences. He had the same reputation in France, whither he went in 1738 in quality of minister plenipotentiary; and, soon afterwards, he was invested with the character of ambassador extraordinary. The wise and prudentmanner in which he conducted himself during the different revolutions which [7:6:100]happened in Russia during his absence, gained him the confidence and esteem of three successive princes. He died of a dropsy, at Paris, in 1744, aged forty-four. Besides the pieces already mentioned, he wrote, 1. Some Fables and Odes; 2. A translation of Horace’s Epistles into Russian verse; 3. A prose translation of Fontenelle’s Plurality of Worlds; and, 4. Algarotti’s Dialogues on Sight. The Abbe Guasco has written his life in French, and translated his satires into that language.
