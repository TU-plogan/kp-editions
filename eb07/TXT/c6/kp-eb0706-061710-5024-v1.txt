CHOIR, that part of a church or cathedral where choristers sing divine service. It is separated from the chancel, where the communion is celebrated, and also from the nave of the church, where the people are placed; and the patron is understood to be under an obligation to repair the choir of the church. In the time of Constantine the choir was separated from the nave, and in the twelfth century it was inclosed with walls; but the ancient balustrades have been since restored, with a view to the beauty of architecture.

Choir, in nunneries, is a large hall adjoining to the body of the church, but separated by a grate, where the nuns sing the office.
