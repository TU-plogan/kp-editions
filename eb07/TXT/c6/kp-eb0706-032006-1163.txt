CHAPMAN, George, born in 1557, was a man highly esteemed in his time for his dramatic and poetic works. He wrote seventeen plays, translated Homer and some other ancient poets, and was thought no mean genius. He died in 1634, and was buried in St Gilesâ€™s in the Fields, where his friend Inigo Jones erected a monument to his memory.
