CHAMBERLAIN, an officer charged with the management and direction of a chamber.

Lord Chamberlain of Great Britain, the sixth great officer of the crown, to whom belong livery and lodging in the king’s court; and there are certain fees due to him from each archbishop or bishop when they perform their homage to the king, and from all peers at their creation or when doing homage. At the coronation of every king he receives forty ells of crimson velvet for his own robes. This officer, on the coronation day, brings the king his shirt, coif, and wearing clothes; and after the king is dressed, he claims his bed, and all the furniture of his chamber, for his fees. He also carries, at the coronation, the coif, gloves, and linen, to be used by the king on that occasion; also the sword and scabbard; the gold to be offered by the king, and the royal robes and crown; he dresses and undresses the king on that day, waits on him before and after dinner, and performs various other menial offices. To this officer belongs the care of providing all things in the House of Lords in the time of parliament, as well as the government of the palace of Westminster; he likewise disposes, to what lord he pleases, of the sword of state, to be carried before the king.

Lord Chamberlain of the Household, an officer who has the superintendence and direction of all officers belonging to the king’s chambers, except the precinct of the king’s bed-chamber. Moreover he has the control and direction of the serjeants at arms, of all physicians, apothecaries, surgeons, barbers, the king’s chaplains, &c. and administers the oath to all officers above stairs.

Other chamberlains are those of the king’s court of exchequer, of North Wales, of Chester, of the city of London, &c.; in which case this officer is generally the receiver of all rents and revenues belonging to the place whereof he is chamberlain.

Chamberlain of London keeps the city money; he also presides over the affairs of masters and apprentices, and makes free of the city, &c.
