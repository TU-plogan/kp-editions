CALYCISTAe, systematic botanists, so named by Linnaeus, who have arranged all vegetables from the different species, structure, and other circumstances, of the calyx or flower-cup. The only systems of this kind are the Character Plantarum ĴVovus, a posthumous work of Mag-nolius, professor of botany at Montpelier, published in 1720; and Linnaeus’s Methodus Calycina, published in his Classes Plantarum, at Leyden, in 1738.
