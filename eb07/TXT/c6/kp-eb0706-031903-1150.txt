CHANTRY, or Chauntry, was anciently a church or chapel endowed with lands, or other yearly revenue, for the maintenance of one or more priests, daily saying or singing mass for the souls of the donors, and such others as they appointed. Hence chauntry-rents arc rents paid to the crown by the tenants or purchasers of chauntry-lands.
