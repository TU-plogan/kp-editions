CHIABRERA, Gabriel, esteemed the Pindar of Italy, was born at Savona, in the republic or state of Genoa, in 1552, and went to study at Rome. The Italian princes and Urban VIII. gave him public marks of their esteem. He wrote a great number of poems; but his lyric verses are the most admired. He died at Savona in 1638, aged eighty-six.
