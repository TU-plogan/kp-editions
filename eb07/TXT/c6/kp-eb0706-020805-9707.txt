CARVAGE (carυagium'), the same with Carrucage. Henry III. is said to have taken carvage, that is, two marks of silver for every knight’s fee, towards the marriage of his sister Isabella to the emperor. Carvage could only be imposed on tenants in capite. Carvage also denotes a privilege by which a man is exempted from the service of carrucage.
