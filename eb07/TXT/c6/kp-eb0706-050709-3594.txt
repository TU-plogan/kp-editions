CHERSO, an island in the Adriatic Sea, belonging to the Austrian Illyrian province. It is a long island, stretching from north to south about thirty-five miles. It consists of a single range of mountains, formed into a kind of natural terraces, on which vines and olive trees flourish. The other parts of the island are covered with bushes of laurel and mastic, but scarcely any large trees. There is a scarcity of spring water, and the houses are generally furnished with cisterns to contain rain water. The whole [7:6:508] island contains about 7000 inhabitants. The capital, of the same name, on the western side of the island, has a cathedral, several churches and monasteries, and in 1819 contained 3570 inhabitants.
