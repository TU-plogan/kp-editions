CAPNOMANCY, a kind of divination by means of smoke, used by the ancients in their sacrifices. The words come from κ0wr∣∕05, smoke, and μαντuα, divination. The general rule was, when the smoke was thin and light, and rose straight up, it was a good omen; if the contrary, it was a bad one. There was also another species of capnomancy, [7:6:125]consisting in the observation of the smoke rising from poppy and jasmine seed cast upon lighted coal.
