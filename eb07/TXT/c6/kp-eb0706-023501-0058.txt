CASTLEBAR, a town of Ireland, in the county of Mayo, situated near the picturesque lake of Rahinc. It is a remarkably neat place; the streets are regular, and the houses well built. The public edifices arc a linen hall, over which is an assembly room; the parish church, which has a lofty steeple; the Roman Catholic chapel; a barrack for soldiers, this being a permanent military station; a handsome court-house; and a new jail. There are here two breweries and a -tannery. The linen trade is prosperous, and the town is altogether a thriving place. The assizes are held here. It is distant 159 miles west-northwest of Dublin, and 35 north of Galway. The population amounts to 5404.
