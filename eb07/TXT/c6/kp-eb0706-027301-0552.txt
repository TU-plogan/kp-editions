CELLARIUS, Christopher, was born in 1638, at Smalcalde, in Franconia, of which town his father was minister. He was successively rector of the colleges at Weimar, Zeitz, and Mcrsburg; and the king of Prussia having in 1693 founded a university at Halle, he was prevailed on to become professor of eloquence and history there, where he composed the greater part of his works. His great application to study hastened the infirmities of old age; for it is said he was accustomed to spend whole days and nights together at his books, without any attention to his health, or even to the calls of nature. His works relate to grammar, geography, history, and the oriental languages; and the number of them is amazing. ' The principal are, 1. Historia Antiqua, Jena, 1698, 12mo; 2. Orthographia Latina ex Vetustis Monumentis, the best edition of which is that of Harles, Altenburg, 1768, 8vo; 3. Antibarbarus, seu de Latinitate Mediae ct lnfÎ¹mce Aetatis Liber, Jena, 1695; 4. Curoe posteriores de Barbarismis et Idiotismis Sermonis Latini, ibid. 1700, 12mo; 5. Breviarium Antiquitatum Romanarum, Halle, 1710, 8vo; 6. Notitia Orbis Antiqui, 2 vols. 4to, Leipsie, 1701, 1706. Cellarius died in 1707.
