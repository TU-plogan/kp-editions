CANCER, in Astronomy, one of the twelve signs, represented on the globe in the form of a crab, and thus marked (sō) in books.

As the latter walks backwards, so the former, in this part of his course, begins to go backwards, or recede from us; though the disposition of stars in this sign is by others supposed to have given the first hint of the representation of a crab.
