CARLETON, Sir Dudley, was born in Oxfordshire in 1573, and bred in Christ Church College. He went as secretary to Sir Ralph Winwood to the Low Countries when King James resigned the cautionary towns to the States; and he was afterwards employed for twenty-nine years as ambassador to Venice, Savoy, and the United Provinces. King Charles created him Viscount Dorchester, and appointed him one of his principal secretaries of state, in which office he died in 1651. He w as esteemed as a good statesman, though an honest man. He published several works, consisting chiefly of speeches, letters, and other productions on political subjects, of which the most valuable is a selection of “Letters to and from Sir Dudley Carleton during his embassy to Holland, from January 1616 to December 1620.”
