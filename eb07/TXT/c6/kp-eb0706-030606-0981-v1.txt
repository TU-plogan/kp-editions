CHAIN, a series of rings or links, fitted into one another, and thus connected as a whole.

Chain also denotes a kind of string of twisted wire, serving to hang watches, tweeser cases, and valuable toys upon. The invention of this piece of curious work belongs to the English; and hence, in foreign countries, it is denominated the English chain. Chain, in surveying, is a measure consisting of a certain number of links of iron wire, usually a hundred, and serving to take the dimensions of fields, &c. This is what Mersenne takes to be the arvipendium of the ancients.

The chain is of various dimensions, as the length or the number of links varies: that commonly used in measuring land, called Gunter’s chain, is in length four poles or perches; or sixty-six feet, or a hundred links, each link being seven inches -⅛%; and hence it is easy to reduce any number of these links to feet, or any number of feet to links.

Chain-Bridges. See Suspension Bridges. C∏ain-Pump. See Pump. Chain-Shot, two bullets with a chain between them. They are used at sea to shoot down yards or masts, and to cut the shrouds or rigging of a ship.

Chain Island lies in the Southern Pacific Ocean, and was discovered by Captain Cook in 1769. It is fifteen miles in length by five in breadth. Long. 145. 50. W. Lat. 34. 55. N.
