Calmar, a city, the capital of the Swedish province of the same name. It is built on the island of Quarnholm, on the Baltic Sea, and is connected with the main land by a bridge of boats. It is a well-built town, the seat of a bishop, and of the provincial courts of law. It is surrounded with walls, has a cathedral, a gymnasium, with 491 houses, and 3058 inhabitants, who carry on manufactures of woollen cloth, of leather, of glass, and the making of pearl ashes; and export, chiefly to Great Britain, pitch, tar, and timber.
