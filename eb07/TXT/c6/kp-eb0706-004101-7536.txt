CAMERONIANS, a sect or party in Scotland, who separated from the Presbyterians in 1666, and continued to hold their religious assemblies in the fields. The Ca-meronians took their denomination from Richard Cameron, a famous field preacher, who refusing to accept the indulgences granted by King Charles II. deeming such acceptance an acknowledgment of the kingâ€™s supremacy, and of his having a previous right to silence them, made a defection from his brethren, and even headed a rising, in which he was killed. But his followers were never entirely reduced till the revolution, when they voluntarily submitted to King William. The Cameronians adhered rigidly to the form of government established in 1648.
