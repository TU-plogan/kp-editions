CHRIST, an appellation synonymous with Messiah, usually added to the name Jesus, and therewith denoting the Saviour of the world. The word χρΰτος signifies anointed, from χg∕ω, inungo, I anoint. Sometimes the word Christ is used singly, by way of antonomasis, to denote a person sent from God, as an anointed prophet, priest, or king.

Order of Christ, a military order, founded by Dionysius I. king of Portugal, in order to animate his nobles against the Moors. The arms of this order are patriarchal gnlcs, a cross charged with another cross argent. They had their residence at first at Castromarin; but afterwards they removed to the city of Thomar, as being nearer to the Moors of Andalusia and Estremadura.

Christ is also the name of a military order in Livonia, instituted in 1205, by Albert, bishop of Riga. The object of this institution was to defend the new Christians who were converted every day in Livonia, but were persecuted by the heathens. They wore on their cloaks a sword with a cross over it, and hence they were also denominated Brothers of the Sword.
