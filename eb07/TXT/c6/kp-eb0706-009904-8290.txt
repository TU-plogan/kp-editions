CANTAL, a department of the south-east part of France, formed out of the ancient province of Upper Auvergne. It is bounded on the north by the department Puy de Dôme, on the east by the Upper Loire, on the south-east by Lozère, on the south by Aveiron, and on the west by Lot and Corrèze. Its extent is 2332 square miles, or 574,081 hectares. It is divided into four arrondissements, twenty-three cantons, and 270 communes, and contains 250,930 inhabitants. The face of the country is generally mountainous, and the interior is occupied with volcanoes long since extinguished, consisting of lava and basalt, some of which are from 5000 to 6000 feet in height. The soil is naturally better adapted for pasture than for agriculture. The climate is raw and cold, though not unhealthy; but, on the more elevated spots, the winter is of eight months duration. The animals are the common domesticated cattle, sheep, cows, swine, and goats. Some wheat is grown, but more of buck wheat; and potatoes, but especially chestnuts, are the common substitutes for bread corn. From the poverty of the soil, great numbers of the people repair to the surrounding provinces and to Spain to procure employment. There are manufactories of linen and woollen goods, of leather, paper, thread-lace, and copper articles of furniture, but all on a very contracted scale. The chief town is Aurillac.
