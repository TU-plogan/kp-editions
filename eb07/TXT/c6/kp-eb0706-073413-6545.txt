CLEEVES, a circle in the Prussian province of Westphalia, containing the ancient sovereign principality of that name. It is bounded on the north by the Netherlands, on [7:6:735]the east by the Rhine and the Rees, on the south-east by Rheinburg, on the south by Guelders, and on the west by the Netherlands. It is 199 square miles, or 126,720 English acres, in extent, and comprehends seven cities or towns, and forty-four villages, with 36,452 inhabitants. The Rhine flows on one side, and the Nierse through the south-west part, of the circle. The country is a level plain, in some parts sandy, but as a whole fruitful, especially in green crops, and it yields a large quantity of clover seed. The dairy is one of the chief agricultural pursuits, and the best of butter is produced, while many cattle are fattened in the natural meadows. There are, however, some spots of little value, being either covered with heath or with stunted woods. Tobacco is grown in some parts, and the fishery on the Rhine affords employment to many of the inhabitants.

Cleeves, a city, the capital of the Prussian circle of that name. It is about two miles from the Rhine, which is connected with it by a canal. It is fortified, and contains a royal palace and pleasure grounds. The houses are built in the style of Holland, and are in number 932. The inhabitants amount to 6850, and are employed in the manufacture of cotton goods, hats, hosiery, caps, leather articles, looking glasses, watches, and especially iÎ¹. the breweries. It is in long. 6. 1. 46. E. and lat. 51. 47. 40. N.
