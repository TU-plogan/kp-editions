CALIXTINS, a name given to those among the Lutherans who follow the sentiments of George Calixtus, a celebrated divine, and professor at Helmstadt in the duchy of Brunswick, who died in 1656. He opposed the opinion of St Augustin on predestination, grace, and free will, and endeavoured to form an union among the various members of the Romish, Lutheran, and reformed churches; or rather to join them in the bonds of mutual forbearance and charity.

Calixtins also denote a sect in Bohemia, derived from the Hussites, about the middle of the fifteenth century, who asserted that the use of the cup was essential to the eucharist. And hence their name, which is formed from the Latin calyx, a cup.

The Calixtins are not ranked by Romanists in the list of heretics, since in the main they still adhered to the doctrine of Rome. The reformation they aimed at terminated in the four following articles: 1. in restoring the cup to the laity; 2. in subjecting criminal clerks to the punishment of the civil magistrate; 3. in stripping the clergy of their lands, lordships, and all temporal jurisdiction; 4. in granting liberty to all priests who were capable of preaching the word of God.
