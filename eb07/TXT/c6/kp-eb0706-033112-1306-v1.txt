CHARPENTIER, Francis, dean of the French academy, was born in 1620. His early capacity inclined his friends to educate him at the bar; but he was much more delighted with the study of languages and antiquity than of the law, and preferred repose to tumult. Μ. Colbert employed him in establishing his new Academy of Medals and Inscriptions; and no person of that learned society contributed more than himsclf toward that noble series of medals which were struck on occasion of the principal events which distinguished the reign of Louis XIV. He published several works, which were all well received; and be died in 1702.
