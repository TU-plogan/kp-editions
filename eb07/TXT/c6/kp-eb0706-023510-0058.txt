CASTLETOWN, a market-town in the Isle of Man, and deemed the capital of the island, although it is inferior to Douglas in wealth and commercial importance. The streets are neat, and in the centre of the town is a square containing some handsome houses. The commerce of the place is much impeded from the difficult entrance to the harbour. A considerable quantity of corn is exported, but foreign importations are confined to Port-Douglas. All law proceedings are transacted here, and the lieutenant-governor resides in the town. Castlc-Rushen, a building of great strength, founded by a Danish prince in the year 690, is situated in the centre of the place. Within its walls are the governorâ€™s house and the barrack. A part of it is also fitted up as a prison. Castletown possesses a bank and a literary society. It is distant nine miles south-south-west of Douglas. The population amounts to about 2100.
