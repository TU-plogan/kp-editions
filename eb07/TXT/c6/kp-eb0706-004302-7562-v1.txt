CAMP, the ground on which an army pitch their tents. It is marked out by the quartermaster-general, who appoints every regiment its ground. See War.

The Hebrew camp was of a quadrangular form, surrounded with an inclosure of the height of ten hands-breadth. It formed a square of twelve miles in compass about the tabernacle; and within this was another called the Levites camp.

The Greek camps were fortified with gates and ditches. The Lacedemonians formed their camps of a round figure, looking upon that as the most perfect and defensible of any form. We are not, however, to imagine, that they thought this form so essential to a camp as never to be dispensed with when the circumstances of the place required it. Of the rest of the Grecian camps it may be observed, that the most valiant of the soldiers were placed at the extremities, and the rest in the middle. Thus we learn from Homer, that Achilles and Ajax were posted at the ends of the camp before Troy, as bulwarks on each side of the rest of the princes.

The figure of the Roman camp was a square divided into two principal parts. In the upper part were the general’s pavilion, or praetorium, and the tents of the chief officers; in the lower were those of inferior degree. On one side of the praetorium stood the quaestorium, or apartment of the treasurer of the army; and near this the i ∕0- rurn, both for a market-place and the assembling of councils. On the other side of the praetorium were lodged the legati ; and below it the tribunes had their quarters, opposite to their respective legions. Beside the tribunes were the proefectí of the foreign troops, over against their respective vvings; and behind these were the lodgments of the evocati, then those of the extraordinarii and ablecti equites, which concluded the higher part of the camp. Between the two partitions was a spot of ground called principia, for the altars and images of the gods, and probably also for the chief ensigns. The middle of the lower partition was assigned to the Roman horse; next to them were quartered the triarii ; then the principes, and close by them the hastati ; afterwards the foreign horse, and [7:6:44] lastly, the foreign foot. The Romans fortified their camp with a ditch and parapet, which they termed fossa and vallum ; but in the latter some distinguish two parts, namely, the agger or earth, and the sudes or wooden stakes driven in to secure it. The camps were sometimes surrounded by walls built of hewn stone; and the tents themselves were formed of the same materials.
