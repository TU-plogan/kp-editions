CAMROOP. This country, which formerly constituted an indepcndent kingdom of the Hindoos, is 300 miles in length by 100 in breadth. It lies to the north-east of Bengal, and occupies both banks of the Brahmapootra river, extending from the Candar Chokey in Ootrecole to the province of Dehrung. Its capital is Kungamutty, on the north side of the Brahmapootra. Part of this country is now included in Bengal, and the remainder, 100 miles in length by 40 in breadth, is reduced to a province of Assam, the principal places of which are Cotta and Gow-hattee. A military causeway, now in a state of decay, extends from Cooch Bahar, to the north of this and other districts, to the utmost limits of Assam. This province [7:6:53] is well watered, being intersected in various directions by rivers flowing from the mountains, and by the tributary streams of the Brahmapootra.

This country was invaded and overrun by an army of Mahommedans from Bengal in the year 1205; but after advancing towards Bootan they were compelled to retreat, and were so harassed that few of them escaped. They were afterwards repulsed in various other attempts to subdue the country; and they in consequence believe that the inhabitants are endowed with supernatural powers for their own defence. But they merely availed themselves of the natural obstacles which the country presented to the progress of an invading army, retiring with their families into the jungles, until the rains inundating the country, and the pestilential nature of the climate, forced the enemy to retreat. The English had been thirty-four years in possession of Bengal before they were permitted to enter into this country. In 1791 the rajah, being terrified by a serious rebellion, applied to the British for military aid; after which a commercial treaty was concluded between Colonel Welsh and the Assam ministers in September 1793, since which period a profitable commercial intercourse has been maintained from Bengal, and large quantities of silk, with European commodities, have been exported, in return for pepper, ivory, cotton, and gold. The chief impediments to trade arise from the unhealthiness of the climate and the fear of robbers.
