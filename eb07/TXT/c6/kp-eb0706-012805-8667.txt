CAPSA, in Ancient Geography, a large and strong town of Numidia, situated amidst vast deserts, waste, uncultivated, and full of serpents, where Jugurtha kept his treasure. In his time it was taken and razed by Marius the Roman general, who put to death all the citizens capable of bearing arms, and sold the rest as slaves. It was, however, afterwards rebuilt by the Romans, and strongly fortified; but, on the decline of their empire, was taken and demolished a second time by Occuba, a famous Arab general. The walls of the citadel still remain, and are monuments of the ancient glory and strength of Capsa. They are twenty-four fathoms in height, and five in thickness, built of large square stones, and have now acquired the solidity and firmness of a rock. The walls of the town were rebuilt by the inhabitants since their first demolition, but were afterwards destroyed by Jacob Almanzor, who sent a governor and troops into the province. In Marmolâ€™s time Capsa was very populous, and abounded with stately mosques and other structures of superb and elegant workmanship; but at present it is occupied by a poor and indigent people, fleeced and oppressed by the Tunisian government.
