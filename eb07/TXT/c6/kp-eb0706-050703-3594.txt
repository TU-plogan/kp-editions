CHER, a department of France, formed out of the ancient Upper Berri, and a small portion of the Bourbonnois. It is bounded on the north by the Loiret, on the east by the Ni√®vre, on the south by the departments of the Allier and the Creuse, and on the west by those of the Indre and Loire and Cher. It comprehends 2908 square miles, or 740,152 hectares. The surface presents a level plain, with no hills, and scarcely an elevation. The soil in the eastern part, on the banks of the Loire and the Arnon, is fertile, and in the southern part it is indifferent; in the middle a mixture of some good and much bad land, and in the north many heaths and much poor sandy lands, are to be seen. About one fifth of the department consists of woodland. The corn of the department, which consists chiefly of rye, is about equal to the consumption. Some of the wine is of a moderate quality, and is sent to Paris as inferior Burgundy; but the greater part is converted into brandy. Hemp and flax are also produced; and before the revolution, silk was cultivated successfully. There are some mines of iron wrought, and indications of silver are to be seen. The manufactures are few, and restricted to the consumption of the department, with the exception of iron, of which about 7000 tons are sent to other districts. The department is divided into three arrondissements, twenty-nine cantons, and 307 communes, and contains 233,583 inhabitants. The capital is the city of Bourges.
