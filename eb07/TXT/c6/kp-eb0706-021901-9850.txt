CASSIODORUS, Marcus Aurelius, secretary of state to Theodoric, king of the Goths, was born at Squillace, in the kingdom of Naples, about the year 470. He became consul in 514, and was in great credit under the reigns of Athalaric and Vitiges; but at the age of seventy[7:6:220] he retired into a monastery in Calabria, where he amused himself in making sun-dials, water hour-glasses, and perpetual lamps. He also formed a library, and composed several works, the best edition of which is that of Father Garet, printed at Roucn in 1679. Of these the most esteemed are his Divine Institutions, and his Treatise on the Soul. He died about the year 562.
