CARMEL, a high mountain of Palestine, standing on the skirts of the sea, and forming the most remarkable headland on all that coast. It extends eastward from the sea as far as the plain of Jezreel, and from the city of that name it stretches to Caesarea on the south. It seems to have had the name of Carmel from its great fertility; this word, according to the Hebrew import, signifying the vine of God, and being used in Scripture to denote any fruitful spot, or any place planted with fruit trees. Mount Carmel, we are assured, was at one time very fertile. Now it is represented by some travellers as dry and barren; but this arises from the negligence of the Turks. Carmel is the name of the mountain, and of a city built on it, as well as of a heathen deity worshipped in it, but without either temple or statue; though anciently there must have been a temple, as we are told that this mountain was a favourite retreat of Pythagoras, who, unattended by any one, spent a good deal of time in the temple. But what has rendered Mount Carmel most celebrated and revered both by Jews and Christians, is its having been the residence of the prophet Elijah, who is supposed to have lived there in a cave, which is still shown, before he was taken up into heaven.
