It is subject to the Mahrattas; but having been assigned as a jaghire to a chief of that nation, in reward for military service, it is now chiefly inhabited by Afghans. There are iron mines in its vicinity, which yield a valuable produce, great part of which is carried into the British provinces. It is eighty-seven miles north from Nagpoor. Long. 80. 2. E.
