CHARYBDIS, in Ancient Geography, a whirlpool in the Straits of Messina, according to the poets, near Sicily, and opposite to Scylla, a rock on the coast of Italy. Thucydides makes it to be only a strong flux and reflux in the strait, or a violent reciprocation of the tide, especially if the wind sets south. But on diving into the Charybdis, there are found vast gulfs and whirlpools below, which produce all the commotion on the surface of the water.
