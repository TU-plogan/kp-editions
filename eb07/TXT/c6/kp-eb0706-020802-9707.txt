CARTRIDGE, in the military art, a case of pasteboard or parchment, holding the exact charge of a firearm. Those for muskets, carabines, and pistols, contain both the powder and ball for the charge; those of cannon and mortars are sometimes in cases of pasteboard or tin, sometimes in cases of wood, but most frequently in flannel bags, which are found in practice much more convenient.

CÎ»rtridge-ZMz, a case of wood or turned iron, covered with leather, holding a dozen or more musket cartridges. It is worn upon a belt, and hangs a little lower than the right pocket-hole.
