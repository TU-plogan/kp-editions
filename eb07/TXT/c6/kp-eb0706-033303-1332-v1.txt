CHARTREUSE, or Chartreuse-Grand, a celebrated monastery, the capital of all the convents of the Carthusian monks, situated on a steep rock in the middle of a large forest of fir trees, about seven miles north-east of Grenoble, in the province of Dauphiny, in France. See Carthusians.

From this mother convent all the others of the same order took their name, among which was the Chartreuse of London, corruptly called the Charterhouse, now converted into an hospital, and endowed with a revenue of L.600 per annum.

Here were maintained eighty decayed gentlemen, not under fifty years of age; forty boys are also educated, and fitted either for the university or trades. Those sent to the university have an exhibition of L.20 a year for eight years, and an immediate title to nine church livings in the gift of the governors of the hospital, who are sixteen in number, all persons of the first distinction, and who take their turn in the nomination of pensioners and scholars.
