CHRONICLE, in matters of literature, a species or kind of history disposed according to the order of time, and agreeing in most respects with annals.
[7:6:652]

Chronology, from χξοvος, time, and ∖ ογος, word or description. is the science which treats of time. Its object is to arrange and exhibit the various events which have occurred in the history of the world in the order of their succession, and to ascertain the intervals of time between them.

The preservation of any record, however rude, of the lapse of time, implies some knowledge of the celestial motions, by which alone time can be accurately measured, and some advancement in the arts of civilized life, which could only be attained by the accumulated experience of many generations. Before the invention of letters, the memory of past transactions could not be preserved beyond a few years with any tolerable degree of accuracy. Events which greatly affected the physical condition of the human race, or were of a nature to make a deep impression on the minds of the rude inhabitants of the earth, might he vaguely transmitted through several ages by traditional narrative; but intervals of time, expressed by abstract numbers, and these too constantly varying, would soon escape from the memory. The invention of the art of writing afforded the means of substituting precise and permanent records for vaguc and evanescent tradition; but in the infancy of the world mankind had neither learned to estimate accurately the duration of time, nor to refer passing events to a fixed and determined epoch. Writing was practised many centuries before historians began to assign dates to the events they narrated.

For these reasons the history of the early ages of the world is involved in impenetrable obscurity, and chronology, comparatively speaking, is only of recent date. After political relations began to be established, the necessity of preserving a register of passing seasons and years would soon be felt, and the practice of recording important transactions must have grown up as a necessary consequence of social life. But of these early records, how small a portion has escaped the ravages of time and barbarism? The annals of the early Greeks and of the Etruscans are irretrievably lost. Of the chronicles which Manetho, high priest of Sebenne, professed to have reduced from the archives of the Egyptian temples; of the histories of Sanconiathon the Phoenician, of Berosus, Hecataeus,and others, only a few mutilated fragments have been transmitted to our times through the suspected relation of Josephus, Julius Africanus, Eusebius, Syncellus, and other chronologers. The Gauls destroyed the records of ancient Rome. The Romans, in their turn, extirpated the Druids of Gaul and Britain, and obliterated the last vestiges of their ancient traditions. An Arab chief burned the library of Alexandria, a Chinese emperor the histories of his own country, and a Spanish soldier the paintings and hieroglyphics of the palace of Montezuma.

In order to preserve an exact record of the succession of events, some conventional epochs or fixed point of time, must be taken as the origin of the reckoning, and some standard period assumed with which the successive intervals may be compared. It is a trite remark, that the simplest ideas are generally the latest in representing themselves to the mind. Nothing seems more obvious than to measure the longer intervals of time by the tropical revolutions of the sun, and to number the years in regular succession. But this simple method was not adopted by historians in the earliest ages. In the Scripture history the lapse of time is frequently estimated by generations, or reigns of kings, and not by exact numbers of years. The historians of early Greece proceeded in a similar manner. Hellanicus regulated his narrative by the succession of the priestesses of Juno in the temple of Argos. Others reckoned by the ephori and kings of Sparta, or the archons of Athens. Ephorus, the disciple of Isocrates, who composed a chronological history of Greece, reckoned by generations. Eratosthenes and Apollodorus, who flourished about a hundred years after the death of Alexander the Great, first attempted to introduce precision into historical records, by substituting numbers of years for generations, reigns, or successions. (See Newton’s Chronology, Introduction). Now, when time is measured by any of the above methods, it is obvious that we can only approximate to the intervals between successive events, from our knowledge of the average duration of human life, and of kings’ reigns, in the present state of the world. Chronologers usually reckon three generations equivalent to a hundred years, and Sir Isaac Newton allows eighteen or twenty years to a reign or succession. In a great number of years this estimate is probably near the truth, but it affords very uncertain information with respect to short periods, and none whatever with regard to the duration of an individual reign. It is to those loose methods of marking the lapse of time that we must ascribe the great discrepancy that exists among the chronological accounts of the early ages of Greece and Rome.

Another great cause of uncertainty and confusion in chronology has arisen from the diversity of epochs assumed by historians, and the practice, which has been unhappily too prevalent, of shifting the origin of their eras from one epoch to another. Having little intercourse with each other, the different groups or communities into which mankind were divided in early times, instead of agreeing on a common epoch, began each to date the years from some event, important perhaps in reference to its individual history, but of which other tribes were probably entirely ignorant, or which at least they regarded with indifference. Hence in ancient history we have the Olympiad ofCoraebus, the foundation of Rome, the era ofNabonassar &c.; and in more recent times the Christian era, the Hegira, the era of Yezdegird, &c. Some centuries after the introduction of Christianity, the various sects of Christians began to found their eras on events connected with the appearance of Christ, but without any regard to uniformity. Some reckoned from the epoch of his conception, or the annunciation; others from his birth, others again from his passion, others from his ascension; and hence there is very frequently the greatest difficulty in reconciling the dates given by the historians and annalists of the middle ages.

In reckoning years from any fixed epoch in constant succession, the numbers denoting the years necessarily undergo a constant and unlimited augmentation. But rude nations, and illiterate people in general, seldom attach any definite idea to large numbers. Hence it has been a practice, very extensively followed, to employ cycles or periods, containing a moderate number of years, and to distinguish and reckon the years by their number in the cycle. The Chinese, and some other nations of Asia, reckon not only the years, but also the months and days, by cycles of sixty. The Saros of the Chaldeans, the Olympiad of the Greeks, and the Roman Indiction, are instances of this mode of reckoning time. Several cycles were formerly known in Europe; but most of them were invented for the purpose of adjusting the solar and lunar divisions of time, and were [7:6:653] rather employed in the regulation of the calendar than as chronological eras. They are frequently, however, of very great usc in fixing dates that have been otherwise imperfectly expressed, and consequently form important elements of chronology.

In the article Calendar, we have already treated of that part of Chronology which relates to the measurement of time, and explained with sufficient detail the principal methods that have been employed, or are still in use, for adjusting the lunar months to the solar year, as well as the intercalations necessary for regulating the civil year according to the celestial motions. In the present article it is our purpose to give an account of the different Eras and Periods that have been employed by historians, and by the different nations of the world, in recording the succession of time and events; to fix the epochs at which the eras respectively commenced; to ascertain the form and the initial day of the year made use of; and to establish their correspondence with the years of the Christian era. These elements will enable us to convert, by a simple arithmetical operation, any historical date, of which the chronological characters arc given according to any era whatever, into the corresponding date in the common era of the Incarnation.

Julian Period.

Although the Julian period is not, properly speaking, a chronological cra, yet, on account of its affording considerable facilities in the comparison of different eras with one another, and in marking without ambiguity the years before Christ, it is very generally employed by chronologers. It consists of 7980 Julian years. The number 7980 is formed by the continued multiplication of the three numbers 28, 19, and 15, that is, of the cycles of the sun, of the moon, and of the Indiction: hence, when the number of any year in the Julian period is divided by one of these three numbers, the remainder of the division will indicate the number of that year in the corresponding cycle. The first year of the Christian era had ten for its number in the cycle of the sun, two in the cycle of the moon, and four in the Indiction; but 4714 is the only number less than 7980 which, on being divided by 28, 19, and 15, gives the respective remainders 10, 2, and 4 (See Calendar). Hence the first year of the Christian era corresponded with the year 4714 of the Julian period. In order, therefore, to find the year of our era corresponding to any other year of the period, or the contrary, we have the following rule:

1. When the given year is anterior to the commencement of the Christian era, subtract the number of the year in the Julian period from 4714, and the remainder is the year before Christ: or subtract the year before Christ from 4714, and the remainder is the corresponding year in the Julian period.

2. When the given year is after Christ, subtract 4713 from the year of the period, and the remainder is the year of the Christian cra; or add 4713 to the year of Christ, and the sum is the corresponding year of the Julian period.

Olympiads.

The Olympic games, so famous in Grecian history, were celebrated once every four years, between the new and full moon first following the summer solstice, on the banks of the river Alpheus, near the city of Pisa, in the Peloponnesus, and lasted five days. They arc said to have been originally instituted by Hercules, at the funeral ceremonies of Pelops, 1354 years before the Christian era; but they seem to have been forgotten, or at least to have been discontinued, during several centuries. They were afterwards re-established by Iphitus, king of a canton of Elis, in concert with Lycurgus and Cleosthenes of Pisa, 844 years before Christ, and 470 years from the time of their original institution; but it was not till upwards of a hundred years after this time that they began to be used as a chronological epoch. It was then that the practice was adopted of designating the Olympiad, or period of four years, by the name of the victor in the contests of the stadium, and of inscribing his name in the gymnasium of Olympia. The first who received this honour was Coroebus. The games in which Coroebus was victor, and which form the principal epoch of Grecian history, were celebrated about the time of the summer solstice, 776 years before the common era of the Incarnation, in the 3938th of the Julian period, and twenty-three years, according to the account of Varro, before the foundation of Rome.

Eorm of the Olympic Year. — Before the introduction of the Metonic cycle, the ordinary Grecian year consisted of twelve lunar months, containing twenty-nine and thirty days alternately; and in order to reconcile this with the course of the sun, a thirteenth month was added, at first every second year, and subsequently three times in eight years. The additional or intercalary month contained thirty days, so that the Octaeteris, or period of eight years, consisted of ninety-nine months, containing in all 2922 days, which is exactly equal to eight Julian years. The years which contained the intercalary month were called embolismic, and formed the third, fifth, and eighth of the period. Hence the Olympiads contained forty-nine and fifty months alternately, the first four years of the. Octaeteris containing one intercalary year, and the second two; and hence, also, the Olympic games were celebrated alternately on common and embolismic years. It has been shown in the article Calendar, that the Octaeteris fell short of the actual length of ninety-nine lunations by a day and a half nearly; at the end of two periods, therefore, the moon’s age was three days less than it had been at the commencement, and in order to restore the coincidence between the civil month and the lunation, three days were added to the last year of each second Olympiad. But this correction introduced an error in respect of the sun, and caused the solar year to commence three days too late. This error was allowed to accumulate till the end of the fortieth Olympiad, when a full month of thirty days was omitted, by which means the solar and lunar years were adjusted, and the forty-first Olympiad commenced with the same day of the moon, and the same season of the year, as the first had done 160 years before. According to this arrangement the common years contained 354 days, and the embolismic 384; excepting however the concluding year of each second Octaeteris, which contained 387 .days, and the last year of each fortieth Olympiad, which had 357 days.

In the fourth year of the eighty-sixth Olympiad, Meton published his celebrated cycle of nineteen years, which, after receiving a slight correction from Calippus, continued to be followed ever afterwards, so long as the practice of dating by Olympiads continued in use. Before the introduction of the Metonic cycle, the Olympic year began sometimes with the full moon which followed, sometimes with that which preceded, the summer solstice, on account that the year sometimes contained 384 days instead of 354; but subsequently to its adoption, the year always commenced with the eleventh day of the moon which followed the solstice. In order to avoid troublesome computations, which it would be necessary to recommence for every year, and of which the results differ from one another only by a few days, chronologers in general regard the first of July as the commencement of the Olympic year. Some authors, however, among whom are Eusebius, Jerome, and the historian Socrates, place its commencement at the first of September; but they seem to have confounded the Olympic[7:6:654] year with the civil year of the Greeks, or the cra of the Seleucidae.

It is material to observe, that as the Olympic years and periods begin with the first of July, the first six months of a year of our era correspond to one Olympic year, and the last six months to another. Thus, when it is said that the first year of the Incarnation corresponds to the first of the 195th Olympiad, we are to understand that it is only with respect to the last six months of that year that the correspondence takes place. The first six months belonged to the fourth year of the 194th Olympiad. In referring dates expressed by Olympiads to our era, or the contrary, we must therefore distinguish two cases.

Is/, When the event in question happened between the first of January and the first of the following July, the sum of the Olympic year and of the year before Christ is always equal to 776. The year of the era, therefore, will be found by subtracting the number of the Olympic year from 776. For example, Varro refers the foundation of Rome to the 21st of April of the third year of the sixth Olympiad, and it is required to find the year before our era. Since five Olympic periods have elapsed, the third year of the sixth Olympiad is 5 × 4 + 3=23; therefore, subtracting 23 from 776, we have 753, which is the year before Christ to which the foundation of Rome is referred by Varro.

2d, When the event took place between the summer solstice and the first of January following, the sum of the Olympic year and of the year before Christ is equal to 777. The difference therefore between 777 and the year in one of the dates will give the year in the other date. Thus, the moon was eclipsed on the 27th of August, a little before midnight, in the year 413 before our era; and it is required to>find the corresponding year in the Olympic era. Subtract 413 from 777, the remainder is 364; and 364 divided by four gives 91 without a remainder; consequently the eclipse happened in the fourth year of the ninety-first Olympiad, which is the date to which it is referred by Thucydides.

If the year is after Christ, and the event took place in one of the first six months of the Olympic year, that is to say, between July and January, we must subtract 776 from the number of the Olympic year to find the corresponding year of our era; but if it took place in one of the last six months of the Olympic year, or between January and July, we must deduct 777. The computation by Olympiads seldom occurs in historical records after the middle of the fifth century of our cra.

The names of the months were different in the different Grecian states. The Attic months, which were the most usual, are as follows:

Hecatombeon. Gamelion.

Metageitnion. Anthesterion.

Bocdromion. Elaphebolion.

Pyanepsion. Munychion.

Moemacterion. Thargelion.

Poseideon. Seirophorion.

Era of the Foundation of Rome.

After the Olympiads, the era most frequently met with in ancient history is that of the foundation of Rome, which is the chronological epoch adopted by all the Roman historians. There are various opinions respecting the year in which this event took place; but the authorities most deserving of credit are the five following:

Is/, Fahius Pictor, who places the epoch of the foundation of Rome in the latter half of the first year of the eighth Olympiad, which corresponds with the 3967th of the Julian period, and with the year 747 before Christ.

2tZ, Polybius, who places it in the second year of the seventh Olympiad, corresponding with 3964 of the Julian period, and 750 b c.

3d, Cato, who places it in the first year of the seventh' Olympiad, that is, in 3963 of the Julian period, and 751 B. c.

4∕A, Verrius Flaccus, who places it in the fourth year of the sixth Olympiad, that is, in the year 3962 of the Julian period, and 752 b c. bth, Terentius Varro, who places it in the third year of the sixth Olympiad, that is, in the year 3961 of the Julian period, and 753 b. c.

A knowledge of these different computations is frequently necessary, in order to reconcile the Roman historians with one another, and even with themselves. Livy in general adheres to the epoch of Cato, though he sometimes follows that of Fabius Pictor. Cicero follows the account of Varro, which is also in general adopted by Pliny. Dionysius of Halicarnassus follows Cato. Modern chronologers for the most part adopt the account of Varro, which is supported by a passage in Censorinus, where it is stated that the 991 st year of Rome commenced with the festival of the Palilia, in the consulship of Ulpius and Pontianus. Now this consulship corresponded with the 238th year of our era; therefore, deducting 238 from 991, we have 753 to denote the year before Christ. The Palilia commenced on the 2lst of April; all the accounts agree in regarding this date as the epoch of the foundation of Rome.

The Romans employed two sorts of years, the civil year, which was used in the transaction of public and private affairs, and the consular year, according to which the annals of their history have been composed. From the time of Numa the civil year always commenced with the calends of January; but by reason of the arbitrary manner in which, till the time of Julius Caesar, their calendar was regulated by the pontiffs, the civil months did not retain a fixed place in the solar year, and the calends of January successively passed into the different seasons. Hence part of the Roman civil year corresponded to one Julian year, and part of it to another. Thus, when the 1st of January in the civil year corresponded with the Julian lst of September, the first four months of the civil year belonged to one Julian year, and the last eight months to the Julian year following. With regard to the consular year (or year of the reign before the expulsion of the kings) the confusion and uncertainty are still greater. The epoch of the succession of a king regulated the commencement of the years of his reign, and the installation of the consuls the commencement of the consular year. The initial day of the consulate was never fixed, at least before the seventh century of Rome, but varied with the different accidents which in times of political commotion so frequently occurred to accelerate or retard the elections. Hence it happens that a consular year, generally speaking, comprehends a part not only of two Julian years, but also of two civil years. The consulate is the date employed by the Latin historians generally, and by many of the Greeks, down to the sixth century of our era.

In the era of Rome the commencement of the year is placed at the 21st of April; an event therefore which happened in the months of January, February, March, or during the first twenty days of April, in the year (for example) 500 of Rome, belongs to the ⅛∙ivil year 501. Before the time of the Decemvirs, however, February was the last month of the year. Many authors confound the year of Rome with the civil year, supposing them both to begin on the 1st of January. Others again confound both the year of Rome and the civil year with the Julian year, which in fact became the civil year after the regulation of the calendar by Julius Caesar. Through a like want of [7:6:655]attention, many writers also, particularly among the moderns, have confounded the Julian and Olympic years, by making an entire Julian year correspond to an entire Olympic year, as if both had commenced at the same epoch. Much attention to these particulars is required in the comparison of ancient dates.

The Christian Era.

The Christian or vulgar era, called also the era of the Incarnation, is now almost universally employed in Christian countries, and is even used by some eastern nations. Its epoch or commencement is the 1st of January in the fourth year of the 194th Olympiad, the 753d from the foundation of Rome, and the 4714th of the Julian period. It is usually supposed to begin with the year of the birth of Christ, but there are various opinions with regard to the year in which that event took place. The most probable is, that the birth of Christ happened five years and seven days before the initial day of the vulgar era. This method of dating the years was introduced into Italy in the sixth century, by Dennis or Dionysius the Little, a Roman abbot, and began to be used in France in the seventh, though it was not generally followed in that country before the reigns of Pepin and Charlemagne. In England it seems to have been introduced by St Augustin. Before its adoption the usual practice in Latin countries was to distinguish the years by their number in tlie cycle of Indiction.

In the Christian era the years are simply marked and distinguished by the cardinal numbers; those before Christ being distinguished by the characters b. c. (Before Christ), or A.c. (AnteChristum), and those after Christ by a.d. (Anno Domini.) This method of reckoning time is more commodious than those which employ cycles or periods of any length whatever; and, provided the commencement of the era had been placed at the creation of the world, or at some point of-time prior to all historical records, it would have satisfied, in the simplest manner possible, all the conditions that are necessary for registering the succession of events. But when the commencement of the era is placed, as in the present case, at an intermediate period of history, some inconvenience is felt with regard to the dates of preceding events, on account of the interruption of the numerical order. Some ambiguity is also occasioned by the want of uniformity in the methods adopted by authors, of numbering the preceding years. In order to preserve uniformity in their computations, astronomers denote the year which preceded the first of our era by 0, and the year previous to that by 1 b. c. ; but chronologers, in conformity with common notions, call the year preceding the era 1 b. c., the previous year 2 b. c., and so on. By reckoning in this manner, there is an interruption in the regular succession of the numbers; and in the years preceding the era, the leap years, instead of falling on the fourth, eighth, twelfth, &c., fall, or ought to fall, on the first, fifth, ninth, &c.

In the chronicles of the middle ages much uncertainty frequently arises respecting dates, on account of the different epochs that have been assumed for the commencement of the Christian year. Dennis, the author of the era, thinking it more natural to reckon from the conception, adopted the day of the Annunciation, or the 25th of March, which preceded the birth of Christ by nine months, as the commencement of the first year of the era. The epoch of Dennis therefore precedes that of the vulgar era by nine months and seven days. This manner of dating was followed in some of the Italian states, and continued to be used in Pisa even down to the year 1745. It was also adopted by some of the Popes in their Bulls; and there are proofs of its having been employed in France about the middle of the eleventh century. Some chroniclers, who adhere to the day of the annunciation as the commencement of the year, reckon from the 25th of March following our epoch, as the Florentines in the tenth century. Gregory of Tours, and some writers of the sixth and seventh centuries, make the year commence sometimes with the 1st of March, like the Romans before the time of Numa, and sometimes with the 1st of January. In France under the third race of kings it was usual to begin the year with Easter; and this practice continued at least till the middle of the sixteenth century, for an edict was passed by Charles IX. in the month of January 1563, ordaining that the commencement of the year should thenceforth be considered as taking place on the first of-January. An instance is given, in l’Art de Verifier les Dates, of a date in which the year is reckoned from the 18th of March; but it is probable that this refers to the astronomical year, and that the 18th of March was taken for the day of the vernal equinox. In Germany, about the eleventh century, it was usual to commence the year at Christmas; and this practice also prevailed at Milan, Rome, and other Italian cities, in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries.

In England, the practice of placing the beginning of the year at Christmas was introduced in the seventh century, and traces of it are found to exist even in the thirteenth. Gervais of Canterbury, who lived in the beginning of the thirteenth century, mentions that almost all writers of his country had agreed in regarding Christmas day as the first of the year, because it forms as it were the term at which the sun finishes and recommences his annual course. In the twelfth century, however, the custom of beginning the civil year with the day of the Annunciation, or the 25th of March, began to prevail, and continued to be generally followed from that time till the reformation of the calendar in 1752. The 'historical year has always been reckoned by English authors to begin with the first of January. The liturgie year of the church of England commences with the first Sunday of Advent.

A knowledge of the different epochs which have been chosen for the commencement of the year in different countries is indispensably necessary to the right interpretation of the ancient chronicles and annals, in which the dates often appear contradictory, though correctly and precisely marked. We may cite an example or two. It is well known that the emperor Charlemagne was crowned at Rome on Christmas-day in the year 800, and that he died in the year 814, according to our present manner of reckoning; but in the annals of Metz and Moissac, the coronation of Charlemagňe is stated to have taken place in the year 801, and his death in 813. Both these statements appear at first sight to be erroneous; but on attending to the different periods at which the year has been supposed to begin, they will both be easily reconciled with the known facts. In the first case the annalist supposes the year to begin with Christmas, and accordingly reckons the 25th of December and all the following days of that month to belong to 801, whereas in the common reckoning they would be referred to the year 800. In the second case the year has been supposed to begin with the 25th of March, or perhaps with Easter; consequently the first three months of the year 814, reckoning from the 1st of January, would be referred to the end of the year 813. As another example, the English revolution is popularly called the revolution of 1688. Had the year then begun, as it now does, with the lst of January, it would have been the revolution of 1689, that event having taken place in February in the year 1689; but at that time the year was considered in England as beginning on the 25th of March. Another circumstance to which it is often necessary to pay attention in the comparison of dates, is the alteration of style which took place on the adoption of the [7:6:656]Gregorian Calendar. The old style still continues to be used by the Russians and Greeks; and in order to convert a date expressed in this manner intô the new style, it is necessary to attend to the variation which takes place from century to century, in the interval between the commencement of the Julian and Gregorian years. From the •reformation of the calendar in 1582 to the 29th of February 1700, the difference is ten days; from the 1st of March 1700 to the 29th of February 1800, it is eleven days; from the 1st of March 1800 to the 29th February 1900 the difference is twelve days; and after the 1st of March 1900, if the old style shall then continue to be in use, the difference will be thirteen days, till the 29th of February 2100, as has been explained at length in the article Calendar. Era of the Creation of the World.

As the Greek and Roman methods of computing time were connected with certain Pagan rites and observances, which the Christians held in abhorrence, these began at an early period to imitate the Jews in reckoning their years from the creation of the world. The chronological elements on which both Jews and Christians founded their computations for determining the epoch of that event were derived from the Old Testament narrative, which, though sufficiently circumstantial to enable us to determine the lapse of time during the first two ages of the world with considerable precision, has been transmitted to us through three distinct channels, not only differing greatly in respect of chronology, but totally irreconcilable with each other. These are, first, the Hebrew text of the Scriptures; second, the Samaritan text; and, third, the Greek version of the Septuagint. Unfortunately no very conclusive reason can be given for preferring any one of these accounts to another. We have no concurrent testimony with which to compare them: it is not even known which of them was regarded as the most probable by the Jews themselves, when the books of the Old Testament were revised and transcribed by Ezra; and the ordinary rules of probability cannot be applied to a state of things in which the duration of human life extended to nearly a thousand years.

Between the creation and the flood ten patriarchs are enumerated, whose names, with the age of each at the birth of his eldest son, according to the-three versions, are as follows;
[table]

Noah entered the ark when he was 600 years of age; by adding, therefore, a hundred to each of the above sums, we have for the interval between the creation of Adam and the flood,
[table]

Hence it appears that the Greek version assigns to this period a duration of 606 years above the Hebrew account, and 955 above the Samaritan, while the two lat ter differ from each other only by 349 years. On account of their nearer agreement, and also of their greater antiquity, critics generally give the preference to the Hebrew and Samaritan texts; and as it appears from a passage in St Jerome, that in his day some manuscripts of the Samaritan agreed with the Hebrew in respect of Methusaleh and Lamech (two out of the three cases in which it at present differs), chronologers usually adopt the Hebrew account. The Latin or vulgate translation, which was declared authentic by the Council of Trent, is in entire conformity with the Hebrew.

The second age of the world is reckoned from the deluge to the vocation of Abraham. It contains also ten patriarchs (the Scptuagint reckons eleven), with respect to whose ages the three accounts differ still more widely than in the case of the antediluvian patriarchs. The following are their names, with the age of each at the birth of his eldest son:
[table]

From the above sums we must deduct the age of Shem when the deluge took place. This was ninety-eight years. The interval between the flood and the call of Abraham is consequently, »
[table]

In this case the Samaritan and Greek accounts differ greatly from the Hebrew. Their difference from each other is only 230 years; and if we reject Cainan IL, whose name does not appear either in the Hebrew or Samaritan text, the difference is only 100 years, which may easily be supposed to have arisen from the errors of the copyists. The near agreement of the Samaritan and Greek accounts renders it probable that the Hebrew text is in error. As another reason for giving the preference to the Samaritan, it may also be mentioned, that according to the Hebrew account, the dispersion of the descendants of Noah, which took place in the time of Peleg, must have happened about a hundred years after the deluge; and it can hardly be conceived that in so short a space of time they should have increased to so great an extent, that, as it is mentioned, a single country could not contain them. According to the Samaritan text, the dispersion took place about 400 years after the deluge,—a space of time which allows of a considerable increase in the number of the inhabitants of the earth.

From this period the intervals of time between the principal events recorded in Scripture are seldom mentioned in the same circumstantial manner; and the chronologers who computed the succession of years had not only to contend with the discordant readings, but were often obliged to assign arbitrary values to the generations, or other vague terms by which the time is computed. From computations founded on such loose and uncertain data, it would be in vain to look for agreement; accordingly the results not only present great discrepancies, but [7:6:657]appear to be as numerous as the computations. Desvig-noles, in the preface to his Chronology of Sacred History, asserts that he has collected upwards of two hundred different calculations, the shortest of which reckons only 3483 years between the creation of the world and the commencement of the vulgar era, and the longest 6984. The difference amounts to thirty-five centuries. In the following table we have inserted the results obtained by some of the most eminent of the computers. The reader who is desirous of more information on this subject may consult the first volume of the Universal History, or L’Art de Verifier les Pates, avant J. C. p. ix.

Table of the Years elapsed between Adam and the Birth of Christ, according to the computation of the principal Chronoloqers.
[table]

All that can be gathered from these conflicting statements amounts to this, that the true epoch of the creation of the world is utterly unknown. British chronologers in general prefer the computation of Archbishop Usher, who places the creation of the world, or rather of Adam, 4004 years before the vulgar era.

Jewish Year and Eras.

Before the departure of the Israelites from Egypt, their year commenced at the autumnal equinox; but in order to solemnize the memory of their deliverance, the month of Nisan or Abib, in which that event took place, and which falls about the time of the vernal equinox, was afterwards regarded as the beginning of the ecclesiastical or legal year. In civil affairs, and in the regulation of the jubilees and sabbatical years, the Jews still adhere to the ancient year, which begins with the month Tisri, about the time of the autumnal equinox.

The ancient Jewish year was lunisolar, that is to say, the months were regulated by the moon, and intercalations employed to preserve a correspondence between the same months and the same seasons of the year. This correspondence was implied in the ceremonials of their religion. The passover began at the middle of the month Nisan; and, besides the paschal lamb, required the offering of a sheaf of barley as the first fruits of the harvest. Pentecost, or the feast of weeks, which was celebrated fifty days after the passover, required the offering of two loaves as the first fruits of the wheat harvest; and the feast of tabernacles, which was always celebrated on the 15th of the month Tisri, was at the end of the harvest. Hence the passover could only be celebrated about the season when the barley was ready to be cut, Pentecost after the wheat was ripe, and the feast of tabernacles after the vintage and the ingathering of the olives. These regulations rendered it necessary that the three great festivals of the Jews should always occur at nearly the same seasons, and consequently, that some sort of intercalation should be employed for the adjustment of solar and lunar time. But the methods employed for this purpose seem to have been of the rudest kind,—founded on no astronomical calculation, and regulated by no fixed rule. The beginning or end of the month was determined only by sight. When a new moon became visible, a new month began. Experience taught them that it was needless to look out for a new moon before the 29th day of the month; if a new moon then appeared, the next day was the first of the following month; if not, they resumed their watch on the night following, and if the moon was not then visible, they concluded that it must have been obscured by clouds, and the following day was reckoned the first of the succeeding month. Twelve months formed the ordinary year, but every two or three years an intercalary month was added. The rule which they followed with regard to the intercalary month seems to have been this. When the 15th of Nisan, which was the first day of unleavened bread, and of the passover, would have occurred in the ordinary course before the vernal equinox, an intercalary month was inserted before Nisan, in consequence of which the passover, with the feasts depending on it, was thrown back a whole month. The intercalary month was called ve-Adar, or second Adar, from its immediately following Adar, the last of the twelve ordinary months.

While the year continued to be regulated in this uncertain and arbitrarymanncr, it is evident that uniformity could only be preserved by conventional arrangements entered into from year to year. Accordingly the Jews, after their dispersion, were constrained to have recourse to the astronomical rules and cycles of the more enlightened heathen, in order that their religious festivals might be observed on the same days in all the countries through which they were scattered. For this purpose they adopted a cycle of eighty-four years, which is mentioned by several of the ancient fathers of the church, and which the early Christians borrowed from them for the regulation of Easter. This cycle seems to be neither more nor less than the Calippic period of seventy-six years, with the addition of a Greek octaeteris, in order to disguise its true source, and give it an appearance of originality. In fact, the period of Calippus containing 27,759 days, and the octaeteris 2922 days (see Calendar), the sum, which is 30,681, is exactly the number of days in eighty-four Julian years. But the addition was very far from being an improvement on the work of Calippus; for instead of a difference of only five hours and fifty-three minutes between the places of the sun and moon, which was the [7:6:658]whole error of the Calippic period, this difference, in the period of eighty-four years, amounted to one day six hours and forty-one minutes. Buccherius places the commencement of this cycle in the year 162 b. c. ; Prideaux in the year 291 b. c. According to the account of Prideaux, the fifth cycle must have commenced in the year 46 of our era; and it was in this year, according to St Prosperus, that the Christians began to employ the Jewish cycle of eighty-four years, which they followed, though not uniformly, for the regulation of Easter, till the time of the council of Nice.

Soon after the Nicene council, the Jews, in imitation of the Christians, abandoned the cycle of eighty-four years, and adopted that of Meton, by which their lunisolar year is regulated at the present day. This improvement was first proposed by Rabbi Samuel, rector of the Jewish school of Sora in Mesopotamia, and was finally accomplished in the year 360 of our era by Rabbi Hillel, who introduced that form of the year which the Jews at present follow, and which, they say, is to endure till the coming of the Messiah.

The following are the names of the Jewish months, with the number of days in each:
[table]

When each of the two months Marchesvan and Chisleu has twenty-nine days, the year of twelve months contains only 353 days, and is called defective ; when these months contain each thirty days, the year contains 355 days, and is called perfect; when the one contains twenty-nine days and the other thirty, the year is common, and contains 354 days. These two months arc variable, because certain days of the week are regarded by the Jews as unlucky; on such days it is not lawful to celebrate the feasts; and as the passover begins on the same day of the week as that with which the year began, when the first day of the year would fall, in the regular course, on one of the unlucky days, the commencement of the year is postponed to the day following.

Till the fifteenth century the Jews usually followed the era of the Seleucidae or of Contracts. Since that time they generalljr employ a mundane era, and date from the creation of the world, which, according to their computation, took place 3760 years and about three months before the commencement of our era. No rule can be given for determining with certainty the day on which any given Jewish year begins, without entering into the minutiae of their irregular and complicated calendar.

Egyptian Year and Canicular Period.

The ancient year of the Egyptians appears to have been lunisolar, and to have continued so till the reign of Hyperion or Osiris. From that time they employed a solar year, which consisted of365days, ortwelve months of thirty days each, with five complementary days added at the end of the last month. This was their religious year; and as its commencement anticipated that of the true solar year by one day every four years, it was adhered to long after they had discovered that the year consists of 3651- days, from superstitious notions, in order that each of the seasons might in its turn be blessed by the enjoyment of the sacred festivals.

As the anticipation of a day every four years brought back the commencement of the vague year to the same place in the seasons in the space of 1461 years, it follows that 1461 Egyptian years are equal to 1460 Julian years. The period of 1461 Egyptian years is denominated in chronology the Sothic or Canicular period, because it commenced with the heliacal rising of the dog-star, called in Egypt Sothis; that is to say, it commenced at the time when that star begins to disengage itself from the rays of the sun, and to be visible just before sunrise. In the latitude of Lower Egypt the dog-star begins to rise hcliacally about the 20th of July.

The vague year of the Egyptians began with the month of Thoth, or the 20th of July, in the year of our era 136, which year, therefore, was the first of a Sothic period. The same coincidence took place 1460 Julian years before that time, that is to say, in the year 1325 before Christ. The cycle which began 1325 b. c. is regarded by chronologcrs as the second which was used in Egypt. Hence, since 1335+ 1460=2785, the first must have commenced in .the year 2785 b. c. according to the Julian computation. In this first cycle we must place the principal events of Egyptian history, such as the invasion of the shepherds, the establishment of the Israelites in that kingdom, &c.

The names of the Egyptian months are,

1. Thoth. 7. Phamcnoth.

2. Paophi. 8. Pharmuthi.

3. Athyr. 9. Pashon.

4. Cohiac. 10. Payni.

5. Tybi. 11. Epiphi.

6. Meshir. 12. Mesori.

Each month contained thirty days, and the year, as already stated, was completed by the addition of five supplementary or epagomenal days.

Era of Constantinople.

This era, which is still used in the Greek church, and was* followed by the Russians till the time of Peter the Great, dates from the creation of the world. The incarnation falls in the year 5509, and corresponds, as in our era, with the fourth year of the 194th Olympiad. The civil year commences with the 1st of September; the ecclesiastical year sometimes with the 21 st of March, sometimes with the 1st of April. It is not certain whether the year was considered at Constantinople as beginning with September previous to the separation of the Eastern and Western empires.

At the commencement of our era there had elapsed 5508 years and four months of the era of Constantinople. Hence the first eight months of the Christian year 1 coincide with the Constantinopolitan year 5509, while the last four months belong to the year 5510. In order, therefore, to find the year of Christ corresponding to any given year in the era of Constantinople, we have the following rule: If the event took place between the 1st of January and the end of August, subtract 5508 from the given year; but if it happened between the 1st of September and the end of the year, subtract 5509.

Era of Alexandria.

The chronological computation of Julius Africanus was adopted by the Christians of Alexandria, who accordingly reckoned 5500 years from the creation of Adam to the birth of Christ; but in reducing Alexandrian dates to the common era, it must be observed that Julius Africanus placed the epoch of the Incarnation three years earlier than it is placed in the usual reckoning, so that the initial day of the Christian era fell in the year 5503 of the Alexandrian era. This correspondence, however, continued only from the introduction of the era till the accession of Diocletian, when an alteration was made by dropping ten years in the Alexandrian account. Diocletian ascended the throne [7:6:659]of the Roman empire in the year of Christ 284. According to the Alexandrian computation, this was the year 5787 of the world, and 287 of the incarnation; but on this occasion ten years were omitted, and that year was thenceforth called the year 5777 of the world, and 277 of the Incarnation. There are, consequently, two distinct eras of Alexandria, the one being used before, and the other after the accession of Diocletian. It is not very well known for what reason the alteration was made; but it is conjectured that it was for the purpose of causing a new revolution of the cycle of nineteen years (which was introduced into the ecclesiastical computation about this time by Anatolius, bishop of Hierapolis) to commence with the first year of the reign of Diocletian. In fact, 5777 being divided by 19, leaves 1 for the year of the cycle. The Alexandrian era continued to be followed by the Copts in the fifteenth century, and is said to be still used in Abyssinia.

Dates expressed according to this era are reduced to the common era by subtracting 5502, till the Alexandrian year 5786 inclusive, and after that year by subtracting 5492; but if the date belongs to one of the four last months of the Christian year, we must subtract 5503 till the year 5786, and 5493 after that year.

Mundane Era of Antioch.

The chronological reckoning of Julius Africanus formed also the basis of the era of Antioch, which was adopted by the Christians of Syria, at the instance of Panodorus, an Egyptian monk, who flourished about the beginning of the fourth century. Panodorus struck off ten years from the account of Julius Africanus with regard to the years of the world, and he placed the Incarnation three years later, referring it to the fourth year of the 194th Olympiad, as in the common era. Hence the era of Antioch differed from the original era of Alexandria by ten years; but after the alteration of the latter at the accession of Diocletian, the two eras coincided. In reckoning from the Incarnation, however, there is a difference of seven years, that epoch being placed in the reformed era of Alexandria, seven years later than in the mundane era of Antioch or in the Christian era.

As the Syrian year began in autumn, the year of Christ corresponding to any year in the mundane era of Antioch is found by subtracting 5492 if the event falls between January and September; from September to January subtract 5493.

Era of Nabonassar.

This era is famous in astronomy, having been generally followed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. It had been in use for some centuries among the Chaldean astronomers; for the ancient observations of eclipses, which were collected in Chaldea by Callisthenes, the general of Alexander, and transmitted by him into Greece to Aristotle, were for the greater part referred to the commencement of the reign of Nabonassar, founder of the kingdom of the Babylonians. The epoch from which it is reckoned is precisely determined by numerous celestial phenomena recorded by Ptolemy, and corresponds to Wednesday at mid-day, the 26th of February of the year 747 before Christ. The year consisted of ttvelve months of thirty days each, with five complementary days added at the end. No intercalation was used; and it is therefore in all respects the same as the ancient Egyptian year. From this circumstance the initial day of the year falls one day earlier every four years than the first of the Julian year; so that 1460 Julian years are equal to 1461 Babylonian years. On account of this difference in the length of the year, the conversion of dates according to the era of Nabonassar, into years before Christ, is attended with considerable trouble. The surest way is to follow a comparative table. Frequently the year cannot be fixed with certainty, unless we also know the month and the day.

The Greeks of Alexandria formerly employed the era of Nabonassar, with a year of 365 days; but soon after the reformation of the calendar by Julius Caesar, they adopted, like the other Roman provincials, the Julian intercalation. At this time the first of Thoth had receded to the 29th of August. In the year 136 of our era, the first of Thoth, in the ancient Egyptian year, corresponded with the 20th of July, between which and the 29th of August there are forty days. The adoption of the Julian year must therefore have taken place about 160 years before the year 136 of our era (the difference between the Egyptian and Julian years being one day in four years), that is to say, about the year 25 b. c. In fact, the first of Thoth corresponded with the 29th of August in the Julian calendar, in the years 25, 24, 23, and 22 b. c.

Era of the Seleucidae, or Macedonian Era.

The era of the Seleucidae dates from the epoch of the first conquests of Seleucus Nicator in Syria, 311 years before Christ, in the year of Rome 442, and twelve years after the death of Alexander the Great. It was adopted not only in the monarchy of the Selcucidae, but in general in all the Greek countries bordering on the Levant; was followed by the Jews till the fifteenth century; and is said to be used by some Arabians even at the present day. By the Jews it was called the Era of Contracts ; by the writers of the books of Maccabees the Era of Kings. But notwithstanding its general prevalence in the East during a great number of centuries, the authors by whom it was followed differ much with regard to their manner of expressing dates, in consequence of the different epochs which they adopt for the commencement of the year. Among the Syrian Greeks the year began with the month El ul, which corresponds to our September. The Nestorians and Jacobites at the present day suppose it to begin with the following month, or October. The author of the first book of Maccabees makes the era commence with the month Nisan, or April; and the author of the second book with the first Tishrin, or October. Albategnius, a celebrated Arabian astronomer, dates from the 1st of October. Some of the Arabian writers, as Alfragan, date from the 1st of September. At Tyre the year was counted from the 19th of our October, at Gaza from the 28th of the same month, and at Damascus from the vernal equinox. These discrepancies with respect to the initial day of the year render it extremely difficult to determine the exact correspondence of Macedonian dates with those of other eras; and the difficulty is rendered still greater by the want of uniformity in respect of the length of the year. Some authors who follow the Macedonian era, use the Egyptian or vague year of 365 days; Albategnius adopts the Julian year of 3651- days. For all these reasons, it frequently happens that the date cannot be fixed, unless some other chronological characters are given with it than merely the month and the year.

According to the computation most generally followed, the year 312 of the era of the Seleucidae began on the 1st of September in the Julian year preceding the first of our era. Hence, to reduce a Macedonian date to the common era, subtract 311 years and four months.

The names of the Syrian and Macedonian months, and their correspondence with the Roman months, are as follows:
[table]
[7:6:660]
[table]

Era of Alexander.

Some of the Greek historians have assumed as a chronological epoch the death of Alexander the Great, which took place in the year 325 before Christ. The year is the same as in the preceding era. This cra has not been much followed; but it requires to be noticed in order that it may not be confounded with the era of the Scleucidae.

Era of Tyre.

The era of Tyre is reckoned from the 19th of October, or the beginning of the Macedonian month IIyperberetaeus, in the year 126 before Christ. In order, therefore, to reduce it to the common era, subtract 125; and when the date is b. c. , subtract it from 126. Dates expressed according to this era occur only on a few medals, and in the acts of certain councils.

Caesarean Era of Antioch.

This cra was established to commemorate the victory obtained by Julius Caesar on the plains of Pharsalia, on the 9th of August in the year 48 b. c., and the 706th of Rome. The Syrians computed it· from their month Tishrin I.; but the Greeks threw it back to the month Gorpiaeus of the preceding year. Hence there is a difference of eleven months between the epochs assumed by the Syrians and Greeks. According to the computation of the Greeks, the 49th year of the Caesarean era began in the autumn of the year preceding our history; and, according to the Syrians, the 49th year began in the autumn of the first year of the Incarnation. It is followed by Evagrius in his Ecclesiastical History.

Julian Era.

The Julian era commences with the Ist of January, forty-five years before Christ. It was designed to commemorate the reformation of the Roman calendar by Julius Caesar.

Era of Spam.

The conquest of Spain by Augustus, which was completed in the thirty-ninth year before Christ, gave rise to another cra, which began with the first day of the following year, and was long followed in Spain and Portugal, and generally in all the Roman provinces subdued by the Visigoths, both in Africa and the South of France. Several of the councils of Carthage, and also that of Arles, are dated according to this era. After the ninth century it became usual to join with it the year of the Incarnation in public acts. It was followed in Catalonia till the year 1180, in the kingdom of Arragon till 1350, in Valencia till 1358, and in Castile till 1393. In Portugal it is said to have been in use so late as the year 1415, or 1422, though it would seem, that after the establishment of the Portuguese monarchy, no other era was used in the public acts of that country than that of the Incarnation. As the cra of Spain commenced with the 1st of January, and the months and days of the year are those of the Julian ca lendar, any date is reduced to the common era by subtracting thirty-eight from the number of the year.

Era of Actium.

This era was established to commemorate the battle of Actium, which was fought on the 3d of September, in the year 31 before Christ, and in the 15th of the Julian era. By the Romans the era of Actium was considered as commencing on the Ist of January of the 16th of the Julian era, and the 30th b. c. The Egyptians, who followed it till the time of Diocletian, dated its commencement from the beginning of their month Thoth, or the 29th of August; and the eastern Greeks from the 2d of September. By the latter it was also called the era of Antioch, and continued to be used till the ninth century. It must not be confounded with the Caesarean era of Antioch, which began seventeen years earlier. Many of the medals struck by the city of Antioch in honour of Augustus are dated according to this era. Besides the era of Actium, there was also an Augustan era, which commenced four years later, or 27 b. c., the year in which Augustus prevailed on the senate and people of Rome to decree him the title of Augustus, and confirm him in the supreme power of the empire.

Era of Diocletian, or Era of Martyrs.

We have already remarked that the Alexandrians, at the accession of Diocletian to the throne of the Roman empire, made an alteration in their mundane era, by striking off ten years from their reckoning. The same event furnished them with an opportunity of establishing a new era, which is still followed by the Abyssinians and Copts. It commences with the 29th of August (the first day of the Egyptian year) of the year 284 of our era, which was the first of the reign of Diocletian. The denomination of Era of Martyrs, subsequently given to it in commemoration of the persecution raised by that prince against the Christians, would seem to imply that its commencement ought to be referred to the year 303 of our era; for it was in this year that Diocletian issued his famous edict; but the practice of dating from the accession of Diocletian has prevailed. In order to transfer a date from this era to that of the Incarnation, it is necessary to recollect the form of the Egyptian year. The ancient Egyptian year consisted of 365 days; but after the introduction of the Julian calendar, the astronomers of Alexandria adopted an intercalary year, and added six additional days instead of five to the end of the last month of every fourth year. In consequence of this regulation the year is exactly similar to the Julian year. The Egyptian intercalary year, however, does not correspond to the Julian leap year, but is the year immediately preceding; and the intercalation takes place at the end of the year, or on the 29th of August. Hence the first three years of the Egyptian intercalary period commence on the 29th of our August, and the fourth commences on the 30th of that month. Before the end of that year the Julian intercalation takes place, and the beginning of the following Egyptian year is restored to the 29th of August. Hence, to reduce a date according to this era to our own reckoning, it is necessary, for common years, to add 283 years and 240 days; but if the date belongs to the first three months of the year following the intercalation, or, which is the same thing, if it falls between the 30th of August and the end of the year of the third year of the Julian cycle, we must add 283 years and 241 days. We ought to remark, that the Ethiopians do not reckon the years from the beginning of the era in a consecutive series, but employ a period of 532 years, after the expiration of which they again commence with unity. This is the Dionysian, or Great Paschal Period, and is formed
[7:6:661]
[table]

by the multiplication of the numbers 28 and 19, that is, of the solar and lunar cycles, into each other.

The following are the Ethiopian or Abyssinian months, with the days on which they begin in the Julian calendar, or old style :—

The additional or epagomenal days begin on the 24th of August. In intercalary years the first seven months commence one day later. The Egyptian months, followed by the modern Copts, agree with the above in every respect excepting the names.

Indidion.

The cycle of indiction is a period of fifteen years, and was very generally followed in the Roman empire for some ages before the adoption of the Christian era. We are unacquainted with the circumstances and the exact time of its origin, but it was certainly not in use before the time of Constantine; and examples occur in the Theodosian code of its being employed in dating the years under the reign of Constance, who died 361 a. c. Three indictions may be distinguished; but they differ only in regard to the commencement of the year.

1. The Constantinopolitan Indiction, which, like the Grecian year, commenced with the month of September. This was followed in the Eastern empire, and in some instances also in France.

2. The Imperial or Coristantinian Indiction, so called because its establishment is attributed to Constantine. This was also called the Coesarean Indiction. It commences on the 24th of September, and it is not unfre-quently met with in the ancient chronicles of France and England.

3. The Roman or Pontifical Indiction, which began on the 25th of December or 1st of January, according as the Christian year was held to commence on the one or other of these days. It is often employed in the papal bulls, especially after the time of Gregory VII.; and traces of its use are found in some of the old French authors.

The first year of the first cycle of Indiction is generally considered to correspond with the year 313 of the Christian era. Some authors, however, regard it as having commenced in 312, others in 314, and some also in 315. The number of cycles, however, is scarcely ever referred to, but only the year in the cycle. Reckoning backwards from 313, the first year of our era is found to be 4 in the cycle of Indiction. Hence to find the Indiction corresponding to any year of the Christian era, add 3 to the date, divide the sum by 15, and the remainder is the Indiction. If there is no remainder, the proposed year is the 15th or last of the cycle.

Era of the Armenians.

The epoch of the Armenian era is that of the council of Tiben, in which the Armenians consummated their schism from the Greek church by condemning the acts of the council of Chalcedon; and it corresponds to Tuesday the 9th of July of the year 552 of the Incarnation. In their civil affairs the Armenians follow the ancient vague year of the Egyptians; but their ecclesiastical year, which begins on the llth of August, is regulated in the same manner as the Julian year, every fourth year consisting of 366 days, so that Easter and the other festivals are retained at the same place in the seasons as well as in the civil year. The Armenians also make use of the mundane era of Constantinople, and sometimes conjoin both methods of computation in the same documents. In their correspondence and transactions with Europeans, they generally follow the era of the Incarnation, and adopt the Julian year.

To reduce the civil dates of the Armenians to the Christian era, we may proceed as follows. Since the epoch is the 9th of July, there were 176 days from the beginning of the Armenian era to the end of the year 552 of our era; and since 552 was a leap year, the year 553 began a Julian intercalary period. Multiply, therefore, the number of Armenian years elapsed by 365; add the number of days from the commencement of the current year to the given date; subtract 176 from the sum, and the remainder will be the number of days from the 1st of January 553 to the given date. This number of days being reduced to Julian years, add the result to 552, and the sum gives the day in the Julian year, or old style.

In the ecclesiastical reckoning the year begins on the llth of August. To reduce a date expressed in this reckoning to the Julian date, add 521 years, and the days elapsed from the 1st of January to the 10th of August, both inclusive, of the year 552; that is to say (since 552 is a leap year), 223 days. In leap years, one day must be subtracted if the date falls between the 1st of March and 10th of August.

The following are the Armenian ecclesiastical months, with their correspondence with those of the Julian calendar :—
[table]

To complete the year, five complementary days are added in common years, and six in leap years.

Era of the Hegira.

The epoch of this era, which is universally used in all Mahommedan countries, is Friday the 16th of July, A. d. 622—the day on which Mahommed fled from Mecca to Medina. Some chronologers, however, and the Arabian astronomers in general, refer its commencement to the preceding day; but though the flight of Mahommed probably began on the evening of Thursday the 15th of July, it is certain, from the comparison of modern dates, that the present practice of the Mahommedans, in dating their civil transactions, is to count from Friday the 16th of July 622. It may be remarked that the civil day of the Mahommedans begins at sunset; the astronomers probably began the day at noon.

The Mahommedan year is strictly lunar, and the civil months are adjusted to the course of the moon, by means of a cycle of 30 years, containing 19 common years of 354 days, and 11 intercalary years of 355 days; whence the cycle contains 10,631 days, which amount to 29 Julian years and 39 days. Each year is divided into 12 months, containing alternately 30 and 29 days, excepting that the last month of the intercalary year contains also 30 days.
[7:6:662]

The intercalary years are the 2d, 5th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 26th, and 29th of the cycle.

The names of the Turkish months, with the number of days in each, are as follows :—
[table]

The months of the Hegira are composed of weeks of seven days. The following are the names of the days in Turkish and modern Arabic :—
[table]

Such are the chronological elements by means of which Mahommedan dates are reduced to the Christian era. As the rules generally given for this purpose are attended with ambiguity, and cannot be depended on to a day, unless corrected by means of a subsidiary table, we will explain at length a method of proceeding by which the correspondence between the two eras is established, without the slightest risk of ambiguity or mistake. The subject is of some interest, in consequence of the era of the Hegira being used over so large a portion of the world.

Having given a Mahommedan date to find the corresponding date in the Christian era,

1. Divide the number of years elapsed by 80; the quotient will be the number of eyeles, and the remainder the number of years elapsed since the beginning of the current cycle. Call the quotient A, and the remainder B; and let a? be the number of intercalary years in B. Then the number of days that have elapsed from the commencement of the Hegira to the beginning of the year in.which the date occurs, is given by the formula,

10631 A + 354 B + x i for 10,631 is the number of days in the cycle or intercalary period, and 354 is the number of days in the common lunar year. To the sum obtained from this formula add the days since the beginning of the current year, and the result is the number of days from the commencement of the cycle to the given date.

2. To the number of days from the commencement of the Hegira to the given date, add the number of days between the commencement of our era and the Hegira, and the sum is the number of days from the epoch of the Incarnation to the given date. The number of days from the beginning of our era to the beginning of the Hegira is 22,7016; for 621 × 365 = 226665

in 621 years there are 155 leap years 155

from 1st of January to 15th July 622, inclusive 196

Sum 227016

3. It now remains only to reduce the sum thus obtained to Julian years. For this purpose divide by 1461 (the number of days in the Julian intercalary period), and call the quotient C. Divide the remainder by 365, and call the quotient D, and the last remainder y. Then 4 C + D is the number of years elapsed since the beginning of the era, and y is the days elapsed of the current year.

Example. — The treaty of peace concluded between the emperor Charles VI. and Gianihi-Ali Pacha, ambassador of the sultan of Constantinople, is dated the loth of Rabiu 1., in theyearof the Hegira 1153; required the year, month, and day, in the Christian era.

The intercalary years being the second, fifth, seventh, tenth, thirteenth, &c., the remainder, 12, contains four intercalary years, whence x = 4; therefore

4 C + D = 4 × 434 + 3 = 1739.

Therefore, as 1739 years have elapsed, the date required is the 151st day of the Christian year 1740. Now since 1740 is a leap year, the 151st day is the 30th of May. This, however, is in Old Style. Add eleven days for the change of style, and we have the 10th of June.

It results, therefore, that the 15th of Rabiu I. of the year of the Hegira 1153 corresponds with the 10th of June 1740 New Style. In this way any Mahommedan date maybe reduced to the corresponding Christian date. The arithmetical operation is extremely simple, and can never lead to ambiguity or error.

Era of Yezdegird, or Gelalaean Era.

This era commences with the elevation of Yezdegird III. to the throne of Persia, and dates from the 16th of June in the year of our era 632. Till the year 1075 a. C. the Persian year resembled that of the ancient Egyptians, consisting of 365 days without intercalation; but at that time the Persian calendar was reformed by Gelal-Edin Malek Schah, sultan of Khorasan, and a method of intercalation adopted, which, though less convenient, is considerably more accurate than the Julian. The intercalary period is 33 years; one day being added to the common year seven times successively at the end of four years, and [7:6:663]the eighth intercalation being deferred till the end of the fifth year (See Calendar). This era was at one period universally adopted in Persia, and it still continues to be followed by the Parsees of India. The months consist of thirty days each, and each day is distinguished by a different name. According to Alfragan, the names of the Persian months are as follows:

Afrudin-meh. Merded-meh. Adar-meh.

Ardisascht-meh. Schaharir-meh. Di-meh.

Cardi-meh. Mahar-meh. Behen-meh.

Tir-meh. Aben-meh. Affirer-meh.

The five additional days (in intercalary years six) are named Musteraca.

As it does not appear that the above-mentioned rule of intercalation was ever regularly followed, it is impossible to assign exactly the.days on which the different years begin. In some provinces of India the Parsees begin the year with September, in others they begin it with October. We have stated that the era began with the 16th June 632. But the vague year, which was followed till 1075, anticipated the Julian year by one day every four years. In 443 years the anticipation would amount to about 112 days, and the beginning of the year would, in consequence, be thrown back to near the beginning of the Julian year 632. To the year of the Persian era, therefore, add 631, and the sum will be the year of our era in which the Persian year begins.

Chinese Chronology.

From the time of the emperor Yao, upwards of 2000 years b. c., the Chinese had two different years; a civil year, which was regulated by the moon, and an astronomical year, which was solar. The civil year consisted in general of twelve months or lunations, but occasionally a thirteenth was added, in order to preserve its correspondence with the solar year. Even at this early period the solar or astronomical year consisted of 365⅜ days, like our Julian year; and it was arranged in the same manner, a day being intercalated every fourth year.

According to the missionary Gaubil, the Chinese divided the day into 100 he, each he into 100 minutes, and each minute into 100 seconds. This practice continued to prevail till the 17th century, when, at the instance of the Jesuit Schaall, president of the tribunal of mathematics, they adopted the European method of dividing the day into twenty-four hours, each hour into sixty minutes, and each minute into sixty seconds. The civil day commences at midnight, and ends at the midnight following.

Since the accession of the emperors of the Iīan dynasty, 205 B. c., the civil year of the Chinese has begun with the first day of that moon in the course of which the sun enters into the sign of the zodiac which corresponds with our sign Pisces. From the same period also, they have employed, in the adjustment of their solar and lunar years, a period of nineteen years, twelve of which are common, containing twelve lunations each, and the remaining seven intercalary, containing thirteen lunations. It is, however, not precisely known how they distributed their months of thirty and twenty-nine days, or, as they termed them, great and small moons. This, with other matters appertaining to the calendar, was probably left to be regulated from time to time by the mathematical tribunal.

The Chinese divide the time of a complete revolution of the sun, with regard to the solstitial points, into twelve equal portions, each corresponding to thirty days, ten hours, thirty minutes. Each of these periods, which is denominated a tze, is subdivided into two equal portions, called tehοηg-hi and tsie-hi ; the tchong-ki denoting the first half of the tee, and the tsie-hi the latter half. Though the tee are thus strictly portions of solar time, yet, what is remarkable, though not peculiar to China, they give their name to the lunar months, each month or lunation having the name of the tchong∙hi or sign at which the sun arrives during that month. As the tee is longer than a synodic revolution of the moon, the sun cannot arrive twice at a tchong-hi during the same lunation; and as there arc only twelve tee, the year can contain only twelve months having different names. It must happen sometimes that in the course of a lunation the sun enters into no new sign; in this case the month is intercalary, and called by the same name as the preceding month.

For chronological purposes, the Chinese, in common with some other nations of the east of Asia, employ cycles of sixty, by means of which they reckon their days, moons, and years. The days are distributed in the calendar into cycles of sixty, in the same manner as ours are distributed into weeks, or cycles of seven. Each day of the cycle has a particular name; and as it is a usual practice, in mentioning dates, to give the name of the day along with that of the moon and the year, this arrangement affords great facilities in verifying the epochs of Chinese chronology. The order of the days in the cycle is never interrupted by any intercalations that may be necessary for adjusting the months or years. The moons of the civil year are also distinguished by their place in the cycle of sixty; and as the intercalary moons are not reckoned, for the reason before stated, namely, that during one of these lunations the sun enters into no new sign, there are only twelve regular moons in a year, so that the cycle is renewed every five years. Thus the first moon of the year 1833 being the first of a new cycle, the first moon of every sixth year, reckoned backwards or forwards from that date, as 1828, 1823, &c., or 1837, 1842, &c., will also commence a new lunar cycle of sixty moons. In regard to the years, the arrangement is exactly the same. Each has a distinct number or name which marks its place in the cycle, and as this is generally given in referring to dates, along with the other chronological characters of the year, the ambiguity which arises from following a fluctuating or uncertain epoch is entirely obviated. The present cycle hegan in the year 1804 of our era; the year 1832 is consequently the 29th of the current cycle.

The cycle of sixty is formed of two subordinate cycles or series of characters, one of ten and the other of twelve, which are joined together so as to afford sixty different combinations. The names of the characters in the cycle of ten, which are called celestial signs, are,

1. Kea; 2. Yich; 3. Ping; 4. Ting; 5. Woo;

6. Ke; 7. Kang; 8. Sin; 9. Jin; 10. Kwey.

And in the series of 12, denominated terrestrial signs,

1. Tse; 2. Tchow; 3. Yin; 4. Maou; 5. Shin; 6. Sze;

7. Woo; 8. We; 9. Shin; 10. Yew; 11. Seo; 12. Hae.

The name of the first year, or of the first day, in the sexagenary cycle, is formed by combining the first words in each of the above series; the second is formed by combining the second of each series, and so on to the tenth. For the next year the first word of the first series is combined with the eleventh of the second; then the second of the first series with the twelfth of the second; after this the third of the first series with the first of the second, and so on till the sixtieth combination, when the last of the first series concurs with the last of the second. Thus Kca-tse is the name of the first year, Yih-tchow that of the second, Kea-seo that of the eleventh, Yih-hae that of the twelfth, Ping-tse that of the thirteenth, and so on. The order of proceeding is obvious.

In the Chinese history translated into the Tartar dialect by the orders of the emperor Kang-hi, who died in 1722, the characters of the cycle begin to appear at the year 2357 b. c. From this it has been inferred, that the [7:6:664]Chinese empire was established previous to that epoch; but it is obviously so easy to extend the cycles backwards indefinitely, that the inference can have very little weight. The characters given to that year 2357 b. c. are Kea-shin, which denote the 41st of the cycle. We must, therefore, suppose the cycle to have begun 2397 b. c., or forty years before the reign of Yao. This is the epoch assumed by the authors of L’Art de Verifier les Pates. The mathematical tribunal has, however, from time immemorial, counted the first year of the first cycle from the eighty-first of Yao, that is to say, from the year 2277 b. c.

Since the year 163 b. c. the Chinese writers have generally dated the year from the accession of the reigning emperor. An emperor, on his accession to the throne, gives a name to the years of his reign. He ordains, for example, that they shall be called Ta-te. In consequence of this edict, the following year is called the first of Ta-te, and the succeeding years the second, third, fourth, &c. of Ta-te, and so on, till it pleases the same emperor, or his successor, to ordain that the years shall be called by some other appellation. The periods thus formed are called by the Chinese Nien∙hao. According to this method of dating the years, a new era commences with every reign; and the year corresponding to a Chinese date can only be found when we have before us a catalogue of the Nien-hao, with their relation to the years of our era.

The Chinese chronology is discussed with ample detail by Freret, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Inscriptions, tom. xviii.; and an abridgment of his memoir is given in L’Art de Verifier les Pates (tom. ii. p. 284, et seq. Ed. in 4to, 1818), from which the preceding account is principally taken.

Indian Chronology.

The method of dividing and reckoning time followed by the various nations of India resembles in its general features that of the Chinese, but is rendered still more complex by the intermixture of Mahommedan with Hindu customs. Like the'Chinese, the Hindus have a solar year, which is generally followed in the transaction of public business, especially since the introduction of European power; and they have also a lunar year, which regulates their religious festivals, and which they follow in their domestic arrangements. Their solar year, or rather sidereal year, is measured by the time in which the sun returns to the same star, and is consequently longer than our astronomical year, by the whole quantity of the precession of the equinoxes. It is reckoned by the Hindus at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, 30 seconds, and consequently exceeds a Gregorian year by one day in sixty years. The Indian zodiac is divided into twelve solar and twenty-eight lunar signs; and the year begins with the sun’s arrival at the first degree of the first sign. The month is the time the sun takes to pass through one sign; and as each sign contains the same number of degrees, the months vary somewhat in length, according as the sun is nearer the apogee or perigee. The longest month may contain 31 days, 14 hours, 39 minutes, and the shortest only 29 days, 8 hours, 21 minutes. The civil months, however, depend solely on the moon; though, with the same perversion of ingenuity which we have already remarked with regard to the Chinese, and of which it would be difficult to find an example, except in the east of Asia, they derive their names from the solar signs of the zodiac. The first civil month commences with the day after the full moon of that lunation in the course of which the sun enters the first Hindu sign, and so on with the others. When the χ sun enters into no new sign during the course of a lunation, the month is intercalary, and is called by the name of that which precedes or follows it, which some prefix, to distinguish it from the regular month. In some provinces of India, as in Bengal, the civil month commences with the day after the new moon; but in the upper or northern provinces, it begins, as we have stated, with the day after the full moon. From the manner in which they are reckoned, it is evident that the Hindu months, both solar and lunar, neither consist of an entire number of days, nor are regulated by any cycle, but depend solely on the motion of the sun and moon. The time of their commencement is different on every different meridian; and a Hindu has no means of knowing beforehand on what day any month begins, excepting by consulting his almanack. The civil day in all parts of India begins at sunrise.

The Hindu eras have been the subject of much controversy. According to the dreams of Indian mythology, the duration of the world is limited to four yugs or ages, three of which have already passed, and the fourth, which is the hali-yug, is the last and most deteriorated. It is this only which has any reference to authentic chronology. It forms the principal era of India, and comprehends several others in common use, as the era of Vicramaditya, of Salivahana, the Bengalee era, and the cycle of sixty years.

The Kali-yug commenced in the year 3101 b. c. The year is sidereal, and begins when the sun enters the first sign of the Hindu zodiac, which at present happens about the 11th of April. Owing to the precession of the equinoxes, the beginning of the year advances in the seasons at the rate of about one day in sixty years.

The Era of Vieramaditya is reckoned from the year 56 B. c., which corresponds to 3045 of the Kali-yug. This era, the years of which are called Samvat, prevails chiefly in the higher or northern provinces of India, and in Guzerat. Its name is derived from that of a sovereign of Malwa, who, by defeating Soka, king of Delhi, acquired possession of the principal throne of India. Whether the year from which it is reckoned was that of the accession or death of this prince, is uncertain. The years are reckoned in the same manner as those of the Kali-yug; and it may be remarked of the Indian eras in general, that though some of them profess to be counted from the deaths of their kings, or other historical events, they all commence at the time the sun reaches the same point in his annual course through the zodiac.

The Era of Salivahana is the year 78 a. c., which corresponds to 3179 of the Kali-yug, and 134 of the Vicramaditya. The name is derived from Salivahan, who is said to have reigned many years over the kingdom of Nor-singa, and to have been a liberal encourager of the arts and sciences. It is generally used in records or writings of importance, but is most prevalent in the southern provinces of Hindustan. The years are called Saka.

The Fuslee Era, from the near coincidence of its dates with those of the Hegira, seems to have been imposed on the natives of India by their Mahommedan conquerors. It is principally used in revenue transactions, and is pretty generally known over India. There are several eras of this name: but the most common is that which is reckoned from the year 590 a. c. At Madras, the commencement of the Fuslee year is fixed on the 12th of July. In Bengal it begins in September, or with the full moon preceding the autumnal equinox.

The Bengalee Era is also supposed to be derived from the Hegira; but the year is measured by solar time, and therefore differs entirely from the Mahommedan year, which is purely lunar. At the present time, the Bengalee epoch is about nine years· later than the Hegira; the year 1245 of the Hegira having commenced in July 1829, and the Bengalee year 1236 in April 1829. The sidereal year exceeds the lunar year by 10days 211 hours nearly; consequently, by reckoning backwards, it will be found [7:6:665]that the dates of the Bengalee era and of the Hegira coincided about the middle of the sixteenth century. History is silent on the subject; but it seems probable, that though the epoch of the Hegira was partially adopted in India, the Hindus pertinaciously resisted all attempts to disturb their ancient methods of reckoning the subdivisions of the year.

Besides the Indian eras here enumerated, there are some others which are less generally known, or which are followed only in particular provinces. The cycle of sixty years is also sometimes used, particularly in connection with the era of Vicramaditya. According to the Bengal account, the first cycle began 3185 years b. c.; and the year 1832 of our era is consequently the thirty-seventh of the eighty-fourth cycle. In the Telinga account the first cycle began 3114 b. c.; and the year 1832 is the twenty-fourth of the eighty-third cycle.

We will conclude this part of the article with the following table, showing the dates at which the different eras above described respectively commenced.
[table]

The utility of chronological and synchronistic tables in the illustration of history has been long perceived. Of the more ancient writers who devoted their labours to this object, the principal are, Diodorus Siculus, Julius Africanus, Eusebius of Caesarea, and George Syncellus, to whom we are indebted for the preservation of some curious fragments of Berosus, Sanconiathon, and Manetho. The modern works of this kind are exceedingly numerous. It will be sufficient to refer the reader to Petau, de Doctrina Temporis·, Usher’s Annales Veteris et Novi Testamenti; Newton’s Chronology; Blair’s Chronology and History of the World; Playfair’s Chronology; and the Tables Chronologiques de l’ Histoire Ancienne et Moderne of Thouret; without mentioning a multitude of smaller tables, of various degrees of merit. But the most complete work on chronology is the Art de Verifier les Dates, an immense compilation, for which the student of history is indebted to the Benedictines of the congregation of St Maur. We may likewise mention, as a very extensive and useful work, though printed in a most inconvenient form, the Tableaux Historiques Chronologiques et Géographiques of Buret des Longchamps, the second edition of which was published at Brussels in 1822.

The subjoined table of political events has been compiled with great care for the present edition of the Encyclopaedia. Though necessarily of limited extent, it will be found to contain a useful summary of the principal events of ancient and modern history. In the early period, the dates are taken from Usher and Blair, as being those followed by the majority of chronologers. (s.)
