CARRUCA, in Antiquity, a splendid kind of carr, or chariot, mounted on four wheels, and richly decorated with gold, silver, ivory, &c. in which the emperors, senators, and people of condition, were carried. The word comes from the Latin cÎ±rrus, or British carr, which is still the Irish name for any wheel-carriage.

Carruca, or Caruca, js also used by the writers of the middle ages to signify a plough.
