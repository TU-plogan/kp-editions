CHIHUAHUA, a district of Mexico, in the intendancy of Durango, is bounded on the cast by Cohahuila, on the south by Durango, and on the west by Sinaloa and Sonora. It contains several gold and silver mines, but being situated in an elevated region, it suffers from want of water.

Chihuahua, the capital of the above province, is situated on a small branch of the Conchos, 180 miles northwest of Mexico. This town is of an oblong rectangular form, and contains several elegant churches, three missions, a town-house, and other public edifices. There are at Chihuahua fifteen mines, thirteen of which are of gold, one of silver, and another of copper. About a mile to the south of the town is a large aqueduct, which conveys the water round it to the east, into the main stream below the town, at the centre of which is a reservoir, whence the water is conducted by pipes to the different parts of the city. The principal church of this place is considered as the most superb in New Spain. The population amounts to about 11,000. Long. 107. 30. W. Lat. 29. N.
