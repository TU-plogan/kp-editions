CHIGI, Fabio, or Pope Alexander VII. was born at Sienna in 1599. His family finding him a hopeful youth, sent him carly to Rome, where he soon formed a friendship with the Marquis Pallavicini, who recommended him so effectually to Pope Urban VIII. as to procure for him the post of inquisitor at Malta. He was sent as vice-legate to Ferrara, and afterwards as nuncio into Germany, where he had an opportunity of displaying his intriguing genius; for he was mediator at Munster, in the long conference held there in order to conclude a peace with Spain. Cardinal Mazarin cherished some resentment against Chigi, who was soon afterwards made cardinal and secretary of state by Innocent X.; but this resentment was sacrificed to political views. In 1665, when a pope was to be chosen, Cardinal Sacchetti, Mazarin’s great friend, finding it impossible for him to compass St Peter’s chair, by reason of the powerful opposition made by the Spanish faction, desired Cardinal Mazarin to consent to Chigi’s exaltation. His request was granted, and Chigi was elected pope by the votes of all the sixty-four cardinals who were in the conclave; a unanimity of which there are but few instances in the election of popes. There is ι a volume of his poems extant. He was extremely fond of stately buildings; and the grand plan of the college Della Sapienza, which he finished, and adorned with a fine library, remains a proof of his taste in architecture. He died in 1667.
