CARDONA, a town of Spain, in the province of Catalonia, with 2400 inhabitants. It is situated on the banks of the river Llobregat, and is remarkable for a mountain of rock salt, destitute of any covering, at the foot of which it is built. This extraordinary mountain is one Spanish league, or four miles, in circumference, and from 400 to 500 feet in height. Its depth below the surface has not been ascertained, and consequently the substance on which it rests, though a most important desideratum to geologists, is unknown. The rock is as transparent as crystal; and pieces cut from it are worked, by artists in Cardona, into images, crucifixes, and many articles of ornamental furniture. It is in latitude 4L 57. N.
