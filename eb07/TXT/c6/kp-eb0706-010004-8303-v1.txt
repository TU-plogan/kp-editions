CANTICLES, a canonical book of the Old Testament, otherwise called the Song of Solomon, and by the Jews the Canticum Canticorum, or Song of Songs. The book of Cantieles is usually supposed to be an epithalamium composed by Solomon on occasion of his marriage with the king of Egypt’s daughter; but those who penetrate further into the mystery find in it the marriage of Jesus Christ with human nature, the church, and good men. On this principle the Cantieles is held to be a continued allegory, in which, under the terms of a eommon wedding, a divine and spiritual marriage is expressed. This song contains the adventures of seven days and seven nights, the exact time allowed for the eelebration of marriage among the Hebrews. The Jews themselves, apprehending the book liable to be understood in a gross and carnal manner, prohibited the reading of it before the age of thirty; and the same usage aneiently obtained in the Christian chureh. Among the aneients, Theodore Mopsuetanus rejected the book of Canticles as not divine. Divers rabbin have also questioned its being written by inspiration. It is alleged that the name of God is not once found in it. Mr Whiston has a discourse expressly to prove that the Canticles is not a sacred book of the Old Testament. He alleges indeed that it was written by King Solomon the son of David; but asserts that it was composed at the time when that prince, blinded by his concubines, was sunk in lust and idolatry. This he ehiefly infers from the general eharaeter of vanity and dissoluteness which reigns throughout the Cantieles; in which there is not, according to Whiston, one thought that leads the mind towards religion, but all is worldly and carnal, to say no worse. As to the alleged mystie sense, he asserts that it is without foundation; and that the book is not cited as canonical by any writer before the destruction of Jerusalem. Mr Whiston will have it to have been taken into the canon between the years seventy-seven and a hundred and twenty-eight, when allegories came into vogue, and the rabbin began to corrupt the text of Seripture. Grotius, Nierembergius, the Dutch divines who criticised F. Simon, Menetrier, Basnage, and some others, seem also to consider the Canticles as a profane composition, on a footing with the love pieces of Catullus or Ovid. But this opinion is refuted by Michaelis, Majus, Witsius, Nat. Alexander, Outrein, Francius, and others. Mr Whiston’s arguments have been particularly considered by Itchener, and also by Dr Gill. R. Akiba finds the book of Canticles more divine than the rest; the whole world, according to this rabbi, is not worth that day when the Canticles was given to Israel; for, whereas all the hagiogra-phers are holy, the Canticles is the holy of holies.
