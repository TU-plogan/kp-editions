CANVASS, a very clear unbleached cloth, of hemp or flax, wove regularly in little squares. It is used for working tapestry with the needle, by passing the threads of gold, silver, silk, or wool, through the intervals or squares.

Canvass is also a coarse cloth of hemp, unbleached, and somewhat clear, which serves to cover women’s stays, to stiffen men’s clothes, and also to make some other wearing apparel.

Canvass is also used among the French for the model or first words on which an air or piece of music is composed, and given to a poet to regulate and finish. The canvass of a song contains certain notes of the composer, which show the poet the measure of the verses he is to make. Thus Du Lot says, he has canvass for ten sonnets against the Muses.

Canvass is also the name of a cloth made of hemp, and used for ships’ sails; Canvass, among painters, is the cloth on which they usually draw their pictures. The canvass being smoothed over with a slick stone, then sized, and afterwards whited over, makes what the painters call their primeo cloth, on which they draw their first sketches with coal or chalk, and afterwards finish with colours.
