CAMPEACHY, or Campeche, a town of Mexico, in the province of Yucutan, situated on a bay to which it gives name, on the west coast of the peninsula. It is defended by a castle provided with cannon. The buildings are of stone, and when first taken by the Spaniards it contained about 3000 houses, and had considerable monuments of Indian art and industry. It has often been stormed and taken by English and French bucaneers and others, and has suffered severely from these marauders. The port is large, but shallow. The principal branch of its trade is the exportation of the wax of Yucutan. There is besides a manufacture of cotton cloth. It was formerly the chief mart for logwood, of which great quantities grew in the neighbourhood, before the English landed here and cut it at the isthmus. The population of the town amounts to about 6000. Long. 90. 31. W. Lat. 19. 51. N.
