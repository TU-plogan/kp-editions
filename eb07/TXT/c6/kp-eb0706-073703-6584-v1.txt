CLEMENTINE, a term used among the Augustines, and applied to a person w ho, after having been nine years a superior, ceases to be so, and becomes a private monk, under the command of a superior. The word had its rise from the circumstance of Pope Clement having, by a bull, prohibited any superior among the Augustines from .continuing above nine years in office.

Clementines, in the canon law, are the constitutions of Pope Clement V. and the canons of the council of Vienne.
