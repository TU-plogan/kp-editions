CHAMPION, a person who undertakes a combat in the stead or quarrel of another, and sometimes the word is used for him who fights in his own cause. It appears that champions, in the just sense of the word, were persons who fought instead of those who, by custom, were obliged to accept the duel, but had a just excuse for dispensing with it, as being too old, infirm, or being ecclesiastics, and the like. Such causes as could not be decided by the course of common law were often tried by single combat, and he who had the good fortune to conquer was always reputed to have justice on his side.

Champion of the King (carnpio regis) is an ancient officer, whose duty is, at the coronation of our kings, when the king is at dinner, to ride armed cap-a-pied into Westminster hall, and by the proclamation of a herald make a challenge, “that if any man shall deny the king’s title to the crown, he is there ready to defend it in single combat;” which being done, the king drinks to him, and sends him a gilt cup with a cover full of wine, which the champion drinks, and has the cup for his fee. This office at the coronation of King Richard II. when Baldwin Ferville exhibited his petition for it, was adjudged from him to his competitor Sir John Dymocke, both claiming from Mar-mion, and has continued ever since in the family of the Dymockes, who hold the manor of Sinvelsby in Lincolnshire hereditary from the Marmions, by grand serjeantry, namely, that the lord of the manor shall be the king’s champion as aforesaid.
