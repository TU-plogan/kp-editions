CHINCHOOR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Aurungabad, pleasantly situated on the left bank of the Moria, on the road from Bombay to Poonah. Its population is said to amount to 5000, including 300 Brahmin families. It has the appearance of a commercial, industrious town, containing many good houses and well supplied shops. It is indebted for its prosperity to its being the residence of Chintamun Deo, believed by a great proportion of the Mahratta nation to be an incarnation of their favourite deity Goonputty. The Deo’s palace is ah enormous pile of building, without the slightest pretensions to elegance, situated near the river. 14ere ∙is earned on all the disgusting worship of this supposed deity. The floors are spread over with sacred cow-dung, and the apartments crowded with well-fed Brahmins. (Lord Valentia’s Voyages and Travels ; Maria Graham’s Journal of α Residence in India, &c.)
