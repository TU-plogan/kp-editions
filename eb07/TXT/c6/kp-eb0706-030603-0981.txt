CHADCHOD, in Jewish antiquity. Ezekiel mentions chadchod among the merchandise which was brought to Tyre. The old interpreters, however, not knowing the meaning of this term, continued it in their translation; and St Jerome acknowledges that he could not discover the interpretation of it. The Chaldee renders it pearls; but some are of opinion that the onyx, ruby, carbuncle, crystal, or diamond, is meant by it.
