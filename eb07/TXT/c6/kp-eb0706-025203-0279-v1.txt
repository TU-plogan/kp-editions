CAUSSIN, Nicholas, surnamed the Just, a French Jesuit, was born at Troyes in Champagne, in the year 1580, and entered into the order of Jesuits when he was twenty-six years of age. He taught rhetoric in several of their colleges, and afterwards began predication, by which he gained great reputation. He increased this reputation by publishing books; and in time was preferred to the office of confessor to the king. But he did not discharge this office to the satisfaction of Cardinal Richelieu, though he did so to that of every honest man; and therefore it is not to be wondered at that he was at length removed from it. He died in the Jesuits’ convent at Paris in 1651. None of his works is held in so great estimation as that entitled Ła Cour Sainte, in 5 vols. 12mo. it has been printed a great many times, and translated into Latin, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and English. The popularity of this work, on its first appearance, was immediate and unbounded; which led some one, at the time, to remark, “que le P. Caussin avec mieux fait ses affaires à la cour sainte qu’à la cour de France.” He published several other books both in Latin and French; particularly, 1. De Eloquentia Sacra et Humana ; 2. La Vie Neutre des Filles devotes qui font état de netrc ni mariées ni religieuses, Paris, 1644, 12mo; 3. Expanse a la Théologie des Jésuites; 4. Syrnbolica Aegyptiorum sapientia, Paris, 1618 and 1634, 4to and 8vo.
