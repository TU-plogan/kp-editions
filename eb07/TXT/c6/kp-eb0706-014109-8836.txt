CARILLONS, a species of chimes, frequent in the Low Countries, particularly at Ghent and Antwerp, and played on a number of bells in a belfrey, forming a complete series or scale of tones and semitones, like those on the harpsichord or organ. There are pedals communicating with the great bells, upon which the carillaneur with his feet plays the bass to sprightly airs, performed with the two hands upon the upper species of keys. These keys are projecting sticks, wide enough asunder to be struck with violence and velocity by either of the hands edgewise, without the danger of hitting the neighbouring key. The player is provided with a thick leather covering for the little finger of each hand, to guard against the violence of the stroke. These carillons are heard through a large town.
