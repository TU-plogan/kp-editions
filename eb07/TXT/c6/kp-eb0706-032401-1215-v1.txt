CHARADE, the name of a fanciful species of composition or literary amusement. It owes its name to the idler who invented it. Its subject must be a word of two syllables, each forming a distinct word; and these two syllables are to be concealed in an enigmatical description, first separately, and then together. The exercise of charades, if not greatly instructive, is at least innocent and amusing. Most of those which have appeared from time to time are not only destitute of all pleasantry, but are formed in general of words utterly unfit for the purpose. In trifles of this nature inaccuracy is without excuse. The following examples, therefore, are at least free from this blemish.
1. My first , however here abused,
Designs the sex alone;
In Cambria, such is custom’s pow’r,
'Tis Jenkin, John, or Joan.
My second oft is loudly call’d,
When men prepare to fist it;
Its name delights the female ear;
Its force, may none resist it:
It binds the weak, it binds the strong,
The wealthy and the poor;
Still 'tis to joy a passport deem’d,
For sullied fame a cure.
It may insure an age of bliss,
Yet mis’ries oft attend it;
To fingers, ears, and noses too,
Its various lords commend it.
My whole may chance to make one drink,
Though vended in a fish shop;
'Tis now the monarch of the seas,
And has been an archbishop.
Her-ring.

2. My first, when a Frenchman is learning English, serves him to swear by. My second is either hay or corn. My whole is the delight of the present age, and will be the admiration of posterity. Gar-rick.

3. My first is ploughed for various reasons, and grain is frequently buried in it to little purpose. My second is neither riches nor honours, yet the former would generally be given for it, and the latter is often tasteless without it. My ιvhole applies equally to spring, summer, autumn, and winter; and both fish and flesh, praise and censure, mirth and melancholy, are the better for being in it. Sea-Soil.

4. My first, with the most rooted antipathy to a Frenchman, prides himself, whenever they meet, upon sticking close to his jacket. My second has many virtues, nor is it its least that it gives name to my first. My whole may I never catch! Tar-tατ.

5. My first is one of England’s prime boasts; it rejoices the ear of a horse, and anguishes the toe of a man. My second, when brick, is good; when stone, better; when wooden, best of all. My whole is famous alike for rottenness and tin. Corn-wall.
6. My first is called bad or good,
May pleasure or offend ye;
My second , in a thirsty mood,
May very much befriend ye.
My whole , though styled a “cruel word,”
May yet appear a kind one;
It often may with joy be heard,
With tears may often blind one.
Fare-well.

7. My first is equally friendly to the thief and the lover, the toper and the student. My second is light’s opposite, yet they are frequently seen hand in hand; and their [7:6:325] union, if judicious, gives much pleasure. My whole is tempting to the touch, grateful to the sight, but fatal to the taste. Night-shade.
