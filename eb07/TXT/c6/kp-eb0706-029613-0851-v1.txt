CERTIORARI, in Law, a writ which issues out of the chancery, directed to an inferior court, to call up the records of a cause there depending, in order that justice may be done. It is not only used out of the court of chancery, but likewise out of the king’s bench, in which last-mentioned court it lies where the king would be certified of a record.
