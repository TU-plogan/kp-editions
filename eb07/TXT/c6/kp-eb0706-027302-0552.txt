CELLBRIDGE, or Ki≈Çdrought, a town of Ireland, in the county of Kildare. It is situated upon the river Liffey, over which there is a fine stone bridge. The town consists chiefly of two broad avenues, intersecting each other at right angles, and presenting a regular appearance. Manufactures of woollen cloths and of chip hats have been occasionally carried on here. The population amounts to about 1300. It is distant fourteen miles west by south from Dublin.
