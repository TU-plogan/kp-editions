CART, a land carriage with two wheels, drawn commonly by horses, to carry heavy goods, &c. from one place to another. The word seems formed' from the French charrette, which signifies the same, or rather the Latin carreta, a diminutive of carrus. See Mechanics, and Wheel-Carriages.

Scripture makes mention of a sort of carts or drags used by the Jews for the purpose of threshing. They were supported on low thick wheels, bound with iron, which were rolled up and down on the sheaves, to break them, and force out the corn. Something of the same kind also obtained among the Romans, under the denomination of plaustra, of which Virgil makes mention in the first Géorgie. According to Servius, trahea denotes a cart without wheels, while tribula is a sort of cart armed on all sides with teeth, and chiefly used in Africa for threshing corn. The Septuagint and St Jerome represent these carts as furnished with saws, insomuch that their surface was beset with teeth. David having taken Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites, ordered all the inhabitants to be crushed to pieces under such carts, moving on wheels set with iron teeth; and the king of Damascus is said to have treated the Israelites of the land of Gilead in the same manner.

Carts of War, a peculiar kind of artillery anciently in use among the Scotch. In an act of parliament passed in the year 1456, they are thus described: “It is thought speidfull, that the king may requeist to certain of the great burrous of the land that are of ony myght, to mak carts of weir, and in ilk cart twa gunnis, and ilk ane to have twa chalmers, with the remnant of the graith that effeirs thereto, and an cunnand man to shut thame.” By another act passed in 1471, the prelates and barons are commanded to provide such carts of war against their old enemies the English.
