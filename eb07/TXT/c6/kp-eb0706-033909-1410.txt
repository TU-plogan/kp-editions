CHEDUBA, an island in the Bay of Bengal, lying off the coast of Arracan. It is distant from the main land about ten miles. It is the most westerly of a cluster of inhabited islands, and produces such abundance of rice, that it is exported in great quantities. The channel between this island and the mainland is navigable for boats, but not for large vessels. Cheduba was taken from the Burmese in 1824, by a British detachment. It was of little advantage in furnishing supplies, and it proved very fatal to the garrison, most of whom died. It was retained by the British at the treaty of peace.
