CELEBES, an extensive island in the Indian archipelago, situated between Java and Borneo, and extending from about 2° north to 6° south latitude, and from 119° to 125° east longitude. It is of the most irregular form, consisting of four long peninsulas united togetheι at a central point. It was first discovered by the Portuguese in 1525. In 1660 that people were driven out by the Dαteh, who had to sustain a long series of contests with the natives, till in 1699 they succeeded in forming a permanent settlement. Their principal establishment has always been Fort Rotterdam, at Macassar, on the western coast of the island, situated in 5° 9' south latitude, and 119° 48’east longitude. The fort is about eight hundred feet from the sea, and is well fortified with high and strong walls. The town lies on a plain to the north, and is tolerably built, and the streets are broad, erossing each other at right angles. The trade is not considerable, the eountry affording few articles of export exeept rice and a number of slaves for the supply of Java. The chief object of the Dutch in making this settlement was to secure their communication with the Spice Islands. They had repeated at-taeks to sustain from the rajah of Macassar, whose power in 1778 they finally subverted, and transferred the superiority to their ally, the rajah of Bony. His territory is situated round the great bay on the southern coast, called the Bay of Bony, Sewa, or Buggess. The inhabitants are termed Bonginese, or Bonnians, corrupted by the English into Buggesses. These are a very remarkable people, and possess many excellent qualities. In a manuscript account which we have seen, written by a gentleman long resident in this part of India, they are considered as by much the most meritorious of the inhabitants of the East India islands. They manufacture the cotton of their own country, and of Java, into a species of cloths, whieh, from their superior quality, are in universal demand throughout the archipelago. Their permanent residence he states to be around a great lake in the interior, whieh they leave at the commencement of the season favourable for navigation. They then sail down a river into the Bay of Bony, whence they spread themselves over all the neighbouring seas. There is not a coast from the extremity of New Holland to the Malay peninsula in whieh their prows are not habitually seen. Besides exchanging their own commodities for those of their neighbours, they act as caιτiers between the countries that lie remote from each other. Our informant describes their conduct as traders to be not less upright and honourable than it is active and enterprising. They defend themselves and their property against the attacks of the Malay pirates with the most heroic and desperate valour. Major Thorn, in his Account of Java, mentions an instance in which a Bonginese crew, being overcome and boarded, fired a barrel of gunpowder whieh was on board, and thus blew up at once themselves and their assailants.

In 1814 the rajah of Bony being considered inimical to the British government, an expedition was sent against him from Java under General Nightingale. It arrived at Maeassar on the 7th of June, and immediately landed. The British force, led by Colonel Maeleod, attacked the town and palace, and carried them in about an hour, though with some loss, the rajah escaping into the interior of his dominions. A new government was then established; but the revolution in Europe has, we believe, restored this settlement to the Dutch, its former possessors.

The interior of Celebes, and the remainder of its coasts, are almost entirely unknown. The great bay of Gonong Zello, on the east eoast, presents many natural advantages. Gold is exported from its coasts, and the amount is said to be capable of almost indefinite augmentation. Tortoise shell is likewise produced in considerable quantity. Bentham Bay, to the south-east of Maeassar, has a fort and some trade. The country around produces excellent rice.

The exports are nearly similar to those of Borneo. Gold [7:6:271] is found, as there, in alluvial soil, washed down by the rivers. Sometimes even springs, slightly impregnated; with that metal, issue from the rocks. The total value of the gold exported is estimated by Mr Hamilton at L.120,000. The cotton cloths manufactured in Celebes, called camhays, are universally worn throughout the Indian islands; but their use does not extend farther. The imports coincide precisely with those of Borneo. (e.)
