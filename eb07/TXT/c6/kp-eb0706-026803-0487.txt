CEBES, of Thebes, a Socratic philosopher, author of the admired Tablet of Cebes ; or, DialogzÎ¹es on the Birth., Life, and Death of Manhind. He flourished about 405 years before Christ. The above piece is mentioned by Lucian, Diogenes Laertius, Tertullian, and Suidas; but of Cebes himself we have no account, save an accidental notice by Plato, and another by Xenophon. The former says in his Phaedo, that Cebes was a sagacious investigator of truth, and never assented without the most convincing reasons; the latter, in his Memorabilia, ranks him among the few intimates of Socrates who excelled the rest in the innocence of their lives. The Tabzda of Cebes is usually printed with the Manuale of Epictetus.
