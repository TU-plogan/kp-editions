CHICKLANA, a town of Spain, in the province of Andalusia. It is most delightfully situated, on the river Sante Pteri; and being but twelve miles from Cadiz, and accessible either by land or by water, it is the place of resort where the richer merchants have their country residences. It contains about 8000 inhabitants, and some very beautiful public and private buildings. The hills that surround it abound with mines and springs of sulphurous impregnation, which are administered for many complaints. The field of Barrosa is about one mile from it, and the object of the army who fought the gallant battle there was to drive the French from the town, and thereby raise the siege of Cadiz.
