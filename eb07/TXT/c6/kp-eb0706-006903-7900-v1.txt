CANANORE, a town and small district of Hindustan, on the sea coast of the province of Malabar. The town is situated at the bottom of a small bay, which is one of the best on the coast; and it is defended by a fortress situated on the point that forms the bay, which, since the province has been ceded to the East India Company, has been strengthened with works after the European fashion, and is now the head-quarters of the province. The town contains several good houses that belong to Mahommedan merchants; and although the exports have been diminished by the prevailing disturbances of the country, it still carries on a flourishing trade. The people have no communication with the Maldives, although the sultan and the inhabitants of these islands are Mahommedans.

The small district around Cananore extends nowhere more than two miles from the glacis of the fort. It consists of low hills, very bare, but not of a bad soil, interspersed with narrow valleys; and the whole is cultivated once in three, six, or nine years, according to the quality of the soil. A very small proportion of it consists of low rice ground, which is well drained, and carefully supplied with water.

The proper name of Cananore is Canura. The Portuguese landed here in 1501, and were the first Europeans who visited this coast. They built a fort, the walls'of which have been recently improved. The Portuguese were expelled by the Dutch in 1664, who sold it to a native family, now represented by a female sovereign, a Mahommedan, who is also sovereign of the Laccadive Islands, and who pays an annual tribute of 14,000 rupees to the East India Company. The family were, prior to this, of very little consequence, and entirely dependent on the Cherical rajahs; but having acquired a fortress which was considered as impregnable, they became powerful, and were looked up to as the head of all the Mussulmans of [7:6:70] Malayala. This princess has but a very small territory, and she could not support herself without the assistance of trade. She possesses, accordingly, several vessels, that sail to Arabia, Bengal, Sumatra, and Surat, whenee horses, almonds, pieee goods, sugar, opium, silk, benzoin, and eamphor, are imported. The exports principally consist of pepper and eardamums, sandal wood, eoir, and shark’s fins. Cananore is fifteen miles north-east of Tel-licherry, and 100 west-south-west of Seringapatam.
