CHANDAH, a large district of Hindustan, in the province of Gundwana, subject to the Nagpoor Mahrattas, situated principally between the 20th and 21st degrees of N. lat. It is a champaign country compared with the Goand Hills to the north, and produces chiefly rice and small quantities of pulse and sugar-cane. The inhabitants possess numerous herds of goats and sheep. Cotton is exported to the Northern Circars. This district was annexed, during the reign of Aurungzebe, to the soubah of Berar. It is inhabited by a savage tribe of Goands, who refuse to have any intercourse with Europeans.
