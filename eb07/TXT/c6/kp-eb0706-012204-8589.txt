CAPITANATA, a province of the kingdom of Naples, in the southern part of Italy. It is bounded on the north and the east by the Adriatic Sea, on the south-east by the provinces Bari and Basilicata, on the south by the Principato-Ulteriore, on the west by Molise, and on the north-west by Abruzzo. It extends over 5000 square miles, or 3,200,000 acres, and is by far the largest province of the kingdom. On the north-east the mountainous range of Gargano covers an extent of more than 800 square miles. On the south-west side of the province the Apennines occupy a part of the space. Though the more mountainous parts are sterile, yet between them are rich valleys. The chief products are wheat, maize, pulse, fruits, tobacco, licorice, hemp, flax, oil, and wine. The breeding of cattle, especially of sheep, is a very extensive pursuit, and has in a great measure supersecled the breeding of silk worms. There are few manufactures in the province; and even the wool, which is excellent, is sent to other districts to be made into cloth. There is some little coasting trade with the other Italian countries, but no foreign commerce, except with Dalmatia. The inhabitants at the last census in 1793 amounted to 251,828 individuals, but are supposed to have much increased since that period. It is divided into three districts, namely, Foggio, St Severo, and Manfredonia. The capital of the province is the city Foggio.
