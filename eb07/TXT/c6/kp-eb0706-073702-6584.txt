CLEMENTI, Muzio, a celebrated musical composer and piano-forte player, was born in Rome in the year 1747. His genius for music being early developed, his studies were pursued with such successful assiduity, that he speedily acquired great proficiency in his profession. He enjoyed, during his life, the highest reputation as an artist and composer, and died,' ripe in age and honour, in England, on the 10th March 1832. His remains were interred in Westminster Abbey. “Clementi,” says Dr Crotch, “may be considered as the father of piano-forte music; for he long ago introduced all the beauty of Italian melody into pieces calculated by their ornamental varieties to elicit the power of the instrument, and display the taste as well as the execution of the performer.” His compositions, moreover, possess those sterling qualities which will secure their permanent popularity throughout all the capricious changes of fashion and taste.
