CHURCHYARD, a piece of ground adjoining to a church, and set apart for the interment of the dead.

In the church of Rome such grounds are blessed or consecrated with great solemnity. If a churchyard which has been thus consecrated shall afterwards be polluted by any indecent action, or profaned by the burial of an infidel, a heretic, an excommunicated or unbaptized person, it must be reconciled ; and the ceremony of the reconciliation is performed with the same solemnity as that of the blessing or consecration. ∙

Churchyard, Thomas, a poet who flourished in the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth. He was born at Shrewsbury, and inherited a fortune which he soon exhausted in a fruitless attendance on the court, by which he only gained the favour of being retained as a domestic in the family of Lord Surrey; when, by his lordship’s encouragement, he commenced poet. Upon his patron’s death, he betook himself to arms, and was present in many engagements, in which he was frequently wounded, and was twice made prisoner. He published twelve pieces, which he afterwards printed together in one volume, under the title of Churchyard’s Chips; and also the tragedy of Thomas Moubray, Duke of Norfolk. He died in 1570.
