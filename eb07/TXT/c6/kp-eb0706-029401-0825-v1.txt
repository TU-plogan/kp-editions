CENTILOQUIUM denotes a collection of a hundred ’sentences, opinions, or sayings. The centiloquium of Hermes contains a hundred aphorisms, or astrological sentences, supposed to have been written by some Arab, falsely fathered on Hermes Trismegistus. It is only extant in Latin, in which it has been several times printed. The centiloquium of Ptolemy is a famous astrological piece, frequently confounded with the former, consisting likewise of a hundred sentences or doctrines, divided into short aphorisms, entitled also in Greek xagπoς, as being the fruit or result of the former writings of that celebrated astronomer, namely, his quadripartitum and almagestum ; or rather, because the use of astrological calculations is therein explained.
