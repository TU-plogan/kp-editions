CARINTHIA, a province of the Austrian empire, with the title of duchy, lying between 12° 35' and 15° of east longitude, and between 46° 20' 50" and 47° 6' of north latitude. It is bounded on the west by the Tyrol, on the south by Carniola and Friuli, and on the north and east by Salzburg and Styria. This province contains about 4000 English square miles, and a population of 300,000. The chief towns are Clagenfurth and Villach.

Carinthia, like the Tyrol, to which it adjoins, is a series of mountains separated by narrow valleys. They attain their highest elevation on the frontiers of the province, and in general are covered with thick forests, which would be valuable were it practicable to convey the trees to navigable rivers. The valleys, besides being narrow, are frequently short; and this, in connection with the height of the mountains, has contributed to form the vast number of lakes with which the province is studded. In this respect it bears a resemblance to the Highlands of Scotland. The soil of Carinthia is by no means fertile, except in a few favoured spots, such as the valley of Lavant; in these the fruits of the south abound. Of 1,400,000 acres, about one seventh only is under tillage; the rest consist of pasturages, which are extensive, and waste lands. Wheat, oats, millet, and buck-wheat, are successfully cultivated in the plains, while only rye and barley thrive on the mountains. Turnips, potatoes, beet-root, carrots, and other garden vegetables, are raised in considerable quantities. Although ample facilities are afforded for the breeding of cattle, that branch of agricultural trade is little understood; and hence the quantity of cattle bred is not considerable. The chief wealth of Carinthia consists in its metallic mines; and to these may be added its marble, which is of great beauty and whiteness. In many of the lead mines silver is found impregnated with the ore; and at Mieslđing and Steinfeld it is found in a state of purity. Near Cappel a mine of quicksilver of some value has been discovered; and there are also copper mines on a small scale; but by far the most important are those of iron and lead. That portion of the latter metal which is found near Villach is considered as the finest in Europe. The chief manufactures of Carinthia are those which have a relation to the mineral kingdom, such as the well known steel called brescia, iron plate, fire-arms, and the several preparations of lead.

In manners and character the Carinthians in some degree resemble the Italians. They are in general gay, frank, and contented, fond of tranquillity and a pastoral mode of life; but, as a counterbalance to these, they are indolent, ignorant, and bigoted. Their dialect has a strong resemblance to that of the Sclavonians of Lower Styria. In religion the Carinthians are adherents of the Romish church; the only sectaries are Lutherans, who are not numerous. This duchy forms part of the division of the Austrian empire, which has its seat of government at Gratz.
