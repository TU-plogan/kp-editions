CANTO denotes a part or division of a poem, answering to what is otherwise called a booh. The word is Italian, and properly signifies song. Tasso, Ariosto, and several other Italians, have divided their longer or heroic poems into cantos. In imitation of them, Scarron has also divided his Gigantamachia, and Boileau his Lutrin, into chants or songs. The like usage has been adopted by some English writers, as Butler, who divides his Hudibras, and Dr Garth his Dispensary, into cantos. A modern translator of part of Virgil’s Aewez¢Zhas even subdivided a book of Virgil into several cantos.

Canto, in the Italian musie, signifies a song; hence canto simplice is where all the notes or figures are equal, and called also canto sermo ; while canto figurato is where the figures are unequal, and express different motions.

Canto also signifies the treble part of a song; hence canto concertante, the treble of the little chorus, and canto repieno, the treble of the grand chorus, or that which sings only now and then in particular places. Canto signifies the first treble, unless some other word be added to it, as secondo; in which case it denotes the second treble.
