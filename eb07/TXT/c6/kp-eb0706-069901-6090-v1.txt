CINCINNATI, a city of the state of Ohio, in Hamilton county, on the northern bank of the river Ohio. It was first laid out in the year 1789, and began to flourish after the year 1794, since which period it has rapidly increased in wealth, trade, and population. The city is pleasantly and advantageously situated, partly on the first and partly on the second bank of the river, the upper portion of it being elevated fifty or sixty feet above the lower. The central part of the town is very compact, and a great proportion of the houses are handsomely built of brick. The principal public buildings and institutions in 1829 were a court-house, a jail, the medical college, the Cincinnati college, an hospital⅜ a museum, a city library, the apprentices’ library, three market-houses, five insurance companies, twenty-three places of public worship, five classical schools, and forty-seven common schools. There were published at the same period two daily newspapers, two twice a week, and five weekly, besides other periodical publications. Cincinnati is a place of great trade and extensive manufactures. The exports, of which the most considerable articles are flour and pork, amounted in 1826 to 1,063,560, and the imports to 2,528,590 dollars. There are between thirty and forty manufacturing establishments, some of which are on a very extensive scale, and their machinery is to a great extent moved by steam power. The value of the manufactures in all the departments was estimated, in 1828, at 1,850,000 dollars. The population in 1820 amounted to 9642, and in 1829 to 24,148. Long. 84. 27. W. Lat. 39. 6. N.
