CHANSI, one of the smallest provinces in the Chinese empire, bounded on the east by the province of Pe-tche-li, by Honan on the south, by Chensi on the west, and on the north by the Great Wall. It is exceedingly mountainous, and in many parts the country is wild, rugged, and uninhabited; but in other parts the mountain districts are cut into terraces, and carefully cultivated from top to bottom. It is admirably 7 adapted, from its unequal surface, for the cultivation of the vine; and excellent grapes are accordingly 7 produced, which are dried and exported. The country 7 also produces wheat, millet, and rice, though not in equal abundance with the other kinds of grain. On the hills are table-lands, which are equal in fertility to the plains. The most valuable mineral produced among the mountains is coal, which is very abundant. Iron is also found, lapis lazuli, variously coloured jaspers, porphyry, crystal, and marble. A great quantity of salt is produced from a lake, the waters of which are said to be salter than the sea. Within the jurisdiction of Chansi are included five cities of the first class, and eighty-five of the second and third. Tai-yuen-fou, an extensive and ancient city, is its capital. Ping-yang, and Fuen-tcheou-fou, on the banks of the Fuen, distinguished by its hot baths, are among its most celebrated cities. The populationis estimated at 27,000,000.
