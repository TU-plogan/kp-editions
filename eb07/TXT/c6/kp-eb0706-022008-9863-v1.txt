CASTALIO, Sebastian, was born at Chatillon, on the Rhone, in the year 1515. Calvin conceived such an esteem and friendship for him, during the stay he made at Strasburg in 1540 and 1541, that he lodged him some days at his house, and procured him a regent’s place in the college of Geneva. Castalio, after continuing in this office for nearly three years, was forced to quit it in the year 1544, on account of some particular opinions which he held concerning Solomon’s Song, and Christ’s descent into hell. He retired to Basel, where he was made Greek professor, and died in 1564, at the age of forty-eight. He incurred the high displeasure of Calvin and Theodore Beza, for differing with them concerning predestination and the punishment of heretics. His works are very considerable, both on account of their quality and number. In 1545 he printed at Basel four books of dialogues, containing the principal histories of the Bible, in elegant Latin, so that youth might thereby make proficiency in piety and in the Latin tongue at the same time. But his principal work is a Latin and French translation of the Scripture. He began the Latin translation at Geneva in 1542, and finished it at Basci in 1550. It was printed at Basel in 1551, and dedicated by the author to Edward VI., king of England. The French version was dedicated to Henry II. of France, and printed at Basel in 1555. The fault which has been most generally condemned in this Latin translation is the affectation of using only classical terms.
