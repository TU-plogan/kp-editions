CALIGULA, the Roman emperor and tyrant, a. d. 37, began his reign with every promising appearance of becoming the real father of his people; but at the end of eight months he was seized with a fever, which it is thought left a frenzy on his mind; for his disposition totally changed, and he committed the most atrocious acts of impiety, cruelty, and folly, such as proclaiming his horse consul, feeding it at his table, introducing it into the temple in the vestments of the priests of Jupiter, and causing sacrifices to be offered to himself, his wife, and the horse. After having murdered many of his subjects with his own hand, and caused others to be put to death without any cause, he was assassinated by a tribune of the people as he came out of the amphitheatre, a. d. 41, in the twentyninth year of his age and fourth of his reign.
