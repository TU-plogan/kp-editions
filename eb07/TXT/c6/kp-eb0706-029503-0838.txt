CERAM, a large island in the Eastern Seas, between 160 and 180 miles in length, and about forty in breadth. It extends from the 128th to the 130th degree of east longitude, and is situated between the third and fourth degrees of south latitude. The island is very mountainous in its aspect, being intersected longitudinally from east to west with a lofty chain about 700Ó feet high, with fertile valleys interposed. The island is of a singular form; the peninsula of Little Ceram is joined to the mainland by a narrow isthmus, and it formerly produced large quantities of cloves and nutmegs. But the trees were extirpated by the Dutch in 1657. Forests of the sago tree, as well as plantations of other curious kinds of wood, are found here. On the shores are beautiful shells. Wild hogs and deer are numerous, as well as birds of paradise. The natives, described as a wild, ferocious race, still exist in the interior. They are taller and stronger than the people dwelling on the shores, and also of a fairer complexion. Their habits are completely those of savages. They go almost naked, and have many barbarous and bloody rites. The chiefs who have territories along the shores formerly acknowledged the rule of the Dutch. An attack was made on one of these chiefs by the British during the last war, but without success, and some loss was sustained.
