CASTLE-CAREY, a remarkable Roman station, a few miles west from Falkirk, on the borders of Stirlingshire, in Scotland. It comprehends several acres of ground, is of a square form, and is surrounded with a wall of stone and mortar. All the space within the walls has been occupied by buildings, the ruins of which have raised the earth eight or ten feet above its natural surface. In 1770 some workmen employed in searching for stones for the great canal which passes very near it, discovered several apartments of stone; and in one of them a great number of stones about two feet in length, and standing erect, with marks of fire upon them, as if they had been employed in supporting some vessel under which fire was put. In a hollow of the rock near this place a considerable quantity of wheat quite black with age was found in 1771, with some wedges and hammers supposed to be Roman.
