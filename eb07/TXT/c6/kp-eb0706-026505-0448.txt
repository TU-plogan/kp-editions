CAVIARE, a kind of food made of the hard roes of sturgeon, formed into small cakes, about an inch thick [7:6:266]and three or four inches broad. This kind of food is in great request among the Muscovites, on account of their three lents, which they keep with a superstitious exactness. A pretty large quantity of the commodity is also consumed in Italy and France. These countries sometimes procure the caviare from Archangel, but commonly buy it at second hand of the English and Dutch.
