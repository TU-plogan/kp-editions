CALVART, Denis, a celebrated painter, was born at Antwerp in 1552, and had for his masters Prospero Fontana and Lorenzo Sabbatini. He opened a school at Bologna, which became celebrated, and from which proceeded Guido, Albani, and other great masters. Calvart was well skilled in architecture, perspective, and anatomy, which he considered as necessary to a painter, and taught them to his pupils. His principal works are at Bologna, Rome, and Reggio. He died at Bologna in 1619.
