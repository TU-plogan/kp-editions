CLAUDIA, a vestal virgin at Rome, who having been suspected of unchastĩty, is said to have been cleared of that imputation in the following manner: The image of Cybele being brought out of Phrygia to Rome in a barge, and happening to stick so fast in the river Tiber, that it could not be moved, Claudia tied her girdle, the badge of chastity, to the barge, and drew it along to the city, which a thousand men were unable to do.

Claudia Aqua, water conveyed to Rome by a canal or aqueduct eleven miles in length, the contrivance of Appius Claudius the censor, and the first structure of the kind, in the year of Rome 441. Called also Aqua Appia. Claudia or Clodia Via, was that road which, beginning at the Pons Milvius, joined the Flaminia, passing through Etruria on the south side of the Lacus Sabatinus, and striking off from the Cassia, and leading to Luca.
