CANDIAC, John Louis, a premature genius, born at Candiac, in the diocese of Nismes in France, in 17I¾. In the cradle he distinguished the letters of the alphabet; at thirteen months old he knew them perfectly; at three years of age he read Latin, either printed or in manuscript; at four he translated from that tongue; at six he read Greek and Hebrew, knew the principles of arithmetic, history, geography, heraldry, and the science of medals, and had read the best authors on almost every branch of literature. Candiac attracted the attention of the learned at Nismes, Montpellier, Grenoble, Lyons, and Paris; and it was for his benefit that the typographic board was contrived by Μ. Dumas, who devoted himself to the instruction of this young prodigy. He died of a complication of disorders, at Paris, in 1726.
