CHUMPANEER, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Gujerat, situated principally between the 22d and 24th degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the east by the province of Mai wall. It has two very large boundary rivers, the Nerbuddah and the Mahy; and is, besides, traversed by many smaller streams. It is chiefly occupied by the Mahrattas, or by chiefs tributary to them.

Chümpaneek, the ancient capital of the above district, situated sixty miles north-east from Broach. Chumpaneer is a large mountain, or rather rock, rising 2500 feet above the plains of Gujerat, one of the most level provinces of Hindustan. To the northward of the mountain are the remains of an ancient city, the ruins of which extend several miles on each side of the mountain, and are at present covered with an impenetrable jungle, the abode of tigers and bheels, a race of mountaineers who are much addicted to plunder. The town is inclosed within a small space of an oblong figure, by a stone wall of good workmanship, which is three fourths of a mile long, and three furlongs broad. The mountain is strengthened by two forts; the upper deemed impregnable by the natives, and containing a Hindu temple, while the defences of the lower part are extcnsivc, and the whole of difficult approach. In 1812 the town of Chumpaneer contained four hundred houses, of which not more than one half were inhabited, principally by emigrants from other parts of Gujerat. It is supposed to have been the capital of an ancient principality long before the Mahommedan conquest; and it was taken about the end of the fifteenth century, by Mahmoud VII. after a siege or blockade of twelve years. In 1534, it was taken by the Mogul emperor Humayon. In 1582, it is described as a place of considerable strength, surrounded by extensive ruins, Hindu as well as Mahommedan. It was taken by the Mahrattas, who always considered it as a strong place, and had a good garrison in it. It was taken from Sindia by the British in 1803, but was restored to him the following year. It is 55 miles cast by north from Cambay. Long. 73. 37. E. Lat 22. 31. N.
