CEUTA, a fortress on the coast of Africa, belonging to Spain. It is situated on a peninsula eastward of Tangier, and opposite to Gibraltar. It is formed of the high mountain Acho, and six smaller ones which are jointly denominated the Bulwark, and incloses a space from east-north-east to west-south-west of about one mile and a half, and a plain which begins at the foot of the mountains. On this spot the city is built, and towards Africa is tremendously fortified. The cathedral of Ceuta and its bishop are under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Seville. Within the lines are formed suburbs, and gardens in which they raise all the fruits of the climate, and have some pleasant walks, cisterns, and fountains. Within the citadel there are cisterns sufficiently capacious to contain as much water as the garrison requires for two years’ consumption. On the top of the mountain Acho there is an observatory, from which the garrison may be enabled to see all the vessels which pass the Straits of Gibraltar, and all the movements of the Moors in their camp before the fortress. Ceuta contains 3000 inhabitants, besides criminals, who are sent here to hard labour, in what the Spaniards denominate a presidio. Long. 1. 37. 5. W. Lat. 35. 54. 4. N.
