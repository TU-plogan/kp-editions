CLARIGATIO, in Roman antiquity, a ceremony which always preceded a formal declaration of war. It was performed in this manner: Four heralds crowned with vervain were sent to demand satisfaction for the injuries which had been done the Roman state. These heralds having taken the gods to witness that their demands were just, one of them, with a clear voice, demanded restitution within a limited time, commonly thirty-three days; and if this [7:6:728] period expired without restitution being made, then the pater patratus, or prince of the heralds, proceeded to the enemy’s frontiers, and declared war.
