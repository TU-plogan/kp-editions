CANTERUS, William, an eminent linguist and philologer, who was born at Utrecht in 1541. He studied at Louvain and Paris, and gave surprising proofs of his progress in Greek and Latin literature. He afterwards visited the several universities of Germany and Italy, and died at Louvain in 1575, aged thirty-three. He understood six languages besides that of his native country; and, notwithstanding his dying so young, wrote several philological and critical works, among which are, Notoe, Scholae, Emendationes, et Explicationes, in Euripidem, Sophoclem, Eschylum, Ciceronem, Propertium, Ausonium, &c. and many translations of Greek authors.
