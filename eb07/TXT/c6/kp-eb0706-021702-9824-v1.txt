CASSANDER, king of Macedon after Alexander the Great, was the son of Antipater. He made several conquests in Greece, abolished democracy at Athens, and intrusted the government of that state to the orator Demetrius. Olympias, the mother of Alexander, having caused Aridaeus and his wife Eurydice, with others, to be put to death, Cassander besieged Pydne, whither the queen had retired, took it by a stratagem, and caused her to be put to death. He married Thessalonica, the sister of Alexander the Great, and killed Roxana and Alexander, the wife and son of that conqueror. Ultimately he formed an alliance with Seleucus and Lysimachus against Antigonus and Demetrius, overwhom he obtained a great victory near Ipsus, in Phrygia, 301 years before the Christian era; and he died three years after, in the nineteenth year of his reign.
