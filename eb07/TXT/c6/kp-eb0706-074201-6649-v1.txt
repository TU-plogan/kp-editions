CLERKE, Captain Charles, a celebrated English navigator, was bred up in the navy from his youth, and was present in several actions during the war of 1755. In the engagement between the Bellona and Courageux he was in imminent danger; for having been stationed in the mizen-top of the Bellona, the mast was carried overboard by a shot, and he fell into the sea along with it, but he was taken up without having received any injury. When Commodore Byron made his first voyage round the world, Mr Clerke served on board his ship in capacity of midshipman; and he was afterwards on the American station. In the year 1768 he sailed round the world a second time in the Endeavour; on board of which he served in the station of master’s mate, but, during the voyage, succeeded to a lieutenancy. He returned in 1775, and was soon afterwards appointed master and commander. When Captain Cook undertook his last voyage, Mr Clerke was appointed captain of the Discovery; and in consequence of the death of Captain Cook, he naturally succeeded to the chief command. He did not, however, long cnjoy his new dignity. Before his departure from England he had exhibited manifest symptoms of consumption. Of this disease he lingered during the whole of the voyage; and his long residence in the cold northern climates cut off all hopes of recovery. But though sensible that the only chance he had of prolonging his life was by a speedy return to a warmer climate, his attention to his duty was so great that he persevered in search of a passage between the Asiatic and American continents until every one of [7:6:743] the offieers eame to be of opinion that it was impraetieable. He bore his distemper with great firmness and equanimity, retaining his usual spirits to the last; and died on the 22d of August 1778, in the thirty-eighth year of his age, the ship being then within view of the eoast of Kamtschatka.

Clerke’s Island, a pretty large island in the North Pacific Ocean, in which are several hills all connected by low ground, which at a distance present the appearance of a group of islands. Near its eastern extremity is a little island remarkable for having upon it three elevated rocks. Both the large and small islands are inhabited. Long. 190. 30. E. Lat. 63. 15. N.
