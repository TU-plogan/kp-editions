CASCANTE, a city of Spain, in the province or kingdom of Navarre. It is on the borders of the river Queiles, which rises in Aragon, and runs into the Ebro near Tudela, where, though in some seasons the bed of the river is dry, a bridge of seventeen arches is found necessary to span it in the rainy season.
