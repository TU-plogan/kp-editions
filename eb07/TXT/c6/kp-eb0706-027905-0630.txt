CENSORINUS, a grammarian and philosopher of the third century, well known by his treatise De Die Natali. This treatise, which was written about the year 238, Gerard Vossius calls a little book of gold, and pronounces it a most learned work, of the highest use and importance to chronologers, as connecting and determining, with great exactness, some of the principal eras in pagan history. The great work of Censorinus, with two fragments by unknown authors, entitled Indigitamenta and De Naturali Institutione, was first printed at Bologna in 1497, folio. It was next printed at Cambridge, with the notes of Lindenbrokius, in 1695. But the best edition is that of Havercamp, Leyden, 1743, 8vo, which was reprinted in 1767, and contains fragments of the Satires of Lucilius. The last edition is that of Gruber, Nuremberg, 1805, in 8vo.
