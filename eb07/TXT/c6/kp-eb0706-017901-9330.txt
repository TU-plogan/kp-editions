CARSTAIRS, William, an eminent Scottish divine, whose merit and good fortune called him to act in great scenes, and to associate with men to whose society and intercourse his birth gave him few pretensions to aspire. A small village in the neighbourhood of Glasgow was the place of his nativity. His father, of whom little is known, exercised the functions of a clergyman.

Young Carstairs turned his thoughts to the profession of theology; and the persecutions and oppressions of government, both in regard to civil and religious liberty, having excited his strongest indignation, it became a matter of prudence that he should prosecute his studies in a foreign university. He went accordingly to Utrecht; and bis industry and attention being directed with skill, opened up and unfolded those faculties which he afterwards employed with equal honour to his country and himself.

During his residence abroad he became acquainted with Pensionary Fagel, and entered with warmth into the interest of the Prince of Orange. On his return to Scotland in order to obtain a license to teach doctrines which he had studied with the greatest care, he became disgusted with the proud and insolent conduct of Archbishop Sharpe, and prepared to revisit Holland, where he knew that religious liberty was respected, and where he hoped he might improve his condition by the connections he had formed.

His expectations were not vain. His prudence, reserve, and political address, were strong recommendations of him to the Prince of Orange; and he was employed in personal negotiations in Holland, England, and Scotland. Upon the elevation of his master to the English throne, he was appointed the king’s chaplain for Scotland, and employed in settling the affairs of that kingdom. William, who carried politics into religion, was solicitous that episcopacy should prevail there as universally as in England. Carstairs, more conversant with the affairs of his native country, saw all the impropriety of this project, and the danger which would arise from enforcing it; and by his reasonings, remonstrances, and entreaties, he overcame the firmness of King William, who yielded to considerations founded alike in policy and in prudence; so that to Carstairs Scotland is indebted for the full establishment of its church in the Presbyterian form of government.

The death of King William was a severe affliction to him; and it happened before the prince had provided for him with the liberality he deserved. He was continued, however, in the office of chaplain for Scotland by Queen Anne; and he was invited to accept the principality of the university of Edinburgh. He was one of the ministers of the city, and four times moderator of the general assembly. Placed at the head of the church, he prosecuted its interest with zeal and integrity. Nor were his influence and activity confined to matters of religion. They were exerted with success in promoting the cultivation of the arts and sciences. The universities of Scotland owe him obligations of the highest kind. He procured, in particular, an augmentation of the salaries of their professors; a circumstance to which may be ascribed their reputation, as it enabled them to cultivate with spirit the different branches of knowledge.

A zeal for truth, a love of moderation and order, with prudence and humility, distinguished Principal Carstairs in an uncommon degree. His religion had no mixture of austerity; his secular transactions were attended with no imputation of artifice; and the versatility of his talents made him pass with ease from a court to a college. He was among the last who suffered torture before the privy council, in order to make him divulge the secrets intrusted to him, which he firmly resisted; and after the revolution, the instrument of torture called the thumbihins was given to him as a present by the council. This excellent person died in 1715; and in 1744 his State Papers and Letters, with an account of his life, were published in one volume 4to, by the Rev. Dr M‘Cormick.
