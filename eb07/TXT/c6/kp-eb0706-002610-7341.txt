CALLOT, James, a celebrated engraver, was born at Nancy in 1593. In his youth he travelled to Rome to learn designing and engraving, and thence proceeded to Florence, where the grand duke took him into his service. After the death of that prince, Callot returned to his native country, where he was very favourably received by Henry duke of Lorrain, who settled a considerable pension upon him. His reputation having soon afterwards spread all over Europe, the infanta of the Netherlands drew him to Brussels, where he engraved the siege of Breda. Louis XI11. caused him design the siege of Rochelle, and that of the Isle of Rh√©. The French king having taken Naney in 1631, made Callot a proposal for representing that new conquest, as he had already done the taking of Rochelle; but Callot begged to be excused; and some courtiers re solving to oblige him to do it, he answered, that he would sooner cut off his thumb than do any thing against the honour of his prince and country. This excuse the king accepted; and said that the Duke of Lorrain was happy in having so faithful and affectionate subjects. Callot followed his business so closely, that, though he died at forty-three years of age, he is said to have left of his own execution about fifteen hundred pieces.
