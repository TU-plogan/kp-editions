CIVIC Crown was a crown given by the ancient Romans to any soldier who had saved the life of a citizen in battle.

The civic crown was reckoned more honourable than any other crown, though composed of no better materials than oaken boughs. Plutarch, in his life of Coriolanus, accounts for the use on this occasion of the branches of the oak in preference to those of all other trees; because, says he, the oaken wreath being sacred to Jupiter, the great guardian of the city, the Romans thought it the most proper ornament for him who had preserved the life of a citizen. Pliny, lib. xvi. cap. 4, speaking of the honour and privileges conferred on those who had merited this crown, says, “They who had once obtained it might wear it al- ' ways.” When they appeared at the public spectacles, the senate and people rose to do them honour, and they took their seats on these occasions among the senators. They were not only personally excused from all troublesome offices, but the honour they enjoyed procured the same immunity for their father, and grandfather by the father’s side.
