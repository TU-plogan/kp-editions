CHARENTE, a department of France, formed out of a large portion of the ancient Angoumois and parts of Sain tonge and Limousin. The extent is 2280 square miles, or, according to the royal almanack, 588,803 hectares. It is bounded on the north by the departments of the Two Sevres and of the Vienne, on the east by' the departments of Upper Vienne and Dordogne, on the south by' Dordogne and the Lower Charente, and on the west by the latter department.

The face of the country is undulating, but nowhere in any degree mountainous. The soil is chiefly' calcareous, [7:6:326] dry, and warm, and on many of the hills is mixed with large deposits of sea-shells and other organic remains. The climate is the most agreeable, and considered as the most healthful in France. The cultivation of the vine has the precedence of agriculture in this department, and one third of the land is appropriated to that object. The best wine districts are those of Cognac and Angoulême, in both which red and white wines are very extensively produced, and the latter are chiefly applied to the preparation of brandies. Each peasant has his small distillery; and the value of the brandy exported is estimated to amount to four millions of francs annually. The corn consists of wheat, rye, maize, barley, and oats, but is scarcely sufficient for the consumption; besides the grain, some hemp, flax, saffron, and linseed are regularly supplied. There are some mines of iron, and the metal they yield is of good quality; the product is about 1100 tons annually. The inhabitants amount to 326,855, of whom about 9000 are Protestants. It is divided into five arrondissements, twenty-nine cantons, and 455 communes. The chief place is the city of Angoulême.

Charente, Lower, a department of France, formed out of the ancient district of Annis and a part of Saintonge. It is bounded on the north by La Vendée, on the north-east by the Two Sevres, on the east by the Charente, on the south by the departments of Dordogne and Gironde, and on the west by the Gironde and the ocean. The extent is 2866 square miles, or, according to the royal almanack, 716,814 hectares. The face of the country is an undulated plain. On the sea-coast the soil is marshy and rich; in the interior, but especially towards the east part, the land is either sandy or chalky. The climate is mild, and, except on the marshy sea shore, healthy. Agriculture is in a neglected state, and in years of average fertility barely produces corn sufficient for the consumption of half the inhabitants. On the meadows many cows are bred, and on the other parts are large flocks of sheep. The department produces both red and white wine beyond its own demand. One of the chief articles of commerce in the department is salt. This is made in the summer by natural evaporation; and the quantity furnished amounts, in warm seasons, to upwards of 30,000 tons. These operations are carried on in the arrondissements of Rochelle, Rochefort, and Marennes, and on the island of Oleron. The exports consist, besides salt, of wine, brandy, vinegar, fruit, hcmp, flax-seed, and cattle. There are few manufactures, and these of coarse linen or woollen for domestic use. The inhabitants amount to 406,579. The capital is Rochelle.
