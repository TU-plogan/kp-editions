CHAO-TCHEOU-FOU, a city of China, in the province of Canton. It is of the second rank, and comprehends, according to the policy of that empire, six others under its jurisdiction. It is situated on a navigable river, which is crossed by two bridges of boats, and is divided in the neighbourhood into two branches. The city is surrounded by ancient walls, and is irregularly built; its garrison, which is considerable, is armed with matchlocks, bows, and arrows. The town is not healthy, the inhabitants being liable to a contagious disorder which is fatal to many. There is a celebrated monastery in the neighbourhood, the founder of which was as noted for austerity as his successors have been for the laxity of their manners. There is here a manufacture of nankeen; but the chief commerce consists in a kind of oil extracted from the tcha-tchou, which resembles the tea plant. It is estimated to contain 10,000 families, and is 232 miles from Canton.
