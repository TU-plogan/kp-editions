CIGNANI, Carlo, an Italian painter, was born at Bologna in 1628. He was the disciple of Albani, and was esteemed by Pope Clement XI. who nominated him prince of the academy of Bologna, and loaded him with favours. Cignani died at Forli in 1719. The cupola of La Madonna del Fuoco at Forli, in which he represented Paradise, is an admirable work. His principal pictures are to be found at Rome, Bologna, and Forli.
