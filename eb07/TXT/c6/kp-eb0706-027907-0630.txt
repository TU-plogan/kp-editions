CENSUS, in Roman antiquity, an authentic declaration made before the censors, by the several subjects of the empire, of their respective names and places of abode. This declaration was registered by the censors, and contained an enumeration in writing of all the estates, lands, and inheritances they possessed; including quantity, quality, place, wives, children, domestics, tenants, slaves. In the provinces the census served not only to discover the substance of each person, but where, and in what manner and proportion, taxes might be best imposed. The census at Rome is commonly thought to have been held every five years; but Dr Middleton has shown that both census and lustrum were held irregularly and uncertainly at various intervals. The census was an excellent expedient for ascertaining the strength of the state, inasmuch as by it they discovered the number of the citizens, how many were fit for war, and how many were qualified for offices of other kinds, as well as how much each was able to pay in taxes and imposts. It extended to all ranks of people, though under different names; that of the common people was called census ; that of the knights, census, recensio, recognitio ; that of the senators, lectio, relectio. Hence also census came to signify a person who had made such a declaration; in which sense it was opposed to incensus, a [7:6:280]person who had not given in his estate or name to be registered. The census, according to Salmasíus, was peculiar to the city of Rome. That in the provinces was properly called professio and a~ογtaφr l . But this distinction is not everywhere observed by the ancients themselves.

The term has, in Britain and other modern countries, been applied to those enumerations and classifications of the people which have at different times been ordered by government. See England. Census Senatorius, the patrimony of a senator, which was limited to a certain value, being at first rated at 800,000 sesterces, but afterwards, under Augustus, enlarged to 1,200,000.

Census Equester, the estate or patrimony of a knight, rated at 400,000 sesterces, which was necessary to qualify a person for that order, and without which no virtue or merit was available.

Census Dominicatus, in writers of the lower age, denotes a rent due to the lord.

Census Duplicatus, a double rent or tax paid by vassals to their lord on extraordinary or urgent occasions, as expeditions to the Holy Land, and the like.

Census Ecclesioe Romanae, was an annual contribution voluntarily paid to the see of Rome by the several princes of Europe.
