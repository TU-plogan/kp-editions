CAREENING, in naval language, the bringing a ship to incline on one side, in order to trim and caulk the other side.

A ship is said to be brought to the careen when, the most of her lading being taken out, she is hulled down on one side by a small vessel, as low as necessary, and there kept by the weight of the ballast, ordnance, &c. as well as by ropes, lest her masts should be strained too much, in order that her sides and bottom may be trimmed, her seams caulked, or any thing that is faulty under water mended. Hence, when a ship lies on one side when she sails, she is said to sail on the careen.
