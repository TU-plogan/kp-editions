CHELTENHAM, a town in the hundred of the same name, in the county of Gloucester, ninety-five miles from London. It takes its name from the small river Chilt, which passes through the town in its way to the Severn. It has long been celebrated for its mineral spring, whose supply of water was small; but of late years new springs have been discovered, more copious in their produce, in consequence of which the company resorting to it has increased, and a corresponding number of new private and public buildings have been erected. It now, in extent and elegance, more resembles a large city than the small town it was forty years ago. The situation, at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, is healthy 7 , picturesque, and pleasant, and affords means of gratifying both pedestrians and equestrians. The pump-rooms, theatre, ball-rooms, hotels, public walks, and lodging houses, are well arranged, and admirably adapted for the visitors who resort to this Spa. The markets are well and reasonably 7 supplied. The population amounted in 1811 to 8325, in 1821 to 13,396, and in 1831 to 22,942.
