CARPI, a principality of Modena, in Italy, situated about four leagues from that city.

Carpi, Ugo da, an Italian painter, of no very considerable talents in the art, but remarkable for being the inventor of that species of engraving on wood, distinguished by the name of chiaro-scuro, in imitation of drawing. This is performed by using more blocks than one. Ugo da Carpi usually had three; the first for the outline and dark shadows, the second for the lighter shadows, and the third for the half tint. In this manner he struck off prints after several designs, and cartoons of Raphael, particularly one of the Sibyl, a Descent from the Cross, and the History of Simon the Sorcerer. He died in 1500. The art was brought to a still higher degree of perfection by Balthazar Peruzzi of Siena, and Parmigiano, who published several excellent designs in this manner.

Carpγ, Girolamo da, historical and portrait painter, was born at Ferrara in 1501, and became a disciple of Garo-fala. When he quitted that master, he devoted his whole time, thoughts, and attention to study the works of Correggio, and to copy them with the most critical care and observation; in which labour he spent several years at Parma, Modena, and other cities of Italy, where the best works of that exquisite painter were preserved. He acquired such excellence in the imitation of Correggio’s style, and in copying his pictures, that many paintings finished by him were taken for originals, and not only admired, but eagerly purchased by the connoisseurs of that time. Nor is it improbable that several of the paintings of Girolamo da Carpi pass at this day for genuine works of Correggio himself. He died in 1556.
