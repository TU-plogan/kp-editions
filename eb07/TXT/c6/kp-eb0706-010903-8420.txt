CAPELLUS, Lewis, an eminent French Protestant divine, born at Sedan in Champagne about the year 1579. He was the author of some learned works, but is chiefly known from the controversy he engaged in with the younger Buxtorf Concerning the antiquity of the Hebrew points or Masora, which Capellus undertook to disprove. His Critica Sacra was also an elaborate work, and excited some disputes. He died in 1658, having made an abridgment of his life in his work De Gente Capellori.
