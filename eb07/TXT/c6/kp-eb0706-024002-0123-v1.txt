CATAPHRACTA (from κατα and φgx,<Mω, I fortify or arm), in the ancient military art, a piece of heavy defensive armour, formed of cloth or leather, fortified with iron scales or links, with which sometimes the breast, sometimes the whole body of the rider, and sometimes the horse also, were covered. It was in use among the Sarmatians, Persians, and other barbarians. The Romans early adopted it for their foot, and, according to Vegetius, retained it till the time of Gratian, when the military discipline becoming relaxed, and field exercises and labour being discontinued, the Roman foot thought the cataphracta, as well as the helmet, too heavy a load to bear, and therefore threw it aside, choosing rather to march against the enemy bare-breasted; so that in the war with the Goths multitudes were destroyed.

Cataphractae Naves, ships armed and covered in fight so that they could not be easily damaged by the enemy. They were covered over with boards or planks, on which the soldiers were placed to defend them; the rowers sitting underneath entirely sheltered from the enemy’s weapons.
