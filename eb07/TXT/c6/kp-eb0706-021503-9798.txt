CASPE, a rich and populous city of Spain, in the province of Aragon, containing 8200 inhabitants. It is situated on the banks of the river Martin, which runs into the Ebro. Its prosperity has arisen from the mines of iron and of coal which abound in its vicinity, and which have given birth to many manufactories, but by no means so many' as the mineral riches of the district would create, or as the wants of the accessible provinces of Spain could consume.
