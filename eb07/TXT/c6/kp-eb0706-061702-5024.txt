CHIUN, or Ciievan, in Hebrew antiquity, a word which we meet with in the prophet Amos, cited in the Acts of the Apostles. St Luke reads the passage thus: “Ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them.” The import of the Hebrew is, “Ye have borne the tabernacle of your kings, and the pedestal (chiun) of your images, the star of your gods, which ye made to yourselves.” The Septuagint in all probability read lie-pliam or Pevan, instead of Claun or Chexan, and took the pedestal for a god. Some say that the Septuagint, who made their translation in Egypt, changed the word Chiun into that of Pemphan, because they had the same signification. M. Basnage, in his book entitled Jeινish Antiquities, after having discoursed a good deal upon Chiun, or Ilemphan, concludes that Moloch was the sun, and Chion, Chiun, or Lłemphan, the moon.
