CINTRA, a town of Portugal, in the province of Estremadura, [7:6:701]with 1900 inhabitants, a little to the north of Lisbon. It is a most delightful spot, at the foot of a stupendous rocky mountain, and contains a palace of Gothic architecture. A monastery near it is asserted to be at the elevation of 3000 feet above the level of the sea. The town is not large, but the variety of fruits which it produces, and the salubrity of the air, render it a place of considerable resort to the richer inhabitants of Lisbon. It has attracted considerable notice, from being the spot where was concluded a convention, by which the army of France was permitted to retire from Portugal, after having been defeated by an inferior British force at Vimicro.
