CERNE Abbas, a market-town of the hundred of Totcombe, in the county of Dorset, seven miles from Dorchester, and 123 from London. It is chiefly remarkable for a figure of unknown ancient date, cut on the side of a hill. It represents a giant with a club. The height of the person is 180 feet, and it covers an acre of ground; between his legs arc three rude letters scarcely legible, and over them the modern figures 748. It is said by some to be the representation of Cenric, son of Cuthred, king of Wessex, who was slain in battle; and by others it is supposed to be the figure of some deity, and these have con-je â€œlured the letters to be JAO. It is repaired once every seven years, by filling up the lines with chalk. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 847, in 1811 to 951, and in 1821 to 1060.

CERNEUX-Pequinot, a town in the department of the Doubs, in France, close to which, on the frontiers of Switzerland, is a celebrated mineral spring. The town, including the inhabitants on the adjoining lake, contains 1325 persons.
