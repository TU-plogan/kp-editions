CHALDEA, in Ancient Geography, when taken in a larger sense, included Babylonia; as in the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. In a restricted sense, it denoted a province of Babylonia, towards Arabia Deserta; called in Scripture The land of the Chaldeans, and so named from Chaled, the fourth son of Nahor. See Babylonia.
