CALVADOS, a department of France, formed out of that part of Lower Normandy formerly distinguished as Bessin, Bocage, Champagne dé Caen, Auge, and Licu-rain. It has received its present name from a chain of rocks so called, at a small distance from the shore, between the mouths of the rivers Orne and Bire, about sixteen miles in extent. It is bounded on the north by the sea, on the east by the department of the Eure, on the south by that of Orne, and on the west by that of Manche. The extent is 1123 square miles, or 570,400 hectares. It is divided into six arrondissements, and subdivided into thirty-seven cantons, formed out of 896 communes, which contain 505,420 inhabitants. The face of the country is undulating, with no lofty hills or deep valleys. The streams are numerous, but of short course; and the fcw of them, as the Orne and the Bire, that are navigable, are only so to a short distance from their mouths. The soil in the valleys is alluvial, and forms excellent pasture. On the plains it is a mixture of clay and chalk, but in the more hilly district of the south it is sandy, resting on a subsoil partly of chalk and slate and partly of clay and granite. The climate is clear and healthy, but rather more inclined to moisture than to dryness; and in the latter cnd of the summer, when the wind is westerly, it is commonly cold and rainy. The winter is much prolonged. As the land is more adapted to the breeding and fattening of cattle than to arable cultivation, the department scarcely produces more corn than is equal to half the consumption of the year; but its surplus of butter, cheese, and meat, is exchanged for grain with the surrounding districts. The breed of sheep is far inferior to that of cows, and the wool is by no means of good quality. Fruit is abundant, especially apples and pears, the cider from which supplies the place of wine, which the department does not produce. Hemp and flax are raised, of good quality, and equal to the internal demand. Manufactures arc established in many of the towns, and are flourishing. They afford clothing of wool, cotton, artd linen, equal to their own demand, and supply other parts with a portion. There are some fisheries on the coast. Coal is also found, and some iron, but the mines are not extensively worked. Fuel is provided partly from the forests, but in a greater degree from the turf of the heaths.
