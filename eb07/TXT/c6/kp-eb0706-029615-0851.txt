CERVERA, a town of Spain, in the province of Catalonia. It lies between Manresa and Lerida, rather nearer to the river Segre than the Llobregat. It contains a very magnificent university, which was established at the beginning of the last century, when the different colleges of Catalonia were abolished on account of their opposition to the Bourbons. It is now the principal place of education in the province. It is situated in latitude 4L 39., and possesses a population of about 5000 souls. The university contains forty-three professors, and 800 students.

Cervera, a town of Spain, in the province of Soria, in Castile. It is watered by the river Alhama, which, though of short course, fructifies a tract of most productive land. Cervera contains about 5000 inhabitants, who are rich and industrious, and cultivate wheat, olives, hemp, and flax, and weave the latter into linen and sailcloth, which are distributed by themselves over the peninsula.
