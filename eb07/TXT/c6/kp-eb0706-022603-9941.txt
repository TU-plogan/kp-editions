CASTELETON, a town in the hundred of High Peake, in the county of Derby, 198 miles from London. It is [7:6:227]situated at the foot of a lofty range of mountains, and is celebrated for the extraordinary natural excavations in them, the most remarkable of which is Peake Hole, a curiosity elsewhere described in this work. Near to it is the Speedwell mine, in which is a wonderful subterranean cataract. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 931, in 1821 to 1428, and in 1831 to 1329.
