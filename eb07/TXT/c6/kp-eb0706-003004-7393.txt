CAMALODUNUM, in Ancient Geography, a town of the Trinobantes, the first Roman colony in Britain. From the Itineraries it appears to have stood where Malden now stands. It continued to be an open town under the Romans, a place of pleasure rather than strength, yet not unadorned with splendid works, as a theatre and a temple of Claudius; which the Britons had considered as badges of slavery, and which gave rise to several seditions and commotions.
