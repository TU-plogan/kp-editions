CARP, the English name of a species of cyprinus. See Ichthyology.

.The carp is the most valuable of all kinds of fish for stocking ponds. It is very quick in its growth, and brings forth the spawn three times a year, so that the increase is very great. The female does not begin to breed till eight or nine years old, so that in breeding ponds a supply must be kept of carp of that age. The best judges allow, that in stocking a breed-pond, four males should be allowed to twelve females. The usual growth of a carp is two or three inches in length in a year; but in ponds which receive the fattening of common sewers they have been known to grow from five inches to eighteen in one year. A feeding pond of one acre in extent will very well feed three hundred carp of three years old, three hundred of two years, and four hundred of one year old. Carp delight greatly in ponds that have marly sides; they love also clay-ponds well sheltered from the winds and overgrown with weeds and long grass at the edges, which they feed on in the hot months. Carp and tcnch thrive very fast in ponds and rivers near the sea, where the water is a little brackish; but they are not so well tasted as those which live in fresh water.
