CAMAIEU, or Camåyeu, a word used to express a peculiar sort of onyx; also a stone, on which are found various figures, and representations of landscapes, or the like, formed by a kind of lusus naturoe, so as to exhibit pictures without painting. It is of these camaieux Pliny is to be understood as speaking when he says of the manifold pictures of gems, and the particooured spots of precious stones: Gemmarum pictura tarn multiplex lapidumque tarn discolores maxulce. Camaïeu is also frequently applied to any kind of gem on which figures are engraved either indentedly or in relievo. In this sense the lapidaries of Paris are called, in their statutes, cutters of camaieux.

A society of learned men at Florence undertook to procure all the cameos or camaieux and intaglios in the great duke’s gallery to be engraven; and began to draw the heads of different emperors in cameos. Camaïeu is also used for a painting, where there is only one colour, and where the lights and shadows are of gold, wrought on a golden or azure ground. When the ground is yellow, the French call it cirage·, when gray, grissaile. This kind of work is chiefly used to represent basso relievos. The Greeks call pieces of such sort μwο- ^ωματα.
