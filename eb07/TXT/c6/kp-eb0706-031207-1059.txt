CHAMANIM, in the Jewish antiquities, is the Hebrew name for that which the Greeks call Pyreia or Pyrateria; and St Jerome in Leviticus has translated simulacra, in Isaiah, delubra. These chamanim were, according to Rabbi Solomon, idols exposed to the sun upon the tops of houses. Abenezoa says they were portable chapels or temples made in the form of chariots, in honour of the sun. What the Greeks call Pyreia were temples consecrated to the sun and fire, in which a perpetual fire was kept up. They were built upon eminences, and were large enclosures without covering, where the sun was worshipped. The Guebres, or worshippers of fire, in Persia and the East Indies, have still these Pyreia. The word chamaâˆ™ nim is derived from chaman, which signified to warm or burn.
