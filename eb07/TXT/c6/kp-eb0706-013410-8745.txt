CARBUNCLE, a name formerly given to garnet.

Carbuncle, in Heraldry, a charge or bearing, consisting of eight radii, four of which make a common cross, and the other four a saltier. Some call these radii buttons or staves, because they are round, and enriched with buttons, or pearled like pilgrimsâ€™ staves, and frequently tipped or terminated with fleurs-de-lis; others blazon them, royal sceptres, placed in saltier, pale and fesse.
