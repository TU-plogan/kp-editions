CIIANDERNAGORE, the principal settlement of the French in Bengal, in a healthy situation on the western bank of the Hooghly or Bhagarutty river. It is about three quarters of a mile long, and is a very neat town, surrounded by a small territory, which extends on the bank of the river, and one mile inland. The height of the houses is generally two stories; they have colonnades in front, and green Venetian windows, and are built of brick and mortar, plastered over with fine chunam, both inside and out. They have generally flat roofs, on which their proprietors sit in the evening and receive company. The French having obtained this situation for their factory in 1676, they afterwards fortified it, and the factory continued to flourish till the year 1757, when it was attacked by Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive, who, having forced it to surrender, dismantled its fortifications. Having remained since that period without protection, it has been quietly taken possession of by the English in every successive war, and as constantly restored at the peace. It was delivered over to the French governor on the 4th of December 1816. Long. 88. 26. E. Lat. 22. 49. N.
