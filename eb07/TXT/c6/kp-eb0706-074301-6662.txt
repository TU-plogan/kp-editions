Clermont Manuscript is a copy of St Paul’s Epistles, found in the monastery of Clermont in France, and used by Beza, together with the Cambridge manuscript, in preparing his edition of the New Testament. This copy is in the octavo form, and is written on fine vellum, in Greek and Latin, with some mutilations. Beza supposes that it is of equal antiquity with the Cambridge copy; but both were probably written by a Latin scribe at a later period than he assigns to them. The various readings of this manuscript were communicated to Archbishop Usher, and they are preserved by Walton. The manuscript itself was in the possession of Morinus, and after his death deposited among the manuscript copies in the royal library at Paris.
