CAMILLUS, Marcus Furius, was the first who rendered the family of Furius illustrious. He triumphed four times, was five times dictator, and was honoured with the title of the second founder of Rome. In a word, he acquired all the glory which a man can gain in his own country. Lucius Apuleius, one of the tribunes, prosecuted him in order to compel him to render an account of the spoils taken at Veii. Camillus anticipated judgment, and banished himself voluntarily. But during his banishment, instead of rejoicing at the devastation of Rome by the Gauls, he exerted all his wisdom and bravery to drive away the enemy, and yet kept with the utmost strictness the sacred law of Rome, in refusing to accept the command, which several private persons offered him. In the year of the city 363, the Romans who were besieged in the capitol created him dictator; and in this office he acted with so much bravery and conduct, that he entirely drove the army of the Gauls out of the territories of the commonwealth. He died in the eighty-first year of his age, 365 years before the Christian era.
