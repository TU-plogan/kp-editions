CATILINE, Lucius Sergius, a Roman of a noble family, who, having spent his whole fortune in debauchery and vice, formed the design of oppressing his country, destroying the senate, assassinating the consuls, seizing the public treasury, setting Rome on fire, and usurping a sovereign power. In order to prosecute this design, he drew into his plot some young noblemen, whom he prevailed upon, it is said, to drink human blood as a pledge of their union. His conspiracy, however, was discovered by the vigilance of Cicero, who was then consul; upon which, retiring from Rome, he, with several of the conspirators, put himself at the head of an army, and fought with incredible valour against Petreius, lieutenant to Antony, who was the colleague of Cicero in the consulship; but he was defeated and killed in battle.
