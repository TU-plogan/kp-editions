CHINABALABARAM, a town of Hindustan, in the territories of the rajah of Mysore. Between sixty and seventy years ago it belonged to an independent polygar chief, but was taken by Hyder Ali about the year 1759. During the wars in which Lord Cornwallis was engaged it was taken possession of by the British forces, and the authority restored to the Hindu family; in revenge for which the town was in a great part destroyed by Tippoo Sultan. From this calamity it is now fast recovering, and already contains from 400 to 500 houses, of which one fourth are occupied by Brahmins. The neighbouring country produces abundance of sugar, which is carried to the town, and there refined into sugar candy, equal to that of China, or into clayed sugar, which is very white and fine, and is held in great estimation all over the peninsula. Long. 77. 55. Ä½. Lat. 13. 26. N.
