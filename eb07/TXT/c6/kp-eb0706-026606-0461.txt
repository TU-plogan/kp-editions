CAXTON, William, memorable for having first introduced the art of printing into his native country, was born in Kent about the year 1410. Having served an apprenticeship to a mercer, Caxton on his demise went to the Netherlands as agent for the mercer’s company, in which situation he continued about twenty-three years. Whilst abroad he became acquainted with the newly-discovered art of printing, and in 1471 printed at Cologne a work entitled “The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye, by Raoul le Fleure.” This book is very valuable, as being the earliest specimen of typography in the English language. After this he printed several works abroad, and at length returned to his native country, furnished with materials for practising the art. The first work he printed after his arrival, was the “Game and Playe of the Cliesse,” the first book executed in England. Caxton continued to exercise this new vocation for about twenty years, during which time he produced between fifty and sixty volumes, most of which were composed or translated by himself. His books are printed on a sort of vellum paper, and the errors of the press are corrected in red ink with his own hand, what are technically termed errata being then unknown. The life of Caxton has been written by the Rev. John Lewis, minister of Margate in Kent, London, 1737, one volume large 8vo; and the reader may also consult Middleton’s “Dissertation on the Origin of Printing in England.” He died in 1492, and was interred, according to some, in Campden, Glamorganshire; whilst others state that his remains were deposited in St Margaret’s, Westminster.
