CLAGET, William, an eminent and learned divine, born in 1646. He was preacher to the society of Gray’s Inn, which employment he exercised until his death in 1688, when he was also one of the king’s chaplains. Archbishop Sharp gives him an excellent character, and Bishop Burnet has ranked him amongst those worthy men whose lives and labours contributed to rescue the church from the reproaches which the follies of others had drawn upon it. Dr Claget published several things, but his principal work is his “Discourse concerning the Operations of the Holy Spirit.” He was one of those divines who made a resolute stand against the designs of James II. to introduce popery. Four volumes of his sermons were published after his death by his brother Nicholas Claget, archdeacon of Sudbury, father of Nicholas Claget, afterwards bishop of Exeter.
