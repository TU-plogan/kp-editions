CHESTER, a city, the capital of the county of the same name, in the hundred of Broxton. It is situated on the river Dee, over which is a fine bridge of twelve arches. The buildings are very antique, and the fronts of them have wooden galleries projecting towards the street, under and on which is a dry promenade in all weather. The cathedral has no particular attraction, but the chapter-house is an object of great admiration. The see of the bishop extends over Cheshire and Lancashire, and a part of λVest-moreland, Cumberland, and Yorkshire, with two parishes in Denbighshire and five in Flintshire. The ancient walls [7:6:520] are in a good state of preservation, and afford a pleasing . promenade of nearly two miles in length. Λt Chester a] large fair was formerly held, to which the manufacturers of linen brought their goods from Ireland. Of late'some ∣ cotton manufactories have been established. The city is governed by a mayor, recorder, twenty-four aldermen, and forty common councilmen. Its shipping trade is inconsiderable. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 17,302, in 1821 to 19,949, and in 1831 to 21,363.
