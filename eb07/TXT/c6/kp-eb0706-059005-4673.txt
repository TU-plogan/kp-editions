CHIROGRAPH was anciently a deed which, requiring a counterpart, was engrossed twice on the same piece of parchment counterwise, leaving a space between, in which was written Chirograph, and through the middle of which the parchment was cut, sometimes straight, sometimes in-dentedly, and รก moiety given to each of the parties. This was afterwards called dividenda and chartae divisa, and was the same with what we now call charter-party. The first use of these chirographs in England was in the time of Henry III.
