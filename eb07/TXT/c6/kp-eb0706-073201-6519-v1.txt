CLASMIUM, an old term in Natural History, applied to some fossils, of the class of gypsums, the characters of which are, that they are of a soft texture, and of a dull opaque look, being composed, as are all the other gypsums, of irregularly arranged flat particles. The word is derived from the Greek ×kα<sμοζ, a fragrant or small particle; from the flaky small particles of which these bodies are composed. Of this genus there is only one known species. This is of a tolerably regular and even structure; though very coarse and harsh to the touch. It is of a very lively and beautiful red colour; and is found in thiek roundish masses, which, when broken, are to be seen composed of irregular arrangements of flat partieles, and emulate a striated texture. It will neither give fire with steel nor ferment with acids; but calcines very freely and easily, and affords a very valuable plaster of Paris, as do all the purer gypsums. It is common in Italy, and is greatly esteemed there; it is also found in some parts of England, particularly Derbyshire; but there it is not much regarded.
