CAPITE, in Law (from caput, that is, rex, whence tenere in capite is to hold of the king, the head or lord-paramount of all the lands in the kingdom), an ancient tenure of land, held immediately of the king, as of the crown, either by knight’s service or by soccage.

Capite Censi, in Antiquity, the lowest rank of Roman citizens, who in public taxes were rated the least of all, being such as never were worth above 365 asses. They were supposed to have been so denominated because they were rather counted and marshalled by their heads than by their estates. The capite censi formed part of the sixth class of citizens, being below the proletarii, who constituted the other moiety of that class. They were not enrolled in the army, as being judged unable to support the expense of war; for in those days the soldiers maintained themselves. It does not appear that before the time of [7:6:123] Caius Marius any of the Roman generals enlisted the capite censi in their armies.
