CALL, among hunters, a lesson blown upon the horn to comfort the hounds.

Call, among sailors, a sort of whistle or pipe, of silver or brass, used by the boatswain and his mates to summon the sailors, to their duty, and direct them in the different employments in the ship. As the call can be sounded to various strains, each of them is appropriated to some particular exercise, such as hoisting, heaving, lowering, veering away, belaying, letting go a tackle, &c. The act of winding this instrument is called piping, which is as attentively observed by sailors as the beat of the drum to march, retreat, rally, or charge, is obeyed by soldiers.

Call, among fowlers, the noise or cry of a bird, especially to its young, or to its mate in coupling time.
