CATEGORY, in Logic, a series or order of all the predicates or attributes contained under any genus. The scłiool philosophers distribute all the objects of our thoughts and ideas into certain genera or classes, which the Greeks called categories, and the Latins predicaments. See Aristotle’s Philosophy.
