CLEOMBROTUS, a king of Sparta, son of Anaxan-drides, who was deterred from building a wall across the isthmus of Corinth, against the approach of the Persians, by an eclipse of the sun. He died in the 75th Olympiad, and was succeeded by Plistarchus, son of Leonidas, a minor.

Cleombrotus II. son of Pausanias, king of Sparta, and brother to Agesipolis I. He made war against the Boeotians, and, lest he should be suspected of treacherous communications with Epaminondas, he gave that general battle at Leuctra, on very disadvantageous ground. He was killed in the engagement, and his army destroyed, in the year of Rome 382.

Cleombrotus III. a son-in-law of Leonidas, king of Sparta, who for a while usurped the kingdom after the expulsion of his father-in-law. Upon the rccal of Leonidas, Clcombrotus was banished, and his wife Chelonis, who had accompanied her father, now attended her husband in his exile.
