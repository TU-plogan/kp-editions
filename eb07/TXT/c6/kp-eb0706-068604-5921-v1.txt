CHUQUISACA, the capital city of Bolivia, in the department of Chuquisaca, is situated at an elevation of 9331 feet above the level of the sea. It stands upon a plain, and is surrounded by a chain of eminences, which shelter it from the winds. The climate is mild and healthy, the temperature throughout the year presenting no great variation; but in winter heavy storms are not unfrequent, and the rains continue a considerable time. The vegetation of the surrounding district is rich and luxuriant, and accordingly it is looked upon as one of the gardens of Bolivia which supply the necessaries of life to those inhabiting higher and less prolific regions. Chuquisaca formerly was named La Plata, from its contiguity to silver mines. It was founded in 1539 by one of Pizarro’s captains. In 1551 it was erected into a bishopric, and in 1608 was raised to an archbishopric. The best houses are only one story high, but they are roomy, and in general all have gardens planted wiţh European fruit trees. The public buildings of this city are, a royal university, a large and handsome cathedral, a parochial church, five monastic establishments, all spacious buildings, with splendid churches, a conventual hospital, and three nunneries. The population, which consists of Creoles and Indians, amounts to about 18,000. Lat. 19. 31. N.
