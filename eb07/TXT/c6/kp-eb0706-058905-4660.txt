CHINSURA, the principal Dutch settlement in Bengal, situated on the western bank of the Bhagarutty or Hooghly river, twenty-four miles above Calcutta. The Dutch erected a factory here in 1656, on a clear and healthy spot of ground, much preferable to that on which Calcutta is situated, and soon attracted a considerable number of natives to settle in the vicinity. About thirty-five years after this they fell under the displeasure of one of the native potentates, who sequestrated their property and prohibited their traffic. In the year 1686 all their factories were re-established, and their trade continued to flourish for a long period. At the time when the English were contending for the sovereignty of Bengal, the Dutch withheld the duties on their commerce, on which account Chinsura was blockaded in the year 1769, by an army commanded by one of the Nawabâ€™s officers, though the country was then in possession of the English. In the year 1795, when Holland became a province of France, the British offered to retain Chinsura for the stadtholder; but the governor having declined to surrender, the settlement was reduced by a detachment from the military stations at Barrackpore, and was occupied by a British garrison during the whole war, but restored to the Dutch at the general peace of 1814. The town, which extends for half a mile along the banks of the river, is neatly built, but with great solidity, of brick and mortar. The houses are plastered with fine lime, and have flat roofs and green Venetian windows. The Dutch maintain no military establishment here, the ascendency of the English being now so decided in India. They have factories at Patna, Dacca, and other places, which are dependent on Chinsura.
