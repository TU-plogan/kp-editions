CENT signifies properly a hundred, being an abridgment of the word centum ; but it is often used in commerce to express the profit or loss arising from the sale of any commodity; so that when it is said there is ten per cent, profit, or ten per cent, loss, upon any merchandise which has been sold, it is to be understood that the seller has either gained or lost L.10 on every L.100 of the price at which he bought that merchandise, which is ⅛ of profit, or ⅛ of loss, upon the total of the sale.
