CHATTERPOOR, a city of Hindustan, in the province of Allahabad, and district of Bundelcund. This is a very ancient town, which was founded by a rajah named Chuttersal, and was occasionally his residence. It was in consequence a very flourishing city, and an important commercial mart, being a great entrep√¥t of trade between Benares and the Deccan, and at a very short distance from the diamond mines of Pannah. It was once an extensive town and well built, the houses being of stone; but it is now comparatively desolate. On the conclusion of the last peace with the Mahrattas it came into the possession of the British, before which it was occupied, along with a large portion of the surrounding territory, by a petty chief, who, assisted by others, had rendered the country a perpetual scene of disturbance. The travelling distance from Agra is 212 miles, from Calcutta 698, and from Bombay 747 miles. Long. 79. 53. E. Lat. 24. 57. N.
