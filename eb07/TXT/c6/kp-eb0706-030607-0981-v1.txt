CHAJOTLI, or Ciiayoti, a Mexican fruit, of a round shape, and similar, in the husk with which it is covered, to the chestnut, but four or five times larger, and of a much deeper green colour. Its kernel is of a greenish-white, and has a large stone in the middle, which is white, and like it in substance. It is boiled, and the stone eaten with it. This fruit is produced by a twining perennial plant, the root of which is also good to eat.
