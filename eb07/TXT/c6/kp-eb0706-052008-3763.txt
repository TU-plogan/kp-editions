CHIAPA, an intendancy of Mexico is bounded on the north by Tabasco, on the north-east by Yucatan, on the west by Oaxaca and Vera Cruz, and on the south by So-conusco. This province, lying alike contiguous to Mexicoand the central states, was claimed by both; but the option being given to the inhabitants, Chiapa declared its wish to join the Mexican union, while the district of So-conusco adhered to the central federation. The climate of this intendancy is hot and moist; but there are large tracts of mountainous country covered with forests of cedar, cypress, pine, and walnut trees. In the lower regions there are also extensive woods, in which the American lion, the ounce, the wild boar, parrots of great beauty, and numbers of serpents, abound. Goats, sheep, and pigs of the European breed have greatly multiplied in this intendancy, and its horses are so highly esteemed that colts are sent to Mexico The chief productions are cotton, cocoa, maize, cochineal, honey, and aromatic gums. Chiapa contains one city, one town, and an immense number of villages, with about 128,000 inhabitants, of whom a great number are Indians. Near the borders of Yucatan, the vestiges of a considerable Indian capital were accidentally discovered about the middle of the last century. They stand in the midst of a fertile and salubrious tract of country, but which is almost entirely depopulated[7:6:521]. The hieroglyphics, emblems, and architectural remains, are of a highly interesting kind. The former are said by a learned Spaniard to resemble the Egyptian.

Chiapa dos Espagnos, or Ciudad Real, the capital of the intendancy, and an episcopal city, is situated in the plain of'Gueizacattan, about 130 leagues north-west of the city of Guatimala. It contains only one parish, that of the cathedral; but there are four convents, a nunnery, a church dedicated to Our Lady of Charity, two other chapels without the walls, and five for the Indians. It is a place of some trade. The inhabitants are about 4000 in number. Long. 94. 16. W. Lat. 16. 35. N.

Ciiiapa dos Indos, the largest place in the whole province, and a very ancient vjjlage, is advantageously situated in a valley near the banks of the river Tabasco. The inhabitants are chiefly Indians, but they are reported to be rich; and a great quantity of sugar is raised in the district. The heat is excessive during the day, but the nights are cool. This place enjoys many privileges, and is rising into importance. The inhabitants are about 15,000 in number. Long. 93. 53. W. Lat. 17. 5. N.
