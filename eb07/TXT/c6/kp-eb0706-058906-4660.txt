CHINUUB, or Chunaub, the ancient Acesines, a river which has its source near the eastern hills of Cashmere, in the province of Lahore, near the sources of the Ravey, the Beyah, the Sutlege, and the Jumna. Its general course is to the south-west, and remarkably straight. After leaving Jummoo, it flows through a flat country, gradually approaching the Behut, with which it unites near Jehung-sect∙ The junction· is effected with great noise and violence; and this circumstance, Rennell remarks, being noted both by the historians of Alexander and Timur, fixes the identity of the spot. The space between the Chinuub and the Bchut is nowhere more than thirty geographical miles within the limits of the Punjab. About ninety miles from its source, and not far from the Cashmere Hills, it is seventy yards broad, and very rapid. The length of its course, including its windings, is estimated at four hundred and twenty miles.
