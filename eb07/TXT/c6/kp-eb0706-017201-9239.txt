CARPENTUM, in Antiquity, a name common to different sorts of vehicles, answering to coaches as well as waggons, or even carts, among us. The carpentum was originally a kind of car or vehicle in which the Roman ladies were carried, though in after-times it was also used in war. Some derive the word from carro ; others from Carmenta, the mother of Evander, by a slight literal conversion.
