CELLARER, or Cellerer (Cellerarius or Cellarius), an officer in monasteries, to whom belonged the care and procurement of provisions for the convent. The denomination is said to have been borrowed from the Roman law, where cellarius denotes an examiner of accounts and expenses. Ulpian defines it thus: “Cellerarius, id est, ideo praepositus ut rationes salvae sint.”

The cellerarius was one of the four ohedientiañi, or great officers of monasteries. Under his orders were the pistrinum or bakehouse, and the bracinum or brewhouse, ln [7:6:273]the richer houses there were particular lands set apart for the maintenance of his office, called in ancient writings ad cibum monachorum. The cellerarius was a great man in the convent; and his whole office in ancient times had respect to its origin. He was bound to see his lord’s corn got in, and laid up in granaries; and his appointment consisted in a certain proportion of grain, usually fixed at a thirteenth part of the whole, together with a furred gown. The office of cellarer then differed only in name from those of bailiff and minstrel, excepting that the cellarer had the receipt of his lord’s rents throughout the whole extent of his jurisdiction.

Cellarer was also an officer in chapters, to whom belonged the care of the temporals, and particularly the distribution of bread, wine, and money, to canons, on account of their attendance in the choir. In some places he was called cellarer, in others burser, and in others currier.
