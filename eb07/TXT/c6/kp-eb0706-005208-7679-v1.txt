CAMPUS, in antiquity, a field or plain in a city, not built upon, but left vacant for shows, combats, exercises, and other uses of the citizens.

Campus Mail, in ancient customs, an anniversary assemblage of our ancestors held on May-day, when they confederated together for the defence of the kingdom against all its e'nemies.

Campus Martius, a large plain in the suburbs of ancient Rome, lying between the Quirinal and Capitoline Mounts and the Tiber, and so called because it was consecrated to the god Mars, and set apart for military sports and exercises, as the use and handling of arms, and all manner of feats of activity, to which the Roman youth were trained. Here races were run, either with chariots or single horses; and here also stood the villa publica, or palace for the reception of ambassadors, who were not permitted to enter the city. Many of the public comitia were held in the same field, part of which was for that purpose cantoned out. The place was also nobly decorated with statues, arches, columns, porticoes, and the like structures.

Campus Sceleratus, a place without the walls of ancient Rome, where the vestals who had violated their vows of virginity were buried alive.
