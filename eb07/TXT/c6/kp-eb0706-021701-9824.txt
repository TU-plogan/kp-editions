CASSANA, Nicoo, called Nicoetto, an eminent Italian painter, was born at Venice in 1659, and became a disciple of his father Giovanni Francesco Cassana, a Genoese, who had been taught the art of painting by Bernardino Strozzi. Some of the English nobility on their travels sat to him for their portraits, which being sent to London, and highly admired, Nicoetto was invited to England. He had the honour of being introduced to Queen Anne, and to paint her portrait, in which he succeeded so happily, that the queen distinguished him by many marks of favour and honour; but he had not the happiness to enjoy his good fortune for any length of time, as he died in London, universally regretted, in the year 1713.
