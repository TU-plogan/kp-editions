CATARACT, in Hydrography, a precipice in the channel of a river, caused by rocks or other obstacles stopping the course of the stream, whence the water falls with great noise and impetuosity. The word is derived from καταggaotfω, I tumble down with violence; compounded of κaτa, down, and gaotfw, dejicio, I throw down. Strabo calls that a cataract which we call a cascade ; and what we call a cataract the ancients usually called a catadupa. Herminius has an express dissertation, “De admirandis mundi Cataractis supra et subterrancis ;” where he uses the word in a new sense, meaning by cataract any violent motion of the elements.
