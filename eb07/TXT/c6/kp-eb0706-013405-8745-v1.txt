CARAVAN, or Karavanne, in the East, signifies a company or assembly of travellers and pilgrims, and more particularly of merchants, who, for their greater security, and in order to assist each other, march in a body through the deserts, and other dangerous places, which are infested with Arabs or robbers.

There are four regular caravans which go yearly to Mecca; the first from Damascus, composed of the pilgrims from Europe and Asia; the second from Cairo, composed of the Mahommedans of Barbary; the third from Zibith, a place near the mouth of the Red Sea, where those of Arabia and India meet; the fourth from Babylon, where the Persians assemble. Most of the inland commerce of the East is carried on by caravans. The Czar Peter the Great established a trade between Russia and China by means of a caravan. M. Bougnon, geographer to the Duke of Lorrain, published a treatise of the caravans of merchants in Asia; in which he shows of what they are composed, how many sorts there are, the several uses of the different sorts of animals in them, the prices given for them, the officers and men appointed to conduct them, and the pay of each, with their manner of marching, halting, fighting, retreating, and the like. Caravans of this kind are large convoys of armed men, merchants, and travellers, with diverse sorts of animals for the carriage of their provisions. There are commonly four chief officers of a caravan, viz. the caravan bachi, or chief, the captain guide, captain of rest, and captain of distribution. The first has absolute command over all the rest; the second is absolute in the march; the office of the third only commences when the caravan stops and makes a stay; to the fourth belongs the disposition of every part of the corps in case of an attack or battle, and he has also the inspection of the distribution of provisions, which is made under him by several distributors, who give security to the master of the caravan, and have each of them a certain number of persons, elephants, dromedaries, &c. to take care of at their peril. The treasurer of the caravan is a fifth officer, who has under him several agents and interpreters, who keep journals of all that passes, for the satisfaction of those concerned in fitting out the caravan. Any dealer is at liberty to form a company in order to make a caravan. He in whose name it is raised is considered as the caravan bachi, or chief of the caravan, unless he appoint some other person in his place. If there are several merchants equally concerned, they elect a caravan bachi; after which they appoint officers to conduct the caravan, and decide all controversies that may arise during the journey.

There are also sea caravans, established on the same footing, and for the same purpose; such is the caravan of vessels from Constantinople to Alexandria.
