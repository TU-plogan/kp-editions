CLARISSES, an order of nuns so called from their: founder St Clara or St Clare. She was born in the town of As^isa in Italy; and having renounced the world to dedicate herself to religion, gave birth to this order in the year 1212; which comprehends not only those nuns who follow the rule of St Francis, according to the strict let-: ter, and without any mitigation, but likewise those who observe the same rule softened and mitigated by several popes. After Ferdinand Cortez had conquered Mexicofor the king of Spain, Isabella of Portugal, wife of the emperor Charles V. sent thither some nuns of the order of St Clara, w ho made several settlements there. Near their monasteries were founded communities of Indian young women, to be instructed by the clarisses in religion, and in such works as were suitable to persons of their sex. These communities were so considerable that they usually consisted of four or five hundred.
