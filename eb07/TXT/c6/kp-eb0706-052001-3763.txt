CHESTERFIELD, a market-town of the hundred of Scarsdale, in the county of Derby, 150 miles from London, on a hill between two small rivers. It communicates, by means of a recent canal, with the river Trent. It has some manufactories of hosiery and of silk, and some spinning of cotton. The family of Stanhope derives the title of Earl from this town. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 4476, in 1821 to 5077, and in 1831 to 10,688.

Chesterfield, Earl of. See Stanhope. CHEVAL-de-Frise, a large piece of timber, pierced, and traversed with wooden pikes, and five or six feet long, armed or pointed with iron. The term is French, and properly signifies a Friselaìid horse, this term having been applied either from some conceived analogy between the appearance of the shaggy horses of the country and that of the instrument, or because it was first invented in Friseland. Chevaux-de-frise are űsed to defend a passage, stop a breach, or secure the avenues of a camp, against both horse and foot. They are sometimes also mounted on wheels with artificial fires, to roll down in an assault. Chevaux-de-frise were first used at the siege of Groningen in 1658.
