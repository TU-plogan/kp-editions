CANEA, one of the circles into which the island of Candia is divided, comprehending the western part of the island. Though hilly, the plains yield oil, flax, honey, corn, silk, and much fruit. The chief city, of the same name, is situated on the north const of the island, is fortified with strong walls and deep ditches, has several mosques and churches, and contains 4000 Turks, 3000 Greeks, and several Jew and Frank inhabitants. Among the latter are respectable mercantile houses, who carry on much commerce with Trieste, Venice, and other places, in oil, soap, and other articles. The harbour has a mole, defended by a fort, but is only adapted to the reception of small vessels.
