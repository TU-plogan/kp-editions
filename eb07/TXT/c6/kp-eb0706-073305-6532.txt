CLAVICHORD, and ClavicthÄ¾rium, two musical instruments used in the sixteenth century. They were of the nature of the spinet, but of an oblong figure. The first is still used by the nuns in convents; and that the practitioners may not disturb the sisters in the dormitory, the strings are muffled with small bits of fine woollen cloth.
