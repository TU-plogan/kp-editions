CARLISLE, a city, the capital of the county of Cumberland, on the south side of the river Eden, near the influx of the Cadew. It is 305 miles from London, and sixteen from Penrith. As a frontier place towards Scotland, it has still some ancient fortifications, though in a state of dilapidation. It is the see of a bishop, having been separated from the diocese of Durham in the reign of Henry I. The government of the city is vested in a corporation, consisting of a mayor, a recorder, twelve aidermen, and twenty-four common-council men. The assizes for the county are held here, but only once in the year. It sends two members to parliament. There are two parish churches, one of which, St Maryâ€™s, serves as the cathedral. Of late years the importance of Carlisle has been increased by the extension of its manufactures. These consist of printed calicoes and other cotton goods linens of various kinds, worsted, articles, hardware, cordage, and various smaller commodities. It is in long. 2. 53. E. and lat. 54. 56. N. The population amounted in 1811 to 10,875, in 1821 to 15,476, and in 1831 to 20,006. It gives the title of Earl to a branch of the Howard family.
