CHRYSOLITE (Peridot , Haüy; Olivin, Hausmann). When chrysolite is found in a crystallized state, and of considerable dimensions, it is a very beautiful mineral, and presents a fine grass-green colour, with a vitreous fracture, and perfect transparency. Such specimens are very rare, and the locality is quite unknown, but supposed to be Upper Egypt. It occurs also in minute but perfect crystals, along with other gems, in alluvial deposits at Expaillie. It it most commonly found in grains in trap-rocks, sometimes in large spheroidal masses, of an oil-green colour, in a state of granular concretions. It likewise enters into the composition of meteoric stones, and occurs imbedded in the native iron discovered by Pallas in Siberia, and also in the same substance, which has subsequently been found at Attacama. Chrysolite is the softest of all gems, being scratched by quartz, and yielding to the file. Its specific gravity is 3∙4; and, according to Vauquelin, it contains, of silica 38∙, magnesia 50∙5, and iron 9∙5.
