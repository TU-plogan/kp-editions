CHINAPATAM, a town of Hindustan, in the territories of the rajah of Mysore. It is an open town, large and handsome, containing about 1000 houses, with a handsome stone fort at a little distance. Not far from this place is Pattala Durg, one of the horrid prisons in whieh Tippoo was wont to immure those unfortunate wretches who incurred his displeasure, and where death soon terminated their sufferings. The town has a manufactory of glass, and another of steel wires for the strings of musical instruments, which are reckoned the best in India. A family at this plaee had the art of making very fine white sugar, which was kept for the sole use of the court at Seringapatam. It is forty miles north-east of Seringapatam. Long. 77. 24. E. Lat. 12. 39. N.
