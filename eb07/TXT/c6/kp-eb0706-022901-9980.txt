CASTIGATION, among the Romans, the punishment of an offender by blows, or beating with a wand or switch. Castigation was chiefly a military punishment, the power of inflicting which on the soldiery was given to the tribunes. Some make it consist of two kinds; one with a stick or cane, called fastigatio ; and the other with rods, called flagellatio. The latter was the more dishonourable.
