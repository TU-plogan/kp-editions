CHASTITY. Purity of the body, or freedom from obscenity. The Romañ law justifies homicide in defence of the chastity either of one’s self or one’s relations; and so also, according to Selden, stood the law in the Jewish republic. The law of England likewise justifies a woman in killing a man who attempts to ravish her. So the husband or father may justify killing a man who attempts a rape upon his wife or daughter, but not if he takes them in adultery by consent; for the one is forcible and felonious, the other not.
