CHRYSOPRASE, a name derived from the Greek, signifying a superior kind of prase. It occurs at Rose-mutz in Silesia, and also at New Fane, Vermont, North America. It is of an apple-green colour, more or less intense. It is translucent, with a fine-grained splintry fracture, nearly even, and occurs massive, in contemporaneous veins, traversing rocks of serpentine. Chrysoprase is nearly allied to calcedony, and derives its beautiful colour from an admixture of the oxide of nickel, as ascertained by the analysis of Klaproth.
