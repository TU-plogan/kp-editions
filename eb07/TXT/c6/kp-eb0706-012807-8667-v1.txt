CAPSICUM, or Guinea-pepper. The bell-pepper produces fruit for pickling, for which purpose the pods must be gathered before they arrive at their full size, while their rind is tender. They must be slit down on one side to get out the seeds, after which they should be soaked two or three days in salt and water. When they are taken out of this and drained, boiling vinegar must be poured on them in a sufficient quantity to cover them, and closely stopped down for two months; then they should be boiled in the vinegar to make them green; but they want∣ no addition of any spice, and are the best and most wholesome pickle in the world. Another species is used for making what is called cayan-butter or pepper-pots, by the inhabitants of America, and which they esteem the best of all the spices.
