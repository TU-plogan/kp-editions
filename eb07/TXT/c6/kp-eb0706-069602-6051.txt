CIMABUE, Giovanni, a celebrated painter, born at Florence in 1240, and the first who revived the art of painting in Italy. According to the custom of the times, he painted in fresco and in distemper; colours in oil not being then found out. He excelled in architecture as well as in painting; and was concerned in erecting the edifice of Sancta Maria del Fior at Florence, during which employment he died, at the age of sixty, and left many disciples.
