CASTANETS, Castagnettes, or Castanettas, a kind of musical instrument, with which the Moors, Spaniards, and Bohemians accompany their dances, sarabands, and guitars. It consists of two little round pieces of wood dried, and hollowed in the manner of a spoon, the concavities of which are placed on one another, fastened to the thumb, and beat from time to time with the middle finger, to direct the motions and cadences. The castanets may be beat eight or nine times in the space of one measure, or second of a minute.
