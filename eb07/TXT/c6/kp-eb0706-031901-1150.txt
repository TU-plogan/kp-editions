CHANTER, a singer of a choir in a cathedral. The word is almost grown obsolete, chorister or singing-man being commonly used instead of it. All great chapters have chanters and chaplains to assist the canons, and officiate in their absence.

Chanters, in the temple of Jerusalem, were a number of Levites, employed in singing the praises of God, and playing upon instruments before his altar. They had no habits distinct from the rest of the people; yet in the ceremony of removing the ark to Solomonâ€™s temple, the chanters appeared dressed in tunics of byssus or fine linen.
