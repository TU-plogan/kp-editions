CAPITOLINE Games, annual games instituted by Camillus, in honour of Jupiter Capitolinus, and in commemoration of the escape of the capitol from capture by the Gauls. Plutarch tells us that a part of the ceremony consisted in the public criers putting up the Hetrurians to sale by auction; they also took an old man, and tying a golden bulla about his neck, exposed him to public derision. Festus says they likewise dressed him in a pr√©texta. There was another kind of Capitoline games, instituted by Domitian, in which there were rewards and crowns bestowed on the poets, champions, orators, historians, and musicians. These last Capitoline games were celebrated every five years, and became so famous, that, instead of calculating time by lustra, they began to count by Capitoline games, as the Greeks did by Olympiads. It appears, however, that this custom was not of long continuance.
