CATMANDOO, or Catamandoo, a city of Northern Hindustan, the capital of the Nepaul country, and the residence of the Goorkhali rajah. It is situated in a romantic valley of Nepaul proper, on the east bank of the Bishen-mutty river, forty miles south of the Himalaya Mountains, and about a hundred and fifty miles north of the British possessions. It extends about a mile along the river, and is in its greatest breadth about half a mile; but.in general it does not exceed a quarter of a mile. The houses, which are of two, three, and four stories, are built of brick, with pent roofs, and have in general a mean appearance, not even excepting the palace of the rajah, which is but a poor edifice. The streets are very narrow, and fully as filthy as those in other eastern towns. The temples are almost as numerous as the houses, and are all provided with idols. The greater part are constructed of wood, but several are built of brick and stone. The Brahminical religion is professed in all these. There is a very ancient temple dedicated to Boodh, which is highly celebrated among the Tartars for its sanctity, and is a great resort of pilgrims. It is built of stone, and consists of three lofty pyramids with two square apartments. It is of great antiquity, having been erected when Nepaul was in possession of the Thibetians. The possession of this temple has been always claimed by the sovereign pontiff, the Dalui Lama, on the ground of its being in the immemorial possession of his predecessors; but in consequence of disputes the Lama’s vicar was obliged to retire, and it is now held by a legate of the ruler of Bootan, who is a Boodhist. The city has good markets, well supplied with every convenience, and is estimated to contain 50,000 inhabitants. Long. 85. 29. E. Lat. 27. 33. N.
