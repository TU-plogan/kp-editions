CHARDIN, Sir John, a celebrated traveller, was born at Paris in 1643. His father, who was a jeweller, caused him to be educated in the Protestant religion, after which he travelled into Persia and India. He traded in jewels, and died at London in 1713. The account he w rote of his travels in the above-mentioned regions is much esteemed; and in it Montesquieu, Rousseau, Gibbon, Helvetius, and other philosophers studied the political system of Persia, and acquired a positive knowledge of despotic government, which they r have so forcibly characterized.
