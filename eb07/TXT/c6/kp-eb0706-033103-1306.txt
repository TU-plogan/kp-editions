CHARLETON, Walter, a learned English physician, born in 1619, was physician in ordinary to Charles I. and Charles II., one of the first members of the Royal Society, and president of the College of Physicians. He wrote on various subjects; but at last his narrow circumstances obliged him to retire to the island of Jersey, where he died in 1707.
