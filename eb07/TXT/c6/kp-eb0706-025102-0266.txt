CAUFIRISTAN, a mountainous country of Asia, situated partly upon the Hindoo Coosh, and partly upon the Beloor Taugh. Its boundaries are Caubul, Budukshaun, and Bulkh. This territory consists of vast mountains covered with snow, inclosing a few narrow but fertile valleys. It is inhabited by a singular people, the Caufirs, who, in religion, manners, and institutions, have remained entirely distinct from all their neighbours. Their religion is entirely Pagan, and they cherish the deadliest antipathy against the Mahommedan name. To have killed a Mussulman is the highest glory to which a Caufir can aspire. Their religious observances bear no resemblance to those established in any part of India. They acknowledge a supreme deity, whom they call Imra, and in their ceremonies represent him by a stone called Imrtan, or the holy stone; but they observe, “this stands for him, but we know not his shape.” They have, besides, numerous inferior deities, consisting chiefly of deceased Caufirs, who have distinguished themselves by some eminent qualities. The best mode of securing an apotheosis, is by giving numerous feasts to the village, hospitality and good cheer being held by this people in the highest veneration. The Caufirs are at almost continual war with their neighbours. They sometimes attack openly, but more commonly seek to surprise, their enemy. On succeeding, they set up a war-cry, sing a song of triumph, and massacre all without distinction. Numerous privileges are attached to the having killed a Mussulman. He who has performed this exploit may wear a turban stuck with feathers, may flourish his axe over his head in the dance, and may set up a pole before his door, with a pin stuck in it for every slaughtered enemy. Their arms are bows, four and a half feet long, with light arrows, sometimes poisoned. When pursued, they unbend their bows, and use them as poles, by the aid of which they leap from rock to rock with astonishing agility. About thirty years ago all their neighbours united in a general confederacy for the extirpation of the Caufirs. They penetrated the country in every direction, but found themselves unable to maintain their ground, and were soon obliged to retire with considerable loss.

The Caufirs are hospitable in the extreme. A stranger arriving at one of their villages is not only welcomed, but is expected to visit each of the principal men, where he is regaled with every dainty which the house can afford. Their wealth consists of cattle and slaves; the latter are always their own countrymen, as they never spare the life of a Mussulman. The government is chiefly conducted by consultations among the rich men. Their dress consists principally of goats’ skins, with the hair turned outwards, two of which form a vest, and other two a kind of petticot. They are less addicted to hunting than the Afghans. The favourite amusement is dancing, of which they never tire. They cannot accommodate themselves to the Asiatic practice of seating themselves cross-legged on the ground, but sit in the European manner on benches and stools. They also use tables, and drink wine copiously, though not to intoxication, out of silver cups. These European habits have given rise to the hypothesis of their being a Greek colony, left during the expedition of Alexander; and the probability of this conjecture is greatly increased by the circumstance that their language is closely allied to Sanscrit, which answers to Greek as face answers to face in a glass. The two chief towns, or rather villages, of the Caufirs, are Caumdaish and Tsokooce. The former contains five hundred houses.
