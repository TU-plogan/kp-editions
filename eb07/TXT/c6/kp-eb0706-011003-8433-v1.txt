CAPIAS, in Law, a writ of two sorts; one before judgment in an action, and the other after. That beforejudg-ment is called capias ad respondendum, where an original is issued out, to take the defendant, and make him answer the plaintiff. That after judgment is of divers kinds; as, Capias ad Satisfaciendum, a writ of execution, that issues on a judgment obtained, and lies where any person recovers in a personal action, as for debt, damages, and the like; in which cases this writ issues to the sheriff, commanding him to take the body of him against whom the debt is recovered, who is to be kept in prison till he makes satisfaction.

Capias pro Fine is a writ lying where a person is fined to the king, for some offence committed against a statute, and he does not discharge the fine according to the judgment; therefore his body shall be taken by this writ, and committed to jail till the fine be paid.

Capias ut Legatum, a writ which lies against any one outlawed, upon any action personal or criminal, by which the sheriff is ordered to apprehend the party outlawed, for not appearing on the exigent, and keep him in safe custody till the day of return, when he is ordered to present him to the court, to be there further ordered for his contempt.

Capias in Withernam, a writ that lies for cattle in withernam ļ that is, where a distress taken is driven out of the county, so that the sheriff cannot make deliverance upon a replevin; then this writ issues, commanding the sheriff to take as many beasts of the distrainer, &c.
