CHANAK Kalesi, a town and fortress of Asiatic Turkey, in Natolia. The town contains about 2000 houses, and has a manufacture of pottery. The fortress was built to defend the Strait of the Dardanelles. The outworks are of modern date; but the date of the citadel belongs to the era of the Greek emperors.
