CARTEL, an agreement between two states for the exchange of prisoners of war.

Cartel signifies also a letter of defiance or a challenge to decide a controversy either in a tournament or in a single combat. See Duel. Cartel Ship, a ship commissioned in time of war to exchange the prisoners of any two hostile powers; also to carry any particular request or proposal from one to another. For this reason the officer who commands her is particularly ordered to carry no cargo, ammunition, or implements of war, except a single gun for the purpose of firing signals.
