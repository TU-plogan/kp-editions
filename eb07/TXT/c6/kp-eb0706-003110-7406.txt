CAMBODIA, Camboge, Camboja, or Camboya, a country of Asia, occupying the eastern shore of the Gulf of Siam, bounded on the north by Loas, on the east by Cochin-China and Tsiampa, on the west by Siam and the Burman empire, and on the south by the sea. In length it maybe estimated at 350 miles, by 150 in average breadth. This is a country very little known to Europeans. The coasts, to which alone they have had access, are so remarkably flat, that at the distance of four or five miles from the shore the water is seldom more than four or five fathoms deep, and no craft except boats can approach within two miles of the shore. The country near the coast is overgrown with wood. Farther inward it is mountainous, intersected by deep ravines; and the middle portion, through which the great river Camboja passes, is described as a fine plain, though it is almost wholly unknown. The soil is fertile, resembling that of Ava, Siam, and the neighbouring countries. It produces rice, legumes, and fruits, as well as many medicinal plants. Here is produced the colouring matter named gamboge, which derives its name from this kingdom, being the concrete resinous juice of certain trees found here. Here are also the sandal and the eagle wood trees, and many other valuable vegetable products. There is a vegetable poison, in which, if a weapon is dipped, it is sure to inflict a mortal wound. In the deep forests with which the country is covered the wild animals of the country find abundant shelter. They consist chiefly of elephants, lions, tigers, &c. and are eagerly hunted by the natives. Cattle arc also plentiful. The chief river, which runs southward through the centre of the country from Thibet, where it has its rise, is Camboja or May Kaung, or more properly Me Kon, and is navigable for boats along the greater part of its course, which is through the province of Yunan in China. It is navigable for ships forty miles from the sea, where the city of Śaigong is situated. It is about two miles broad, and very deep, and falls into the Chinese Sea by several mouths. Some sand banks obstruct its entrance; but they may be easily avoided. The chief town is Lowaick, named Cambodia by Europeans; and there are just three others that deserve the name, whose position, however, is very indistinctly known to Europeans. The foreign commerce of the country is extremely limited; and the inhabitants seldom leave their country for commercial objects. The Chinese and Portuguese from Macao import to a small extent silk goods, china and lackered ware, tea, sweetmeats, tin, and tutenague; while the exports are betel-nut, various kinds of wood, mother of pearl, shells, peltry, silk, and coarse cloths. The mountains yield various sorts of precious stones, also gold of great beauty, and in considerable quantities. The Portuguese were formerly rivals with the Dutch for [7:6:32]the trade of this country. In the year 1670 the English attempted some traffic with the inhabitants, but to little ’advantage. The country is inhabited by a mixture of Cochin-Chinese, Malays, Japanese, and Portuguese. The men are generally handsome, with a dark complexion and long hair; the women are likewise handsome, but rather licentious in their manners. The inhabitants of the interior are very little known; they seem to resemble the barbarous aborigines found all over India, and to follow neither the religion of Mahommed nor Buddha, but some idolatrous superstition of their own. The city of Cambodia is 150 or 170 miles from the sea; it is now a mean place, with an indifferent palace of wood. Long. 104. 35. E. Lat. 13. N.
