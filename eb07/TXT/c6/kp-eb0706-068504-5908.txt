CHUMBUL, or the Sumbul, a river of Hindustan, which has its rise in the centre of the province of Malwah, within fifteen miles of the Nerbuddah. From thence its course is due north, until it passes the city of Kotah; after which, being augmented by many smaller streams, it turns more to the east, and falls into the Jumna twenty miles from Etaweh. The course of this river is computed at 446 miles, and the breadth of its channel at the ford Kyteree, near Dhoolpoor, is three quarters of a mile. This river is supposed by Major Rennell to be the Sambus of Arrian. It is now the boundary between the British territories and those of Sindia to the south.
