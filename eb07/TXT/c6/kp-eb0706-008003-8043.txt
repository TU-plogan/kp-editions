CANGOZIMA, or Cangoxuma, a town of Japan, in the southern extremity of the island of Ximio. It is watered by a river which descends into an artificial canal, and is afterwards discharged with great rapidity into the sea. On the side of the river stands a custom-house, a fine edifice, at which passengers paya second duty in addition to that levied from them in passing a strong castle at the entrance of the port. At the mouth of the harbour, on a very high rock, stands a square light-house, which is visible at the distance of twenty miles. The harbour itself is protected by a bulwark with a stone rampart breast-high, covered with copper; at one end of which is a guardhouse, where five hundred men keep constant watch.
