CHAPLET, an ancient ornament for the head, like a garland or wreath; but this word is frequently used to signify the circle of a crown. There are instances of its being borne in a coat of arms, as well as for crests. The paternal arms for Lascelles are argent, three chaplets, gules.

Chaplet also denotes a string of beads used by the Roman Catholics to count the number of their prayers. The invention of it is ascribed to Peter the hermit, who probably learned it of the Turks, as they owe it to the East Indians.

Chaplets are sometimes called paternosters, and are made of coral, diamonds, wood, and other substances. The common chaplet contains fifty ave-marias and five paternosters. There is also a chaplet of our Saviour, consisting of thirty-three beads, in honour of his thirty-three years life on the earth, instituted by Father Michael the Camaldulian.

The orientals have a kind of chaplets which they call chains, and use in their prayers, rehearsing one of the perfections of God on each link or head.
