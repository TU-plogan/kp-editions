CLARION, a kind of trumpet, the tube of which is narrower, and the tone acuter and shriller, than that of the common trumpet. It is said that the clarion now used among the Moors, and the Portuguese who borrowed it from the Moors, served anciently for a treble to several < trumpets, which sounded tenor and bass.
