CHANCAY, a province of Peru, in the department of Lima. That part of the district which lies amongst the mountains is subjected to a cold temperature, but that towards the sea enjoys a warmer climate. The province is exceedingly fertile in sugar and maize, with which large quantities of pigs are fattened for the markets of Lima. In the centre of this district, and on the coast, are some fine salt mines or pits. The capital is situated in a beautiful valley, a few miles distant from the river Passamayo. It has a tolerable port, well frequented by trading vessels. Lat. 11. 30. S.
