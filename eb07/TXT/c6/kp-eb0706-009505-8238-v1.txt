CANOPUS, in Astronomy, a star of the first magnitude, in the rudder of Argo, a constellation of the southern hemisphere.

Canopus, in Pagan Mythology, one of the deities of the ancient Egyptians, and, according to some, the god of water. It is said that the Chaldeans, who worshipped fire, carried their fancied deity through other countries to try its powers, in order that, if it obtained the victory 7 over the other gods, it might be acknowledged as the true object of worship; and it having easily subdued the gods of wood, stone, brass, silver, and gold, its priests declared that all gods did it homage. This the priest of Canopus hearing, and finding that the Chaldeans had brought their god to contend with Canopus, they took a large earthen vessel, in which they bored several holes, which they afterwards stopped with wax, and having filled the vessel with water, painted it of several colours, and fitting the head of an idol to it, brought it out in order to contend with the Chaldean deity. The Chaldeans accordingly kindled their fire all round it; but the heat having melted the wax, the water gushed out through the holes and extinguished the fire; and thus Canopus conquered the god of the Chaldeans.

Canopus, or Canobus, according to Strabo, was Menelaus’s pilot, and had a temple erected to him in a town called Canopus, near one of the mouths of the Nile.

Canopus, or Canobus, in Ancient Geography, a town of Lower Egypt, on the Mediterranean, a hundred and twenty 7 stadia, or fifteen miles, to the east of Alexandria.
