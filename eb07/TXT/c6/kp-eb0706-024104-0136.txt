CATECHISM, in its primary sense, means instruction or institution in the principles of the Christian religion, delivered viva voce, and so as to require frequent repetitions, from the disciple or hearer, of what has been said. The word is formed from xαrηχtω, a compound of %αrα, and r l χοi, q. d. circumsono, alluding to the noise or din made in this sort of exercise, or to the zeal and earnestness with which things are to be inculcated over and over on learners. Anciently the candidates for baptism were only to be instructed in the secrets of their religion by tradition, viva voce, without writing; as had also been the case among the Egyptian priests, and the British and Gaulish druids, who only communicated the mysteries of their theology by word of mouth.

Catechism is more frequently used in modern times . for an elementary book, in which the principal articles of religion arc summarily delivered in the way of question and answer.
