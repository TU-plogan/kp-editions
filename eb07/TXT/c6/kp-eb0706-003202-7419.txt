CAMBRAY, an arrondissement of the department of the North, in France, extending over 355 square miles, divided into seven cantons, and containing 117 communes, with 112,994 inhabitants. The chief place, of the same name, is a fortified city on the river Scheldt, which divides it into two parts. It is well but irregularly built, is the seat of a bishop, and contains eleven churches, 2990 houses, and 15,608 inhabitants. It has long been celebrated for those linens of delicate texture which have obtained in England the name of the city. Fine lawns and thread gauzes are manufactured in Cambray; besides which there are produced fine threads, inferior linen, carpets, soap, snuff, and copper utensils; and there are several large bleaching establishments. From 1815 to 1818 it was the head quarters of the army of occupation under the command of the Duke of Wellington. It is in longitude 3. 8. 27. E. and latitude 50. 10. 37. N.
