CATULLUS, Caius Valerius, a Latin poet, born at Verona in the year of Rome 666. The harmony o√á his numbers acquired him the esteem and friendship of Cicero, and other great men of his time. Many of his poems, however, abound with gross obscenities. He wrote satirical verses against Caesar, under the name of Marmoro. Catullus spent his whole life in a state of poverty, and died in the flower of his age and the height of his reputation. Joseph Scaliger, Passerai, Muret, and Isaac Vossius, have written learned notes on this poet.
