CHAPTER, in ecclesiastical polity, a society or community of clergymen belonging to the cathedrals and collegiate churches.

It was in the eighth century that the body of canons began to be called a chapter. The chapter of the canons of a cathedral was a standing council to the bishop, and, during the vacancy of the see, had the jurisdiction of the diocese. In the earlier ages the bishop was head of the chapter; afterwards abbots and other dignitaries, as deans, provosts, and treasurers, were preferred to this distinction. The deans and chapters had the privilege of choosing the bishops in England; but Henry VIII. got this power vested in the crown; and as the same prince expelled the monks from the cathedrals, and placed secular canons in their room, those whom he thus regulated were called deans and chapters of the new foundation, such as Canterbury, Winchester, Ely, Carlisle, &c.
