CAT ISLAND, or St Salvador, one of the Bahama Islands, is about sixty miles in length by twelve in average breadth. It is only remarkable from having been the first land discovered by Columbus in his voyage of discovery. He landed here on the 12th of October 1492, and named it St Salvador. By the natives it is termed Gua-nimina, and by the English Cat Island. Long. 75. W. Lat. 24. 30. N.

Cat's -Eye , or Sun-stone, a kind of gem found chiefly in Siberia. Caťs-eye is by the Latins called oculus cati, and sometimes oηycopalus, as having white zones or rings like the onyx, with its colours variable like opal, from which last it differs chiefly by its superior hardness.

Cat - Gut, a denomination given to small strings for fiddles and other instruments, made of the intestines of sheep or lambs, dried and twisted together, either singly, or several together. These strings are sometimes coloured red, sometimes blue, but are commonly left whitish or brownish, the natural colour of the gut. They are also used by watchmakers, cutlers, turners, and other artificers.

Cat - Salt , a name given by salt-workers to a very beautifully granulated kind of common salt.
