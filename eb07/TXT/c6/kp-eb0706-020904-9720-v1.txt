CARYLL, John, an English poet, of the Roman Catholic persuasion, was secretary to Queen Mary, the wife of Janies II., and one who followed the fortunes of his abdicated master; who rewarded him, first with knighthood, and then with the honorary titles of Earl Caryll and Baron Dartford. How long he continued in the service of the exiled monarch is not known, but he was in Englaņd in the reign of Queen Anne, and recommended the subject of the Rape of the Lock to Mr Pope, who at its publication addressed it to him. He was also the intimate friend of Pope’s Unfortunate Lady. He was the author of two plays, 1. The English Princess, or the Death of Richard III. 1667, 4to; 2. Sir Salomon, or the Cautious Coxcomb, 1671, 4to: and in 1700 he published The Psalms of David, translated from the Vulgate, 12mo. In Tonson’s edition of Ovid’s Epistles, that of Briseis to Achilles is said to be by Sir John Caryll; and in Nichols’ Select Collection of Miscellany Poems, vol. ii. p. 1, the firsL eclogue of Virgil is translated by the same ingenious poet. He was living in 1717, and at that time must have been a very old man.
