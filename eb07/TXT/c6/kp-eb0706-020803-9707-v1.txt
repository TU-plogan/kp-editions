CARTWRIGHT, William, a divine and poet of some eminence, born at Northway, near Tewkesbury, in Gloucestershire, in September 1611. He finished his education at Oxford, afterwards went into holy orders, and became a most florid preacher in the university. In 1642 he obtained the place of succentor in the church of Salisbury, and was afterwards chosen junior proctor in the university. He was also metaphysical reader there. Wit, judgment, elocution, with a graceful person and behaviour, elicited from Dean Fell the encomiastic remark, “that he was the utmost that man could come to.” He was an expert linguist, a good orator, and a respectable poet. There are extant four of his plays and some poems. He died in 1644, aged thirty-three.
