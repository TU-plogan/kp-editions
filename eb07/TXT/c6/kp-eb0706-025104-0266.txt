CAULABAGH, a town of Afghanistan, in the province of Caubul. It is a singularly built place, the houses being situated on terraces cut out of the declivity of the hill. Here it is that the country of the real Afghans commences; and that country as far as Peshawer is inhabited by a variety of tribes. In the vicinity of the town are large rocks, which yield an inexhaustible store of the pure rock salt; and there is, besides, a considerable manufacture of alum; in both of which articles an extensive trade is carried on with the neighbouring provinces, and proves highly beneficial to the inhabitants. The river Indus here flows in one channel, and is about 400 yards wide, but deep and rapid. The proper name of the town is Khara Bagh, or Garden of Salt. Long. 70. 46. E. Lat. 32. 11. N.
