CATECHUMEN, a candidate for baptism, or one who prepares himself for receiving that rite.

The catechumens, in church history, were the lowest order of Christians in the primitive church. They had some title to the common name of Christian, being a degree above pagans and heretics, though not consummated by baptism. They were admitted to the state of catechumens by the imposition of hands and the sign of the cross.

The children of believing parents were admitted as cate- 1 chumcns whenever they were capable of receiving instruction; but at what age those of heathen parents might be admitted is not so clear. As to the time of their continuance in this state, there were no fixed general rules, but the practice varied according to the difference of times and places, and the readiness and proficiency of the catechumens themselves.

There were four orders or degrees of catechumens. The first consisted of those instructed privately without the church, and kept at a distance for some time from the privilege of entering the church, to make them the more eager and desirous of doing so. The next degree consisted of the audientes, so called from their being admitted to hear sermons and the Scriptures read in the church, but they were not allowed to partake of the prayers. The third sort of catechumens included the genuflectentes, so called because they received imposition of hands kneeling. The fourth order was that of the competentes et electi, denoting the immediate candidates for baptism, or such as were appointed to be baptized at the next approaching festival; before which, strict examination was made into their proficiency in the several stages of catechetical exercises.

After examination, they were exercised for twenty days together, and were obliged to fast and confess; some days before baptism they went veiled, and it was customary to touch their ears, saying, Ephatha, be opened; as also to anoint their eyes with clay; both ceremonies being in imitation of our Saviourâ€™s practice, and intended to shadow out to the catechumens their condition both before and after their admission into the Christian church.
