CAUSEWAY, or Causey, a massive construction of stones, stakes, and fascines, or an elevation of fat viscous earth, well beaten, serving either as a road in wet marshy places, or as a mole to retain the waters of a pond, or pre-venta river from overflowing the lower grounds. See Road. The word is derived from the French chaussée, anciently written chaulsée ; and that, again, from the Latin calceata, or calcata, which, according to Somner and Spelman, comes a calcando. Bergier rather takes the word to have had its rise a peditum calceis, quibus teruntur. Some derive it from the Latin calx, or French chaux, supposing it to have primarily denoted a way paved with chalk stones.

Causeway, calcetum or calcca, commonly denotes a common hard raised way, maintained and repaired with stones and rubbish.

Devil's Causeway, a famous work of this kind, which ranges through the county of Northumberland, commonly supposed to be of Roman origin, though Mr Horsley suspects it to be a work of later times.

Giant's Causeway is a denomination given to a huge pile of basaltic columns in the district of Coleraine in Ireland. See Giant’s Causeway.
