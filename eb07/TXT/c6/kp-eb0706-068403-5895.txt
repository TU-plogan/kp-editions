CHRYSIPPUS, a Stoic philosopher, born at Solos in Cilicia, was a disciple of Clean thus, successor of Zeno. He wrote many books, several of which related to logic. None of the philosophers dogmatised in stronger terms of the fatal necessity of every thing, or declaimed more pompously of the liberty of man, than the Stoics, particularly Chrysippus, who was held of so much importance among them, as to give rise to the proverbial remark, that but for Chrysippus, the Porch had never been. Yet the Stoics complained, as Cicero relates, that he had collected many arguments in favour of the sceptical hypothesis, which he could not answer himself, and had thus furnished Carneades, their antagonist, with weapons against them. There has been preserved an apophthegm of this philosopher, which does him honour. Being told that some persons spoke ill of him, “It is no matter,” said he; “I will live so that they shall not be believed.”
