CIMON, an Athenian, son of Miltiades and Hegisipyle. He was famous for his debaucheries in his youth, and the reformation of his morals when he arrived at years of discretion. He behaved with great courage at the battle of Salamis, and rendered himself popular by his munificence and valour. In one day he defeated the Persian fleet, took two hundred ships, and totally routed their land army. The money which he had obtained by his victories, however, was not applied for his own private use, for with it he fortified and embellished the city. Some time afterwards he lost all his popularity, and was banished by the Athenians, who had declared war against the Lacedemonians; but he was recalled from his exile, and on his return he effected a reconciliation between Lacedaemon and his countrymen. He was afterwards appointed to carry on the war against Persia in Egypt and Cyprus, with a fleet of two hundred ships; and on the coast of Asia he gave battle to the enemy, and totally ruined their fleet. He died while besieging the town of Citium in Cyprus.
