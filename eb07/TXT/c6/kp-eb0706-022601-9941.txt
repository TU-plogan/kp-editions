CASTEL, Lewis Bertrand, a learned Jesuit, was born at Montpellier in 1688, and entered among the Jesuits in 1703. He studied polite literature in his youth, and at length applied himself entirely to the study of mathematics and natural philosophy. He distinguished himself by writing on gravity, mathematics, and the music of colours, a very whimsical idea, which he took great pains to reduce to practice. His piece on gravity, entitled Traité de la Pesanteur Universelle, was printed at Paris in 1724. He afterwards published his Mathématique Universelle, which occasioned his being unanimously chosen a fellow of the Royal Society of London, without the least solicitation. He was also member of the academies of Bordeaux and Rouen; but his Clavecin Oculaire mia ∖ c the greatest noise; and he spent much time and expense in constructing a harpsichord for the eye, butwithout success. He also wrote for and against Sir Isaac Newton; and published several other works, the principal of which are Le Plan du Mathématique abregee, and a treatise entitled Optique des Couleurs. He led a very exemplary life, and died in 1757.
