CLAUBERG, John, born at Salingen, in the duchy of Berg, in 1622, professed philosophy and theology, first at Herborn, and afterwards at Duisburg, where he died on the 3lst January 1665. He was one of the first who taught in Germany the doctrine of Descartes, which he had studied under John Ray at Leyden. His philosophical works ( Opera Omnia Philosophica), collected at Amsterdam by John Theodore Schalbrucb, in two volumes 4to, with a life of the author prefixed, by John Christian Hennius, show how well he was qualified to appreciate the merits of the French philosopher, and to follow in his footsteps. The most esteemed of Claubergâ€™s works is his Logica Vetus et Nova ; but he has not admitted in this collection a little work, entitled Ars Etymologica Teutonum e Philosophice foiitibus derivata, published by him at Duisburg in 1663, in 8vo, and which Morhof has highly commended in his Polyhistor, and Leibnitz included in his Collectanea Etymologica. This brochure was intended as the prelude to a large work, De Causis Linguce Germanicce, which, however, the projector did not find leisure or encouragement to execute. In a separate form we have collected .7. Clau-bergii et Martini Hundii Dissertationes selectoe, quibus controversae fidci adversus omnis generis adversarios explicantur, and J. Claubergii et Tobice Andrece Exercitationes et Epistolce varii argumenti.
