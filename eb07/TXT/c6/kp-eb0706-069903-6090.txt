CINEAS, a Thessalian, the minister and friend to Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. He was sent to Rome by his master to sue for a peace, which he, however, could not obtain. He told Pyrrhus that the Roman senate was a venerable assembly of kings; and observed, that to fight with them was to fight against another Hydra. He was of such a retentive memory, that the day after his arrival at Rome he could call every senator and knight by his name.
