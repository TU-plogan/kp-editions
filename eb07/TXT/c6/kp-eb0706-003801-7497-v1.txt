CAMERARIUS, Joachim, one of the most learned writers of his time, was born in 1500, at Bamberg, a city of Franconia, and obtained great reputation by his writings. He translated into Latin Herodotus, Demosthenes, Xenophon, Euclid, Homer, Theocritus, Sophocles, Lucian, Theodoret, Nicephorus, and other Greek writers. He published a Catalogue of the Bishops of the principal Sees; Greek Epistles; Accounts of his Journeys, in Latin verse; a Commentary on Plautus; the Lives of Helius Eobanus Hessus, and Philip Melancthon, &c. He died in 1574.

Camerarius, Joachim, son of the former, and a learned physician, was born at Nuremberg in 1534. -After having finished his studies in Germany, he repaired to Italy, where he obtained the esteem of the learned. At his return he was courted by several princes, who invited him to live with them; but he was too much devoted to books, and the study of chemistry and botany, to accept their offers. He wrote a Hortus Medicus, and several other works; and he died in 1598.
