CISPADANA Gallia, in Ancient Geography, a district of Italy, to the south of the Po, occupied by the Gauls in the time of the kings of Rome, and separated from Liguria on the west, by the Iria, running from south to north into the Po, and bounded on the south by the Apennines, and on the east by the Adriatic. The term is formed analogically, frequent mention being made in Cicero, Tacitus, Suetonius, and ancient inscriptions, of the Transpadani, which, with Cispadani, are terms used with respect to Rome. Ptolemy calls the Cispadana Gallia Togata; it extended between the Po and Apennines to the Sapis and Rubico.
