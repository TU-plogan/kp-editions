CELTIBERIA, in Ancient Geography, a country of Hither Spain, along the right or south-west side of the river Iberus or Ebro; though sometimes the greater part of Spain was called by the name of Celtiberia. ' The people were denominated Celtiberi, or the Celtae established on the Iberus. They were brave and warlike; and their cavalry in particular was excellent. They wore a black and rough cloak, the shag of which was like goatsâ€™ hair. Some of them had light bucklers like those worn by Gauls; others had hollow and round targes like those used by other nations. They all wore boots made of hair, and iron helmets adorned with crests of a purple colour. They used two-edged swords and poniards of a foot in length. Their arms were of an admirable temper, and are said to have been prepared of plates of iron buried under ground, where they remained till the rust had eaten the weakest part of the metal, and the rest consequently became hard and firm. Of iron thus prepared they made their swords, which were so strong and well tempered that neither buckler nor helmet could resist their edge. The Celtiberians were very cruel towards their enemies, and inflicted savage punishments on malefactors, but showed the greatest humanity towards their guests. They not only cheerfully granted hospitality to strangers who travelled in their country, but were desirous that such persons should seek protection under their roofs..
