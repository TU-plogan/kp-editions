CARDIAC, in a general sense, signifies all medicines beneficial to the heart, whether applied internally or externally. The word comes from the Greek word κaξδ ∣ a, cor ; the heart being reputed the immediate seat of their operation.

Cardiacs, in a more particular sense, denote medicines which raise the spirits and give present strength and cheerfulness; these are the same with what are properly called cordials.
