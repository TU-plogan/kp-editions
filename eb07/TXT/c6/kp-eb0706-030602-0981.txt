CHACHAPOYAS, a province of Peru, in the department of Truxillo, is bounded on the east by the eastern ridges of the Andes, on the north-west by the province of Luyu, and on the west by Caxamarca. The chief produce of the district was formerly tobacco. The cultivation of the vine has recently been introduced, and also that of indigo, which grows wild. Wheat, maize, barley, cocoa, sugar, cotton, castor oil, and all kinds of vegetables, are enumerated among the diversified productions of the province, which comprises every variety of climate. Cattle of all kinds are also plentiful. According to the last census, the population amounted to 10,176. The capital, which is of the same name, is built on the usual plan of the Spanish towns, with a plaza in the centre, having at one corner a handsome church. The streets are paved, but the houses are only one story high. It is the residence of an intendant. Lat. 6. 7. 41. S.
