CHARGED, in Heraldry. A shield carrying some impress or figure is said to be charged with it; so also, when one bearing, or charge, has another figure added to it, it is properly said to be charged.

Charged, in electrical experiments, is when a phial, pane of glass, or other electric substance, properly coated on both sides, has a quantity of electricity communicated to it; in which case the. one side is always electrified positively, and the other negatively.
