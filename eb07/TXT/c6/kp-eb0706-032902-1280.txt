CHARLEMAGNE, or Charles I. king of France, and emperor of the West by conquest, was born at the castle of Saltzburg, in Upper Bavaria, in 742. The events in the life of this great monarch belong properly to the history of France. Equally illustrious in the cabinet and in the field, a wise legislator and a great warrior, the patron of men of letters and the restorer of learning, Charlemagne has united in his favour the suffrages of statesmen and soldiers, of ecclesiastics, lawyers, and men of letters, who have all vied with one another in bestowing the homage of their praise on the celebrated founder of the western empire. Politicians indeed have blamed him for having regulated every thing in his states except the succession to the throne, which he left at the mercy of faction, and for having multiplied those assemblies where the royal power is necessarily weakened by being divided, a policy unsuitable •to the extent and condition of his empire. Nor is this censure without foundation. By his genius, his courage, his activity, and the skill with which he distributed rewards, he unquestionably surmounted all obstacles; but he unfortunately consolidated nothing; and hence, to succeed him, we do not say with glory, but with safety to the throne and to France, it would have been necessary to resemble him in many of his great qualities. But such a successor was nowhere to be found. Charlemagne was the last hero of his race; and as he took no effectual measures to consolidate the empire which he had established, it went to pieces not long after that disastrous day when he, “with all his peerage, fell by Fontarabia.” His death happened on the 28th January 814, in the seventy-second year of his age, and the forty-seventh of his reign. The works of Charlemagne are, 1. His Capitularies, first collected by Ansegise, abbot of St Wandrille, the best edition of which is that of Etienne Baluze, Paris, 1677, two vols. fol.; 2. Letters, contained in the collection of D. Bouquet; 3. A Grammar, of which fragments are to be found in the Polygraphia of Trithemus; 4. His Testament, contained in Bouehel’s Bibliothèque du Droit Français, tom. iii. printed at Paris, 1667, fol.; 5. Some Latin poems, such as the Epitaph of Pope Adrian, and the Song of Boland ; 6. The Caroline Boohs. Of the more early historians of Charlemagne, the principal is Eginhard. A very respectable account of his life and reign has been published by Mr James, in one vol. 8vo, 1832.
