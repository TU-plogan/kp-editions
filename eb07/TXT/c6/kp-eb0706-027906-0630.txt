CENSURE, a judgment which condemns some book, person, or action, or more particularly a reprimand from a â€¢ superior. Ecclesiastical censures are penalties, by which, for some remarkable misbehaviour, Christians are deprived of the communion of the church, or prohibited from exercising the sacerdotal office.
