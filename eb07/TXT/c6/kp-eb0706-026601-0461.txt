CAVITE, a town in the Philippines, in the island of Luzon, situated on a tongue of low land within the Bay of Manilla. It is the capital of a province of the same name, and was formerly a place of more importance. It now has a garrison of 150 men, who occupy the castle of St Philip, which is of a square form, with four bastions. Îœ. Perouse calculated the inhabitants at 4000, all of whom, with the exception of the governor, are mulattoes and Indians. There is ample depth of water in the bay for the largest ships; but it is infested by a worm which penetrates their planks and timbers, and soon renders them unfit for sea.

Long. 120. 48. E. Lat. 14. 34. N.
