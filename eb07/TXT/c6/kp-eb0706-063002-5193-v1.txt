CHRISTIANSAND, a province of Norway. It is the most southern and the smallest province of the kingdom. It extends over 10,629 square miles, and contains 117,580 inhabitants. It is generally mountainous, and on the coast has some deep indentations forming excellent havens. By a law of 1815 it is divided into two parts, called Christiansand and Savanger. The chief place is the city of the same name. It is situated in a spacious and secure bay, where a large fleet might ride in safety. It is the seat of a bishop, and has, besides the cathedral, two churches, and 700 houses, with 4844 inhabitants. It has some little trade, but its chief dependence is on the numerous vessels which seek shelter in its bay, and obtain stores when assailed by the storms of the Cattegat. It owns some vessels in the timber trade, and carries on the fisheries. Long. 8. 45. 5. E. Lat. 58. 27. N.
