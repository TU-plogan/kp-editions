CEPHALONIA, or Cephallenia, the largest of the islands constituting the Ionian republic. It was known in Homerâ€™s time by the name of Samos and Epirus Melaena; and is about forty miles in length, from ten to twenty in breadth, and a hundred and fifty in compass. It had anciently four cities, one of which bore the name of the island. Strabo tells us, that in his time there were only two cities remaining; but Pliny speaks of three, adding, that the ruins of Same, which had been destroyed by the Romans, were still in being. Same was the metropolis of the island, and is supposed to have stood in the place which the Italians call Porte Guiscardo. See Ionian Isles. Cephalonia, a town on the above island, is situated on a mountain, and forms, united with Zante, the see of a bishop, whose jurisdiction extends over the whole island. Long. 20. 59. E. Lat. 38. 20. N.
