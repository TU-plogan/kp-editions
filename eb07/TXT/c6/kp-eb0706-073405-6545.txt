CLAVUS, in Antiquity, an ornament upon the robes of the Roman senators and knights, which was more or less broad, according to the dignity of the person; hence the distinction of tunica angusti-clavia and lali-clavia.

Clavus Annalis, in Antiquity. So rude and ignorant were the Romans at the rise of their state, that the driving or fixing a nail was the only method they had of keeping a register of time; for which reason it was called clavus annalis. There was an ancient law, ordaining the chief praetor to fix a nail every' year on the ides of September; it was driven into the right side of the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, towards Minervaâ€™s temple. This custom of keeping an account of time by means of fixing nails was not peculiar to the Romans; for, with the same view, the Etrurians used likewise to drive nails into the temple of their goddess Nortia.
