CHESELDEN, William, an eminent anatomist and surgeon, who was born at Burrow on the Hill, in the county of Leicester, and descended from an ancient family in the county of Rutland. He received the rudiments of his professional education at Leicester, and married Deborah Knight, a citizen’s daughter, by whom he had one daughter, Williamina Deborah. In 1713 he published his Anatomy of the Human Body, in one volume 8vo; and in 1723 a Treatise on the High Operation for the Stone. He was one of the earliest of his profession who contributed by his writings to raise it to its present eminence. In the beginning of 1736 he was thus honourably mentioned by Mr Pope: “As soon as I had sent my last letter, I received a most kind one from you, expressing great pain for my late illness at Mr Cheselden’s. I conclude you was eased of that friendly apprehension in a few days after you had dispatched yours, for mine must have reached you then. I wondered a little at your query, who Cheselden was? It shows that the truest merit does not travel so far any way as on the wings of poetry; he is the most noted and most deserving man in the whole profession of chirurgery, and has saved the lives of thousands by his manner of cutting for the stone.” He appears to have been on terms of the most intimate friendship with Mr Pope, who frequently, in his letters to Mr Richardson, talks of dining with Mr Cheselden, who then lived in or near Queen Square. In February 1737 Mr Cheselden was appointed surgeon to Chelsea hospital. He died at Bath on the 11th April 1752, of a disorder arising from drinking ale after eating hot buns. Finding himself uneasy, he sent for a physician, who advised vomiting immediately; and if the advice had been taken it was thought his life might have been saved. By his own direction he was buried at Chelsea.
