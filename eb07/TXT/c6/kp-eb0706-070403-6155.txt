CIRCULAR, in a general sense, any thing that is described, or moved round; as the circumference of a circle, or surface of a globe.

Circular Numbers, called also spherical ones, according to some,are such whose power√° terminate in the roots themselves. Thus, for instance, 5 and 6, all whose powers end in 5 and 6; as the square of 5 is 25, the square of 6 is 36, &c.

Circular Sailing is the method of sailing by the arch of a great circle. See Navigation.
