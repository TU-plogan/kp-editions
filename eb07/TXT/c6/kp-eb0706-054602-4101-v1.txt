CHILTERN, a chain of chalky hills forming the southern part of Buckinghamshire, the northern part of the county being distinguished by the name of the Vale. The air on these heights is extremely healthful. The soil, though stony, produces good crops of wheat and barley; and in many places it is covered with thick woods, among which are great quantities of beech. Chiltern is also applied to the hilly parts of Berkshire, and is believed to have the same meaning in some other counties. Hence the hundreds situated in those parts are denominated the Chiltern Hundreds. Chiltern Hundreds, Stewards of. Of the hundreds into which many of the English counties were divided by King Alfred for their better government, the jurisdiction was originally vested in peculiar courts; but it came afterwards to be devolved on the county courts, and so it remains at present, excepting with regard to some, as the Chilterns, which have by privilege been annexed to the crown. The latter having still their own courts, a steward of these courts is appointed by the chancellor of the exchequer, with a salary of twenty shillings, and all fees and perquisites belonging to the office; and this is deemed an appointment of sufficient profit to vacate a seat in parliament.
