CALYBITES, the inhabitants of a cottage; an appellation given to divers saints on account of their long residence in some hut, by way of mortification. The word is formed from καλυστω, tego, I cover ; whence καλu⅛ a little cot. The Romish church commemorates St John the Caly-bite on the 15th of December.
