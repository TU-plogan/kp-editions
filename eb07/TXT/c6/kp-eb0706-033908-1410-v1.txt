CHECKY, in Heraldry, is when the shield or a bordure is chequered, or divided into chequers or squares, in the manner of a chess-board. This is one of the most noble and most ancient figures used in armory; and a certain author says that it ought to be given to none but great warriors, in token of their bravery; for the chessboard represents a field of battle; and the pawns placed on both sides represent the soldiers of the two armies, and move, attack, advance, or retire, according to the will of the gamesters, who are the generals. This figure is always composed of metal and co]our; but some authors are disposed to reckon it as a sort of fur.
