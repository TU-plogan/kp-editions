CITHAERON, in Ancient Geography, a mountain and forest of Boeotia, celebrated both in fable and in song. To the west it runs obliquely, a little above the Sinus Crislaeus, taking its rise contiguous to the mountains of Megara and Attica; then declining into plains, it terminates at Thebes. It is famous for the fate of Pentheus and Actaeon, as also for the orgia, or revels of Bacchus.
