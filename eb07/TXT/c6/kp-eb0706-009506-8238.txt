CANOPY, in Architecture and Sculpture, a magnificent kind of decoration, serving to cover and crown an altar, throne, tribunal, pulpit, chair, or the like. The word is formed from the barbarous Latin canopeurn, of κανω-Τί/ον, a net spread over a bed to keep off the gnats, from καv⅛∙∙ψ, a gnat.

Canopies are also borne over the head in processions of state, after the manner of umbrellas. The canopy of an altar is more peculiarly called ciborium.

The Roman grandees had their canopies, or spread veils, called thensoe, over their chairs; and similar coverings were also placed, in temples, over the statues of their gods. The modern cardinals still retain the use of canopies.
