CAUKING, or Cavlking of a Ship, is driving a quantity of oakum, or old ropes untwisted and drawn asunder, into the seams of the planks, or into the intervals where the planks are joined together in the shipâ€™s decks or sides, in order to prevent the entrance of water or leakage. After the oakum is driven very hard into these seams, it is covered with hot melted pitch or rosin, to keep the water from rotting it. Among the ancients, the first who made use of pitch in caulking were the inhabitants of Phaeacia, afterwards called Corsica. Wax and rosin appear to have been commonly used previously to that period; and the Poles at one time used a sort of unctuous clay for the same purpose on their navigable rivers.

CAULABAGH, a town of Afghanistan, in the province of Caubul. It is a singularly built place, the houses being situated on terraces cut out of the declivity of the hill. Here it is that the country of the real Afghans commences; and that country as far as Peshawer is inhabited by a variety of tribes. In the vicinity of the town are large rocks, which yield an inexhaustible store of the pure rock salt; and there is, besides, a considerable manufacture of alum; in both of which articles an extensive trade is carried on with the neighbouring provinces, and proves highly beneficial to the inhabitants. The river Indus here flows in one channel, and is about 400 yards wide, but deep and rapid. The proper name of the town is Khara Bagh, or Garden of Salt. Long. 70. 46. E. Lat. 32. 11. N.
