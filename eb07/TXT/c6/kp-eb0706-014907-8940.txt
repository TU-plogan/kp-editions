CARNIVAL, or Carnaval, a time of rejoicing and season of mirth, observed with great solemnity by the Italians, particularly at Venice, and held from the twelfth day till Lent.

The word is formed from the Italian CÎ±rnavalle, which M. Du Cange derives from Carn-a-val, by reason of the flesh being then put in the pot, to make amends for the season of abstinence ensuing. Accordingly, in the corrupt Latin, he observes, it was called Carnelevamen and Car-nispriviurn ; as the Spaniards still denominate it carnes tollendas.

Feasts, balls, operas, concerts of musie, intrigues, marriages, and the like, are chiefly held in carnival time. The carnival begins at Venice the second holiday in Christmas. Then it is they begin to wear masks, and open their playhouses and gaming houses; while the place of St Mark is filled with mountebanks, jack-puddings, pedlars, prostitutes, and such like mobs, who flock thither from all parts. There have been no less than seven sovereign princes and 30,000 foreigners present to partake of these diversions.
