CALDWALL, Richard, a learned English physician, born in Staffordshire about the year 1513. He studied physic in Brazen-nose College, Oxford, and was examined, admitted into, and made censor of, the College of Physicians at London, all in one day. Six weeks afterwards he was chosen one of the elects; and in the year 1570 he was made president of that college. Wood informs us that he wrote several professional pieces; but he does not tell us what they were, only that he translated a book on the art of surgery, written by one Horatio More, a Florentine physician. We learn from Camden, that Caldwall founded a chirurgical lecture in the College of Physicians, and endowed it with a handsome salary. He died in 1585.
