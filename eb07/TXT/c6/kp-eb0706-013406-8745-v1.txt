CARAVANSERAI, or Kara vansera, a place appointed for receiving and loading the caravans. It is commonly a large square building, in the middle of which there is a very spacious court; and under the arches or piazzas that surround it there runs a bank, raised some feet above the ground, where the merchants and those who travel with them in any capacity take up their lodgings as well as they can, the beasts of burden being fastened to the foot of the bank. Over the gates that lead into the court there are sometimes little rooms, which the keepers of the caravanserais let out at a very high price to such as have a mind to be private.

The caravanserais in the East are something of the nature of the inns in Europe; only that you meet with little accommodation either for man or beast, but are obliged to carry almost every thing with you. There is no caravanserai without a well or spring of water. The existence of these buildings is chiefly owing to the charity of the Mahommedans; and they are esteemed as sacred dwellings, where it is not permitted to insult any person, or to pillage any of the effects that are deposited there. There are also caravanserais where most things may be had for money; and as the profits of these are considerable, the magistrates of the cities to whose jurisdiction they belong take care to store them well. There is an inspector, who, at the departure of each caravan, fixes the price of the night’s lodging, from which there is no appeal.
