CANE denotes a walking stick. It is, or rather was, customary to adorn it with a head of gold, silver, agate, or other substances. Some are without knots, and very smooth and even; others are full of knots about two inches distant from one another, and have but little elasticity.

Canes of Bengal are the most beautiful of those brought into Europe. Some of them are so fine, that people work them into bowls or vessels, which being varnished over in the inside with black or yellow lacca, arc capable of containing liquors as well as glass or china ware, and the Indians use them for that purpose.
