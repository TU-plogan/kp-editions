CHUNARGHUR, a town and fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Allahabad and district of Chunar, situated on the south bank of the Ganges. The first is built on the top of a solid rock, which rises abruptly from the plain, and projects into the river. It is fortified all round with a stone wall and small towers, and is a place of great strength; but its chief defence against escalade is a number of large round stones, which are piled round the rampart, ready to be hurled down on any rash assailant. It has a small citadel, two good houses for the commandant, and extensive magazines. This fortress has been sometimes used as a state prison; but the rays of the sun reflected from the rock render it very hot and unhealthy. The town of Chunar consists of a straggling collection of native huts and European dwellings. The batteries completely command the navigation of the river, so that no vessel can pass without inspection. Chunarghur is a very ancient fortress, and there is no record of its original foundation. The first time it is mentioned in Mahommedan history is [7:6:686]in the year 1491, when it was in possession of Sing Joan-pore. In 1530 it was the residence of Shere Khan, the Afghan who expelled the emperor Humayon from Hindustan. In 1575 it was recovered by the emperor Akbar, after a siege of six months. In 1763 it belonged to the nuwab Shuja Addowleh; and it was then attacked by the English, who were repulsed by the garrison rolling down large stones on the storming party; but it was soon after delivered up to the British without a siege, and has ever since been garrisoned by their troops. The hills, which approach very near the town, contain quarries of excellent freestone, which is in great demand at Benares and other towns down the river. From these quarries a handsome revenue arises to government. Since the British frontier has been extended farther north, Chunarghur has been superseded by Allahabad as a military depot. The travelling distance from Calcutta by Moorshedabad is 574 miles, by Birboom 469 miles.
