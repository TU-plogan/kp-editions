CLEDONISM, Cledonismus, a kind of divination, in use among the ancients. The word is formed from κλ)jδw>, which signifies two things, rumor, a report, and avis, a bird. In the first sense, cledonism should denote a kind of divination drawn from words occasionally uttered. Cicero observes, that the Pythagoreans observed not only the words of the gods, but those of men; and accordingly believed the pronouncing of certain words, for instance incendium, at a meal, very unlucky. Thus, instead of prison, they used the word domicilium ; and to avoid erinηys, furies, they said eumenides. In the second sense, cledοηisrη should indicate a divination drawn from birds, and mean the same thing with ornithomantia.
