CAPTIVE, a slave, or a person taken from the enemy. Formerly captives in war became the slaves of those who took them; and though slavery, such as obtained among the ancients, is now abolished, some shadow of it still remains in respect of prisoners of war, who are accounted the property of their captors, and have no right to liberty but by concession from them. The Romans used their captives with great severity; their necks were exposed to the soldiers to be trampled on, and their persons afterwards sold by public auction. Captives were frequently burnt in the funeral piles of the ancient warriors, as a sacrifice to the infernal gods. Those of royal or noble blood had their heads shaven, and their hair sent to Rome to serve as decorations for female toys, and the like. They were led in triumph, loaded with chains, through Rome, in the emperorâ€™s train, at least as far as the foot of the Capitoline Mount; for they were not permitted to ascend the sacred hill, but carried thence to prison. Those of the first quality were honoured with golden chains on their hands and feet, and golden collars on their necks. If they made their escape, or killed themselves, to avoid the ignominy of being carried in triumph, their images or effigies were frequently carried in their place.
