CHEVALIER, a French term, ordinarily signifying a knight. The word is formed from the French cheval, a horse, and the barbarous Latin cavallιιs. It is used in heraldry to signify any cavalier or horseman armed at all points, and is the same as the Romans called cataphractus eques. CHEVAUX-de-Frise. See Cheval-de-Frise.
