CARRYING, in falconry, signifies a hawk’s flying away with the quarry. Carrying is one of the ill qualities of a hawk, which she acquires either by dislike of the falconer, or from not being sufficiently broken to the lure.

Carrying, among huntsmen. When a hare runs on rotten ground, or even sometimes in a frost, and it sticks to her feet, they say she carries.

Carrying, among riding-masters. A horse is said to carry low, when having naturally an ill-shaped neck, he lowers his head too much. A horse is said to carry well when his neck is raised or arched, and he holds his head high and firm, without constraint.
