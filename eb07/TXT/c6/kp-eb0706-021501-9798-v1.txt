+=====================================================================+


CASLON, William, eminent in an art of the greatest consequence to literature, the art of letter-founding, was born in the year 1692, in that part of the town of Hales Owen which is situated in Shropshire. Though he justly attained the character of being the coryphaeus in that employment, he was not brought up to the business; and it is observed by Mr Mores that the craft is so concealed among the artificers of it, that he could not discover any one who had taught it to another, but every person who used it had learned it of his own genuine inclination. Mr Caslon served a regular apprenticeship to an engraver of ornaments on gun-barrels; and, after the expiration of his term, he carried on this trade in Vine Street, near the Minories. He did not, however, confine his ingenuity solely to that instrument, but employed himself likewise in making tools for the bookbinders, and for the chasing of silver plate. Whilst he was engaged in this business, the elder Mr Bowyer accidentally saw, in a bookseller’s shop, the lettering of a book uncommonly neat; and inquiring the name of the artist by whom the letters were made, was thus induced to seek an acquaintance with Mr Caslon. Not long afterwards Mr Bowyer took Mr Caslon to Mr James’s founđery in Bartholomew-close. Caslon had never before that time seen any part of the business; and being asked by his friend if he thought he could undertake to cut types, he requested a single day to consider the matter, and then replied that he had no doubt but he could. Upon this answer, Mr Bowyer, Mr Bettenham, and Mr W’atts, had such a confidence in his abilities, that they lent him L.500 to begin the undertaking, and he applied himself to it with equal assiduity and success.. In 1720 the Society for promoting Christian Knowledge, in consequence of a representation from Mr Solomon Negri, a native of Damascus in Syria, who was well skilled in the oriental tongues, and had been professor of Arabic in places of note, deemed it expedient to print, for the use of the Eastern churches, the New Testament and Psalter, in the Arabic language. These were intended for the benefit of the poor Christians in Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and Egypt, countries the constitution of which did not permit the exercise of the art of printing. Upon this occasion Mr Caslon was pitched upon to cut the fount; and in his specimens he distinguished it by the name of English Arabic. Under the further encouragement of Mr Bowyer, Mr Bcttenham, and Mr Watts, he proceeded with vigour in his employment; and he arrived at length at such perfection, that he not only freed us from the necessity of importing types from Holland, but, in the beauty and elegance of those made by him, so far exceeded the productions of the best artificers, that his workmanship was frequently exported to the Continent. In short, his founđery became, in process of time, one of the best either in this or in foreign countries. Having acquired opulence in the course of his employment, he was put into the commission of the peace for the county of Middlesex. Towards the latter end of his life, his eldest son being then in partnership with him, he retired in a great measure from active business. His death happened in January 1766.
