CEILING, in Architecture, the top or roof a lower room; or a covering of plaster over laths nailed on the bottom of the joists which support the floor of the upper room, or, where there is no upper room, on joists for the purpose, hence called ceiling joists. The word ceiling answers pretty accurately to the Latin lacunar, meaning every thing over head.
