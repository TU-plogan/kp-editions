CATABAMBA, a province of Peru, bounded on the north by the province of Abancay, on the south-west and south by that of Chilques and Masques, on the west by that of Chumbivilcas, and on the north-west by that of Aima-raez. It is seventy-five miles in length from east to west, and twenty-three in breadth from north to south. This province is mountainous, and of a cold temperature. In the valleys and low lands there are a number of pastures, on which cattle are reared. Wheat, maize, and pulse, grow here, but not in great abundance. In some parts plantains, figs, and water melons, are produced. There is an abundance of that peculiar plant, the leaves of which are manufactured into hemp, from which are made those cords and thick ropes used in the construction of bridges across rivers. There are twenty-five settlements, and the inhabitants amount to about 10,000. The capital is an inconsiderable place, of the same name, although sometimes called Tumbabamba.
