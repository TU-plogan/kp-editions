CASALE, one of the provinces into which the Italian kingdom of Sardinia is divided. It is bounded on the north by Vercelli, on the east by Moltara, on the south by Alessandria, and on the west by Asti. It extends over 375 square miles, or 239,360 English acres.

The breeding of cattle is considerable. There are no manufactures except the first steps in the process of preparing silk. It contains two cities, eighty-eight towns and villages, some large farming establishments, and 94,370 inhabitants.
