CASTIGATORY for Scolds. A woman indicted for being a common scold, if convicted, shall be placed in a certain engine of correction, called the trehucket castigatory, or caching stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool ; though now it is frequently corrupted into the ducking stool, because the residue of the judgment is, that when she is placed therein, she shall be plunged in water for her punishment.
