CHARTULARY, Chartularius, a title given to an ancient officer in the Latin church, who had the care of charters and papers relating to public affairs. The chartulary presided in ecclesiastical judgments, in place of the p>ope. In the Greek church the chartulary was called chartophylax ; but his office was there much more considerable; and some even distinguished the chartulary from the chartophylax in the Greek church. See Charto- PHYLAX.
