CAPHTOR, in Ancient Geography, a town or district of Upper Egypt; and hence the people called Caphtorim or Caphtorei. CAPI-Aga, or Capi-Agassi, a Turkish officer who is governor of the gates of the seraglio, or grand master of the seraglio. The capi-aga is the first dignity among the white eunuchs; lie is always near the person of the grand signior; he introduces ambassadors to public audiences; and nobody enters or goes out of the grand signior’s apartment but by his means. His office gives him the.privilege of wearing the turban in the seraglio, and of going everywhere on horseback. He accompanies the grand signior to the apartment of the sultanas, but stops at the door without entering. His appointment is very moderate: the grand signior bears the expense of his table, and allows him at the rate of about sixty French livres per day; but his office brings him abundance of presents, no affair of consequence coming to the emperor’s knowledge with out passing through his hand. The capi-aga cannot become pasha when he quits his post.
