CHOISI, or Choisy, Francis Timoleon de, dean of the cathedral of Bayeux, was born at Paris in 1644. His mother, who doated on him, used to amuse herself by clothing him in female attire, and his figure, which was feminine and pretty, aided this deception; but, it seems, “il abusa, auprès de plusieurs femmes, de l’erreur où il les jetait, et de la sécurité qu’il leur inspira.” A recital of his adventures of this description will be found in L’Histoire de Madame la Comtesse des Barres, the name which he assumed in order to complete his disguise. He abandoned this detestable practice, however, and seems to have become ashamed of his vices, if not to have acquired a [7:6:618] duc sense of religion. In 1685 he was sent with the Chevalier de Chaumont to the king of Siam, and w as ordained priest in the Indies by the apostolical vicar. He wrote a great number of works, in a florid style, the principal of which are, 1. Four Dialogues on the Immortality of the Soul; 2. Histories of St Louis, Philip of Valois, John, Charles V. and Charles VI. first published separately in 4to, but afterwards collected in four vols. 12mo; 3. Account of a Voyage to Siam; 4. An Ecclesiastical History, in eleven vols. 4to; 5. Life of Dávid, with an Interpretation of the Psalms; 6. Life of Solomon. He died at Paris in 1724.
