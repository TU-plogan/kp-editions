CARACT, or Carat, the name of that weight which expresses the degree of fineness of gold. The word is also written carract, carrat, harract, and harrat. Its origin is contested; but the most probable opinion is that of Kennet, who derives it from carecta, a term which anciently denoted any weight, and came afterwards to be appropriated to that which expresses the fineness of gold and the gravity of diamonds.

These carats are not real determinate weights, but only imaginary. The whole mass, be the weight what it will, is conceived to be divided into twenty-four carats; and as many twenty-fourth parts as it contains of pure gold, it is called gold of so many carats, or so many carats fine. Thus, gold of eighteen carats is a mixture, of which eighteen parts are of pure gold, and the other six of an inferior metal. This is the common way of reckoning in Europe, and at the gold mines in the Spanish West Indies, but with some variation in the subdivision of the carat; for among us it is divided into four grains, among the Germans into twelve parts, and among the French, according to Mr Helot, into thirty-two. The Chinese reckon by a different division called touches, of which the highest number, or that which denotes pure gold, is a hundred; so that a hundred touches correspond to our twenty-four carats.

Carλct is also a certain weight which goldsmiths and jewellers use for weighing precious stones and pearls. In thŉ sense the word is supposed by some tobe derived from the Greek κigαr∕ov, a fruit which the Latins call siliqua, and we carob bean, each of which may weigh above four grains of wheat; and hence the Latin siliqua has been used for the weight of four grains. This caract weighs four grains; but they are sometimes lighter than the grains of other weights. Each of these grains is subdivided into X 1 χ _ı_
