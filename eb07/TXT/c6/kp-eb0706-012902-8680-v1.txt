CAPTAIN, a military officer. There are several kinds of captains, according to their commands.

Captain of a Troop or Company, an officer who commands a troop of horse or a company of foot under a colonel. In the horse and foot guards, the captains have the rank of colonels.
[7:6:130]

Captain- General, he who commands in chief.

CAPTAiN-Lieutenant, he who, with the rank of captain, but the pay of lieutenant, commands a troop or company in the name and place of some other person who is dispensed with, on account of his quality, from performing the functions of his post. Thus the colonel being usually captain of the first company of his regiment, that company is commanded by his deputy under the title of Captain-Lieutenant. So in England, as well as in France, the king, dauphin, princes, and others, have usually the title of captain of the guards, gens cl 'armes, &c.; the real duty of which offices is performed by captain-lieutenants.

Captain Reformed, one who, upon the reduction of the forces, has his commission and company suppressed, yet is continued captain, either as second to another, or without any post or command at all.

Captain of a Ship of War, the officer who commands a ship of the line or a frigate carrying twenty or more cannon. The charge of a captain in his majesty’s navy is very comprehensive, in às much as he is not only answerable for any bad conduct in the military government, navigation, and equipment of the ship he commands, but also for any neglect of duty or ill management in his inferior officers, whose several charges he is appointed to superintend and regulate. See Navy- Captain of a merchant-ship, he who has the direction of the ship, crew, lading, &c. In small ships and short voyages lie is more ordinarily called the master. In the Mediterranean he is called the patroon. Captain Pashαu, or Capdan Pasha, in the polity of the Turks, signifies the Turkish high admiral. He possesses the third office of the empire, and is invested with the same power at sea as the vizier has on shore. Soliman II. instituted this office in favour of the famous Barbarossa, with absolute authority over the officers of the marine and arsenal, whom he may punish, cashier, or put to death, as soon as he is without the Dardanelles. He commands in chief in all the maritime countries, cities, castles, &c.; and at Constantinople he is the first magistrate of police in the villages on the side of the Porte and the canal of the Black Sea. The mark of his authority is a large Indian cane, which he carries in his hand both in the arsenal and with the army.
