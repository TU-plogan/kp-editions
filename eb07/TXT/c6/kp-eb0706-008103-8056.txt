CANICULUM, or Caniculus, in the Byzantine antiquities, a golden standish or ink vessel, decorated with precious stones, in which was kept the sacred encaustum, or red ink, wherewith the emperors signed their deerecs, letters, &c. The word is by some derived from canis, or caniculus ; alluding to the figure of a dog which it represented, or rather because it was supported by the figures of dogs. The caniculum was under the care of a particular officer of state.
