CHRONOMETER denotes, in general, any instrument or machine used in measuring time, such as dials, clocks, watches, and the like.

The term chronometer, however, is commonly used in a more limited sense for a kind of clock, so contrived as to measure a small portion of time with great exactness, even to the sixteenth part of a second. There have been several machines under this name contrived for measuring time, upon principles very different from those on which docks and watches are constructed.

Chronometer, among musicians, an instrument invented by Loulie, a French musician, for the purpose of measuring time by means of a pendulum. The form of the instrument, as described by him, is that of an Ionic pilaster, and is described by Malcolm in his Treatise of Music, p. 407.
