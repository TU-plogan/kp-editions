CASSANDRA, in fabulous history, the daughter of Priam and Hecuba, was beloved of Apollo, who promised to bestow on her the spirit of prophecy, provided she would eonsent to his love. Cassandra seemed to accept the proposal, but had no sooner obtained that gift than she laughed at the tempter, and broke her word. Apollo, being enraged, revenged himself by causing her predictions to be discredited; and hence she prophesied in vain the ruin of Troy. Ajax, the son of Oileus, having ravished her in the temple of Minerva, was struck with thunder. Cassandra fell into the hands of Agamemnon, who loved her to distraction; but in vain did she predict that he would be assassinated in his own country. Both were killed by the intrigues of Clytemnestra; but their death was avenged by Orestes.
