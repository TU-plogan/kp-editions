CAWNPORE, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Allahabad, situated on the western bank of the Ganges. It is an ancient Hindu town, on the high road between Culpec and Lucknow, forty-nine miles south-west from the latter place; and it formerly carried on a considerable trade. It is now better known as the chief military station of the British in the ceded provinces. The buildings which have been erected here for the accommodation of the troops are, barracks for four hundred artillery, two regiments of European and three of native cavalry, and seven thousand native infantry, with a general hospital for the reception of the sick. The officers of every description provide their own lodgings, which consist of elegant bungalows built without any regularity, and which extend about six miles along the Ganges. Cawnpore is situated in the upper part of that vast plain which extends from the Bay of Bengal to the mountains of Thibet. It is subject to great heats. The hot winds blow here with great violence during the months of April, May, and June; not a drop of rain falls; and from the parched ground clouds of dust arise so thick as to obscure the sun, and to envelope the station in darkness. Cawnpore is nevertheless esteemed a healthy station. After the cession of the country between the Ganges and the Jumna to the British in the year 1802, Cawnpore was made one of the civil stations, and an establishment appointed for the administration of justice and the collection of the revenue. The adjacent country is highly improved, and has greatly profited by the demand of the Europeans, and the high prices given, for agricultural produce. In the adjacent country Indian corn, grain, barley, and wheat, are cultivated; and in their season turnips, cabbages, and European vegetables, are abundant. Grapes, peaches, with a profusion of fruit, have been long supplied by Europeans. It is 49 miles south-west from Lucknow. Long. 80. 21. E. Lat. 26. 30. N.
