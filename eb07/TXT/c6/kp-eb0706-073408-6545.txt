CLEARCHUS, a tyrant of Heraclea in Pontus, who was killed by Chion and Leonidas, Platoâ€™s pupils, during the celebration of the festivals of Bacchus. He had enjoyed the sovereign power during twelve years. Clearcbus was also the name of a Lacedaemonian who was sent to quiet the Byzantines, and being recalled, refused to obey, and fled to Cyrus the Younger, who made him captain of 13,000 Greek soldiers. He obtained a victory over Artaxerxes, who was so enraged at the defeat, that when Clearchus fell into his hands by the treachery of Tissaphernes, the king immediately put him to death.
