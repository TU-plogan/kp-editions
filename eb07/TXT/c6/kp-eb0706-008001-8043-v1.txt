CANGI, Ceangi, or Caηgani, anciently a people of Britain, concerning whose situations antiquaries have been much perplexed. These various names indicate the same people. Camden discovered some traces of them in many different and distant places, as in Somersetshire, Wales, Derbyshire, and Cheshire; and he might have found as plain vestiges of them in Devonshire, Dorsetshire, Essex, Wiltshire, &c. Mr Horsley and others are perplexed and undetermined in their opinions on this subject. But Mr Baxter seems to have discovered the true cause of their perplexity, by observing that the Cangi or Ceangi were not a distinct nation seated in one particular place, but such of the youth of many different nations as were employed in pasturage, in feeding the flocks and herds of their respective tribes. Almost all the ancient nations of Britain had their ceangi, Ú\Cvr pastoritiα pubes, the keepers of their flocks and herds, who ranged about the country in great numbers, as they were invited by the season and plenty of pasture for their cattle. This is the reason that, vestiges of their name are to be found in so many different parts of Britain, but chiefly in those parts which are most fit for pasturage. These ceangi of the different British nations, naturally brave, and rendered still more hardy by their way of life, were constantly armed for the protection of their flocks from wild beasts; and these arms they occasionally employed in the defence of their country and their liberty.
