CARDIFF, a market-town of Glamorganshire, South Wales, where the assizes and sessions are held. It consists of two parishes, though it has but one church. It is watered by the river Taaf, which is connected by means of a canal with the distant parts of the country, by which a vast quantity of iron is brought from the founderies and furnaces in the interior, to be shipped at the port of Cardiff, about three miles below the town. The same conveyance [7:6:137] is used for the large number of boxes of tin plates which the country supplies. The borough unites with Swansea, Loughor, Neath, Aberavon, and Ken-fig, in returning a member to parliament. It has markets on Wednesday and Saturday, and is distant from London 160 miles. The population amounted in 1811 to 2458, in 1821 to 3521, and in 1831 to 6187.
