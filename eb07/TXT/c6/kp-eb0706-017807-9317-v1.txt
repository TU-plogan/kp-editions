CARSE, a word signifying a flat piece of ground, has been applied to three several tracts of country in Scotland, namely, the Carse of Falkirk, the Carse of Gowrie, and the Carse of Stirling. It was long matter of plausible conjecture that these flat tracts of land on the borders of large rivers had been formed by the deposition of alluvial matter and the change of the water-courses; and the light of modern science, with careful investigation, has confirmed the fact. Bones of large marine animals have been found embedded many feet below the surface of the soil; thus demonstrating that such places must have been at some former period, but subsequently to the Mosaic deluge, within the flow of the sea. Some years ago the perfect skeleton of a whale was found at Airthrie, in the Carse of Stirling, many miles from the sea, or the Frith of Forth, and a considerable distance from the present course of the river. Anchors, and other artificial articles, have at various times been found in the Carse of Falkirk. The nature of the soil of these carses is also probative of the fact.

Carse of Falkirk, The, stretches for nearly ten miles in a westerly direction, from about Borrowstownness to Air th, along the south shore of the Frith of Forth. Its breadth varies from one to two miles. On the margin of the sea the land is rich and productive, and rises in well-cultivated[7:6:179] acclivities on the south. It is broadest below Falkirk, where it is irrigated by the placid waters of the Carron.

Carse of Gowrie, The, is a portion of the district of Gowrie, in Perthshire, and consists of a level tract of land on the north side of the Frith of Tay, from the neighbourhood of Dundee on the east, till it rises into an eminence at the transition of the Tay from a frith to a river. On the north it is bounded by the Siedlaw Hills. It comprehends a breadth of from two to three miles by a length of fifteen. It is celebrated for its rural loveliness and high state of cultivation.

Carse of Stirling, The, is a beautiful tract of land stretching from the Devon on the north side of the Forth, on both banks of that rivcr, to beyond Stirling. In the centre it is intersected by the windings of the Forth. It also possesses great rural beauty, and is in a high state of cultivation.
