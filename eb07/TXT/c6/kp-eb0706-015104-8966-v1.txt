CAROOR, a town of Hindustan, in the district of South Coimbetoor. It is situated on the north bank of the Amarawati, or Caroor river, and contains above 1000 houses. The Caroor was the ancient boundary between the dominions of Mysore and Trichinopoly; and owing to this favourable situation, and being also guarded by a strong fort, it became a place of great mercantile resort and opulence. It was taken in 1760, during the wars of the Carnatic, by the British. It is forty-two miles west from Trichinopoly. Long. 78. 12. E. Lat. 10. 55. N.
