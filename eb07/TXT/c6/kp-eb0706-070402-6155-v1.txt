CIRCUIT, in Law, signifies the journey or progress which the judges take twice every year, through the several counties of England and Wales, to hold courts and administer justice, where recourse cannot be had to the king’s court at Westminster; and hence England is divided into six circuits, viz. the home circuit, Norfolk circuit, ^Midland circuit, Oxford circuit, Western circuit, and Northern circuit. In Wales there arc but two circuits, those of North and South Wales. Two judges are assigned by the king’s commission to every circuit.

In Scotland the judges of the supreme criminal court, or court of justiciary, are divided into three separate courts, consisting of two judges each; and the kingdom into as many districts. In certain burghs of every district, each of these courts by rotation is obliged to hold two courts in the year, in spring and autumn; which are called Circuit Courts. One more is now held at Glasgow during the Christmas recess.
