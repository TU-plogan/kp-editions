CANONICAL, something that belongs to, or partakes of, the nature of a rule or canon.

Canonical Hours are certain stated times of the day, consigned, more especially by the Romish church, to the offices of prayer and devotion. Such are matins, lauds, sixth and ninth vespers. In our country the canonical hours are from eight to twelve in the forenoon, before or after which marriage cannot be legally performed in any parish church.

Canonical Obedience is that Submission which, by the ecclesiastical laws, the inferior clergy are bound to pay to their bishops, and religious persons to their superiors.

Canonical Sins, in the ancient church, those which were deemed capital or mortal. Such especially were idolatry, murder, adultery, heresy, and schism.

Canonical Punishments are those which the church may inflict; such as excommunication, degradation, and penance, in Roman Catholic countries; also fasting, alms, whipping, and the like.

Canonical Life, the method or rule of living prescribed by the ancient clergy who lived in community. The canonical life was a kind of medium between the monastic and clerical lives. Originally the orders of monks and clerks were entirely distinct; but pious persons, in process of time, instituted colleges of priests and canons, where clerks, brought up for the ministry, as well as others already engaged therein, might live under a fixed rule, which, though somewhat more easy than the monastic, was yet more restrained than the secular. This was called the canonical life, and those who embraced it canons. Authors are divided about the founder of the canonical life. Some will have it to be founded by the apostles; others ascribe it to Pope Urban I. about the year 1230, who is said to have ordered bishops to provide such of their clergy as were willing to live in community, with necessaries out of the revenues of their churches. The generality attribute it to St Augustin, who, having gathered a number of clerks to devote themselves to religion, instituted a monastery within the episcopal palace, where he lived in community with them. Onuphrius Pan-vinus[7:6:95] brings the institution somewhat lower; according to him, Pope Gelasius I. about the year 495, placed the first regular canons of St Augustin in the Lateran church.

Canonical Letters, in the ancient church, were a sort of testimonials of the orthodox faith, which the bishops and clergy sent each other, to keep up the Catholic communion, and distinguish orthodox Christians from Arians and other heretics. They were denominated canonical, cither as being composed according to a certain rule or form, or because they were given to the canonici, that is, those comprehended in the canon or catalogue of their church. When they had occasion to travel into other dioceses or countries, dimissory and recommendatory letters, also letters of peace, and the like, were so many species of canonical letters.

Canonical is also an appellation given to those epistles in the New Testament, more frequently called catholic or general epistles.
