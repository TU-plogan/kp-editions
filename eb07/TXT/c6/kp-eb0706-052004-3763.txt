CHEVIOT, or Tivιoτ Hills, run from north to south through Northumberland and Cumberland, and formerly constituted the borders or boundaries between England and Scotland, where many a bloody battle was fought between the two nations, one of which is recorded in the ballad of Chevy Chase. These hills are the first land discovered by sailors in coming to Scotland from the east.
