CARTOUCHE, in Architecture and Sculpture, an ornament representing a scroll of paper. It is usually a flat member, with wavings to represent some inscription, device, cipher, or ornament of armoury. Cartouches are, in architecture, much the same as modifiions; only the latter are set under the cornice in wainscotting, and the former are set under the cornice at the caves of a house.

Cartouche, in the military art, signifies a case of wood, about three inches thick at the bottom, girt with marline, and containing about four hundred musket balls, besides six or eight balls of iron of a pound weight, to be fired out of a hobit, for the defence of a pass, or the like.

A cartouche is sometimes made of a globular form, and filled with a ball of a pound weight; sometimes it is made for the guns, being filled with balls of half or quarter a pound weight, according to the nature of the gun, tied in the form of a bunch of grapes, on a tompion of wood, and coated over. These were used instead of partridge-shot.

Cartouche, in hieroglyphics, is the term applied by the French savans to the elliptical ring or oval which incloses every proper name in a monumental inscription. In the hieratic and demotic, enchorial, or civil forms of writing, the cartouche or oval degenerates into rude brackets.
