CIRCENSIAN Games, a general term under which was comprehended all combats exhibited in the Roman circus, in imitation of the Olympic games in Greece. Most of the feasts of the Romans were accompanied with Circensian games; and the magistrates and other officers of the republic frequently presented the people with these shows, in order to procure their favour. The grand games were held during five days, commencing on the 13th of September.
