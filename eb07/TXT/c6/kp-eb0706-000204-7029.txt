CALENBERG, a principality or duchy in the kingdom of Hanover. It is bounded on the north-east by Luneburg; on the south-east by Hildesheim; on the south by Brunswick, the Prussian circle of Minden, and Pyrmont; and on the west by Lippe, Schaumburg, and Hoya. It is 1090 square miles, or 667,800 English acres, in extent; and contains a populatiou of 151,000 persons. The city of Hanover is the capital of the pincipality, as well as of the kingdom. The southern part is generally hilly, but with broad valleys interposed. The northern division is part of that sandy plain which extends through the Continent, and is of little fertility except in a few spots. The principal products are corn,cattle, butter, and flax; and the latter, made into yarn or cloth, is almost the only article manufactured for exportation. The river Weser flows through one part of this principality; and the Leine, which also passes through it, has by great efforts been made navigable.
