CHOSE (Fr.), a thing, used in the common law with divers epithets, as chose local, chose transitory, and chose in action. Chose local is such a thing as is annexed to a place, as a mill and the like; chose transitory is that thing which is movable, and may be taken away, or carried from place to place; and chose in action is a thing incorporeal, and only a right, as an obligation for debt, annuity, and the like. And generally all causes of suit for any debt, duty, or wrong, are to be accounted as choses in action; and it seems chose in action may be also called chose in suspense, because it has no real existence or being, nor can properly be said to be in our possession.
