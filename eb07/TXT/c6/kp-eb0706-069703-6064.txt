CIMOLIA Terra, in Natural History, a name applied by the ancients to an earth, at one time much employed in medicine, but which in later ages has been supposed to be no other than our tobacco-pipe clay and fullers’ earth.

The cimolia terra of the ancients was found in several of the islands of the Archipelago, particularly in the island of Cimolus, whence it derived its name. It was used with great success in erysipelas, inflammations, and the like, being applied by way of cataplasm to the part affected. The ancients also used, as we do, what we call cimolia, or fullers’ earth, for the cleansing of clothes. This earth, though so long disregarded, and by many supposed to be lost, is yet very plentiful in Argentiere (the ancient Cimolus), Sphanto, and many of those islands. It is a marl of a lax and crumbly texture, and a pure bright white colour, but very soft to the touch. It adheres firmly to the tongue, and, if thrown into water, raises a little hissing[7:6:698] and ebullition, and moulders to a fine powder. It makes a considerable effervescence with acids, and suffers no change of colour in the fire. These are the characters of what the ancients called simply terra cimolia ; but besides this, they obtained from the same place another earth which they called by the same general name, but which was distinguished by the epithet purple, purpurescens. This they described as fattish, cold to the touch, of a mixed purple colour, and nearly as hard as a stone.

Cimolia Alba, the officinal name of the earth of which we now make tobacco-pipes. Its distinguishing characters are, that it is a dense, compact, heavy earth, of a dull white colour, and very close texture, not easily frangible between the fingers, and slightly staining the skin in handling. It adheres firmly to the tongue, melts very slowly in the mouth, and is not readily diffusible in water. It is found in many places. That of the Isle of Wight is much esteemed for its colour. It is found in great abundance near Pole in Dorsetshire, and near Wedensbury in Staffordshire.

Cimolia Nigra is of a dark lead colour, hard, dry, and heavy, of a smooth compact texture, and not viscid. It does not colour the hands, crumbles when dry, adheres to the tongue, diffuses slowly in water, and is not acted upon by acids. It burns perfectly white, and acquires a considerable hardness. The chief pits for this clay are near Northampton, where it is used in the manufacture of tobacco-pipes. It is also mixed with the critche clay of Derbyshire, in the proportion of one part to three, in the manufacture of the hard reddish-brown ware.
