CEDRENUS, George, a Grecian monk, who lived in the eleventh century, and wrote Annals, or an abridged History, from the beginning of the world to the reign of Isaac Comnenus, emperor of Constantinople, who succeeded Michael IV. in 1057. This work is no more than a compilation from several historians. There is an edition of it printed at Paris in 1647, with the Latin version of Xylander, and the notes of Father Goar, a Dominican.
