CELEUSMA, or Celeuma, in Antiquity, the shout or cry of the seamen, by which they animated each other in their work of rowing. The word is formed from κsasuε∕r, to call, or give the signal. Celeusma was also a kind of song or formula, rehearsed or played by the master or others, to direct the strokes and movements of the mariners, as well as to encourage them to labour.
