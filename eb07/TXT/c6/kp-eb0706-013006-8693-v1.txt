CAPUCHINS, religious persons of the order of St Francis in its strictest observance; deriving their name from capuce, or capuchon, a stuff cap, or cowl, wherewith they cover their heads. They are clothed with brown or gray, always barefooted, and never travel in coaches, nor shave their beards. The Capuchins are a reformed body of the order of Minors, commonly called Cordeliers, set on foot in the sixteenth century by Matthew Baschi, a religious observant of the monastery of Montefiascone; who, being at Rome, was advertised several times from heaven [7:6:131] to practise the rule of St Francis to the letter. Upon this he made application to Pope Clement in 1525, who gave him permission to retire into a solitude, with as many others as chose to embrace the strict observance. In 1528 they obtained the pope’s bull. In 1529 the order was brought into complete form, Matthew was elected general, and the chapter framed constitutions. In 1543 the right of preaching was taken from the Capuchins by the pope; but in 1545 it was restored to them again with honour. In 1578 there were already seventeen general chapters in the order of Capuchins.
