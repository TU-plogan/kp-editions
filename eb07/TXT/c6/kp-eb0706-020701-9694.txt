CARTHUSIANS, a religious order, founded by one Brudo in the year 1080. The Carthusians, so called from the desert of Chartreux, the place of their institution, are remarkable for the austerity of their rules. They are not permitted to quit their cells, except to go to church, without leave of their superior, nor speak to any person without leave. They must not keep any portion of their meat or drink till next day; their beds are of straw, covered with a felt; their clothing consists of two hair-cloths, two cowls, two pairs of hose, and a cloak, all of coarse texture. In the refectory they are enjoined to keep their eyes on the dish, their hands on the table, their attention on the reader, and their hearts fixed on God. Women are not allowed to come into their churches. The actual number of houses belonging to'this order cannot be accurately ascertained. They are divided into sixteen provinces, each of which has two visitors. There have been several canonized saints of this order, four cardinals, seventy archbishops and bishops, and a great many very learned writers.
