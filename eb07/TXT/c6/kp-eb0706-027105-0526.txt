CELETES, or Celetae (from κι ∖ ης, a race-horse), in Antiquity, denote single or saddle-horses, by way of contradistinction from those which were yoked or harnessed together, and called bigarii, quadrigarii, &c. The same denomination is also given to the cavaliers, or riders on horseback; and hence some deduce celeres, the name of Romulus’s guard.
