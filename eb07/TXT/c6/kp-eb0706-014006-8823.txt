CAREY, Harry, a man distinguished both in poetry [7:6:141]and music, but perhaps more so by a certain facetiousness, which made him agreeable to everybody. He published in 1720 a little collection of poems, and in 1732 six cantatas, written and composed by himself. He also composed sundry songs for modern comedies, particularly those in the Provoked Husband; he wrote a farce called The Contrivances, in which were several little songs set to very pretty airs of his own composition; and he also composed two or three little dramas for Goodman’s Fields Theatre, which were very favourably received. In 1729 he published by subscription his poems much enlarged, with the addition of one entitled Namby Pamby, in which Ambrose Philips is ridiculed. Carey’s talent, says his historian, lay in humour and satire without malevolence. To ridicule the rant and bombast of modern tragedies, he wrote one, to which he gave the strange title of Chrononhotonthologos, acted in 1734. He also wrote a farce called The Honest Yorkshireman. Carey was a thorough Englishman, and had an insurmountable aversion to the Italian opera and the singers in it; he wrote a burlesque opera on the subject of the Dragon of Wantley, and afterwards a sequel to it, entitled the Dragoness, both which were esteemed a good burlesque of the Italian opera. His qualities being of the entertaining kind, he was led into more expenses than his finances could bear, and thus was frequently in distress. His friends, however, were always ready to assist him by their little subscriptions to his works; and encouraged by these, he republished in 1740 all the songs he had ever composed, in a collection entitled The Musical Century, in a hundred English Ballads, and in 1743 his dramatic works in a small volume 4to. With all his mirth and good humour, he seems to have been at times deeply affected with the malevolence of some of his own profession, who, for reasons that no one can guess at, were his enemies; and this, with the pressure of his circumstances, is supposed to have occasioned his untimely end; for about 1744, at his house in Warner Street, Cold Bath Fields, he, in a fit of desperation, put a period to a life which, Sir John Hawkins says, was without reproach. It is to be noted, and it is somewhat singular in such a character, that in all his songs and poems on wine, love, and such kinds of subjects, he seems to have manifested an inviolable regard for decency and good maimers.
