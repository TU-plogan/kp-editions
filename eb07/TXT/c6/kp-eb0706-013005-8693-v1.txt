CAPUA, a city, the capital of the province Terra di Lavoro, in the kingdom of Naples. It is on the river Volturno, and is fortified. The air in summer is unhealthy, and the water scarcely drinkable. The principal streets are paved with lava, but the others are in a neglected state. Though it contains a cathedral, eighteen parish churches, and thirty-thrce cloister churches, with six hospitals, the number of inhabitants does not exceed 8000. In the neighbourhood are some medicinal springs, and quarries of good tuffstein. It is in longitude 13. 51. E. and latitude 41.7. N. The ancient Capua was situated at the village of Santa Maria, a short distance from the present city.
