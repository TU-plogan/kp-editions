CALVERT, George, afterwards Lord Baltimore, was born at Kipling in Yorkshire about the year 1582, and educated at Oxford, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts. He afterwards travelled. At his return he was made secretary to Sir Robert Cecil: he was afterwards knighted, and in 1618 appointed one of the principal secretaries of state. But after he had enjoyed that post about five years, he willingly resigned it; frankly owning to his majesty that he had become a Roman Catholic, so that he must either be wanting to his trust, or violate his conscience in discharging his office. This ingenuous confession so affected King James, that he continued him privy counsellor all his reign, and the same year created him baron of Baltimore in the kingdom of Ireland. He had before obtained a patent for himself and his heirs, of the province of Avelon in Newfoundland; but that being exposed to the insults of the French, he abandoned it, and afterwards obtained the grant of a country in the northern part of Virginia from Charles I. who called it Maryland, in honour of his queen. He died, however, in April 1632, aged fifty, before the patent was made out. But it was filled up to his son Cecil Calvert Lord Baltimore, and bears date the 20th of June 1632. It is held from the crown [7:6:28]as part of the manor of Windsor, on one very singular condition, namely, to present two Indian arrows yearly, on Easter Tuesday, at the castle, where they are kept and shown to visitors. His lordship wrote, 1. A Latin poem on the Death of Sir Henry Upton; 2. Speeches in Parliament; 3. Various Letters of State; 4. The Answer of Tom Tell-truth; 5. The Practice of Princes; and, 6. The Lamentation of the Kirk.
