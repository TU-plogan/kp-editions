CARYL, Joseph, a divine of the last century, bred at Oxford, and some time preacher to the society of Lineoln’s-inn, an employment which he filled with much distinction. He became a frequent preacher before the long parliament, a licenser of their books, one of the assembly of divines, and one of the candidates for the approbation of ministers; in all which capacities he showed himself a man of considerable parts and learning, but evinced great zeal against the king’s person and cause. On the restoration of Charles II. he was silenced by the act of uniformity, and lived privately in London, where, besides other works, he distinguished himself by a laborious Exposition of the Book of Job ; and died in 1672.
