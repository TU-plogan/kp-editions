CERBERUS, in fabulous history, a three-headed mastiff, born of Typhon and Echidna, and placed to guard the gates of hell. He fawned upon those who entered, but devoured all who attempted to get back. He was, however, mastered by Hercules, who dragged him up to the earth, when, in struggling, a foam dropped from his mouth which produced the poisonous herb called aconite or wolf’s bane. Some have supposed that Cerberus is the symbol of the earth, or of all-devouring time; and that its three mouths represent the present, past, and future. The victory obtained by Hercules over this monster denotes the conquest which this hero acquired over his passions. Bryant supposes that Cerberus was the name of a place, and that it signified the temple of the sun; deriving it from Kir Abor, the place of light. This temple was called also Tor-Caph-El, which was changed to τpr,τtyaKος ; and hence Cerberus was supposed to have had three heads. It was likewise called Tor-Keren, Turris Regia ; whence τξ ∣ κaξη∙ i ∣ ος, from τξtις, three, and καgrjrap, head.
