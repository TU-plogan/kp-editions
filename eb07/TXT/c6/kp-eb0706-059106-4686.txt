CHITORE, or Chetore, a Rajpoot district of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer, situated to the south-west of Joudpoor, and bordering on Gujerat and Malwah. The country is subject to the ranah of Chitore or Odeypoor, whose family is the most ancient and honourable of all the Rajpoot chiefs, though they at present possess little power. In modern times, the town of Odeypoor has become the capital of the district. The territory of the Odeypoor ranah is bounded on the north by the Ajmeer district and the chiefship of Kishenagur, on the north-west and west by Joudpoor, on the south and south-east by the province of Malwah, on the south-west by Gujerat, and on the north-east by Kotah and Bundee. The present territories of the prince are estimated at about seventy miles in length by a hundred and ten in breadth. The country is in general mountainous; but valleys are interspersed of great fertility, which yield sugar, indigo, tobacco, wheat, rice, and barley. The country contains also iron and sulphur mines. The lands arc all held on feudal principles, every Rajpoot being a soldier, and holding his lands by the tenure of military service. The cultivators of the soil are all Hindus, of the tribes of Brahmin, Jaut, Bheel, and Rajpoot. Owing to the want of good pasturage, the cattle are smaller than in the neighbouring countries. They also breed a number of sheep and camels. The revenues of the district have been much diminished, owing to the frequent incursions of the Mahrattas.

Chitore, or Chetore, the capital of the above-mentioned district, and a celebrated fortress, was formerly the capital of the ranah of Odeypoor. It is situated on the top of a high and rugged mountain, and is considered as a place of great strength. In 1303 it was taken by theMa-hommedans, the ranah’s son-in-law defending it to the last extremity; and having put to death his women and children, he rushed out with his garrison, and fell in the midst of the enemy. The Mahommedans retained possession of it till the year 1345, when it was given over to the rajah of Jalore, from whom it came again into the possession of the former ranah’s family; and in 1567 it was taken by the armies of the emperor Acbar. The place was garrisoned by 8000 disciplined Rajpoots, who made an obstinate defence; and when at last driven to despair, they sacrificed their women and children, and were trampled to death by the war-elephants introduced into the place by the emperor. It was again taken by the Moguls in 1680, during the reign of Aμrungzebe, when sixty-three Hindu temples were destroyed, either in the, fort or town. In the succeeding reign the ranah again got possession, and retained it till the end of last century,, when it was again surprised by a rebellious chieftain. In 1790 it was taken by Mudajee Šcindia, and restored to^its lawful possessor on the payment of an annual stipend of a large sum of money.
