CHANG-TONG, a province of China, bounded on the east by the province of Pe-tche-li and part of Honan, on the south by that of Kiang-nan, on the east by the Eastern Sea, and on the north partly by the Gulf of Pe-tche-li. The aspect of the country is mountainous. A great ridge, 170 miles in length, traverses the northern portion of it, while in the south the country is filled with mountains and swamps, and large tracts of peatmoss. From the city of Tsy-ho-hien, for sixty leagues, the country is a continued plain. The soil is in some parts light, in other parts it is dry and of a better quality. This province is tolerably well watered, containing several rivers and lakes. It is also intersected by the grand canal, which greatly contributes to the extension of its trade. In the north the inhabitants are mostly agricultural, in other parts they derive a precarious subsistence from fishing. The whole province is liable to suffer from drought. Its principal products are coarse silk, wheat, mullet, and indigo. The province is divided into six districts, which contain six cities of the first class, and a hundred and fourteen of the second and third. The capital is Tsi-nan, situated on the river Tsi, or Tsing; and among the others of larger size are Yen-tcheou, Tong-chang-tsin, and Kin-kieng. The population has been estimated on rather vague data at twenty-four millions.
