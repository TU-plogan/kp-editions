CHARISIUS, in the Heathen Theology, a surname given to Jupiter. The word is derived from γapς, gratia, grace or favour; Charisius being the god by whose influence men obtain the favour and affection of one another. On this account the Greeks used at their meals to make a libation of a cup to Jupiter Charisius.
