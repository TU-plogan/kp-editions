CHILO, one of the seven sages of Greece, and of the ephori of Sparta, the place of his birth, flourished about 556 years before Christ. He was accustomed to say that there were three things very difficultâ€”to keep a seeret, to know how best to employ time, and to suffer injuries without murmuring. According to Pliny, it was he who caused the short sentence, Know thyself, to be inscribed in letters of gold on the temple of Delphos. It is said that he died of joy while embracing his son, who had been crowned as victor at the Olympic games.
