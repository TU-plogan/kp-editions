CAUSTICS is an appellation given to substances of so hot and fiery a nature, that, being applied, they consume, and as it were burn, the texture of the parts, like hot iron. Caustics arc generally divided into four sorts; the common stronger caustic, the common milder caustic, the antimonial caustic, and the lunar caustic or nitrate of silver.

Caustic Curve, in the higher geometry, a curve formed by the concourse or coincidence of the rays of light reflected from some other curve.
