CAMPANELLA, Thomas, a famous Italian philosopher, born at Stilo in Calabria in 1568. He distinguished himself by his early proficiency in learning; for at the age of thirteen he was a perfect master of the ancient orators and poets. His peculiar inclination was to philosophy, to which he at last devoted his whole time and study. In order to arrive at truth, he shook off the yoke of authority, by which means the novelty of some of his opinions exposed him to many inconveniences; for at Naples he was thrown into prison, in which he remained twenty-seven years, and during this confinement wrote his famous work entitled Atheismus triumpliatus. Being at length set at liberty, he went to Paris, where he was graciously received by Louis XIII. and Cardinal Richelieu; the latter procured him a pension of 2000 livres, and often consulted him on the affairs of Italy. Campanella passed the remainder of his days in a monastery of Dominicans at Paris, and died in 1639.
