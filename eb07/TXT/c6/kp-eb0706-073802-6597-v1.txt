CLEOPATRA, the celebrated queen of Egypt, was daughter of Ptolemy Auletes. By her extraordinary beauty she subdued the two renowned Roman generals Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, the latter of whom, it is thought, lost the empire of Rome by his attachment to her. At length Mark Antony being subdued by Octavius Caesar, shc tried the force of her declining charms upon the conqueror, but in vain; upon which,‘expecting no mercy from him, she poisoned hersclf, thirty years before Christ. According to some authors, she was the restorer of the Alexandrian library, to which she added that of Pergamos; and it is said that she studied philosophy, to console her for the absence of Antony. With her ended the family of the Ptolemies in Egypt, where it had reigned 294 years, from the death of Alexander; for Egypt, after this, was reduced into a Roman province, in which state it remained till it was taken by the Saracens, a. d. 641.
