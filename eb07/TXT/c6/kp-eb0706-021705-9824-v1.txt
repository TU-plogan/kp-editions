CASSEL, a city, the capital of the dominions of the Prince of Hesse-Cassel, and of the province of Lower Hesse. It is one of the most beautiful cities of Germany. It rises gently from the banks of the river Fulda, which is navigable for boats to the Weser. The river Drosset, which passes the upper part of the city, has its water so directed that it may be made use of to keep the whole place in a cleanly state. The square and streets are broad, well paved, and the edifices elegantly constructed. Under Bonaparte it was the capital of his short-lived kingdom of Westphalia, and was hastening to decay; but since the restoration its improvements have been great. The royal palace, with its picture gallery and museums, is magnificent and elegant, as are also the other public buildings. The walks, on what were once the ramparts, [7:6:218] form an agreeable promenade. Cassel is the capital of a kingdom in miniature. It contains 1431 dwelling-houses, and 19,500 inhabitants. There are some manufactures carried on in the city, but on a small scale, and almost exclusively confined to the demands of the principality, of which it is the head. The theatre, the buildings for balls and masquerades, and other places of amusement, are quite upon a par with the extent and poverty of the country. The institutions for benevolent purposes are respectable. About two miles from the city the ducal palace of Wilhelmshoe is a great object of attraction, and especially on the days when the well-contrived waterworks of a cascade and fountain are played off. Cassel is in longitude 9. 22. E. and latitude 51. 29. 20. N.
