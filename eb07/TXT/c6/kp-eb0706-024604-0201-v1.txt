CATHOLIC, in a general sense, denotes any thing that is universal or general.

Catholic Church. The rise of heresies induced the primitive Christian church to assume to itself the appellation of catholic, to distinguish itself from all sects, who, though they had party names, sometimes sheltered themselves under the name of Christians.

The Romish chureh distinguishes itself now by the name of Catholic, in opposition to all those who have separated from her communion, and whom she considers as heretics and schismatics, regarding herself as the only true and Christian church. In the striet sense of the word, there is no Catholic church in being, that is, no universal Christian communion. See Roman Catholic. Catholic King is a title which has long been hereditary to the king of Spain. Mariana pretends that Reccarede first received this title after he had destroyed Arianism in his kingdom, and that it is found in the council of Toledo for the year 589. Vasce ascribes the origin of it to Alphonsus in 738. Some allege that it has been used only since the time of Ferdinand and Isabella; and Co-lombierc says it was given them on occasion of the expulsion of the Moors. The Bollandĩsts pretend it had been [7:6:247] borne by their predecessors the Visigoth kings of Spain, and that Alexander VI. only renewed it to Ferdinand and Isabella. Others say that Philip de Valois was the first who was honoured with the title, which, it seems, was given him after his death by the ecclesiastics, on account of his favouring their interests. In some epistles of the ancient popes, the title catholic is given to the kings of France and of Jerusalem, as well as to several patriarchs and primates.
