CARLINE, or Caroline Thistle. This plant is said to have been discovered by an angel to Charlemagne, to cure his army of the plague; whence its denomination.

Carline, or Caroline, a silver coin current in the Neapolitan dominions, and worth about 4d. of our money.

Carlines, or Carlings, in a ship, two pieces of timber lying fore and aft, along from one beam to another, directly over the keel, and serving as a foundation for the whole body of the ship. On these rest the ledges, on which the planks of the deck and other matters of carpentry are made fast. The carlines have their ends let into the beams called culver-tailways. Carline Trees are timbers going athwart the ship, from the sides to the hatchway, and serving to sustain the deck on both sides.
