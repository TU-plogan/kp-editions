CELSUS, Aurelius Cornelius, a celebrated physician of the first century, who wrote in elegant Latin eight books on medicine. He was the Hippocrates of the Latins; and Quintilian pronounces a high eulogium upon him. The great Boerhaave tells us that Celsus is one of the best authors of antiquity for letting us into the true meaning and opinions of Hippocrates; and that, without him, the writings of this father of physic would often be unintelligible, and often misunderstood by us. Fie shows us also how the ancients eured distempers by frietion, bathing, and the like. FIis eight books de Medicina have been several times printed. The Elzevir edition, in the year 1650, by Vander Linden, is the best, as being entirely corrected from manuscripts.

Celsus, an Epicurean philosopher of the second century. He wrote a work against the Christians, entitled The True Discourse ; to which Origen, at the desire of his friend Ambrose, wrote a learned answer. Lucian dedicated his Pseudomenos to this philosopher.
