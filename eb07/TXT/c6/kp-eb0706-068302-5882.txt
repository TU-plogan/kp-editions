CHRUDIM, one of the circles into which the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia is divided. It extends over 1196 square miles, and contained, in 1817, 248,750 inhabitants, mostly of the Sclavonian race, as there are only a few German families on the frontier towards Moravia. The chief part of the circle is on the western side of the Elbe. It is well watered by various streams, which, when united, form the river Chrudimka. The eastern part, which touches the mountains of Gratz, is hilly and woody. The whole is fruitful in corn, flax, and grass; and there are manufactories of woollen, linen, glass, earthenware, and paper. The circle contains 13 cities, 25 market-towns, and 761 villages; and the number of dwelling-houses in 1817 was 42,850.

Chrudim, the chief place of the circle of the same name, in Bohemia. It is on the river Chrudimka, is well built, surrounded with walls, and contains a cathedral, a Capuchin monastery, a high school, and 4514 inhabitants.
