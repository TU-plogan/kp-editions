CAREER, in the manege, a place inclosed with a barrier, wherein they run the ring. The word is also used for the race or course of the horse itself, provided it do not exceed 200 paces. In the ancient circus, the career was the space which the bigae or quadrigae were to run at full speed in order to gain the prize.

Career, in falconry, is a flight or tour of the bird, about 120 yards. If she mount more, it is called a double career ; if less, a semi-career.
