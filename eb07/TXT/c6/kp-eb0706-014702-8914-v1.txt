CARMENTALIA, a feast among the ancient Romans, celebrated annually upon the 11 th of January, in honour of Carmenta or Carmentis, a prophetess of Arcadia, mother of Evander, with whom she came into Italy sixty years before the Trojan war. The solemnity was also repeated on the 15th of January, which is marked in the old calendar of Carmentalia relata. This feast was established on occasion of a great fecundity among the Roman dames, after a general reconciliation with their husbands, with whom they had been at variance, on account of the use of coaches being prohibited them by an edict of the senate. This feast was celebrated by the women; he who offered the sacrifices was called sacerdos Carmentalis.
