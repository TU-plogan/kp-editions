He published, Recherches sur les Courbes à double courbure, Paris, 1731, in 4to; Elemensde Geometrie, 1741, in 8vo; Théorie de la Figure de la Terre, 1743, in 8vo; Elémens d’Algèbre, 1746, in 8vo; Théorie de la Lune, déduite du seul principe de l' attraction, 1754, in 8vo; Theorie du Mouvement des Comètes, Paris, 1760. He was concerned also in the Journal des Sçavans, which he furnished with many excellent articles. He died in 1765, at the comparatively early age of fifty-two. He was one of the academicians who were sent into Lapland to measure a degree of the meridian, with a view to the determination of the figure of the earth.
