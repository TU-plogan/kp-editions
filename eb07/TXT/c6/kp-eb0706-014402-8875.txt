CARLSBAD, a town in the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia, the capital of the circle of Caslau. It is celebrated throughout the Continent for its mineral springs, which are frequented in the summer season by numerous visitors of the highest rank. It is situated between two lofty mountains, through which the river Tepl runs; and the surrounding country is highly picturesque, whilst the various accommodations for the company that resort to the town make it an agreeable residence for the patients. The springs differ but little from each other in their component parts; all have both an aperient and tonic quality. Some of them are warm. The Brudel is of 50 degrees of Fahrenheit, the MÃ¼hlenbad of 38. The Neubrunnen and the Sclopbrunnen are also warm; but the one most prized is the Sauerbrunnen, which is cold, and has more saline particles. These baths are said to have been discovered by the Emperor Charles IV. when on a hunting excursion, and to have derived their name from him. The town contains a church, theatre, ball-room, and about 2500 resident inhabitants, who are employed in manufacturing various articles of fine steel, of gold and silver, of porcelain, of fire-arms, and various trinkets. It is thirty-eight miles from Prague, and the roads to it from thence and from Saxony are very good.
