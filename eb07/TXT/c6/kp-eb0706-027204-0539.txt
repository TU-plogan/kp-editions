CELLAR (Cellarium), in ancient writers, denotes the same with cella, namely, a conservatory of provisions or liquors. Cellar differs from vault, as the latter is supposed to be deeper, while the former is frequently but little below the surface of the ground. Cellarium also differed from pemis, inasmuch as the former was only a storehouse for a short time, while the latter was one for a long time. Hence the Bactroperatae, a sort of ancient Cynics, are said by St Jerome to carry their cellar about with them.

Cellarium also denoted an allowance of bread, wine, oil, or other provision, furnished out of the cella, for the use of the governor of the province and his officers and dependents. In this sense the word amounts to nearly the same with annona.

Cellars, in modern building, are the lowest apartments in a house, the ceilings of which are usually on a level with the surface of the ground upon which the house is built; or they arc situated under the pavement before the house, especially in streets and squares.

Cellars, and other places vaulted under ground, were called by the Greeks hypogaea ; and the Italians still denominate them fundi delli case.
