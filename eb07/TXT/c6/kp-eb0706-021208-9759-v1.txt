CASHEL, a city of Ireland, in the county of Tipperary, and province of Munster. It is situated about four miles from the banks of the Suir, in an open and fertile country. Here is the palace of the archdiocese, to which a public library is attached, in which are some valuable manuscripts. The new cathedral is a spacious modern church, but not possessed of any architectural merit. The ancient cathedral stands upon the rock of Cashel; it is the largest, grandest, and most remarkable ecclesiastical edifice in Ireland. Besides this, there are several other magnificent ecclesiastical antiquities, the most singular of which is Cormack's chapel, probably the oldest stone building in Ireland. The other public buildings of Cashel are the Roman Catholic chapel, the market-house, county court-house, infirmary, barrack, and charter sehool, Henry II. received the homage of Donald king of Limerick in this city in the year 1172, and held a synod here; and King John confirmed some grants of land to the church founded by Donald O’Brien. The archiépiscopal see was erected in 1152, but the bishopric existed in the tenth century. Emly, an ancient archbishopric, extends over all Tipperary, and into the counties of Kilkenny and Limerick. The want of inland navigation has completely prevented the growth of trade here. The population amounts to about 6000. It is distant 100 miles S.W. of Dublin. Long. 7. 50. W. Lat. 52. 31. N.
