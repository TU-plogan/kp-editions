CHAIR (Cathedra) was anciently used for the pulpit, or suggestum, from which the priest spoke to the people. It is still applied to the place where professors and regents in universities deliver their lectures, and teach the sciences to their pupils; thus, we say, the professor’s chair, and the like.

Curule Chair was an ivory seat placed on a car, and in which were seated the prime magistrates of Rome, as well as those to whom the honour of a triumph had been granted.

Sedan Chair, a vehicle supported by poles, and in which persons are carried. It is borne by two men.
