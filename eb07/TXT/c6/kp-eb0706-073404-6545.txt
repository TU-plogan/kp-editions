CLAUSTHAL, a city in the province Grubenhagen, in the kingdom of Hanover. It is situated in the centre of the Hartz forest, 1710 feet above the level of the sea; is well built, but chiefly â€™ of wood; and contains 7192 inhabitants, who subsist by labour in the mines of lead and silver in the vicinity of the place, and by spinning, lace-making, and forming various common articles of metal. The country around it is highly picturesque, and the roads recently made are good.
