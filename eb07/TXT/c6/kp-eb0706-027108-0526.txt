CELIBACY, the state of unmarried persons. Scaliger derives the word from the Greek κοίτη, hed f and λe ∣ πω, linquo, I leave; others say it is formed from coeli beatitudo, that is, the blessedness of heaven.

The ancient Romans used all means imaginable to discourage celibacy. Nothing was more usual than for the censors to impose a fine on bachelors. Dionysius Halicarnasseus mentions an ancient constitution by which all persons of mature age were obliged to marry. But the first law of that kind of which we have any certainty is that under Augustus, called lex Julia de maritandis ordinibus. It was afterwards denominated Papia Poppaea, and more usually Julia Papia, in regard of some new sanctions and amendments made to it under the consuls Papius and Poppaeus. By this law various prerogatives were given to persons who had many children; while penalties were imposed on those who lived a single life, such as being declared incapable of receiving legacies exceeding a certain amount or proportion.
