CARNIVAL, or Carnaval, a time of rejoieing and season of mirth, observed with great solenmity by the Italians, particularly at Venice, and held from the twelfth day till Lent.

The word is formed from the Italian Cαrnavalle, which M. Du Cange derives from Carn-a-val, by reason of the flesh being then put in the pot, to make amends for the season of abstinence ensuing. Accordingly, in the corrupt Latin, he observes, it was called Carnelevαmen and Car-nispriνiurn ; as the Spaniards still denominate it carnes tollendas.

Feasts, balls, operas, concerts of musie, intrigues, marriages, and the like, are chiefly held in carnival time. The carnival begins at Veniee the seeond holiday in Christmas. Then it is they begin to wear masks, and open their playhouses and gaming houses; while the plaee of St Mark is filled with mountebanks, jack-puddings, pedlars, prostitutes, and sueh like mobs, who floek thither from all parts. There have been no less than seven sovereign prinees and 30,000 foreigners present to partake of these diversions.
