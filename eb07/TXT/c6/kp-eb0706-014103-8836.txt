CARIA, in Ancient Geography, a country of Asia Minor, whose limits are extended by some, while they are contracted by others. Mela and Pliny extend the maritime Caria from Jasus and Halicarnassus to Calynda and the borders of Lycia. The inland Caria Ptolemy extends to the Meander and beyond. Car, Cariâtes, Cariatis, Carissa and Caris, and Caira, are the gentilitious names; Carius and Cŉncws the epithets. In Care periculum was a proverbial saying respecting a thing exposed to danger, but of no great value. The Cares being the Swiss of those days, were hired and placed in the front of the battle. Cum Care Carissa denoted the behaviour of clowns. The Cares came originally from the islands to the continent, being formerly subject to Minos, and called Leleges. This the Cretans affirmed, and the Cares denied, making themselves aborigines. They were of a common origin with the Mysi and Lydi, having a common temple, of a very ancient standing, at Melassa, a town of Caria, called Jovis Carii Delubrum. Homer calls the Carians barbarians in language.
