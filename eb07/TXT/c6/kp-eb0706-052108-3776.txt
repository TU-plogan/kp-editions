CHICHACOTTA, a town of Northern Hindustan, in the province of Bootan, not far from Cooch Bahar, in Bengal. It was taken in 1772 from the Booteas, who defended it with great obstinacy; but with all their personal courage they could not long contend with matchlocks, sabres, and bows, against musketry and cannon. It was restored at the conclusion of the war, and now constitutes the frontier between Bootan and Bengal.
