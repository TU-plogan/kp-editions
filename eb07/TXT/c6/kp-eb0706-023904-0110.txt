CATANIA, a city in the island of Sicily, the chief of the intendancy and district of the same name. It is one of the oldest cities of Europe, though, from its situation under Mount Aetna, exposed to the tremendous operations of nature, by which it has been several times visited. It is now a large and well-built city. The streets are broad, straight, and well paved with lava. The market-place or square is spacious, and surrounded with magnificent buildings. There is a well-conducted university, two colleges, a museum, a cabinet of natural history, and several appropriate institutions for instruction. The environs, except [7:6:240]where buried by the lava of 1669, are fertile and well cultivated. It contains a population of 45,000, but, including â€™ the suburbs, of 74,000 persons. These find employment in various manufactures, particularly in those of linen and of silk. There is also an export trade in corn, wine, soda, nuts, hemp, flax, liquorice, and fruits. There is no harbour, and merely a roadstead, but boats discharge their cargoes at a mole. It is 120 miles from Palermo. Long. 15. 5. 15. E. Lat. 37. 28. 20. N.
