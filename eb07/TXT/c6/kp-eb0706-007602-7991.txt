CANDIA, a city, the capital of the island and province of the same name, in the Mediterranean. It is the residence of a pasha, and of the Greek archbishop, who is called Archbishop of Gortyna, and primate of Kirid or Candia. It stands on a point of land in a bay, before which the island of Sandia is a protection to the harbour, which, though formerly good, is now nearly choked with mud. It is fortified with high walls, deep ditches, and several outworks, which are kept in good order. The streets are regular and level, and the houses well built. There are fourteen mosques, a Greek cathedral and church, an Arminian church, and a Catholic monastery, with its chapel. The inhabitants consist of about 12,000 Turks, 3000 Greeks, and 1000 other persons. The principal fabric is soap, the preparation of which consumes the greater part of the oil which the island yields. There are, besides, some silk and cotton goods made; much rosin is prepared here; and there are several distilleries for brandy.

Candia, an island in the Mediterranean, south from the Grecian Archipelago, the ancient Crete. It is situât-ed[7:6:77] between the longitude 22. 45. and 26. 50. E. and the latitude 34. 50. and 35. 55. N., and extends over 3130 square miles, or 2,003,200 English acres. According to Olivier, the inhabitants were 240,000 individuals, half Greeks and half Turks; but Savary estimates the Turks at 200,000, and the Greeks at 150,000. It is probable that the first‘calculation is nearest the truth, although in ancient times the population must have been much more dense.

The island is for the most part mountainous. A lofty ridge runs from east to west, in the centre of which are the highest peaks, some upwards of 7000 feet in height, in certain parts of which snow is always to be found, as is generally the case at Mount Ida, now called Psiloriti. Between the mountains are some most delightful valleys, of great natural fertility, but ill cultivated, and producing less than is sufficient for the wants of its scanty population. Candia commonly draws a part of its corn from Salonica, the Morea, or Egypt. For raising wheat the land is merely once scratched with the plough; and barley is sown on the wheat stubble without ploughing. The land produces abundance of esculent vegetables and choice fruits; but the chief production is oil, by the exportation of which, and of the soap made with it, the inhabitants are enabled to procure commodities of various kinds from other countries. There are none but domestic manufactures. The island is governed by a pasha of three tails, and is divided into three districts, viz. Candia, Retimo, and Canea, each of which is ruled by a pasha of two tails.

Candia, a town of Italy, in the province of Ivrea, and kingdom of Sardinia, with 2650 inhabitants.
