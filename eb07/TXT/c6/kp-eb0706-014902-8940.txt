CARNEIA, in Antiquity, a festival in honour of Apollo, surnamed Carneus, and held in most cities of Greece, but especially at Sparta, where it was instituted. The reason of the name, as well as the occasion of the institution, is controverted. It lasted nine days, beginning on the 13th of the month Carneus. The ceremonies were an imitation of the method of living and discipline used in camps.
