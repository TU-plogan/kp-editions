CARAMANIA, an extensive province of Asia Minor. On the north and west it has Natolia for its boundary, on the south the Mediterranean, and its eastern boundary is not exactly ascertained. The coast is everywhere indented by bays and inlets, and in many parts is of a steep and rocky aspect, with promontories which rise to the height of 500 or 600 feet above the level of the sea, and penetrate to a great depth below the surface. In other parts the shore is barren and sandy. The country is well watered, though its rivers are in general narrow, shallow, and unfit for navigation. It contains also many lakes stored with fish. But this and other advantages are not improved by the indolent inhabitants. The aspect of the country is mountainous. It is intersected by long ranges of hills, from which diverge subordinate branches in every direction, with broad and fertile valleys intervening, and insulated rocks and mountains in the spacious plains. Some of the more lofty hills rise to the line of perpetual snow; and the lower ranges are covered with forests to [7:6:134] their very summit, in which are seen the oak, the pine a hundred feet in height, besides every other variety of forest trees. The soil in the valleys is remarkably fertile, and yields the finest wheat and other grain, besides all descriptions of fruit. Oranges, citrons, pomegranates, figs, grapes, &c. are produced in abundance; the vine and the fig tree exhibit the most luxuriant vegetation, and the laurel and myrtle, with innumerable odoriferous shrubs and plants, flourish in profusion. The poppy plant is extensively cultivated. This country, which was once so populous, and covered with flourishing cities, now lies desolate in many parts. The inhabitants, namely the Turcoman shepherds, are little better than a lawless banditti; and pirates frequently shelter themselves behind the promontories of the coast, in order to plunder the defenceless mariner. Among the principal cities known to Europeans, are enumerated Konieh, the residence of the pasha; Aphiom; and Adalia, which contains 8000 inhabitants. The Turks exercise a pernicious authority over the country, which is governed, or rather oppressed and plundered, by the pashas, who rule over it as the delegates of the grand signior. The ruins of cities once flourishing, containing the finest monuments of antiquity, are seen scattered over the plains, and attest, the former prosperity of this now comparatively desolate country.
