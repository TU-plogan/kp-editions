CARACCAS was formerly a division of the Spanish dominions in South America, bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea, from the Cape de la Vela on the west, to the point of Paria; on the east by the sea, from the twelfth to the eighth degree of north latitude; on the south by Dutch Guiana and Peru; and on the west by the kingdom of Santa Fé, another obsolete division of the Spanish territory. The captain generalship of the Caraccas is now incorporated into the modern republic of Colombia, to which the reader is referred.

Caraccas, a large city of South America, and the former capital of the above province, situated on that chain of mountains which runs along the coast of the Caribbean Sea, from Coro to Cumana, above the land of which it is situated at the height of three thousand feet. It stands on a declivity near four streams, namely, the Guayra, the Anauco, the Caroata, and the Catucho, which, after passing the town, join into one, and at length mingling their waters with those of the Tuy, flow into the ocean thirty-six miles east of Cape Codera. The streets are in general about a hundred yards apart; and as they intersect each other at right angles, the whole town is divided into square portions called quadras. There are several squares in this city, of which the Plaza Mayor, or open square, is the most worthy of notice. The east side is principally occupied by the cathedral, the south by the college, and the west by the public prison. This square is a great market for fruit and other articles, and contains a sort of inner square, in which are ranges of shops. The town is well supplied with water from the Catueho, which is dispensed to the inhabitants in public fountains, as well as in pipes and reservoirs. The chief public buildings are the cathedral, which is two hundred and fifty fcct in length by seventy-five in breadth, and is supported by twenty-four pillars, without beauty or proportion. The church of Alta Gracia, built by the people of colour, excels the cathedral in the richness of its ornaments, and is by far the most splendid church in Caraccas. There are three other parish churches, three monasteries for friars, two nunneries, and three hospitals, of which one is for lepers alone. The college is the only public institution for education; and the mode of education was a mere monkish routine before the late revolution; but more liberal sentiments now begin to prevail. The city contains, according to Dcpons, 40,000 inhabitants, composed of whites, freed persons, slaves, and a few Indians. Caraccas, owing to its elevation, enjoys a temperate climate; the thermometer in summer varying, about two o’clock of the day, from 73 to 79. Long. 67. W. Lat. 10. 31. N.
