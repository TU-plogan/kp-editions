CITIZEN, a native or inhabitant of a city, who is vested with the freedom and liberties thereof.

A citizen of Rome was distinguished from a stranger who belonged to no certain commonwealth subject to the Romans. A citizen is such either by birth or by election, and sons may derive the right from their fathers. To constitute a good Roman citizen, it was necessary to be an inhabitant of Rome, to be enrolled in one of the tribes, and to be capable of dignities. Those to whom were granted the privileges of Roman citizenship were only honorary citizens. It was not lawful to scourge a citizen of Rome.
