CHARKOW, a circle in the Russian government of the Ukraine, bounded on the north by Kursk, on the east by Woltschansk, on the south-east by Kupinsk, on the south by Smijew, and on the west by Bogoduchow. It extends over 1980 square miles, and contains a population of 165,000 souls. The circle is watered by the Donez, which within it receives the waters of the Kharkowka, Lepanka, and Uda. It is highly productive of corn and fruit, but more especially of tobacco and hemp. The chief place, a city of the same name, is 1460 wersts, or 980 miles, from St Petersburg, on the river Donez: it was formerly surrounded with walls, which are now converted into gardens and promenades; and it contains a cathedral and seven other churches, two monasteries, a university, an ecclesiastical seminary, and several institutions for primary education. In 1815 the houses were 1552, and the inhabitants 15,000, exclusive of the military and the members of the university. It is a place of considerable trade, which consists chiefly in the productions of the vicinity. The chief articles prepared in the city are brandy, from corn; soap, leather, candles, and latterly some silk. It is in long. 36. 10. E. lat. 49. 59. 20. N.
