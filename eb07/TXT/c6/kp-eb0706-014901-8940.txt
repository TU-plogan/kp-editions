CARNEDDE, in British antiquity, denotes heaps of stones, supposed to be druidical remains, and thrown together on occasion of confirming and commemorating a covenant, Gen. xxxi. 46. They are very common in the Isle of Anglesey, and were also used as sepulchral monuments, in the manner of tumuli; for Mr Rowland found a curious urn in one of these carnedde, whence it may be inferred, that the Britons had the custom of throwing stones on the deceased. From this custom is derived the Welsh proverb Karn ardyben, Iâ€™ll betide thee.
