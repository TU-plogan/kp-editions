CAPRANU, a village of European Turkey, in the province of Livadia, on the river Cephissus, nearly corresponding to the ancient Chaeronea, a city of Boeotia. The ruins of that town are still in existence, and consist of the remains of a temple, a beautiful antique fountain, the theatre, some relics of the acropolis, and a number of broken marbles with inscriptions. The modern village is a mean place, of about half a dozen scattered cottages, with almost as many churches.
