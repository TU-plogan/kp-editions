CASTOR, in Astronomy, a moiety of the constellation Gemini, called also Apollo. Its latitude northwards, for the year 1700, according to Hevelius, was 10. 4. 23, and its longitude of Cancer 17. 4. 14. It is also called Razal-genze, Apollo, Aphellan, Avellar, and Anelar.

Castor and Pollux, in Pagan mythology, twin brothers, celebrated for the fable of their birth, their fortunes, and their friendships. Jupiter having had an amour with Leda, the wife of Tyndarus, king of Sparta, in the form of a swan, she brought forth two eggs, each containing twins. From the one impregnated by Jupiter proceeded Pollux and Helena, who were both immortal; from the other Castor and Clytemnestra, who being begotten by Tyndarus, were both mortal. They were all, however, called by the common name of Tyndaridce. The two brothers entered into an inviolable friendship; and they went with the other noble youths of Greece in the expedition to Colchis, and on several occasions signalized themselves by their courage; but Castor being at length killed, Pollux obtained leave to share his own immortality with him, so that they were said to live and die alternately; for, being translated into the skies, they form the constellation of Gemini, one of the stars of which rises as the other sets.

A martial dance, called the Pyrrhic or Castorian dance, was invented in honour of these deities, whom the Ccpha-lenses placed among the Dii Magni, and offered to them white lambs. The Romans also paid them particular honours on account of the assistance they are said to have rendered during an engagement with the Latins, in which, appearing mounted on white steeds, they turned the scale of victory in favour of the Romans, for which service a temple was erected to them in the forum.

Castor and Pollux, a fiery meteor, which at sea appears sometimes sticking to a part of the ship, in form of [7:6:236] one, two, or even three or four fire-balls. When one is seen alone, it is properly called Helena ; but two are denominated Castor and Pollux, and sometimes Tyndaridae. Castor and Pollux are called by the Spaniards, San Elmo; by the French, St Eime, St Nicholas, St Clare, St Helene; by the Italians, Hermo; by the Dutch, Tree Vuuren.

Castor and Pollux are commonly believed to portend a cessation of the storm, and a succeeding calm, being rarely seen till the tempest is nearly spent. Helena alone portends ill, and indicates that the severest part of the storm is yet to come. When the meteor sticks to the masts and yards, it is concluded, from the air not having motion sufficient to dissipate this flame, that a profound calm is at hand; if it flutter about, it indicates a storm.
