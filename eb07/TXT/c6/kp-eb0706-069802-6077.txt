CINALOA, or Sinaloa, a province of Mexico, in the intendancy of Sonora, situated between New Biscay and the Gulf of California. On the south it is bounded by Guadalaxara and the ocean. It is about 300 miles in length and 150 in breadth. The country is bare, destitute of timber, and hilly. The air is dry, pure, and salubrious, except along the coast, where the ground is marshy, the soil rich, and the atmosphere humid. The principal vegetable products are maize, legumes, fruits, and cotton. Cinaloa contains five towns, ninety-two villages, thirty parishes, fourteen farms, and four hundred and fifty cottages. The population amounts to about 60,000, of whom not above three twentieths are Spaniards.
