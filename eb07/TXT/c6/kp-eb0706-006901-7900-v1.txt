CANAL, an artificial cut in the ground, supplied with water from rivers, springs, and the like, in order to form a navigable communication betwixt one place and another. (See Navigation, Inland.) Canal, in Anatomy, a duct or passage through which any of the juices flow.

Canal de Principe, a channel on the north-west coast of North America, formed by Bank’s Island on the southwest, and Pitt’s Archipelago on the north-east. It was first explored by Signior Camaano, a Spaniard, who represented it as fair and navigable. It is about fourteen leagues long. The southern shore is compact and nearly straight, and has no soundings. The northern shore is much broken, bounded by many rocks and islets, and affords soundings in several places. Both sides of this canal are entirely covered with pine trees; and the shores abound with seaotters.
