CARD, among artificers, an instrument consisting of a block of wood set with sharp teeth, serving to arrange the hairs of wool, flax, hemp, and the like. There are different kinds of them, as hand-cards, stock-eards, &e. They are made as follows:

A pieee of thiek leather, of the size intended for the card, is strained in a frame for that purpose, and then pricked full of holes, into which the teeth or pieces of iron wire are inserted; after whieh the leather is nailed by the edges to a flat piece of wood, in the form of an oblong square, about a foot in length and half a foot in breadth, with a handle plaeed in the middle of one of the longer sides.

The teeth are made in the following manner. The wire being drawn of the size intended, a skain or number of wires are eut into proper lengths by means of a gauge, and then doubled in a tool contrived for the purpose; after which they are bent into the proper direction by means of another tool, and then plaeed in the leather, as above mentioned. See Woollen Manufacture. Cards, in Gaming, little pieees of fine thin pasteboard, of an oblong figure, of several sizes, but most eommonly, in Britain, three inches and a half long and two and a half broad, on whieh are painted several points and figures.

The moulds and bloeks for making cards are exactly like those that were used for the first printed books. , A sheet of wet or moist paper is laid on the block, whieh is very slightly done over with a sort of ink made of lampblack diluted in water, and mixed with some stareh to give it a body. This is afterwards rubbed off with a round list. The eourt-eards are coloured by means of several patterns, styled stane-files. These consist of papers eut through with a penknife; řìnd in the apertures the various colours, as red, black, &e. are severally applied. These patterns are painted with oil-colours, that the brushes may not wear them out; and when the pattern is laid on the pasteboard, a brush full of colour is slightly passed over it, and, leaving the eolour within the openings, forms the faee or figure of the eard.

Among sharpers, divers sorts of false and fraudulent earđs have been eontrived; as, 1. Marked eards, where the aces, kings, queens, knaves, are marked on the eorners of the backs with spots of different number and order, either with clear water or water tinged with pale Indian ink, that those in the seeret may distinguish them. Aees are marked with single spots on two eorners opposite diagonally; kings with two spots at the same eorners; knaves with the same number transversed. 2. Breef eards, those which are longer or broader than the rest, ehiefly used at whist and piquet. The broad eards are usually for kings, queens, knaves, and aces; the long for .the rest. Their design is to direct the cuttings, to enable him in the secret to cut the cards disadvantageously to his adversary, and draw the person unacquainted with the fraud to eut them favourably for the sharper. As the pack is placed either endwise or sidewise to him that is to cut, the long or broad cards naturally lead him to cut them. Breef eards are sometimes made thus by the manufacturer; but, in defeet of these, sharpers pare all but the breefs with a penknife or razor. 3. Corner bend denotes four eards turned down finely at one corner, to serve as a signal to cut by. 4. Middle bend, or Kingston-bridge, is where the trieks are bent two different ways, which eauses an opening or arch in the middle, to direet likewise the cutting.

Cards were invented about the year 1390, to divert Charles VI. of France, who had fallen into a melancholy disposition. The inventor proposed, by the figures of the four suits or eolours, as the French call them, to represent the four elasses of men in the kingdom. By the coeurs (hearts) are meant the gens de choeur, choir-men, or eeelesiastics; and therefore the Spaniards, who eertainly received the use of cards from the French, have copas, or chalices, instead of hearts. The nobility, or prime mili.- tary part of the kingdom, are represented by the ends or points of lanees or pikes; and our ignorance of the meaning or the resemblanee of the figure induced us to call them spades. The Spaniards have espadαs, swords, in lieu of pikes, whieh are of similar import. By diamonds are designed the order of eitizens, merchants, or tradesmen, carreaux, square stones, tiles, or the like. The Spaniards have a eoin, dincros, which answers to it; and the Dutch eall the Freneh word carreaux, streηeeη, stones and diamonds, from the form. Trefle, the trefoil-leaf, or elovergrass, eorrnptly called clubs, alludes to the husbandmen and peasants. But how this suit came to be called clubs is not easily explained; unless, borrowing the game from the Spaniards, who have bastos (staves or clubs) instead of the trefoil, we gave the Spanish signification to the French figure.

The history of the four kings, whieh the Freneh, in drollery, sometimes call the cards, are David, Alexander, Caesar, and Charles; which names were then, and still are, on the Freneh eards. Those respeetable names represent the four celebrated monarchies of the Jews, Greeks, Romans, and Franks under Charlemagne. By the queens are intended Argine, Esther, Judith, and Pallas (names retained in the French cards), typical of birth, piety, fortitude, and wisdom, the qualifications residing in each person. Argine is an anagram for regina, queen by descent. By the knaves were designed the servants to knights, for knave originally meant only servant ; but Freneh pages and valets, now indiscriminately used by various orders of persons, were formerly only allowed to persons of quality, esquires (pscmres), shield or armour-bearers. Others faney that the knights themselves were designed by those eards, because Hogier and Labire, two names on the Freneh eards, were famous knights at the time when eards were supposed to have been invented.
