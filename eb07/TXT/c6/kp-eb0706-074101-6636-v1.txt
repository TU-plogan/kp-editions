CLERK (clericus), a word formerly used to signify a learned man, or man of letters. The word eomes from the Greek xXrçgo¢, used for clergy, but more properly signifying lot or heritage, beeause the lot or portion of clerks or eeelesiastics is to serve God. Accordingly clerus was at first used to signify those who were particularly attached to the serviee of God. The origin of the expression is derived from the Old Testament, where the tribe of Levi is ealled the lot or heritage, r.λr l ξος ; and God is reeiproeally ealled their portion, by reason of that tribe having been eon-seerated to the serviee of God, and lived on the offerings made to God, without any other settled provision. Thus Pasquier observes, that the officers of the counts, or comites, were anciently created under the title of clerks of accompts, and secretaries of state were ealled clerks of the secret. So clericus domini regis, in the time of Edward I., was rendered, the kings secretary, or clerk of his council. The term was applied indifferently to all who made any profession of learning, or who knew how to manage the pen; though originally it was applied only to eeelesiasties. As the nobility and gentry were usually brought up to the exercise of arms, there were none but the clergy left to cultivate the sciences; and henee, as it was the clergy alone who had made any profession of letters, a very learned man came to be ealled a great clerk, and a stupid, ignorant man, a bad clerk. Clerk is also applied to sueh as by their course of life exereise their pens in any eourt or offiee; of whieh there were, and still are, various kinds.
