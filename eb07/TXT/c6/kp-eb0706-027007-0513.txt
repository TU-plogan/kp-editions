CEIMELIOPHYLAX (from zi∕∕xηλ∕ov and poaαrrω, I keep), the keeper or curator of a collection of ceimelia, sometimes also denoted ceimeliarcha. The ceimeliarcha, or ceimeliophylax, was an officer in the ancient churches or monasteries, answering to what was otherwise denominated chartophylax and custos archivorum.
