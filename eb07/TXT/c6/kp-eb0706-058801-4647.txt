CHINA- Root, in the Materia Medica, the root of a species of Smilax, brought both from the East and West Indies, and thence distinguished into oriental and occidental. Both sorts are longish, full of joints, of a palc-reddish colour, with no smell, and very little taste. The oriental, which is the most esteemed, is considerably harder and paler coloured than the other. Such should be chosen as is fresh, close, heavy, and upon being chewed appears full of a fat, unctuous juice. It is generally supposed to promote insensible perspiration and the urinary discharge, and by its unctuous quality to obtund acrimonious juices. China-root was first brought into Europe in the year 1535, and used as a specific against venereal and cutaneous disorders. With this view it was made use of for some time, but it has long since given place to more powerful medicines.

China- Ware. See Porcelain.
