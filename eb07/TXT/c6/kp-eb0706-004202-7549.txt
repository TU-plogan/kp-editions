CAMISADE, in the art of war, an attack by surprise in the night, or at break of day, when the enemy is supposed to be asleep. The word is said to have taken its rise from an attack of this kind, in which, as a badge or signal to know one another by, they bore a shirt, in French called chemise, or chamise, over their arms.
