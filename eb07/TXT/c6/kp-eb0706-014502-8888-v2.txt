CARLSKRONA, a province of Sweden. It is bounded on the north by Cronoberg, on the north-east by Kalmar, on the east and south by the Baltic Sea, and on the west by Christianstadt. Its extent is 1122 square miles, and it contains a population of 67,200 persons, inhabiting three cities, three market-towns, and 1091 hamlets.

Carlskrona, the capital of the Swedish province of the same name. It is the seat of the boards for regulating the marine administration of the kingdom. It is built on five small islands, connected by bridges with the main land. It contains docks, store-houses, work-shops, hospitals, and all the other appendages of a naval arsenal. The haven is secure, and well adapted for the ships of war which are stationed in it. The city contains 1500 houses, and 10,533 inhabitants, chiefly depending on the fleet, but in some measure on the fisheries, and on the export of pitch, tar, timber, and some iron. The city suffers from the want of fresh water. Long. 15. 27. 40. E. Lat. 56. 6. 57. N.
