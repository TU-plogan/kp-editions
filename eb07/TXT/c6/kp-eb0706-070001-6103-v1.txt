CINQUE Ports, five havens situated on the eastern part of England, towards France, and thus called by way of eminence, on account of their superior importance, as having been thought by our kings to merit a particular regard, for their preservation against invasion. Hence they have a particular policy, and are governed by a keeper with the title of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Camden tells us that William the Conqueror first appointed a warden of the Cinque Ports; but King John first granted them their privileges, upon condition that they should provide eighty ships at their own charge for forty days, as often as the king should have occasion in the wars, he being then straitened for a navy to recover Normandy. The five ports are Hastings, Romney, Hythe, Dover, and Sandwich. Thorn tells us that Hastings provided twenty-one vessels; with twenty-one men in each vessel. To this port belong Seaford, Pevensey, Hedney, Winchelsea, Rye, Ha-mine, Wakesbourn, Creneth, and Forthclipe. Romney provided five ships, with twenty-four men in each. To this port belong Bromhal, Lyde, Oswarstone, Dangemares, and Romenhal. Hythe furnished seven ships, with twenty-one seamen in each. To this port belongs Westmeath. Dover furnished the same number as Hastings. To this port belong Folkstone, Feversham, and Marge. Lastly, Sandwich furnished the same with Hythe. To this port belong Fordiwic, Reculver, Serre, and Deal.

The privileges granted in consequence of these services were very great. Amongst others, they were each of them to send two barons to represent them in parliament; their deputies were to bear the canopy over the king’s head at the time of his coronation, and to dine at the uppermost table in the great hall, on his right hand; they were to be exempted from subsidies and other aids; their heirs were to be free from personal wardship, notwithstanding any tenure; they were to be impleaded in their own towns, and not elsewhere; they were not to be liable to tolls; and they had other privileges besides.
