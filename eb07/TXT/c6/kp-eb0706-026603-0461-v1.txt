CAXAMARCA, a province of Peru, bounded on the north by Jaen, on the east by Chachapoyas, on the southeast by Caxamarquilla, on the south by Huamachuco, and on the west by Sana and Truxillo. It is a hundred and twenty miles in length by a hundred and eight in breadth, and lies between the fifth and eighth degrees of south latitude. The country is in general mountainous, being intersected in many parts by the great ridges which diverge from the main chain of the Andes; and it is on this account subjected to every variety of temperature. It abounds in fruits and cattle. The inhabitants, who are for the most part Indians, amount to about 50,000, and are chiefly employed in weaving.

C ax am a rca, the capital of the above province, stands upon a level plain, and is of an irregular figure. It was at one time a royal city; and here Atahuapa, the last Inca of Peru, was put to death by the Spaniards. The population amounts to about 12,000. Long. 78. 35. W. Lat. 7. 3. S.
