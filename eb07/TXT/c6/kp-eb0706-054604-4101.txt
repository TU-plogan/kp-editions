CHIMBORAZO, a mountain of Columbia, in the province of Quito. It is the most elevated summit of the Andes, rising to the height of 20,100 feet above the level of the sea, and to about 2500 feet from the top downwards covered with perpetual snow. At certain seasons of the year it presents a magnificent spectacle when seen from the shores of the Pacific Ocean. After the long winter rains, the atmosphere becomes remarkably clear; and through this transparent medium its enormous snowy summit is seen projected upon the deep azure of the equatorial sky. The view is in the highest degree imposing and sublime. Humboldt and Bonpland ascended this mountain in 1802, to the height of 19,300 feet by barometrical measurement, a greater height than was ever before attained by man.
