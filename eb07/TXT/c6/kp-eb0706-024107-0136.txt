CATEGORICAL, in a general sense, is applied to those things ranged under a Category. Categorical also imports a thing to be absolute, and not relative; in which sense it stands opposed to hypothetical. We say, a categorical proposition, a categorical syllogism, and the like.

A categorical answer denotes an express and pertinent answer made to any question or objection proposed.
