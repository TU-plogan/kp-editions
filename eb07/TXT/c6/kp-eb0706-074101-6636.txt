CLERK (clericus), a word formerly used to signify a learned man, or man of letters. The word comes from the Greek xXrcgo¢, used for clergy, but more properly signifying lot or heritage, because the lot or portion of clerks or ecclesiastics is to serve God. Accordingly clerus was at first used to signify those who were particularly attached to the service of God. The origin of the expression is derived from the Old Testament, where the tribe of Levi is called the lot or heritage, r.λr l ξος ; and God is reciprocally called their portion, by reason of that tribe having been consecrated to the service of God, and lived on the offerings made to God, without any other settled provision. Thus Pasquier observes, that the officers of the counts, or comites, were anciently created under the title of clerks of accompts, and secretaries of state were called clerks of the secret. So clericus domini regis, in the time of Edward I., was rendered, the kings secretary, or clerk of his council. The term was applied indifferently to all who made any profession of learning, or who knew how to manage the pen; though originally it was applied only to ecclesiastics. As the nobility and gentry were usually brought up to the exercise of arms, there were none but the clergy left to cultivate the sciences; and hence, as it was the clergy alone who had made any profession of letters, a very learned man came to be called a great clerk, and a stupid, ignorant man, a bad clerk. Clerk is also applied to such as by their course of life exercise their pens in any court or office; of which there were, and still are, various kinds.
