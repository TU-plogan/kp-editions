CENSITUS, a person censed or entered in the tables of the census. In an ancient monument found at Ancyra, containing the actions of the Emperor Octavius, we read,
Quo lustro civium Romanorum
Censita sunt capita quadragies
Centum millia et sexaginta tria:

From which we learn that the number of Roman citizens, entered in the censor’s rolls, was then upwards of four millions.

Censitus is also used in the civil law for a servile sort of tenant, who pays capitation to his lord for the lands he holds of him, and is entered as such in the lord’s rent-roll; in which sense the word is equivalent to capite census, or eapite censitus. See Capite Censu
