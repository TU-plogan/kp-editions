CHESS,

A very ancient and ingenious game, performed by two persons, with thirty-two pieces of wood or ivory called men, on a square board divided into sixty-four equal squares, usually stained black and white alternately. Each player has sixteen men, those of the one player being usually black, and those of the other white, in order to distinguish them.

Of the sixteen men on either side, eight are called Pieces, and eight Pawns. The eight pieces consist of a King, a Queen, two Castles or Rooks, two Bishops, and two Knights.

The men may be thus represented:

The following diagram represents the board, with the men as placed on it when a game is to be played:

Each row of squares running from the bottom to the top of the board is called a file. Each row of squares running from side to side is called a rank or line. Four lines of squares belong to the black men, and four to the white. A row of squares running obliquely from one side of the board to the other is called a diagonal. A diagonal consists either wholly of black squares or wholly of white.

The board must be so placed between the two players, that each of them may have a white corner at his right hand. This manner of placing the board, though not essential to the game, is invariably observed.

The eight pieces are ranked up on the first line of the board next each player, according to the following distribution: The two rooks occupy the two lateral squares which form the angles of the board; the two knights occupy the squares next to the rooks; the two bishops are next to the knights; and the king and queen occupy each of them one of the two centre squares of the line, the queen being upon a square of her own colour. ^[1. Sequitur regina colorem.] It follows, that when the pieces are properly placed, the white king will be found occupying the square to the right, and the black king the square to the left, each of his respective queen.

The pieces on the king’s side of the line are called the king’s bishop, the king’s knight, and the king’s rook. Those on the queen’s side are called the queen’s bishop, the queen’s knight, and the queen’s rook.

The eight pawns are ranked up on the second line of squares, and take their denomination from the several pieces before -which they are respectively placed. Thus, the pawn in the square in front of the king is called the king’s pawn, the one in front of the queen is called the queen’s pawn, and so on with the rest, as king’s bishop’s pawn, queen’s bishop’s pawn, king’s knight's pawn, queen’s knight’s pawn, king’s rook’s pawn, queen’s rook’s pawn.

In like manner the squares of the board take their denomination from the several pieces. The square occupied by the king at the beginning of the game is called the king’s square, the one occupied by the queen the queen’s square, and so on. The square immediately in front of the king’s square is called the king’s second square, the one in front of his second square is his third square, and the one in front of his third is his fourth square. The eight pieces of each of the two players have thus their respective squares, and second, third, and fourth squares, exhausting among them the whole sixty-four squares of the board. For the sake of clearness, however, it is sometimes convenient to carry the numeration into the adverse side of the board. Thus, the square in front of the king’s fourth is sometimes called his fifth square, and so on to the eighth square, which of course is the adverse king’s square.

The pawn moves straight forward on its own file, one square at a time, except at first setting off, when, in the option of the player, it may move two squares at once. For example, if it be proposed to move the king’s, pawn, which stands on its own square, being the king’s second square, it may be moved either to the king’s third or to his fourth square, but afterwards it can be moved forward only one square at a time.

The pawn, although it moves straight forward, attacks and captures its adversaries diagonally or obliquely. Thus suppose a white pawn to be on its king’s fourth square, and a black pawn to be also on its king’s fourth square, the one pawn cannot attack and take the other; on the contrary, the one stops the other in its progress onward. But suppose the black pawn to be on its queen’s fourth square, then the white pawn can attack and take the black pawn. This is done by removing the black pawn from the board, and advancing the white pawn obliquely, and placing it on the square left vacant by the removal of the black pawn; that is to say, the white pawn is removed from its own king’s fourth square, and placed on the adverse queen’s fourth square. It still retains the name of the king’s pawn. When this pawn has again occasion to move, it goes straight forward on its new file, unless it should avail itself of another opportunity of making a capture, when it again passes obliquely to a square in another file. When a pawn has arrived at the eighth or last square of the file, it loses its character of a pawn, and may be converted into any piece, [7:6:512] except the king, that the player chooses. He is said to queen his pawn when he carries it up to the ultimate square.

The hnight moves in a manner somewhat difficult to be described. It leaps obliquely over an adjoining square to one of the next squares, having a colour different from the colour of the square which it leaves. For example, let the king’s knight be on its own square; it may be moved to the king’s second square, to the king’s bishop’s third square, or to the king’s rook’s third square; or, supposing it to be-standing on its king’s fourth square, it may be moved to the king’s knight’s third square, or to the king’s bishop's second square, or to the queen’s second square, or to the queen’s bishop’s third square, or to the adverse queen’s bishop’s fourth square, or to the adverse queen’s third square, or to the adverse king’s bishop’s third square. On turning to the diagram, the reader will be able easily to follow and understand this description of the knight’s move. It is the only piece that is allowed to move over another.

The bishop moves diagonally forward or backward any number of squares at a time, provided the course be open, by being free of other men. A bishop must necessarily continue to move over squares of a colour the same with that on which it was originally placed. The one bishop always moves upon black diagonals, the other upon white.

The rook or castle moves straight forward, straight backward, or straight across, any number of squares at a time, provided the intermediate squares be unoccupied by other men; that is to say, a rook moves either upon files or upon lines.

The queen can move either like a rook or like a bishop.

The Λύψ can move one square only at a time, and that backwards, or forwards, or sidewise, or obliquely. He can also, once in the course of a game, make the singular move called castling. Castling usually takes place for the double purpose of removing the king into a more secure situation, and of bringing a castle more into play; and it may be done either on the king’s side of the board or on the queen’s. When it is done on the king's side, the king and his rook are simultaneously lifted from their respective squares, and placed, the king on his knight’s square, the rook on the bishop’s. When it is done on the queen’s side, the king and the queen’s rook are lifted from their squares, and placed, the king on the queen’s bishop’s square, the rook on the queen’s.

The adverse kings cannot approach each other so as to be on conterminous squares. One square at least must intervene between them. The reasen of this obviously is, that if one king were to come to a square adjoining that occupied by the other, he would be within the range of his attack.^[2. In 11 Giuοcο Incomparable Degli Scacclã, this reason is given :—“ Non bene conveniunt, nec in una sede morantur Majestas, et Amor.]

All the pieces (it is otherwise with the pawns) take in the direction in which they move. The manner of taking is to place the attacking piece on the square of the piece or pawn captured, the captured piece being removed from the board. A player, however, is not obliged to take a piece or pawn under attack and subject to capture. He may take it or not as he thinks fit.

The principal technical terms made use of in chessplaying will now be explained.

Castling. —This has been treated of already.

Check. —When an attack is made upon a king by any piece oŗ pawn, he is said to be cheched. This will be best understood from a practical illustration. Let your king be upon his own square, and let your adversary play his queen to his king’s second square. If there be no piece or pawn on any of the squares which separate the king and queen, your king is directly exposed to the action of the queen, and is said to be checked by her. The check is to be got the better of by capturing the queen, if she happen to be within the range of any of your men, or by interposing some piece between your king and the attacking queen, or by moving the king to another square beyond the scope of her action.

Check by Discovery, or Discovered Check. —This takes place when the removal of an interposed piece opens up a check from another piece. For example, let your king be on his own square, and the adverse queen on her king’s second square, and let all the intermediate squares of the file be vacant, except the adverse king’s third, upon which third square his queen’s bishop happens to be placed. It is evident that the interposition of this bishop covers or protects your king from the action of his queen. But if your adversary should play away his bishop from his king’s third square, your king would be instantly exposed to the action of the queen; and this is called check by discovery, or discovered clιech. Check-mate. —The object of the game is to give checkmate. When the king is so assaulted and beset that he cannot move out of check, nor take the piece or pawn that checks him, nor interpose any man for his protection, he is check-mated ; and the party giving the check-mate wins the game.

Stale-mate. —When the king is not in check, but yet is so circumstanced that he cannot move without going into check, and when, at the same time, all his men are cither off the board, or in such a situation that none of them can move, he is said to be stale-mated. When stalemate is given, the game is held to be drawn.

Drawn Game. —A game is said to be drawn, when neither party can give check-mate to the other. This happens, Hr, where perpetual cheek is given to the adverse king without the possibility of his averting it; %dly, where the force left on the board is not sufficient to give check-mate; ⅛dly, where the force left being sufficient, the party possessing it is unacquainted with the method of giving check-mate in fifty moves, as required by the laws;^[3. See Art. xxii. of the Laws.] Athly, where both parties stand on the defensive, neither of them being inclined to hazard an attack; and, 5thly, where one of the kings is stale-mated.

Doubled Pawn. —A pawn is said to be doubled, when, by having made a capture, it has passed from its own file to another file, already possessing a pawn on some other square.

Passed Pawn.— A pawn is said to be passed, when there is no adverse pawn to oppose its march to queen, nor any adverse pawns on the two adjacent files; or, if there be hostile pawns on the adjacent files, when it has already passed them.

• En Passant. —In explaining the pawn’s moves, it was stated, that at first setting off a pawn may be played two squares at once. This statement, however, is subject to qualification. Suppose your king’s pawn to be upon its own square, and your adversary to have a pawn on your queen’s fourth square, it is evident that you cannot play your king’s pawn two squares without passing over a square exposed to the action of your adversary’s pawn, the square so exposed being your king’s third. Now, your adversary is entitled to arrest, as it were, your pawn in its passage over that square, and to capture it. You play your pawn from king’s second to king’s fourth; he [7:6:513] lifts it up, and moves his own pawn obliquely from your queen's fourth square to your king’s third; and this operation is called taking your pawn en passant. He may take it, however, or let it alone, just as he likes.

En Prise. —When a piece or pawn is liable to be taken by another, it is said to be en prise of that other.

Minor Pieces. —Knights and bishops are called minor pieces, because they are of less value than the other pieces.

To Gain the Exchange or Difference. —When a player wins his adversary’s rook, in exchange for his own knight or bishop, he is said to gain the exchange. In the Edinburgh Cheşs Club the expression used is, to gain the difference. Gambit. —This is a peculiar opening of a game, where a player sacrifices a pawn or piece, in order to remove the adverse king’s pawn from its fourth square, and thus be the better enabled to make an attack. Examples of it will be given hereafter, from which its nature will be much more easily understood than from any general description or definition.

Relative Value of the Pieces. King. —As the king can never be taken, and as the very existence of the game depends upon him, he can, of course, have no relative value. But his power both of attack and defence being considerable, he should be brought forward to action as soon as the more powerful pieces, particularly the queen, are off the board.

Queen. —The queen is the most powerful of all the pieces, being worth two rooks and a pawn. Towards the end of a game, when the board has become more open for the action of the rooks, her relative value is lessened a little, and she is then worth two rooks only. Properly speaking, however, this arises not from any diminution of power upon her part, but from an increase of power on the part of the rooks.

Rook. —The rook is next in value to the queen, and is reckoned equal to a minor piece and two pawns, or to five pawns. A rook increases in power of action as the board gets clear of other pieces and pawns; and it is the only piece except the queen that can give check-mate with no other assistance than its own king.

Bishop. —The bishop is worth more than three pawns, and less than four. It is reckoned of equal value with a knight. At the beginning of a game the king’s bishop is more serviceable for attack than the queen’s. Two bishops, with the assistance of the king, can give check-mate.

Knight. —The knight, like the bishop, is worth more than three pawns, but less than four. It is distinguished by these two peculiarities: Is/, It is never en prise, of the piece that it attacks, except when it attacks another knight; and, 2dly, the piece attacked cannot get the better of the attack by the interposition of a third piece, but must itself move to another square. Two knights, with the assistance of the king, cannot give check-mate. A knight and bishop can.

It is usual with writers on chess to give a great many general instructions as to the mode of opening and conducting a game; but as such general instructions are of little or no practical use, we shall withhold them entirely, in order to make room for a few examples of the game, by going over which with the aid of a board and men, the reader will become much better acquainted with chessplaying, than if lie were to peruse whole volumes of general observations.

The following are the laws usually observed in this country in playing the game:

1. The chess-board must be placed in such a manner that each player may have a white square corner on his right hand. If the board be improperly placed, and the mistake not discovered till after four moves have been played on each side, it must remain as it is till the end of the game.

2. If the pieces or pawns be improperly placed, the player who first perceives it may insist on the mistake’s being rectified, provided four moves on each side have not been played.

3. If a player begin a game without having all his pieces, and if he do not perceive it until the fourth move has been played, he must finish the game without the pieces or pawns which he has forgotten.

4. When the game is played even, the players must draw lots for the first move; after the first game the move belongs alternately to each player.^[4. In Germany he who wins the game has the advantage of playing first the next game.]

5. The player who gives odds has always the advantage of the move; except, of course, in those games where the move is also given to the inferior player; such, for example, as the pawn and move, &c.

6. When a player has touched a piece he must wzore it. N. Ľ. — If a piece be not placed exactly in the centre of its square, or if it should fall, the player must say Radoube in placing it properly, else his adversary 7 may compel him to play it.

7. As long as a player holds a piece, he is at liberty to play it where he chooses; but when he has let it go, he cannot recal his move.

8. If a player touch one of his adversary’s pieces without saying· J'adoube, he may be compelled to take it; if the piece cannot be taken, the player must move his king; and if neither the piece nor the king can be moved, no penalty shall be inflicted.

9. If a player should, by mistake, play one of his adversary’s pieces instead of his own, his adversary may compel him either to take it, if it can be taken, to replace it where it was, or to let it remain where he played it.

10. If a player take one of his adversary’s pieces with a piece that cannot take it without a false move, his adversary may compel him either to take it with any other piece, or to play the piece which he has touched.

11. If a player take one of his pieces with another of his own, his adversary may oblige him to play either of the two pieces.

12. If a player make a false move, his adversary may oblige him to let the piece remain where he played it; or to play it to some other square; or to replace the piece where it previously was, and to play the king instead of it.

13. If a player should play two successive moves, it is in his adversary’s power to oblige him to put back the second move; or, if he choose it, he may insist on continuing the game, as if only one move had been played.

14. A pawn that is pushed two squares may be taken en passant, by the adversary’s pawn.^[5. This is not the case in Italy; a pawn is allowed to pass en prise, which is called j>assar battaglia.]

15. The king cannot castle: Is/, If he has moved; 2dly, if he be in check; 3dly, if any of the squares over which he moves in castling be occupied by or under the power of one of his adversary’s pieces; and, ⅛tkly, if the rook has moved. A player who castles in either of these four [7:6:514] cases must put back the move; and his adversary has the option of compelling him to play either the king or the rook with which he intended to castlc.

16. If a player touch one of his pieces which cannot be moved without placing his king in check, he must play his king; and if the king cannot move, no penalty is to be inflicted.

17. Whenever a player attacks his adversary’s king, he must say check ; and if he forget to say it, the adversary needs not move his king, or take notice of the check; and if the player who did not say check, should, on the next move, attack the queen, or any of his adversary’s pieces, and say check, the player whose king is in check may put back his last move, and, instead of it, remove his king, or cover the check.

18. If the king have been in check during two or more moves, and it be not possible to ascertain how it happened, he whose king is in check may, as soon as he perceives it, put back his last move, and remove his king, or cover the check.

19. If a player say check without giving check, and his adversary should in consequence move his king, or touch any piece to cover the check, and should afterwards perceive that he is not in check, he may put back his last move, provided his opponent have not already played his next move.

20. If a player has moved previously to perceiving a false move, or any other mistake which his adversary may have committed, he can no longer insist on the penalty: he should have noticed the mistake before he moved or even touched a piece.

21. When a player has pushed a pawn to queen, he is at liberty to make a second queen, a third rook, or any other piece which he may deem more useful for his attack or defence.

22. At the end of a game, when a player remains with a rook and a bishop against a rook, with both bishops, or with a knight and bishop, against the king, &c. if he cannot check-mate his adversary in fifty moves, the game shall be considered as a drawn game.

But if a player engage to check-mate his adversary with a marked pawn, or with any particular piece, the number of moves is then unlimited.

23. If the king be stale-mated, the game is a drawn game. Explanation of the Abbreviated Terms made use of in the Notation of the Games.

As this game happened to be drawn, we shall give a variation of it, in order to make it terminate with a checkmate. Supposing white to have played, for its 26th move, K. R. P. one square, instead of Q. R. to K. sq. the following would probably have been the train of moves:

At this point the London Club resigned the game and lost the match.

It is stated in the report of the match by the Edinburgh committee, that the match, which was played by correspondence, was begun on the 23d of April 1824, and finished on the 31st of July 1828. The first and third games were drawn, the fourth was won by the London Club, and the second and fifth were won by the Edinburgh Club.

METHODS OF GIVING CHECK-MATE.

2. With two Bishops and a King against a King.

If he should play his R. to your K. Kt. 4th, you play Q. to ad. K. R. 4th sq. checking, and then gain the Rook. Therefore he plays R. to ad. K. Kt. 3d.

If he had, at his third move, played R. to your K. Kt. 2d, you would have checked with your Q. at K. 4th sq. gaining the Rook.

Sarasin has an express treatise on the different opinions as to the origin of the word schacchi, whence the French échecs and our chess is formed. Menage is also very full on the same head. Leunclavius supposes it to come from uscoches, famous Turkish robbers; P. Sirmond from the German schache, theft, and that again from calculus. He takes chess to be the same with the ludus latrunculorum of the Romans, but erroneously. This opinion is countenanced by Vossius and Salmasius, who derive the word from calculus, as used for latrunculus. G. Tolosanus derives it from the Hebrew search, volavit, and mat, mortuus ; whence check and check-mate. Fabricius says a celebrated Persian astronomer, one Schatrenscha, invented the game of chess, and gave it his own name, which it still bears in that country. Nicod derives it from scheeqιιe, or xeque, a Moorish word for lord, king, and prince. Bochart adds that scach is originally Persian; and that scαck-ηιat in that language signifies the king is dead. The opinion of Nicod and Bochart, which is likewise thatofScri-verius, appears the most probable.

With regard to the origin of the game of chess we are much in the dark. Though it came to us from the Saracens, it is by no means probable that they were the original inventors of it. According to some, it was invented by the celebrated Grecian hero Diomedes. Others say that two Grecian brothers, Ledo and Tyrrheno, were tlιe inventors; and that being much pressed with hunger, they sought to alleviate the pain by this amusement. According to Mr Irwin, it is a game of Chinese invention. During his residence in India he found that a tradition of this nature existed among the Brahmins, with whom he frequently played the game. But according to Sir William Jones, this game is of Hindoo invention. “If evidence were required to prove this fact,” says he,^[10. Asiatic Researches, vol. ii. mėm. 9.] “we may be satisfied with the testimony of the Persians, who, though as much inclined as other nations to appropriate the ingenious inventions of a foreign people, unanimously agree that the game was imported from the west of Lidia in the sixth century of our era. It seems to have been immemorially known in Hindostan by 7 the name of Cheturαηgα, i. e. the four azιgas, or members of any army; which are these, elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers ; and in this sense the word is frequently used by epic poets in their description of real armies. By a natural corruption of the pure Sanscrit word, it was changed by the old Persians into Chetraηg ; but the Arabs, who soon after took possession of their country, had neither the initial nor final letter of that word in their alphabet, and consequently altered it further into Shetranj, which found its way presently into the modern Persian, and at length into the dialects of India, where the true derivation of the name is known only to the learned. Thus has a very significant word in the sacred language of the Brahmins been transformed by successive changes into axidrez, scacchi, échecs, chess, and, by a whimsical concurrence of circumstances, has given birth to the English word check, and even a name to the exchequer of Great Britain.”

The game of chess lias been generally practised by the [7:6:519] greatest warriors and generals; and some have even supposed that it was necessary for a military man to be well skilled in this game. It is a game which has something in it peculiarly interesting. We read that Tamerlane was a great chess-player, and was engaged in a game during the very time of the decisive battle with Bajazet the Turkish emperor, who was defeated and taken prisoner. It is also related of Al Amin, the caliph of Bagdad, that he was engaged at chess with his freedman Kuthar at the time when Al Mamun’s forces were carrying on the siege of that city with so much vigour that it was on the point of being carried by assault. In a battle between the French and English in 1117, an English knight having seized the bridle of Louis le Gros, and crying to his comrades, “The king is taken !” the king struck him to the ground with his sword, saying, “Nc sçais-tu pas qu’aux échecs on ne prend pas le roi ?” Dr Hyde quotes an Arabie history of the Saracens, in which the caliph is said to have cried out, when warned of his danger, “Let me alone, for I see check-mate against Kuthar !” We are told that Charles I. was at chess when news were brought of the final intention of the Scotch to give him up to the English; but so little was he disturbed by this alarming intelligence, that he continued his game with the utmost composure, so that no person could have known that the letter he received had given him information of any thing remarkable. King John was playing at chess when the deputies from Rouen came to acquaint him that their city was besieged by Philip Augustus; but he would not hear them until he had finished his game.

The following remarkable anecdote we have from Dr Robertson in his history of Charles V. John Frederic, elector of Saxony, having been taken prisoner by Charles, was condemned to death. The decree was intimated to him while at chess with Ernest of Brunswick, his fellow prisoner. After a short pause, and making some reflection on the irregularity and injustice of the emperor’s proceedings, he turned to his antagonist, whom he challenged to finish the game. He played with his usual ingenuity and attention; and having beat Ernest, expressed all the satisfaction that is commonly felt on gaining such victories. He was not, however, put to death, but set at liberty after five years’ confinement.

Chess seems to have been in vogue at the court of Queen Elizabeth. Sir Walter Raleigh used to say that he did not wish to live longer than he could play at chess. Sir Charles Blount, afterwards Earl of Devonshire, having distinguished himself at a tilt, received from that princess a present of a chess-queen of gold enamelled, which he tied round his arm with a crimson riband. This favour from the queen produced a duel betwixt him and the Earl of Essex.

Charles XII. of Sweden was fond of the game; but he was not a successful player, in consequence of his making the king take too active a share in the contest. To this day a chess-king who advances too boldly into the fight is called Charles XII.

In the Chronicle of thę Moorish Kings of Granada we find it related, that in 1396 Mehemcd Baiba seized upon the crown in prejudice of his elder brother, and passed his life in one continual round of disasters. His wars with Castille were invariably unsuccessful; and his death was occasioned by a poisoned vest. Finding his case desperate, he dispatched an officer to the fort of Salabreno to put his brother Juzuf to death, lest that prince’s adherents should form any obstacle to his son’s succession. The alcade found the prince playing at chess with an alfaqui or priest. Juzuf begged hard for two hours’ respite, which was denied him; at last, with great reluctance, the officer permitted him to finish the game; but before it was finished a messenger arrived with the news of the death of Mehemed, and the unanimous election of Juzuf to the crown.

We h∙ave a curious anecdote of Ferrand, Count of Flanders, who, having been accustomed to amuse himself at chess with his wife, and being constantly beaten by her, a mutual hatred took place, which came to such a height, that when the count was taken prisoner at the battle of Bovines, she suffered him to remain a long time in prison, though she could easily have procured his release.

Two Persians had engaged in such deep play, that the whole fortune of one of them w as gained by his opponent. He who played the white was the ruined man; and, made desperate by his loss, offered his favourite wife as his last stake. The game was carried on until he would have been check-mated by his adversary next move. The lady, who had observed the game from a window above, cried out to her husband to sacrifice his castle and save his wife.

The game of chess has undergone considerable variations since it was first invented. We have it on good authority, that among the eastern nations the piece now called the queen was formerly called the vizir or king’s minister, and that the powers of the queen herself were but very small. The chess-boards used by Tamerlane were larger, and contained many more squares, than those at present in use. Carrera invented two new pieces to be added to the eight commonly in use. One of these, which he calls Campione, is placed between the king’s knight and castle; the other, named Centaur, between the queen’s knight and castle, has the move of the bishop and knight united. This invention, how cver, did not survive its author. In another of this kind the two additional pieces are called the centurion and decurion ; the former situated between the king and his bishop, in its move the same with that of the queen, but only for two squares; the latter moves as the bishop, but only one square at a time. This, like the former, died with its inventor. The chessboard of Tamerlane was a parallelogram, having eleven squares one way and t∏ 7 elve the other. In the Memoirs of the late Marshal Keith, we find it related that he invented an amusement something similar to that of chess, with which the king of Prussia was highly entertained. Several thousand small statues were cast by a founder; and these were ranged opposite to each other as if they had been drawn up in an army, making the different movements with them as in real service in the field.
