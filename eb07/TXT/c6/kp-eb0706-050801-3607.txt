CHERSON, the capital of the province as well as of the circle of the same name in European Russia. It is distant from Petersburg 1200 miles, and has been built since 1778, on the right bank of theDneiper. It contains many establishments of a public nature, viz awell-built fortress, the marine arsenal, with its docks, storehouses, and ships of war; a suburb for the Greeks settled there, and another as quarters for the military.Â· It has three churches, a well-built bazar, and barracks for the sailors of the fleet. The city contains 1500 private dwellings, and about 12,000 inhabitants. It has a great trade in ship-timber and ship-building. The river is too shallow for ships drawing much water, and its depth has so much diminished that vessels cannot now, as a few years ago, come to the quays. Near to the city is a monument to the celebrated Potemkin, and also one to the philanthropic Howard. It is in long. 32. 33.13. E. and lat. 46. 37. 46. N.
