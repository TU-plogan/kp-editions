CAMPBELTOWN, a royal burgh of Scotland, in the peninsula of Kintyre, Argyleshire. It is beautifully situated on the margin of a salt-water lake or inlet of the sea, lying, in a semicircular form, around the head of the bay. Campbeltown is mostly of modern erection. It consists, besides the side streets, of one main street stretching upwards from the water, intersected at right angles by another which goes through the town. Prior to the year 1700 it was a mere fishing village, but in that year it was erected into a royal burgh, through the interest of the Argyll family, in honour of ∖vhom it had received its name. Campbeltown is of considerable antiquity, though no memorial of this exists, except a flat stone cross, on which are a variety of figures in relief, and an inscription, but no date. Popular tradition, however, has assigned it to the twelfth century. It was brought from Icolmkill, and is now inserted in an elevated pedestal at the market-place. There are five distilleries in the town, and the trade consists chiefly in the export of whisky and potatoes, of which great quantities are shipped for Ireland. The town is in a very thriving state, from a number of respectable retired families having taken up their residence in the handsome cottages scattered over the sides of the loch. Campbeltown has a magisterial government, composed of a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, a treasurer, a water bailie, and twelve counsellors, but no incorporated trades. Here branches of the Commercial and British Linen Company’s Banks have been some time established. There are two established churches, and some dissenting meetinghouses, besides a Roman Catholic chapel. The population of the burgh and parish amounted in 1821 to 9016, and in 1831 to 9472.
