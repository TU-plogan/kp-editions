CHAMBERS, David, a Scotch historian, priest, and lawyer, was born in the shire of Ross about the year 1530, and educated in the university of Aberdeen. From thence he went to France and Italy, where he continued some time, particularly at Bologna, where in 1556 he was a pupil of Mariannus Sozenus.

After his return to Scotland, he was appointed by Queen Mary, parson of Suddy, and chancellor of Ross. He was soon afterwards employed in digesting the laws of Scotland, and was principally concerned in publishing the acts of parliament of that kingdom by authority in 1566. He was also appointed one of the lords of session, and continued her majesty’s faithful servant till her declining fortune obliged her adherents to seek for refuge in othe∙ kingdoms. Chambers went first to Spain, where he was graciously received by king Philip; and thence travelled to Paris, where he was no less kindly welcomed by Charles IX. of that kingdom, to whom, in 1572, he presented his history of Scotland. He died at Paris in the year 1592, much regretted, says Mackenzie, by all who knew him. His writings were chiefly calculated to assist his royal mistress, and to extol the wisdom of the Scotch nation.

Chambers, Ephraim, author of the Cyclopaedia which bears his name, was born at Milton, in the county of Westmoreland. His parents were dissenters of the Presbyterian persuasion, and his education was no other than that common one which is intended to qualify a youth for trade and commerce. λVhen he became of a proper age, he was put as apprentice to Mr Senex the globe-maker, a business which is connected with science, and especially with astronomy[7:6:314] and geography. It was during Mr Chambers’ residence with this skilful mechanic that he contracted that taste for science and learning which accompanied him through life, and directed all his pursuits. It was even at this time that he formed the design of his great work, the Cyclopoedia ; and some of the articles of it were written behind the counter. Having conceived the idea of so extensive an undertaking, he justly concluded that the execution of it would not consist with the avocations of trade; and therefore lie quitted Mr Senex, and took chambers at Gray’s Inn, where he chiefly resided during the rest of his days. The first edition of the Cyclopaedia, which was the result of many years’ intense application, appeared in 1728, in two volumes folio. It was published by subscription, the price being L4. 4s.; and the list of subscribers was exceedingly respectable. The dedication to the king is dated the 15th October 1727. The reputation which Mr Chambers acquired by bis execution of this undertaking procured him the honour of being elected fellow of the Royal Society on the 6th November 1729. In less than ten years time a second edition became necessary, which accordingly was printed, with corrections and additions, in 1738; and it was followed by a third in the course of next year.

Although the Cyclopoedia was the grand business of Mr Chambers' life, and may be regarded as almost the sole foundation of his fame, his attention was not wholly confined to this undertaking. He was concerned in a periodical publication entitled The Literary Magazine, which was begun in 1735. In this work he wrote a variety of articles, and particularly a review of Morgan’s Moral Philosophy. He was engaged likewise, in conjunction with Mr John Martyn, fellow of the Royal Society, and professor ofbotany at Cambridge, in preparing for the press a translation and abridgment of the Philosophical History and Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, or an Abridgment of all the Papers relating to Natural Philosophy which have been published by the Members of that illustrious Society. This undertaking, when completed, was comprised in five volumes 8vo, which did not appear till 1742, some time after our author’s decease, when they were published under the joint names of Mr Martyn and Mr Chambers. In a subsequent publication, Mr Martyn passed a severe censure upon the share which his fellowlabourer had had in the abridgment of the Parisian papers. The only work besides, that we find ascribed to Mr Chambers, is a translation of the Jesuit’s Perspective, from the French; which was printed in 4to, and has gone through several editions. Mr Chambers’ close and unremitting attention to his studies at length impaired his health, and obliged him occasionally to take a lodging at Canonbury-house, Islington. This not having greatly contributed to his recovery, he made an excursion to the south of France, but did not reap that benefit from it which he had himself hoped, and which his friends wished; for, returning to England, he died at Canonbury-house, and was buried at Westminster, where the following inscription, written by himself, is placed on the north side of the cloisters of the Abbey:
Multis pervulgatis,
Paucis notus;
Qui vitam, inter lucem et umbram,
Nec eruditus, nec idiota,
Literis deditus, transegit; sed ut homo
Qui humani nihil a se alienum putat.
Vita simul, et laboribus functus,
Hic requiescere veluit,
Ephraim Chambers, R. S. S.
Obiit xv. Mail mdccxl.
