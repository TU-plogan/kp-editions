CASTRUCCIO Castracani, a celebrated Italian general, was born at Lucca in Tuscany in 1284, and left in a vineyard covered with leaves, where he was found by Dianora, a widow lady, the sister of Antonio, a canon of St Michael in Lucca, who was descended from the illustrious family of the Castracani. The lady having no children, resolved to bring him up, and accordingly educated him as carefully as if he had been her own. She intended him for a priest; but he was scarcely fourteen years old when he began to devote himself to military sports and those violent exercises which suited his great strength of [7:6:237]body. The factions named the Gudfs and Ghibelines then shared all Italy between them; divided the popes and the emperors; and engaged in their different interests not only the members of the same town, but even those of the same family. Francisco, a considerable person on the side of the Ghibelines, observing Castruccioâ€™s uncommon spirit and great qualities, prevailed with Antonio to permit him to become a soldier; on which Castruccio soon became acquainted with every thing belonging to the profession of arms, and was made lieutenant of a company of foot by Francisco Guinigi. In his first campaign he gave such proofs of his courage and conduct as spread his fame all over Lombardy; and Guinigi, dying soon afterwards, committed to him the care of his son and the management of his estate. Continuing to distinguish himself by his exploits, he filled his commander-in-chief with such jealousy and envy, that he was imprisoned by stratagem in order to be put to death. But the people of Lucca soon released him, and afterwards chose him for their sovereign prince. The Ghibelines considered him as the chief of their party; and those who had been banished from their country fled to him for protection, and unanimously promised that if he could restore them to their estates, they would serve him so effectually that the sovereignty of their country should be his reward. Flattered by these promises, he entered into a league yvith the prince of Milan; and kept his army constantly on foot, employing it as best suited his own designs. For the services he had rendered the pope, he was made senator of Rome with more than ordinary ceremony; but whilst he remained there he received news which obliged him to hasten back to Lucca. The Florentines entered into a war with him; but Castruccio fought his way through them; and the supreme authority of Tuscany was about to fall into his hands, when a period was put to his life. In May 1328 he gained a complete victory over his enemies, amounting to 30,000 foot and 10,000 horse; and 22,000 of them were slain, while the loss on his part fell short of 1600; but as he was returning from the field of battle, tired with the action, and covered with sweat, he halted a little, in order to thank and caress his soldiers as they passed; when, the north wind blowing upon him, he was immediately seized with an ague, which he at first neglected, but which carried him off in a few days, in the forty-fourth year of his age. Machiavelli, who has written the life of Castruccio, says that he was not only an extraordinary man in his own age, but that he would have been so in any other.
