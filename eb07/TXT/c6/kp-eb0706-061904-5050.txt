CHOTEESGUR, a large district of Hindustan, in the province of Gundwanah, situated principally between the twenty-second and twenty-third degrees of north latitude. It is sometimes called Ruttunpore, from its principal town, but more frequently Jeharcund, from its being full of woods. Choteesgur, which name is given to it from its possessing thirty-four forts, is generally unproductive. The best portion of it is to the south of Ruttunpore, which is a champaign country, abundantly watered with rivulets, well cultivated, and stocked with villages, and adorned with numerous groves. Wheat and vegetables are produced in considerable quantities in the vicinity of Ryepore; rice is not abundant, there being few places favourable for its cultivation. The chief towns are Ruttunpore, Ryepore, Niagur, Nowagur, Sindoury, and Khoorbah. Large quantities of grain are exported to the Deccan and Northern Circars; and in return salt is imported from the latter, on which the merchants exact an exorbitant profit. It is by the itinerant grain-dealers that the principal part of the commerce is carried on, though foreign merchants bring a few horses, elephants, camels, and shawls. The country abounds in cattle and horses. It was estimated about the year 1794, that 100,000 bullocks were employed in the export trade. The IÄ­atsoo and Caroon are the chief rivers. This district was in ancient times comprehended in the Hindu province of Gundwanah, and composed part of the state of Gurrah; but during the reign of Aurungzebe it was annexed to the province of Allahabad. In 1752 it was conquered by Rayogee Bhoonsla; it was afterwards tributary to the rajah of Nagpoor, and, after he was driven from his dominions in 1818, was annexed to the British territories.
