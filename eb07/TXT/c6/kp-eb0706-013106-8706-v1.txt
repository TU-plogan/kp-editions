CARACCI, Louis, Augustine, and Hannibal, three celebrated painters of the Lombard school, all of Bologna. Louis was born in 1555, and was cousin-german to Augustine and Hannibal, who were brothers, the sons of a tailor, who was yet careful to give them a liberal education. They were both disciples of their cousin Louis. Augustine gained a knowledge of mathematics, natural philosophy, music, poetry, and most of the liberal arts; but, though painting was his principal pursuit, he learned the art of engraving from Cornelius Cort, and surpassed all the masters of his time. Hannibal, again, never deviated from his pencil. These three painters at length having reaped all the advantages they could by contemplation and practice, formed a plan of association, continued always together, and laid the foundation of that celebrated school which has ever since been known by the name of Caracci , s Academy. Thither all the young students who had a view of becoming masters resorted for instruction in the rudiments of painting; and there the Caracci taught freely, and without reserve, all that came. Louis’s charge [7:6:132] was to make a collection of antique statues and bas reliefs. They had designs of the best masters, and a collection of curious books on all subjects relating to their art; and they had a skilful anatomist always ready to teach whatever belonged to the knitting and motions of the muscles, &c. There were often disputations in the academy; and not only painters, but men of learned professions, proposed questions which were always decided by Louis. Every body was well received; and though stated hours were allotted to treat of different matters, yet improvement might be made at all hours from the antiquities and the designs which were constantly to be seen.

The fame of the Caracci reaching Rome, Cardinal Farnese sent for Hannibal thither, to paint the gallery of his palace. Hannibal was the more willing to go, because he had a great desire to see Raphael’s works, with the antique statues and bas reliefs'. The taste which he formed there from the ancient sculpture, made him change his Bolognian manner for one more learned, but less natural in the design and in the colouring. Augustine followed Hannibal to assist him in his undertaking of the Farnese gallery; but the brothers not rightly agreeing, Farnese sent Augustine to the court of the Duke of Parma, where he died in the year 1602, being only forty-five years of age. His most celebrated piece of painting is that of the communion of St Jerome, in Bologna.

In the meanwhile, Hannibal continued working in the Farnese gallery at Rome; and, after inconceivable pains and care, finished the paintings in a style of perfection altogether unrivalled. He hoped that the cardinal would have rewarded him in some proportion to the excellence of his work, and the time it occupied, which was eight years; but he was disappointed. The cardinal, influenced by an ignorant Spaniard, his domestic, gave him little more than L.200, though it is certain he deserved more than twice as many thousands. When the money was brought him, he was so surprised at the injustice done him, that he could not speak a word to the person who brought it. This confirmed him in a melancholy to which his temper naturally inclined, and made him resolve never more to touch his pencil; which resolution he would undoubtedly have kept, if his necessities had not compelled him to break it. It is said that his melancholy gained so much upon him, that at certain times it deprived him of the use of his senses. It did not, however, put a stop to his amours; and his debauches at Naples, whither he retired for the recovery of his health, brought on a distemper of which he died in 1609, when he was only forty-nine years of age. His veneration for Raphael was so great, that his deathbed request was to be buried in the same tomb with him; which was accordingly done in the Pantheon or Rotunda at Rome. There are extant several prints of the blessed Virgin, and some other subjects etched by the hand of this incomparable artist. He is said to have been a friendly, plain, honest, open-hearted man; very communicative to his scholars, and so extremely kind to them, that he generally kept his money in the same box with his colours, where they might have recourse to either as they had occasion.

While Hannibal Caracci worked at Rome, Louis was courted from all parts of Lombardy, especially by the clergy, to paint pictures in their churches; and we may judge of his capacity and facility by the great number of pictures he executed, and by the preference that was given him over other painters. In the midst of these employments Hannibal solicited him to come and assist him in the Farnese gallery, and so earnestly, that he could not avoid complying with his request. He went to Rome, corrected several things in that gallery, painted a figure or two himself, and then returned to Bologna, where he died in 1619, aged sixty-four.
