CARO, Annibal, a celebrated Italian poet, was born at Civita Nuovo in 1507. He became secretary to the Duke of Parma, and afterwards to Cardinal Farnese. He was also made a knight of Malta. He translated Virgil’s Aeneid into his own language, and with such propriety and elegance of expression, that he was allowed by the best judges to have almost equalled the original. He also translated Aristotle’s rhetoric, two oratories of Gregory Nazianzen, and a discourse of Cyprian. He wrote a comedy; and a miscellany of his poems was printed at Venice in 1584. He died at Rome in 1566.
