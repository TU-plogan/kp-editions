CLACKMANNAN, the capital of the shire of the same name, is pleasantly situated on an eminence gently rising out of a plain stretching from east to west, to the height ofl90 feet above the level of the Forth. It consists of one long street, which runs up the acclivity to the gate of the park surrounding Clackmannan tower. This building is tall and impressive; but it is now deprived of the palace of Robert Bruce; and the family house of Bruce of Clackmannan, with the gardens which formerly adorned it, is unfurnished, and will probably go fast to decay, from the property of it being disputed. The church of Clackmannan, which is situated a little south of the principal street, is rather a handsome modern structure, in the Gothic style. The population amounted in 1821 to 4056, and in 1831 to 4266.
