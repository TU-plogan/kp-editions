CHIEF, a term signifying the head or principal part of a thing or person. Thus we say, the chief of a party, the chief of a family, and the like. The word is formed of the French chef, head, from the Greek κipaλjj, caput, head, though Menage derives it from the Indian capo, formed from the Latin caput. Chief, in Heraldry, is that which occupies all the upper part of the escutcheon from side to side, and represents[7:6:522] a man’s head. The phrase in chief, imports something borne in the chief part or top of the escutcheon.
