CHEESAPANY, a town and small fort in the Nepaul [7:6:340] territories. The fortress stands upon a perpendicular rock, 530 yards in height. The natural strength of its position is its chief defence, as it is not capable of containing more than 100 men. The village contains twenty houses; and there is here a custom-house, at which all goods passing from the British territories pay a duty. From a position about 120 yards above the fort the great Himalaya range is to be seen towering amid the regions of eternal snow. Long. 85. 30. E. Lat. 27. 23. N.
