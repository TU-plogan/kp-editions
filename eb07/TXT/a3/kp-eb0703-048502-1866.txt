ARIADNAEA, in Grecian Antiquity, two festivals at Naxos, in honour of two women named Ariadne. One of them being the daughter of King Minos, they had, in the solemnity dedicated to her, a show of sorrow and mourning; and, in memory of her being left by Theseus near the time of child-birth, it was usual for a young man to lie down and counterfeit all the agonies of a woman in labour. This festival is said to have been first instituted by Theseus, to atone for his ingratitude to that princess.â€”The other Ariadne was thought to be of a gay and sprightly temper, and therefore her festival was observed with music and other expressions of mirth and joy.
