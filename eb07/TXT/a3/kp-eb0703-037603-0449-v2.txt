ARBUSTUM implies a number or multitude of trees planted for the fruit’s sake. The word was more peculiarly applied to a place planted with trees for fastening vines to, which are hence called by Columella Arbustivae. Arbustum is sometimes also used to denote an orchard, or field wherein trees are planted at such distance that there is room for ploughing and growing corn between.
