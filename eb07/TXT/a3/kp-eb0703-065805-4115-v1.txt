ARUNDEL, a borough and market-town in the rape of the same name, in the county of Sussex, 57 miles from London. It is a well-built town, on the river Arun. Adjoining to it is the magnificent castle of the dukes of Norfolk, lately repaired and fitted up at a vast expense. The market is on a Saturday. It returns two members to Parliament, chosen by the householders, who commonly pay the compliment to the duke of Norfolk of accepting one on his recommendation. The population was, in 1801, 1855; in 1811, 2178; and in 1821, 2511.

Arundel, Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury in the reigns of Richard IL, Henry IV., and Henry V., was the second son of Robert, earl of Arundel and Warren, and brother of Richard, earl of Arundel, who was beheaded. At 22 years of age, from being created archbishop of Taunton, he was raised to the bishopric of Ely, on the 6th of April 1375, in the reign of Edward III. He was a great benefactor to the church and palace of this see: among other donations, he gave a curious table of massy gold, adorned with precious stones, which had been given by the king of Spain to Prince Edward, and sold by him to Bishop Arundel. In 1386 he was appointed lord chancellor of England; two years after he was translated to the see of York; and in 1396 was advanced to the archiépiscopal see of Canterbury, when he resigned the chancellorship. This was the first instance of the translation of an archbishop of York to the see of Canterbury. Scarcely was he fixed in this see, when he had a contest with the university of Oxford about the right of visitation. The affair was referred to King Richard, who determined it in favour of the archbishop. At his visitation in London he revived an old constitution, by which the inhabitants of the respective parishes were obliged to pay to their rector one halfpenny in the pound out of the rent of their houses. In the second’year of his translation, a parliament being held at London, the commons, with the king’s leave, impeached the archbishop, together with his brother the earl of Arundel, and the duke of Gloucester, of high treason. The archbishop was sentenced to be banished, and within forty days to depart the kingdom on pain of death. He retired, first to France, and then to the court of Rome, where Pope Boniface IX. gave him a kind reception. He was engaged in the plot to-depose Richard and place the duke of Lancaster on the throne; and re [7:3:659] turning to England along with him, he was restored to his see on that monarch’s accession. In the first year of this prince’s reign Arundel summoned a synod, which sat at St Paul’s. The next year the commons moved that the revenues of the church might be applied to the service of the public; but Arundel opposed the measure with such vigour that it was thrown aside. In the year 1408 Arundel began to exert himself against the Lollards or Wickliffites; and his zeal for suppressing that sect carried him to several unjustifiable severities against the heads of it, particularly against Sir John Oldcastle and Lord Cobham. He also procured a synodical constitution, which forbade the translation of the Scriptures into the vulgar tongue. This prelate died at Canterbury on the 20th February 1413, of an inflammation in his throat, with which he was seized, as is pretended, whilst he was pronouncing sentence upon Lord Cobham. He was buried in the cathedral church of Canterbury, near the west end, under a monument erected by himself in his lifetime.
