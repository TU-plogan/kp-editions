ARAUCANIA, a district of Chili, in South America, lying between 37° and 39° of south latitude. The Araucanians had a certain tincture of civilization, which was united with a high and unconquerable spirit of independence. They warred with the Spaniards for more than a century, and though often vanquished in the field, never would submit to them. Their government, according to Molina, was a sort of federal republic; and they had a nobility, and held national councils annually. The number of fighting men in the four districts which composed Araucania was about 7000 or 8000. They still enjoy their independence. See America.
