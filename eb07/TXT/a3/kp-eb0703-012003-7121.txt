ANDREAS, John, a celebrated canonist of the 14th century, was born at Magello, near Florence; and was professor of the canon law at Padua, Pisa, and afterwards at Bologna. He had a beautiful daughter, named Novella, whom he is said to have instructed so well in all parts of learning, that when he was engaged in any affair which hindered him from reading lectures to his scholars, he sent his daughter in his room; and, lest her beauty should prevent the attention of the hearers, she had a little curtain drawn before her. To perpetuate the memory of this daughter, he entitled his commentary upon the Decretals of Gregory IX. the Novellae. He married her to John Caldcrinus, a learned canonist. The first work of Andreas was his Gloss upon the Sixth Book of the Decretals, which he wrote when he was very young. He wrote also Glosses upon the Clementines; and a Commentary inRegulas Sexti, which he entitled Mercuriales, because he either engaged in it on Wednesdays (diebus Mercurii), or because he inserted his Wednesdayâ€™s disputes in it. He enlarged the Speculum of Durant in the year 1347. He died of the plague at Bologna in 1348, after he had been a professor 45 years, and was buried in the church of Dominicans.

Andreas, St, a market-town on the Danube, in the circle of Pilesch, and palatinate of Pest, in Hungary. It contains one Catholic and seven Greek churches, 1040 houses, and 7980 inhabitants, who trade very extensively in the wine produced in the vicinity. It is also the name of an island in the Danube, opposite to the town, which is fourteen miles in length and one in breadth, and remarkable for its great fertility.
