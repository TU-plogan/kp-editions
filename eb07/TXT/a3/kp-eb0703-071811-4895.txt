ASTERN, a sea phrase, used to signify any thing at some distance behind the ship; being the opposite of Ahead, which signifies the space before her.

-ASTI, a province of the duchy of Piedmont, in the [7:3:719]continental dominions of the king of Sardinia. It is bounded on the north-east and east by Alessandria, on the south-east by Aqui, on the south-west by Alba, and on the west and north-west by Turin. It extends over 400 square miles, or 256,000 acres. It is a plain, with gentle undulations, watered by the Tanaro and the Po; fruitful in all the productions of Italy, but more especially in corn, wine, and silk. It contains one city and 109 towns and villages, inhabited by 110,623 persons.

Asti, the capital of the above province, is a large and well-built town, standing on the left bank of the Tanaro, in Upper Italy. It is the see of a bishop, who is a suffragan of the archbishop of Turin. It contains many churches and monastical institutions, with 22,000 inhabitants, who carry on a considerable trade in corn, wine, and silk, which is not a little promoted by the situation of the town on the high road from Alessandria to Turin and Coni. 20 miles W. of Alessandria, and 24 E. of Turin.
