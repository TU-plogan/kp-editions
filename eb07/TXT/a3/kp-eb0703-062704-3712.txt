ARRAN, an island on the west coast of Scotland, near the mouth of the river Clyde, which forms part of the county of Bute. It is about 20 miles in length by from 8 to 11 in breadth, and contains a superficial area of 165 square miles, or 105,814 acres, of which about 14,431 are cultivated. This island is of an extremely rugged and mountainous surface, particularly in the northern part, in which the valleys are deep and romantic. The principal mountain is Goatfell,,which rises, according to accurate measurement, 2685 feet above the level of the sea, and is clothed with lichens and mosses. A few others approach to the same elevation. There are five small lakes in the island, from which two streams have their source. The quadrupeds are not numerous. There are a few red deer, the remains of a numerous breed, which are said still to find shelter among the mountains; and wild goats are still harboured in those parts. The cattle and sheep, which were formerly small, have been improved by the introduction of a larger breed. The birds are eagles, hooded crows, plovers, curlews, black cock, and other species of grouse, which are exceedingly numerous in the mountains. Ptarmagans, which were formerly seen, have now disappeared. Limestone, marl, and slate, are found in different parts, and there are also indications of coal; while in the mountains are found marble, jasper, agates; cairngorms, and a fine species of rock-crystal called the Arran diamond. Shoals of herring frequent the shores, and the herring fishery is prosecuted to a great extent. 'No less than 200 fishing vessels, well manned and properly fitted out, and belonging to the island, are employed in it. Arran has two remarkably fine harbours, Lamlash on the east side, and Loch Ranza on the other. Formerly the style of agriculture was extremely rude and imperfect; but the improved system has now been adopted in all its branches. Most of the high land was at one time a common, on which the cattle of all the tenants was indiscriminately pastured. The whole of the cultivated land is now subdivided and inclosed, and the hills laid out in sheep-walks. Flax is cultivated in small quantities, and linens and some woollens are manufactured. With the exception of a few farms, the whole island belongs to the Duke of Hamilton, who has very lately begun to take an interest in its improvement, and expended a considerable sum in making roads, bridges, and small harbours. It has several castles of great antiquity; one, the castle of Brodick, which was garrisoned by Sir J. Hawkins in the reign of Edward II.; another at Lochvanza, built by Robert II. as a hunting seat. Population 6754.
