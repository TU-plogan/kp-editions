ARNAULD, Antony, a very celebrated doctor of the Sorbonne, was born in 1612. He published in 1643 A Treatise on Frequent Communion, which highly displeased the Jesuits; and the disputes upon grace, which broke out about this time in the university of Paris, and in which he took a zealous part with the Jansenists, helped to increase tlιe animosity between him and the Jesuits. But nothing raised so great a clamour against him as the two letters he wrote On Absolution ; in the second of which the faculty of divinity found two propositions which they condemned, and Μ. Arnauld was expelled the society. Upon this he retired; and during a retreat which lasted nearly twenty-five years, he composed that great variety of works which are still extant, on grammar, geometry, logic, metaphysics, and theology. In 1679 he withdrew from France, lived in obscurity in the Netherlands, and died in 1694. His heart, at his own request, was sent to be deposited in the Port Royal. Arnauld was a man of genius, remarkable for the strength of his memory and a command of his pen, which he possessed unimpaired to the last year of his life. Mr Bayle says, he had been told by persons who had been admitted into his familiar conversation, that he was a man very simple in his manners; and that unless any one proposed some question to him, or desired some information, he said nothing that was beyond common conversation, or that might make one take him for a man of great abilities; but when he set himself to give an answer to such as proposed a point of learning, he seemed as it were transformed into another man: he would then deliver a multitude of fine things with great perspicuity and learning. A complete collection of his works, extending to 45 vols. 4to, was published at Lausanne in 1777-83.
