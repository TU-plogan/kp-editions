AR SENIUS, a deacon of the Roman church, of great learning and piety. He was appointed by the pope to go to the emperor Theodosius, as tutor to his son Arcadius. Arsenius arrived at Constantinople in the year 383. The emperor happening one day to go into the room where he was instructing Arcadius, his son was seated and the preceptor standing. At this he was exceedingly displeased, took from his son the imperial ornaments, made Arsenins sit in his place, and ordered Arcadius for the future to receive his lessons standing uncovered. Arcadius, however, profited little by his tutorâ€™s instructions, for some time after he formed a design of dispatching him. The officer to whom Arcadius had applied for this purpose divulged the affair to Arsenius, who retired to the deserts of Scete, where he passed many years in the exercises of the most strict and fervent devotion. He died there, at 95 years of age.
