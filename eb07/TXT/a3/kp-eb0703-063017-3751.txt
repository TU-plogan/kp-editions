ARTABA, an ancient measure of capacity used by the [7:3:631] Persians, Medes, and Egyptians. The Persian artaba is represented by Herodotus as larger than the Attic medimnus by three Attic choenixes: from which it appears that it was equal to 6∣ Roman modii; consequently it contained 166^ pounds of wine or water, or 126∣∙ pounds of wheat. The Egyptian artaba contained five Roman modii, and fell short of the Attic medimnus by one modius; it consequently held 1331 pounds of water or wine, or 100 pounds of wheat.
