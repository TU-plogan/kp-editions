ANTITRINITARIANS, those who deny the Trinity, and teach that there are not three persons in the Godhead. Thus the Samosatenians, who do not believe the distinction of persons in God; the Arians, who deny the divinity of the Word; and the Macedonians, who deny that of the Holy Spirit, are all properly Antitrinitarians. Among the moderns, Antitrinitarians are particularly understood of Socinians, called also Unitarians.

The Bibliotheca Antitrinitariorum, or Antitrinitarian Library, is a posthumous work of Christopher Sandius, an eminent Antitrinitarian, in which he gives a list, digested in order of time, of all the Socinian or modern Antitrinitarian authors, with a brief account of their lives, and a catalogue of their works.
