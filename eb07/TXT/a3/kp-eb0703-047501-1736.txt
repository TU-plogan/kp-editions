ARCHITRICLINUS, in Antiquity, the master or director of a feast, charged with the order and economy of it, the covering and uncovering of the tables, the command of the servants, and the like. The architriclinus was sometimes called servus tricliniarcha, and by the Greeks π1ογιo<sτr ∖ ς, i. e. proegustator or foretaster. Potter also takes the architriclinus for the same with the sym-posiarcha.
