APOSTOLICI, or Apo sÏ„oLies, was a name assumed by three different sects, on account of their pretending to imitate the manner and practice of the apostles. The first a postolici, otherwise called Apotactitae and Apotactici, rose out of the Encratitae and Cathari in the third century. They made profession of abstaining from marriage, and the use of wine, flesh, money, &c. Gerhard Sagarelli was the founder of the second sect: he obliged his followers to go from place to place as the apostles did, to wander about clothed in white, with long beards, dishevelled hair, and bare heads, accompanied with women, whom they called their spiritual sisters. They likewise renounced all kinds of property and possessions, inveighed against the growing corruption of the church of Rome, and predicted its overthrow, and the establishment of a purer church on its ruins. Sagarelli was burnt alive at Parma in the year 1300, and was afterwards succeeded by Dul-cinus, who added to the character of an apostle that of a prophet and of a general, and carried on a bloody and dreadful war for the space of more than two years against Reynerius, bishop of Vercelli: he was at length defeated, and put to death in a barbarous manner, in the year 1307. Nevertheless, the sect subsisted in France, Germany, and other countries, till the beginning of the 15th century, when it was totally extirpated under the pontificate of Boniface IX. The other branch of apostolici was of the 12th century. These also condemned marriage, preferring celibacy, and calling themselves the chaste brethren and sisters; though each was allowed a spiritual sister, with whom he lived in a domestic relation; and on this account they have been charged with concubinage. They held it unlawful to take an oath, they set aside the use of baptism, and in many things imitated the Manichees. Bernard wrote against this sect of apostolici.
