ASCETIC, an ancient appellation given to such persons as, in the primitive times, devoted themselves more immediately to the exercises of piety and virtue in a retired life, and particularly to prayer, abstinence, and mortification. The word is derived from α<ixtω, exerceo, I exercise. Afterwards, when the monks came in fashion, this title was bestowed upon them, especially upon such of them as lived in solitude.
