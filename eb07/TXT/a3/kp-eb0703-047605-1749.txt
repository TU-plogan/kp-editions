ARCONA, a strong town situated on the island of Rugen in the Baltic. It stood on a high promontory, with the east, north, and south sides defended by steep and lofty precipices, and the west by a wall 50 feet high, proportionably thick, and secured by a deep and broad ditch. It was, however, taken and ruined in 1168, by Valdemar, king of Denmark.
