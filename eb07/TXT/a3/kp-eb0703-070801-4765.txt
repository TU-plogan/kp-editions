ASSARIUM, in Antiquity, denotes a small copper coin, being a part or diminutive of the as. The word atfiaj∕o⅛ is used by Suidas indifferently with oβολoς and wμι<sμα, to denote a small piece of money; in which he is followed by Cujacius, who defines a<Soayov by minimus aeris nurnrnus∙ We find mention of the assarium in the gospel of St Matthew, chap. x. ver. 29.
