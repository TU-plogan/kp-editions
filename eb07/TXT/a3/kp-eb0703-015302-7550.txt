ANGORA, Angura, or Ankora, a city of Asia in Anatolia, the ancient Ancyra, situated on a stream called abana. It is large an ; neatly built, and its streets are causewayed with large blocks of granite, but have no footpaths. Its position is lofty and imposing, surrounded by mountains, with numerous gardens which yield the finest fruits. The city was celebrated in the ancient world for its fine edifices; and it still contains the remains of its former grandeur. In its streets are to be seen pillars, some of porphyry, and jasper, and fine marbles. The city has been encompassed by a substantial wall, apparently double in some places, formed of durable stone. Some of the gates exhibit Greek inscriptions, and the masonry is intermixed with pillars, architraves, capitals, and other ancient ornaments. The vestiges of an amphitheatre are still to be seen, and the ruins of a magnificent coria or senate-house, of Corinthian architecture, with inscriptions complimentary to Augustus, in whose reign Angora was built. The inhabitants are distinguished in Natolia for their polished manners: they consist of Mahometans and Christians, there being 9000 of the latter, who are subjected to grievous tyranny and exactions from the former. The Christians have a Greek and an Arminian archbishop, and seven churches. Although the trade and population of this place have declined, a great quantity of yarn, Angora stuffs, and shawls, are still manufactured. The shawls, which rival those of Cashmere, are fabricated from the hair of the Angora goat, which is of a fine silken texture. The soil of the adjacent territory is entirely employed in rearing these animals; and the city is supplied with grain from a distance. This city was constituted the capital of Galatia by Nero. It was taken by the Saracens, and afterwards by Tamerlane in 1402, after the battle in which Bajazet was overthrown. The population, which was formerly 80,000, does not now exceed 20,000. 212 miles E. S. E. of Constantinople. Long. 33. 18. E. Lat. 40. 4. N.
