ARUSPICES, or Haruspices, in Homan Antiquity, an order of priests who pretended to foretel future events by inspecting the entrails of victims killed in sacrifice; they were also consulted on occasion of portents and prodigies. The aruspices were also chosen from the best families; [7:3:662]and as their employment was of the same nature as that of the augurs, they were as much honoured. Their college, as well as those of the other religious orders, had its particular registers and records.
