ANTIGRAPHUS, in Antiquity, an officer of Athens, who kept a counterpart of the apodecti, or chief treasurer’s accounts, to prevent mistakes, and keep them from being falsified.

Antigraphus is used by writers in the middle ages for [7:3:251] I a secretary or chancellor. He is thus called, according to the old glossarists, on account of his writing answers to the letters sent to his master. The antigraphus is sometimes also called archigraphus, and his dignity αntigra-plιiα or archigraphia. Antigraphus is also applied by ecclesiastical writers to an abbreviator of the papal letters·; in which sense the word is used by Pope Gregory the Great in his register.
