ANOLYMPIADES, in Antiquity, a name given by the Elians to those Olympic games which had been celebrated under the direction of the Pisaeans and Arcadians. The Elians claimed the sole right of managing the Olympic games, in which they sometimes met with competitors. The hundred and fourth Olympiad was celebrated by order of the Arcadians, by whom the Elians were at that time reduced very low. This, as well as those managed by the inhabitants of Pisa, they called avoau∕z- <παδας, that is, unlawful Olympiads; and left them out of their annals, wherein the names of their victors and remarkable occurrences were registered.
