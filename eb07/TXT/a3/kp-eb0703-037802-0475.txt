ARCESILAUS, a celebrated Greek philosopher, about 300 years before the Christian era, was born at Pitane, i‚àè Eolis. He founded the second academy, called the second or middle school. He was a man of great erudition, and had many disciples. The middle school laid it down as a principle, that we could know nothing, nor even assure ourselves of the certainty of this position; from whence they inferred, that we should affirm nothing, but always suspend our judgment. They advanced, that a philosopher was able to dispute upon every subject, and bring conviction with him, even upon contrary sides of the same question; for there are always reasons of equal force both in the affirmative and negative of every argument. According to this doctrine, neither our senses nor even our reason are to have any credit; and, therefore, in common affairs, we are to conform outSelves to received opinions. Arcesilaus was succeeded by his disciple Lacydes.
