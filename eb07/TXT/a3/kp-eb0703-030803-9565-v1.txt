APPEAL, in Law, the removal of a cause from an inferior to a superior court or judge, when a person thinks himself aggrieved by the sentence of the inferior judge. Appeals lie from the ordinary courts of justice to the house of lords. In ecclesiastical cases, ií an appeal is brought before a bishop, it may be removed to the archbishop; if before an archdeacon, to the court of arches, and thence to the archbishop; and from the archbishop s court to the king in chancery. .
