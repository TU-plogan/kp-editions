ARARAT, a lofty mountain of Armenia, which rises from the adjacent plain to the height of 9500 feet, lt has two peaks covered with perpetual snow, which, viewed from the north, are seen to be separated by a deep glcn in the body of the mountain. From the slope of this deep cleft the lesser head rises in a perfectly conical shape. The larger peak is of the same form, only-more rounded at the top; and the north-west face of the mountain is broken and abrupt, and opens half-way down into a stupendous rocky chasm of great depth, and peculiarly black. Many travellers have attempted to scale the summit of this tremendous mountain. But the distance between the commencement of the perpetual snow line and the summit, and the long-continued cold to which the traveller would consequently bc exposed, baffled for a long time all such hazardous attempts. Lately, however, a German traveller, accompanied by a companion, accomplished this daring feat, and attained the snowy summit, on which no human foot had ever trod before. The mountain is held in peculiar veneration by the Armenian Christians, from the belief that Noah’s ark after the flood rested on its summits. It is evidently of volcanic origin; but Dr Reinegg’s assertion, that an eruption occurred in 1783, is totally devoid of foundation. This fact was ascertained by Sir R. K. Porter from the priests of a neighbouring monastery, where an account was kept of the appearances exhibited by the monastery for several centuries back.
