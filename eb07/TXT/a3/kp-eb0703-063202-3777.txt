ARTIFICER, a person who works in iron, brass, wood, &c. such as smiths, brasiers, carpenters, &ć. The Roman artificers had their peculiar temples, where they assembled and chose their own patron to defend their causes; and they were exempted from all personal services. Tarun-tenus Paternus reckons 32 species of artificers, and Constantine 35, who enjoyed this privilege. The artificers were incorporated into divers colleges or companies, each of which had their tutelar gods, to whom they offered their worship. Several of these, when they quitted their profession, hung up their tools, a votive offering to their gods. Artificers were held a degree below merchants and argentarii or money-changers, and their employment more sordid. Some deny that in the earliest ages of the Roman state artificers were ranked in the number of citizens; others, who assert their citizenship, allow that they were held in contempt, as being unfit for war, and so poor that they could scarcely pay any taxes; for which reason they were not entered among the citizens in the censor’s books; the design of the census being only to see what number of persons were yearly fit to bear arms and to pay taxes towards the support of the state. It may be added, that much of the artificers’ business was done by slaves and foreigners, who left little for the Romans to mind but their husbandry and war.
