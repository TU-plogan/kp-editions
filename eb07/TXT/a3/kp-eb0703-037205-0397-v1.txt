ARAFAT, Mount, a celebrated mountain in Arabia, held in high veneration by the Mahometans. A visit to this mountain constitutes a necessary part of the religious pilgrimage to Mecca; which we have described at [7:3:373] length under the article Arabia. The mountain consists ' 0 f a σranite rock about 150 fcet high, which is ascended by staircases, partly cut in the rock and partly composed of solid masonry. On the summit is a.chapel, which the Mahometans believe to have been built by Adam. On this hill also Adam is said to have met his wife Eve after a lon° ’ absence; and it is thence called Arafat or Gratitude* The interior of the chapel was destroyed by the Wahabys in 1807.
