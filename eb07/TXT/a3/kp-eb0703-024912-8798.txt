ANTIDORON, in ecclesiastical writers, a name given by the Greeks to the consecrated bread, out of which the middle part, marked with the cross, wherein the consecration resides, being taken away by the priest, the remainder is distributed after mass to the poor. On the sides of the antidoron are impressed the words Jesus Christus vicit. The word is formed from δωgoν, donum, a gift, as being given away loco muneris, or in charity. The antidoron is also called panis praesanctificatus.
