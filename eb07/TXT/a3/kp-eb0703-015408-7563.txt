ANHALT-DESSAU, an independent sovereignty in Germany, with the title of duchy. It takes the first name from the family that governs it, and the second from the chief place in the territory. The greater part lies in a compact manner on the left bank of the Elbe, and on both sides of the Mulde. The other parts are scattered and separated from each other by the dominions of other princes. It is in general a level country, and the compact part on the left bank of the Elbe is cultivated with great care, and yields abundant produce; and though, in the scattered parts on the right bank of that river, there are some heaths and a poorer soil, yet the whole produces sufficient necessaries for its dense population. The whole duchy is divided into 15 amts or bailiwicks. Its extent is 363 square miles, or 232,320 English acres. The number of inhabitants in 1817 amounted to 52,947, living in 8 cities, 2 markettowns, and 115 villages and hamlets. The almost exclusive employment is husbandry, except that the females spin both linen and woollen yarn. All kinds of grain are raised. Flax, rapeseed and its oil, hops, madder, fruit, especially apples, wood, butter, cheese, game, and fish, are conveyed to the great markets of Berlin and Leipsic, and constitute the external trade. With the exception of 1200 Jews and two Catholic congregations, the whole of the inhabitants are Protestants, with ,32 reformed and 21 Lutheran churches. The revenue of the state amounts to L.70,000 annually, of which the personal domains of the duke produce L.20,000; the remainder arises from his feudal dues, and from some moderate taxesì It has no debt, and is the most favoured part of Germany. 1 Though it suffered dreadfully by the war in the year 1813, it was enabled very speedily to recover from its losses, by the productive qualities of its soil, and* the parsimonious industry of its cultivators. The whole military force is nominally 600 men, but scarcely an eighth are ’ mustered at any one time. (g.)
