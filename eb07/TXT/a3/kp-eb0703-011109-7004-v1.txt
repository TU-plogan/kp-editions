ANDERSON, Alexander, a very eminent mathematician, who flourished in the early part of the 17th century. He was born at Aberdeen, but passed over to the Continent, and settled as a private teacher or professor of mathematics at Paris, where he published or edited, between the years 1612 and 1619, various geometrical and algebraical tracts, which are conspicuous for their ingenuity and elegance. It is doubtful whether he was ever acquainted with the famous Vieta, master of requests at Paris, who died in 1603; but his pure taste and skill in mathematical investigation had pointed him out to the executors of that illustrious man, who had found leisure, in the intervals of a laborious profession, to cultivate and extend the ancient geometry, and, by adopting a system of general symbols, to lay the foundation and begin the superstructure of algebraical science, as the person most proper for revising and publishing his valuable manuscripts. Anderson did not come forward, however, as a mere editor; he enriched the texts with learned comments, and gave neat demonstrations of those propositions which had been left imperfect. He afterwards produced a specimen of the application of geometrical analysis, which is distinguished by its clearness and classic elegance.

Of this able geometer we are ignorant both of the time of his birth and of his death. His brother David Anderson[7:3:112], a small proprietor in Aberdeenshire, but engaged in business, had likewise a strong turn for mathematics and mechanics, which, joined to great versatility of talent, made him be regarded by his neighbours at that period as a sort of oracle. The daughter of this clever and active burgess was married to John Gregory, minister of Drumoak, in that county, father to the celebrated James Gregory, inventor of the reflecting telescope; and is supposed to have communicated to her children that taste for mathematical learning which afterwards shone forth so remarkably in the family of the Gregorys.

The works of Anderson amount to six thin quarto volumes, which are now very scarce. These are,

1. Supplementum Apollonii Redivivi; sive, Analysis problematis hactenus desiderati ad Apollonii Pergaei doctrinam <7! , iζi vtuđíMv, a Marino Ghetaldo Patritio Ragu-sino hucusque non ita pridem restitutam.

This tract refers to the problem of inclinations, by which, in certain cases, the application of the curve called the conchoid is superseded.

Parisiis, 1619, 4to. (b.) Anderson, Sir Edmund, a younger son of an ancient Scotish family settled in Lincolnshire. He was some time a student of Lincoln College, Oxford, and removed from thence to the Inner Temple, where he applied himself diligently to the study of the law, and became a barrister. In 1582 he was made lord chief justice of the common pleas, and in the year following was knighted. He held his office to the end of his life in 1605. His works are, 1. Reports of many principal Cases argued and adjudged in the time of Queen Elizabeth in the Common Bench, Lond. 1644, fol.; 2. Resolutions and Judgments on the cases and matter agitated in all courts of Westminster in the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Lond. 1655, 4to.

Anderson, James, LL. D. The subject of this article, who has been brought into notice principally from the more recent encouragement given to agriculture, and the versatility of his own genius, was born at the village of Hermiston, in the county of Edinburgh, in the year 1739. His parents were in humble life, and had possessed a farm for some generations, which he was destined to inherit and to cultivate. At that period improvement was in infancy, and the husbandman had to contend with a climate whose uncertainty seemed to keep pace with the progress of his skill, and which too often disappointed him of the fruits of his industry. Anderson, while yet at an early age, lost his parents: however, his education was uninterrupted; and conceiving that an acquaintance with chemistry would promote his profession, he attended a course of lectures on that science, then delivered by Dr Cullen. None of the other pupils besides himself took notes of his lectures, which being afterwards surreptitiously obtained from him, with the design of publication, he defeated the intended purpose, apprehensive that his preceptor’s fame might be diminished by these imperfect transcripts. His own active occupations had already commenced, and, along with the practice of husbandry, he prosecuted his original taste for literature.

Enlarging the sphere of his employments, Anderson forsook his first possession, for a farm of 1300 acres, which he rented in Aberdeenshire, though nearly in a state of nature, and where agriculture is still behind the southern districts. But previous to this he became known to men of letters, by some essays on planting, which, under the signature Agricola, he ventured to commit to the world through the medium of the Edinburgh Weekly Magazine, in 1771. Soon embarking in a higher sphere of literature, he composed the article Monsoon for the first edition of this Encyclopaedia, in 1773, wherein he threw out some luminous ideas, and, among other observations, predicted from physical facts, and the state of geographical knowledge, that no polar continent would be found by the circumnavigators then employed by government. In the year 1777 he published a considerable quarto volume, said to have been composed two years preceding, on the means of exerting a spirit of national industry with regard to agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and fisheries; and in this he enters into detailed views of many subjects of political economy. The interest of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland is in a particular manner considered; and the author maintains, that the only effectual means of increasing agriculture is by promoting manufactures; as also, that the neglect∙which the agriculture of these parts of the kingdom experienced, resulted from the neglect of manufactures. Scotland, he affirms, is better adapted than England for the production of wool; and this, as well as other products, he thought, would be best encouraged by premiums. The advantages which might result from attending to the fisheries, he judged, would be very great, and the shoals of herrings frequenting the coast could be converted into a source of national wealth under suitable establishments. Anderson, who soon after had die degree of doctor of laws conferred on him by the University of Aberdeen, did not abandon these inquiries. He printed a tract regarding the fisheries, which was circulated among his friends; and, in consequence of being more widely diffused, he was appointed by the Lords of the Treasury to survey the western coast of Scotland, for the purpose of obtaining satisfactory information on the subject. This he did in 1784, and received the full approbation of his employers; and he published a brief account of the Hebrides, a chain of islands then as little within the general acquaintance of the inhabitants of Great Britain as if they had been under the dominion of another country. The principal obstacles to the fishery, Dr Anderson considered, were to be found in a duty on salt and coals, and he recommended the repeal of both. It is certain that, from thenceforward, this great branch of national industry has received infinitely more patronage than before his report, and, while we only shared the labours of the Dutch for centuries, the fisheries on our own coast have since been monopolized by ourselves. Nothing[7:3:113] can be more impolitic than to fetter the exertions of the industrious by exorbitant duties, or equally oppressive with denying fuel to the poorer classes, where it is scarce, by duties on its importation.

Dr Anderson had now withdrawn from his northern farm, where he resided above 20 years, and settled in the vicinity of Edinburgh. His agricultural speculations were still continued; and when a parliamentary grant was about to be proposed to Mr Elkington for a particular mode of draining land, he reclaimed the practice as having been observed by himself many years anterior. Repeated examples, indeed, prove that the rewards granted by Parliament for improvement are attended with such slight investigations, that the merits of real invention are overlooked. Dr Anderson now projected a periodical publication called The Bee, consisting of miscellaneous original matter, which attained the extent of 18 volumes in octavo. It was published weekly, and a large proportion of it came from his own pen, which is seldom a prudent course in an editor. The relation of Great Britain and her colonies, and the political rights of mankind—subjects which had excited strong interests throughout Europe—also received some commentaries from Dr Anderson. He wrote a tract called The Interest of Great Britain with respect to her Colonies, and commenced a correspondence with General Washington, which was afterwards published.

Towards the year 1797 he again removed to Islesworth, in the neighbourhood of London, where he undertook another periodical publication, appearing at more distant intervals than the former, entitled Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History, Arts, and Miscellaneous Literature. This work was prefaced by two copious dissertations, the one on agriculture, the other on natural history; and opened with a discussion regarding a very curious and important subject, namely, an inquiry into what are denominated varieties in plants and animals. Many useful and interesting remarks appear in the course of this publication, a portion of which was supplied by other contributors; and it is embellished by beautiful vignettes from engravings on wood. Owing to some difficulties attending the publication, it ceased in 1802. Though natural history is rather predominant, the rest of his leading subjects are not overlooked. Dr Anderson henceforward lived in a great measure in retirement, though occasionally reminding the world of his wonted inquiries, by the publication of tracts on unconnected subjects. He obtained a patent for an improved hot-house, wherein no fuel was used; and employed himself in experiments regarding the degree of temperature and humidity most beneficial to plants. Likewise, having observed the uncommon depredations of wasps, he is said, after satisfying himself of their manner of increase, to have devised a plan for their absolute extermination. This was chiefly by the destruction of the females before founding their respective colonies by the depositation of innumerable eggs; and hand-bills were circulated under the auspices of an association formed by him, offering a reward for every female brought in dead within a specified time. It does not appear, however, that the breed was at all diminished by the proposed expedient.

Dr Anderson still remained in his retreat, enjoying the cultivation of his garden; and nothing of importance is known to have proceeded from his pen. After a gradual decline, partly occasioned by the over-exertion of the mental.energies, he died in the year 1808, aged 69. He was twice married; first, to Miss Seton of Mounie; secondly» to an English lady. By his first marriage he had thirteen children, six of whom survived him. One of his sons made distinguished progress in the art of engraving on wood; and, if the vignettes of the Recreations in Agriculture were executed by him, they afford ample testimony of his abilities.

Dr Anderson was endowed with a vigorous understanding, which he chiefly displayed in treating of agricultural matters, and those connected with rural economy; but he was at the same time of a versatile talent, which could readily be occupied on transient facts and occurrences. Many of his works were of a fugitive nature, consisting of small impressions, which were not renewed, and hence are difficult to be obtained at present, if they have not totally disappeared. None of them soars to the more lofty regions of science; they are directed to practical views in useful projects, and for the most part relate to subjects of ordinary detail. Of this the reader will be enabled to judge by the subjoined list, which we believe is the most copious that has yet appeared. The industry of Dr Anderson was indefatigable, whether in personal exertion or mental energy; and he possessed elevated sentiments of independence. During a period of overstrained political fervour, certain papers formed part of the periodical works already referred to, which were thought libellous on the government. Although Dr Anderson’s principles were noted for attachment to the existing administration, he was called upon to give up the author of the obnoxious compositions, which he steadily refused, and, even in the face of the civil magistrates, charged his printers not to violate their fidelity to him and the author in betraying his name. The business terminated here, until a factious individual insinuated to the same magistrates that the compositions had proceeded from one of the supreme judges, whose party politics were avowedly hostile to those of government. Dr Anderson having learned the reproach, hastened to relieve the object of it by divulging the name of the real author, who, to the universal surprise of the public, proved to be none other than the traducer himself.

Dr Anderson, besides, wrote many papers in periodical publications, and an account of Ancient Fortifications in the Highlands, read to the Society of Scotish Antiquaries.

Anderson, Robert, the fourth son of William Anderson, and of Margaret Melrose his wife, was born at Carnwath in Lanarkshire on the 7th of January 1750. His father was a feuar, that is, a person who possessed some small parcels of real property by the tenure of a perpetual lease. Having received the earlier part of his education in his native town and in the adjacent village of Libberton, he was afterwards placed under the tuition of Robert Thomson, master Of Lanark school, who had married a sister of Thomson the poet, and who has been commended for his uncommon proficiency in classical learning. Excellence however is always a relative term; nor must it be forgotten that the grammar schools of Scotland had about that period descended to their very lowest level. James Graeme, a native of the same town, was his companion and friend at all these seminaries: he appears to have been an amiable young man of promising talents, and to have been imbued with the love of literature. One of their school-fellows at Lanark was John Pinkerton, who afterwards became a conspicuous member of the republic of letters.

Anderson's father had died in 1759, in the 40th year of his age, leaving his widow with a very slender provision. Uniting considerable energy of character with a large share of piety, she made a vigorous effort to educate her four sons; and as she survived till the year 1796, she had the satisfaction of seeing one of them arrive at independence and distinction. Having discovered an early taste for reading, he soon made choice of one of the liberal professions. His first destination was for the church: in the year 1767 he was sent to the university of Edinburgh, and in due time was enrolled among the students of divinity.. Graeme, who had entered the university at the same time and with the same views, died of consumption in 1772, in the 23d year of his age; and, after a short interval, his faithful friend published a collection of Poems on several occasions, by James Graeme. Edinb. 1773, 12mo. These poems he inserted in the 11th volume of the. British Poets, together with an account of the author, in which his literary merits are estimated, not with the discrimination of sober criticism, but with all the partiality of friendly zeal. About this period he relinquished the study of divinity, and betook himself to the study of medicine. He was for a short time employed' as surgeon to the dispensary at Bamborough Castle in Northumberland; and in a neighbouring town he then formed connections which had no small influence on his future destiny. On the 25th of September 1777 he married Anne, the daughter of John Grey, Esq. of Alnwick, who was related to the noble family of that name. Returning to Scotland, he took the degree of Μ. D. at St Andrews on the 20th of May 1778, after having been duly examined by the professor of physic. He now began to practise as a physician at Alnwick; but his general habits were radier those of speculation than exertion, and a moderate provision, acquired by his marriage, had emancipated him from the necessity of professional labour. In 1784 he finally returned to Edinburgh, where he continued to reside for the period of 46 years, in a condition of life removed from affluence, but perfectly compatible with genuine independence and comfort. He possessed the valuable secret of living within his income; and his house was long distinguished by a hearty and unostentatious hospitality. His amiable and affectionate wife died of consumption on the 25th of December 1785, in the 39th year of her age, leaving three daughters, the youngest of whom speedily followed her mother to the grave. He did not resume the practice of physic, but being satisfied with his moderate acquisitions, he devoted much of his time to the education of his two children, and to miscellaneous and desultory reading, rather than to any systematical course of study. In 1793, after having remained a widower for eight years, he married Margaret, the daughter of Mr David Dall, master of Yester school in the county of Haddington.

For several years his attention was occupied with his edition of The Works of the British Poets, with Prefaces biographical and critical, which was published at Edinburgh, and extends to 14 large octavo volumes. The earliest volume, which is now the second in the series, was printed in 1792-3; the 13th was printed in 1795, and another volume was added in 1807. He was frequently solicited to revise his Lives of the Poets, and publish them in a separate form; but after having collected some materials for such a work, he finally abandoned the design. In the mean time he had published The Miscellaneous Works of Tobias Smollett, Μ. D. with Memoirs of his Life and Writings. Edinb. 1796, 6 vols. 8vo. The sixth edition of this collection was printed in the year 1820. Of his account of the ingenious author, the eighth separate edition appeared under the title of The Life of Tobias Smollett, M.D. with critical Observations on his Works. Edinb. 1818, 8vo. But the most able and elaborate of his productions is the third edition of his Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D. with critical Observations on his Works. Edinb. 1815, 8vo. The same service which he rendered to Dr Smollett he afterwards extended to Dr Moore, having published The Works of John Moore, Μ. D. with Memoirs of his Life and Writings. Edinb. 1820, 7 vols. 8vo. At an earlier period he had published The Poetical Works of Robert Blair ; containing the Grave, and a Poem to tke Memory of Mr Law : to which is prefixed the Life of ŵ Author. Lond. 1794, 8vo. And his latest publication was The Grave, and other Poems, by Robert Blair: to which are prefixed, some Account of his Life, and Observations on his Writings. Edinb. 1826, 12mo.

Dr Anderson contributed his ready aid to many different publications, and was always influenced, not by the love of moneyļ'but by the love of literature. With many emine∏t mcn in England, Ireland, and America, he maintained ∙ a literary correspondence; and having survived most of his lettered contemporaries, he enjoyed the [7:3:115] esteem and consideration of a second and even of a third 'generation. In 1802, 1809, and 1810, he paid three long visits to Dr Percy, the late excellent Bishop of Dromore; and he likewise enjoyed the friendship of Dr Ledwich, Dr Ryan, Mr Boyd, Mr Cooper Walker, and many other literary men of the sister island. No part of his character was more conspicuous than his uniform and unabating zeal to promote the success of young men who discovered any promise, however moderate, of literary talent; and some of the more distinguished writers of our own age and nation were not without their obligations to his disinterested friendship. Mr Campbell dedicated to him his earliest and most popular publication, The Pleasures oj Hope. Miss Bannerman, a very ingenious and accomplished lady, who died at Portobello on the 29th of September 1829, dedicated to him her first collection of Poems. Edinb. 1800, 8vo. Thomas Brown, John Leyden, and Alexander Murray, who all died at too early an age, were among the most eminent of his young friends. For Dr Brown, who became professor of moral philosophy in the university of Edinburgh, he entertained a very cordial esteem, which suffered no abatement or interruption. Another prominent feature of his mind, was his ardent regard for the civil and religious liberties of mankind. This characteristic he displayed from the first years of manhood till the last day of his earthly existence; and, on the very evening before his death, he gave a signal proof of his unquenchable zeal, by sending for a map of Greece, in order, as he expressed himself, to form some notion of the general elements of this new state. His principles were those of a very decided Whig; and, during the extraordinary excitement which attended the close of the last century, he was sometimes misrepresented as little better than a republican. The honest alarm of one class of individuals, and the hollow zeal of another, had a strong tendency to confound all nice distinctions.

His bodily frame had never been robust; but the uniform temperance and regularity of his habits contributed to prolong a life which was marked by cheerfulness and benevolence. His faculties, mental and corporeal, betrayed few or no symptoms of old age. During the greater part of his last winter he was confined to his own house by what was considered as a common cold, and was attended by his friend and contemporary Dr Hamilton. His lungs however seemed to be affected in an unusual manner; and, five days before his dissolution, his physician discovered that dropsy in the chest had supervened. As he had now reached a very advanced age, he indulged not even the faintest hope of recovery. Though his chief or only suffering proceeded from difficulty of respiration, the progress of his malady was swift and certain: but the native alacrity of his mind seemed incapable of diminution; and maintaining much and varied conversation during the last days, and indeed during the last hours of his life, he evinced more than his usual continuity of thought and accuracy of expression. As the vital tide was rapidly receding, his heart seemed to expand with new kindness towards all those who approached his couch. Of the immediate prospect of death he spoke, not merely witlι resignation, but even with cheerfulness; with the subdued but confident hope of one who had long and habitually reposed on the assurances of the Christian faith. He died on Saturday the 20th of February 1830, after having completed the 80th year of his age; and, ; according to his own directions, lχjs remains were interred in Camwath churchyard. His eldest daughter, Anne Margaret, was married in 1810 to David Irving, LL. D. and died in 1812, leaving an only son. His second daughter, Margaret Susannah, lived to deplore the loss of a parent, whose declining years she” had soothed by the most exemplary attention to all his wants and wishes. (x.)
