ANGELOT, an ancient English gold coin, struck at Paris while under subjection to the English. It was thus called from the figure of an angel supporting the scutcheon of the arms of England and France. There was another coin of the same denomination struck under Philip de Valois.

Angelot is also used in Commerce to denote a small, fat, rich sort of cheese brought from Normandy. Skinner supposes it to have been thus called from the name of the person who first made it up in that form, and perhaps stamped it with his own name. Menage supposes it to have been denominated from the resemblance it bears to the English coin called angelot. It is made chiefly in the Pays de Bray, whence it is also denominated angelot de Bray. It is commonly made in vats, either square or shaped like a heart.
