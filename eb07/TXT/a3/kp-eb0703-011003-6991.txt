ANDALUSIA, an extensive province in the south of Spain, on the Mediterranean Sea. Though its surface is very unequal, and its soil and climate vary with the elevations of the land, it must be considered the most rich and delightful of all the divisions of the peninsula. It is divided into four districts, which, in conformity with ancient usage, are denominated kingdoms, viz. Jaen, Cordova, Seville, and Granada, the description of each of which will be found in their alphabetical place.

Andalusia, New, a division of the province of Terra Firma in South America, whose boundaries cannot be well ascertained, as the Spaniards pretend a right to countries in which they have never established any settlements. According to the most reasonable limits, it extends in length 500 miles from north to south, and about 270 in breadth from east to west. The interior country is woody and mountainous, variegated with fine valleys that yield corn and pasturage. The produce of the country consists chiefly in dyeing-drugs, gums, medicinal roots, brazil wood, sugar, tobacco, and some valuable timber. To this province also belonged five valuable pearl fisheries. The capital of New Andalusia is Comana, Cumana, or New Corduba, situated in lat. 10Â° 5' N. about nine miles from the North Sea. Here the Spaniards laid the foundation of a town in the year 1520. The place is strong by nature, and fortified by a castle capable of making a vigorous defence. The country is better known under the name of Guiana. The revolution which began there in 1810 is not yet terminated.
