ANDERAVIA, or Inderabia, a low, level, and narrow island on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, about three miles in length. It is separated from the mainland by a strait three miles in length, and free from danger; but ships running for shelter under this island must not come within a mile of its south end, until a remarkable tree, which will be distinguished standing by itself, bear westnorth-west. Lat. 26. 40. N.
