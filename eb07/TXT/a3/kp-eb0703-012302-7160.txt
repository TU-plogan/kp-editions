ANDRISCUS, a man of mean extraction, who, pretending to be the son of Perseus, last king of Macedonia, took upon him the name of Philip, for which reason he was called Pseudo-Philippus, the False Philip. After a complete victory over Juventus, the Roman pretor who was sent against him, he assumed kingly power, but exercised it with vast cruelty. At last the Romans obliged him to fly into Thrace, where he was betrayed and delivered into the hands of Metellus. This victory placed Macedonia once more in the power of the Romans, and gained for Metellus the name of Macedonicus, but cost the Romans 25,000 men. Andriscus adorned the triumph of Metellus, walking in chains before the generalâ€™s chariot.
