ANOMALOUS, a term applied to whatever is irregular, or deviates from the rule observed by other things of the like nature.

ANOMALOUS Verbs, in Grammar, such as are not conjugated conformably to the paradigm of their conjugation. They are found in all languages. In Latin, the verb lego is the paradigm of the third conjugation, and runs thus, lego, legis, legit: by the same rule it should be fero, feris, ferit ; but we say, fero, fers, fert .∙ ferο, then, is an anomalous verb. In English the irregularity relates often to the prêter tense and passive participle; for example, give, were it formed according to rule, would make gwed in the prêter tense and passive participle; whereas, in the former, it makes gave, and in the latter given.
