ANGRA, a city of Tercera, one of the Azores; the capital, not only of that island, but of all the group, and the residence of the governor. It is seated on the southern shore, and the harbour is the only tolerable one in the whole island. It is in the form of a crescent, the extremities of which are defended by two high rocks, that run so far into the sea as to render the entrance narrow, and easily covered by the batteries on each side. From this harbour the town is said to derive its name, the word Angτa signifying a creek, bay, or station for ships. Here ships may ride in great safety during the summer; but as soon as the winter begins, the storms are so furi-òus, that the only safety is in putting to sea with all possible expedition. Happily these storms are preceded by infallible signs, with which experience has made the inhabitants perfectly acquainted.

The town is well built and populous, and forms the see of a bishop, under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Lisbon. It contains five parishes, a cathedral, four monasteries, as many nunneries, besides a bishop’s court, which extends its jurisdiction over all the Azores. The fortifications are strong, but not in good repair.

At Angra are kept the royal magazines for anchors, cables, sails, and other stores for the royal navy, and occasionally for merchant vessels in great distress. All maritime affairs are under the inspection of an officer, Desembergτador, who has subordinate officers and pilots for conducting ships into the harbour, or to proper watering places. The English, French, and Dutch, have each a consul residing at Angra, though the commerce' 4 of anyof these nations with the Azores is very inconsiderable. Long. 27. 14. W. Lat. 38. 38. N.
