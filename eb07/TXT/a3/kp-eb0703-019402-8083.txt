ANNA, Ana, oγ'Anah, a town of Arabian Irac, or pachalic of Bagdad, which extends five or six miles along the western bank of the Euphrates. It consists of a single street built on both sides. The houses are of stone, two stories high, and separated from each other, as in other eastern towns, by beautiful gardens, filled with fruit-trees, bearing lemons, oranges, citrons, quinces, figs, dates, pomegranates, and olives. It is an open and defenceless place; and in 1807 it was attacked by the Wahabees,.who gave it up to plunder, and perpetrated the most horrible cruelties, massacring the greater part of the inhabitants, and setting the town on fire; after which they retreated with their plunder, carrying into captivity many women and children. The inhabitants are said, previous to this calamity, to have been more polished than those in the neighbourhood, and to have consisted chiefly of Arabians, who were, however, addicted to their usual vocation of robbery when any opportunity offered. Population about 3000. 260 miles east of Damascus; 220 south-east of Aleppo. Long. 41. 15. E. Lat. 34. N.

Anna Comnena, daughter of the emperor Alexius Comnenus I., was not less distinguished by her elevated rank than by her mental qualifications. Her superiority of mind began early to display itself. Despising the effeminacy and voluptuousness of the court in which she was educated, she directed her attention to literary pursuits. Indulging her favourite studies, she solicited the acquaintance of the more eminent philosophers of that period.

But the pursuits of literature did not induce her entirely to abandon society; she gave her hand to Nicephorus Briennius, a young nobleman of a respectable family. This accomplished woman was, however, actuated with unjustifiable ambition; and, during the last illness of her father, she united with the empress Irene in attempting to prevail upon that monarch to disinherit his own son, and give the crown to her husband. The affection and virtue of the father prevailed over female address and intrigue. But the ambition of Comnena was not diminished; for she entered into a conspiracy to depose her brother; and when her husband displayed a timidity and hesitation in this unjust enterprise, she exclaimed that “nature had mistaken their sexes, for he ought to have been the woman.”

Either through the vigilance of her brother, or the timidity of her husband, the treasonable plot was discovered, and Anna punished with the confiscation of all her property. But generosity has an opportunity of displaying its real nature when an enemy is vanquished; thus was the -generosity of her brother displayed on the present occasion, by returning all her property. Ashamed, however, of her base conduct, she retired from court, and never more possessed any influence there. Disappointed ambition took shelter among the walks of literature, and she employed herself in her solitude in writing the history of her father’s reign. This production of her pen is still extant, and composes a part of the celebrated collection of the Byzantine Historians. The stores of rhetoric are ransacked to embellish this work, and every effort made to enrich it with science; but the general complexion of it is rather like an apology than an impartial narrative. It must, however, be acknowledged that she is not more partial than many other Latin historians, and that her history contains many valuable facts and observations.
