APPENZELL, one of the cantons of Switzerland. It is a mountainous district, surrounded by the canton of St Gall. Three chains of hills, continuations of the Alps, with valleys between them, form the chief part of the surface. The highest point of the hills is 7671 feet. In these are some extraordinary natural excavations, particularly the Ziegerloch and the Wildkirchlein. The climate is raw and cold, little calculated for agriculture, but adapted in some degree for breeding cattle, and for the dairy. The extent has been variously reported: it is probably about 220 square miles. The number of inhabitants, by the last estimate, is about 58,000, who are divided into 22 communes or parishes. The outer part of the canton was occupied by manufacturers of cotton and linen goods, and by calico printers; but of late years these fabrics have declined, and much distress has followed. The poverty thus produced has led to extensive emigrations to the western world. The constitution is a pure [7:3:309]democracy, each individual above 16 years having a vote. About one third of the inhabitants are Catholics, the remainder Protestants of the Calvinistic confession. The canton is formed into two divisions, each with its respective capital: Herisau is the capital of the outer division, and Appenzell of the inner. . . ...

Appenzell, a city, t ^ ιe ca pi trd °f thθ i nner division of the canton of that name in Switzerland. It stands on the river Sitter, in a beautiful valley. It contains one church of Gothic architecture, a capuchin monastery, a nunnery, with several chapels, and about 3000 inhabitants, who chiefly subsist by linen weaving and bleaching.
