ANTHROPOMORPHITES, in Ecclesiastical History, a sect of ancient heretics, who, taking every thing spoken of God in Scripture in a literal sense, particularly that passage of Genesis in which it is said God made man after his own image, maintained that God had a human shape. They are likewise called Audeans, from Audeus their leader.
