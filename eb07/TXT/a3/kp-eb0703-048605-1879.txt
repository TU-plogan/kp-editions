ARIMANIUS, the evil god of the ancient Persians. The Persian magi held two principlesâ€”a good demon or god, and an evil one; the first the author of all good, and the other of all evil: the former they supposed to be represented by light, and the latter by darkness, as their truest symbols. The good principle they named Yezud or Yesdan, and 0rmozd or Hormizda, which the Greeks wrote Oromasdes ; and the evil demon they called Ahriman, and the Greeks Arirnanius. Some of the magians held both these principles to have been from all eternity; but this sect was reputed heterodox, the original doctrine being that the good principle only was eternal, and the other created.
