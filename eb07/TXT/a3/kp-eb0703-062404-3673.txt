ARNOLDUS, Gothofredus, pastor and inspector of the churches of Perleberg, and historiographer to the king of Prussia, was born at Annaburg, in the mountains of Misnia, in 1666. He was a zealous defender of the Pietists, a sect among the German Protestants, and composed a great number of religious works, particularly an Ecclesiastical History, which exposed him to the resentment of the divines, and another giving an account of the doctrines and manners from the first ages, in which he frequently animadverts upon Caveâ€™s Primitive Chrisdanitu. He died in 1714.
