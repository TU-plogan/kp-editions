ASHRUFF, an ancient and formerly splendid city of Persia, adorned with a magnificent palace built by Shah Abbas, which was his favourite residence. It is situated on the shore of a bay, on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. This palace is described in glowing terms by Hanway, who saw it in its splendour. It was visited by Fraser in 1821, who found it a heap of ruins; and the town appeared to have suffered equally with the royal establishment. Ashruff was formerly said to have 300 baths within its walls; but it now contains only 500 houses, which are thinly scattered through an extensive jungle. It is about 70 miles west of Astrabad. Long. 53.15. E. Lat. 36. 50. N.

ASHTON-under-Line, a large parish in the hundred of Salford and county of Lancaster, distant 5 miles from Manchester and 185 from London. It is one of those large places which within a few years has risen to wealth arid populousness from the cotton manufactories. It is situated on the river Tame, and has the benefit of a navigable canal to Manchester, Rochdale, and Lancaster. The parish contains the hamlets of Hartshead, Hay, More-ley, and Staley Bridge. Population in 1801, 15,632; in 1811, 19,052; and in 1821, 25,967.
