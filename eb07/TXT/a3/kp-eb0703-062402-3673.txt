ARNOLD, of Brescia, in Italy, distinguished himself, in the 12th century, by being the founder of a sect which opposed the wealth and power of the Roman clergy. He went into France, where he studied under the celebrated Peter Abelard. Upon his return to Italy he put on the habit of a monk, and opened his invectives in the streets of Brescia. He pointed his declamation against the bishops, the clergy, the monks, and finally against the Roman pontiff himself; to the laity only he was indulgent. In 1139 he was cited to appear before a grand council at Rome. His accusers were the bishop of Brescia, and many others, whom he had ridiculed and insulted. Nor from his judges could he look for much indulgence. He was found guilty, and sentenced to perpetual silence. Upon this he left Italy, crossed the Alps, and found a refuge in Zurich. After the death of pope Innocent II. he returned to Italy, and was ultimately condemned to death and executed in 1155. His name is chiefly deserving of being remembered for the boldness of his attempt to lower the power of the pope and his clergy, in an age when the papacy existed in all the plenitude of its power and influence.
