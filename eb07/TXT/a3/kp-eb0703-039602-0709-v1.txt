ARCHANGEL, a Russian government or stadtholdership in the north of the eastern hemisphere of the globe; for though the city as well as the circle of the same name is comprehended in Europe, yet the government extends, according to Russian division, over great part of Asia. It is bounded on the north by the Frozen Ocean and White Sea; on the east by Tobolsk; on the south-east by Wologda; on the south-west by Olonez, of which a narrow part extends to the White Sea, and separates it from Finland; on the west by Finland; and on the north-west by Norway: but besides these boundaries there are some islands in the White Sea, and the great island Nova Zembla in the Frozen Ocean. The whole extent is 346,120 square miles, or 18,000 square miles more than, the kingdom of France, comprehending 41 degrees of longitude, from 27. 54. to 69. 13., and 16⅜ of latitude, from 61. 23. to 78. 4. The climate, though not all alike, is universally raw and cold. Up to the latitude of 65° the spring is moist, with frost at nights; the summer is short, with long but foggy days; the autumn is moist, and the winter begins early. The trees, however, grow, and the rye ripens. The rivers cease to flow from October to April. Between the 65th and 47th degrees there are some trees, but dwarfish; corn does not ripen; and animals scarcely endure the temperature. Beyond 67° is a more arctic climate, short summer, long winter, and the soil always frozen below the surface. The rivers are closed in September, and scarcely thaw before July. Though oats and rye grow up to the 65°, yet beyond that the chief subsistence depends on the chase and the fisheries; but even in the most southern parts the bark of trees is mixed with corn to eke out the scanty products of the harvest. The province contains seven cities or towns, and 220 parishes. The inhabitants are Russians, Samoieds, Laplanders, or Permijaks, whose number it is difficult to ascertain. By the latest accounts we have been able to obtain, the males, exclusive of the burghers, were, in 1783, 80,546; the whole may be about 170,000.

Archangel, a circle in the Russian government of the same name, through the centre of which the Dwina runs. It produces some little corn, and turnips, radishes, cabbages, onions, and garlic. The cattle are tolerable, and their Calves are in great request both in Petersburg and [7:3:397]Moscow. The inhabitants are all of the Russian race, and are seated, besides the capital, in four parishes, and three islands in the White Sea.

Archangel, a city, the capital of the government and circle of the same name, is situated on the Dwina where that river flows into the White Sea, and forms the Bay of Dwinskaja. The city is fortified in a very antique manner. All the houses but one are of wood, and the streets are planked instead of being paved. The churches are eleven Greek, and one each for Lutherans and Calvinists. There are a gymnasium, a seminary for priests, an hospital, and 1300 houses, with about 8000 inhabitants, who depend chiefly on foreign, commerce. The harbour is good, but only accessible from July to September. The ships that repair to it are generally of 300 tons burden, mostly British, but some from the Netherlands and the Hans towns. The way to this port was first discovered by the English in the year 1553, since which it has gradually increased in commercial importance. In the year 1819 the arrivals of vessels were 305; the imports amounted to 442,403 rubles, the exports to 6,031,088: the former have doubled, and the latter tripled, since the year 1803. The chief exports are, corn, linseed, train-oil, tar, tallow, peltry, wax, honey, mats, linen, bar iron, and copper, the greater part of which is brought from a great distance, some by the Dwina, and some in the winter on sledges. The imports consist chiefly of sugar and other colonial productions, wine, and manufactured goods. The commercial establishments are chiefly branches of mercantile houses of Petersburg, or of English, German, or Dutch merchants residing here. It is in long. 38. 41. 48. E. and lat. 64. 31. 40. N.
