ANGOT, a considerable province in the southern part of the kingdom of Abyssinia, which Alvarez, who visited it in the sixteenth century, describes as an extremely rich and beautiful territory. It has not since been reached by any European traveller, and is entirely in the possession of the Galla, who have overrun all the central provinces of Abyssinia. The tribe now in possession of Angot is called the Betzuma Galla.
