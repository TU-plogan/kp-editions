ANDREWS, James Pettit, a late English historian and miscellaneous writer, was the younger son of Joseph Andrews, Esq. of Shaw-house, near Newbury, Berks, where he was born in the year 1737. He was educated privately, and is said to have discovered an early taste for literature and the fine arts. He joined the Berkshire militia when they were first called out, being then about 18 or 19, and held the rank of lieutenant in that regiment until it was disbanded. On the institution of the new system of London police, he was appointed one of the commissioners for the district of Queen’s Square and St Margaret’s, Westminster, and discharged the duties of that office with great industry and integrity until his death, which took place at his house in London, on the 6th of August 1797, in the 60th year of his age. He married Miss Ann Penrose, daughter of the Rev. Mr Penrose, late rector of Newbury, by whom he had two sons and a daughter. He seems to have possessed a cheerful and social disposition, and enjoyed the conversation of a large circle >of literary acquaintance, who frequently met at his house and experienced his hospitality.

Mr Andrews appears to have devoted a considerable portion of his time to literary pursuits; and he is the author of several works which are not undeserving of notice. The first publication upon which we find him employed is an edition of the poems of his friend and relation Penrose, in 1781; to which he prefixed an introduction, containing a short account of the life and character of the author. His first original production, so far as we have been able to ascertain, was a pamphlet in behalf of the chimneysweepers’ apprentices in 1788, which is said to have led to the act of parliament passed not long afterwards for the purpose of ameliorating the condition of that unfortunate class of beings. In 1789 he published Anecdotes, Ancient and Modern, 8vo, a work of pleasantry, in the composition of which he acknowledged having received assistance from the late lauréat Mr Pye, the facetious antiquary Captain Grose, and others. To this volume he added a Supplement in 1790.

The most extensive work undertaken by Mr Andrews was his History of Great Britain, connected with the Chronology of Europe; with Notes, &c. The first volume, which commences with Caesar’s invasion, and ends with the deposition and death of Richard II., was published in 1794 in 4to. A second volume, in which the history is continued from the deposition and death of Richard H∙tθ the accession of Edward VI., appeared in 1795. The plan of this work is new, and in some respects singular; a certain portion of the history of England is given on one page, and a corresponding portion of the contemporaneous history of Europe on the one opposite. The notes consist oţ a variety of curious and amusing particulars, not immediately connected with the main story. Appendixes are also added at proper intervals, containing an account of the state of literature, science, religion, government, man [7:3:123]ners, &c. at different periods. The author, however, did not live to complete this curious and extensive work, no more of it having appeared than the two volumes above mentioned. In 1796 he published a continuation of Henry’s History of Britain, in one volume 4to and two volumes 8vo.

The other productions of this author are, An Account of Saxon Coins found in Kintbury Churchyard, Berks, printed in the seventh volume of the Archaeologia ; the Account of Shaw, in Mr Mores’s Berkshire Collections; The Savages of Europe, a popular French novel, which he translated, and illustrated by prints from his own designs. Mr Andrews was also a frequent contributor to the Gentleman’s Magazine. See the Gen. Biog. Diet, by Chalmers; Introduction to Poems by the Bev. Thomas Penrose, 1781; Gent. Mag. for 1797 and 1801; and Lysons’ Supplement to Environs of London, 1811. (κ.)

Andrews, Lancelot, bishop of Winchester, was born at London in 1555, and educated at Cambridge. After several preferments he was made bishop, first of Chichester, then of Ely, and in 1610 was raised to the see of Winchester. This very learned prelate, who was distinguished by his piety, charity, and integrity, may be justly ranked with the best preachers and scholars of his age. He appeared, however, to much greater advantage in the pulpit than he does now in his works, which abound with Latin quotations and trivial witticisms. He died at Winchester House in Southwark, September 27, 1626, in the 71st year of his age, and was buried in the parish church of St Saviour’s, where his executors erected to him a very fair monument of marble and alabaster, on which is an elegant inscription in Latin, written by one of his chaplains. His most popular works are, his Sermons, his Lectures on the Ten Commandments, and his Orphan Lectures, each forming a folio volume. There is a collection by Felix Kyngston, of some other pieces written by him, which was published in 4to in 1629.
