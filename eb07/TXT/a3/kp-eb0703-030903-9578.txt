APPIAN, an eminent writer of the Roman history in Greek, under the reigns of Trajan and Adrian. He was of a good family in Alexandria in Egypt; whence he went to Rome, and there distinguished himself so well as an advocate, that he was chosen one of the procurators of the empire, and the government of a province was committed to him. He did not complete the Roman history in a continued series, but wrote distinct histories of all nations that had been conquered by the Romans, in which he placed every thing relating to those nations in the proper order of time. Of all this voluminous work there remains only what treats of the Punic, Syrian, Parthian, Mithridatic, and Spanish wars, with those against Hannibal, the civil wars, and the wars in Illyricum, and some fragments of the Celtic or Gallic wars. An excellent edition of Appian was published by Schweighaeuser in Greek and Latin, at Leipsic, in 1785, in 3 vols. 8vo. The extracts from the lost books, preserved by various authors, have been collected in this edition.
