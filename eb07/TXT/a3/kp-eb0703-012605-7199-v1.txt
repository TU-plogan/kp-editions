ANDUJAN, a city of Spain, in the province of Jaen, in Andalusia. It is situated on the south side of the Sierra Morena, which defends it from the cold winds of the north, near the sources of the Jandula. There is a very fine bridge over the Guadalquivir at this place. The surrounding country is well watered, and yields abundant harvests of wheat, barley, oil, and wine; and numerous hives of bees furnish abundant supplies of honey and wax. From a whitish clay found here there are manufactured a vast quantity of jars called alcarrasas, which are highly esteemed for their property of keeping water cool in the hottest summer weather. It contains a castle, six churches, nine monasteries, a theatre, and 14,000 inhabitants. Long. 3. 28. 25. W. Lat. 38. 1. 32. N.
