ARISTO, a Stoic philosopher, the disciple of Zeno, flourished about 290 years before the Christian era. He differed but little from his master Zeno. He rejected logic as of no use, and natural philosophy as being above the reach of the human understanding. It is said that being bald, the sun burnt his head; and that this caused his death.
