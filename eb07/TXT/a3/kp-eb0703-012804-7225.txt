ANGERONA, in Mythology, the name of a pagan deity whom the Romans prayed to for the cure of the quinsy, in Latin angina. Pliny calls her the goddess of silence and calmness of mind, who banishes all uneasiness and melancholy. She is represented with her mouth covered, to denote patience and refraining from complaints. Her statue was set up and sacrificed to in the temple of the goddess Volupia, to show that a patient enduring of affliction leads to pleasure.
