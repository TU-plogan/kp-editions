ARABESQUE, or Arabesk, something done after the manner of the Arabians. Arabesque, ' Grotesque, and Moresque, are terms applied to paintings and ornaments where there are no human or animal figures, but which consist wholly of foliages, plants, stalks, &c. The words take their rise from hence, that the Moors, Arabs, and other Mahometans, use these kinds of ornaments; their religion forbidding them to make any images or figures of men or other animals.
