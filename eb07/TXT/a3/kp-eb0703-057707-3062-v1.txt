ARMINIUS, James, whose real name in Low Dutch was James Harmanni, a famous Protestant divine, was born at Oude water, in Holland, in 1560. He was ordained minister at Amsterdam on the 11th of August 1588, where he soon distinguished himself by his sermons, which were remarkable for their solidity and learning. Martin Lydias, professor of divinity at Franeker, judging him a fit person to refute a writing in which Beza’s doctrine of predestination had been attacked by some ministers of Delft, Arminius at his desire undertook the task; but upon thoroughly examining the reasons on both sides, he came into the opinions he proposed to overturn, and afterwards went still farther than the ministers of Delft had done. In 1600 he opposed those who maintained that ministers should subscribe the confession and catechism every year. In 1602 a pestilential disease raged at Amsterdam, during which he acted with the greatest resolution and courage, in assisting the poor and comforting the sick; and Lucas Trelcatius and Francis Junius dying of that disease at Leyden, the curators of that university chose Arminius professor of divinity there, and he was afterwards made doctor of divinity. Disputes upon grace were soon after kindled in that university; and he was at length engaged in a new contest, occasioned by a disputation of his concerning the divinity of the Som These contests, his continual labour, and the concern of seeing his reputation blasted by a multitude of slanders in relation to his opinions, impaired his health, and threw him into a fit of sickness, of which he died on the 19th of October 1609. Arminius was esteemed an excellent preacher; his voice was low, but very agreeable; his pronounciation admirable; he was easy and affable to persons of all ranks, and facetious in conversation amongst his friends. The curators of the university of Leyden had so great a regard for him, that they settled a pension upon his wife and children. He left several treatises, viz. 1, Disputationes de Diversis Christianae Religionis Capitibus; 2, Orationes, itemque Tractatus Insigniores aliquot; 3, Examen modesti Libelli Gulielmi Perkinsi de Praedestinationis Modo et Ordine, itemque de Amplitudine Gratiae Divinae; 4, Analysis Capitis Noni ad Romanos; 5, Dissertatio de vero et genuino Sensu Capitis Septimi Epistolae ad Romanos; 6, Amica Collatio cum D. Francisco Junio de Praedestinatione, per literas habita; 7, Epistola ad Hippolytum a Collibus. These pieces were collected in a 4to volume, published at Leyden in 1629, which has been several times reprinted.
