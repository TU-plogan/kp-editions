ASTELL, Mary, an English authoress of some name, was born at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the year 1668. Her father, who was a merchant, committed the education of his daughter to her uncle, who was a clergyman. Convinced of the general injury done to young ladies at that period by the deficiency of their education, he taught her the Latin and French languages, and instructed her in the principles of logic, mathematics, and natural philosophy. Having spent 20 years of her life in Newcastle, she went to London, where she continued the pursuit of her studies; and, deeply affected with the general ignorance of her sex, she employed the first fruits of her pen to rouse them to a proper emulation, in a work entitled A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, wherein a Method is offered for the Improvement of their Minds, printed in 12mo, at London, 1697. The chief object of this work was to recommend the erection of a seminary for female education. She next wrote a book entitled Reflections on Marriage, which was published in 1700. This lady was a zealous advocate for the religious system commonly called orthodox, and in politics defended the doctrine of non-resistance. About this time she published some controversial pieces, among which are the following:—Moderation Truly Stated; A Fair Way with the Dissenters; An Impartial Enquiry into the Causes of the Rebellion; and A Vindication of the Royal Martyrs; all printed in 4to, in 1704. Her most finished performance was, The Christian Religion, as professed by a Daughter of the Church of England; published in 1705, in a large octavo volume. She died in the year 1731.
