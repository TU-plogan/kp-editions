ASCITAE (from αΰκος, a bag or bottle'), in Antiquity, a sect or branch of Montanists, who appeared in the second century. They were so called because they introduced a kind of Bacchanals into their assemblies, who danced round a skin or bag blown up, saying they were those new bottles filled with new wine whereof our Saviour makes mention, Matth, ix. 17. They are sometimes also called Ascodrogitoe.
