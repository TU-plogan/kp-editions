AORISTIA, in the sceptic philosophy, denotes that state of the mind wherein we neither assert nor deny any thing positively, but only speak of things as seeming or appearing to us in such a manner. The aoristia is one of the great points or terms of scepticism to which the philosophers of that denomination had continual recourse by way of explication or subterfuge. Their adversaries, the dogmatists, charged them with dogmatizing, and asserting the principles and positions of their sect to be true and certain.
