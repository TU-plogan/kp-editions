ARMILLARY, in a genera] sense, something consisting of rings or circles.

ARMiLLÄ€RY Sphere, an artificial sphere composed of a number of circles of the mundane sphere, put together in their natural order, to ease and assist the imagination in conceiving the constitution of the heavens and the motions of the celestial bodies. The armillary. sphere revolves upon its axis within a silvered horizon, which is divided into degrees, and movable every way upon a brass supporter. The other parts are the equinoctial, zodiac, meridian, the two tropics, and the two polar circles.
