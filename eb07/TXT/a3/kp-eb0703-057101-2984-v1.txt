ARLES, an arrondissement in the department of the mouths of the Rhone, in France, extending over 883 square miles, or 585,120 acres. It is divided into eight cantons, and subdivided into 33 communes, which contain 70,641 inhabitants.

Arles, a city, the chief of the arrondissement of the same name, in France. It is situated on the left bank of the principal branch of the Rhone, called the Grand Phone, to avoid the bad navigation of which, a broad and deep canal to the harbour of Boue has been constructed. The surrounding country is fruitful, especially in corn. The city is ancient, large, and well built, containing, besides a cathedral and several churches, a fine town-house, an exchange, and other public buildings, and 20,151 inhabitants. Having been formerly a Roman colonial city, Arles abounds with many interesting remains of that people. The most remarkable are, an amphitheatre of 1000 feet in circumference, though its arena is filled with miserable dwellings; five arches of Roland’s Tower; the remains of the palace of Constantine the Great, called Le Chateau de Trouille; the obelisk of granite before the town-house, 61 feet in height; and the Elysian fields, an ancient burial place, with many sarcophagi. It is in long. 5. 42. 27. E. Lat. 43. 40. 28. N.
