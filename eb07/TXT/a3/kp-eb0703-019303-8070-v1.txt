ANIME, in Heraldry, a term used when the eyes of a rapacious creature are borne of a different tincture from the creature itself.

Anime, a resin exuding from the trunk of a large American tree, called by the Indians courbaril (a species of Hymenaea). This resin is of a transparent amber colour, a light agreeable smell, and little or no taste. It dissolves entirely, but not very readily, in rectified spirit of wine; the impurities, which are very often in large quantity, remaining behind. The Brazilians are said to employ anime in fumigations for pains and aches proceeding from cold: with us, it is rarely, if ever, made use of for any medicinal purpose.
