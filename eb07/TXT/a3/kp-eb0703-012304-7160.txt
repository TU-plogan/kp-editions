ANDROGYNES, in Ancient Mythology, creatures of whom, according to the fable, each individual possessed the powers and characters of both sexes, having two heads, four arms, and two feet. The word itself is compounded of two Greek radical words; aw1ξ, in the genitive avδξoς, a male ; and γυvη, a female. Many of the rabbinical writers pretend that Adam was created double, one body being; male, the other female, which in their origin not being essentially joined, God afterwards did nothing but separate them.

Androgynes, in Natural History, a name given to those living creatures which, by a monstrous formation of their generative parts, seem (for it is only seeming) to unite in themselves the two sexes, that of the male and of the female. See Hermaphrodite.
