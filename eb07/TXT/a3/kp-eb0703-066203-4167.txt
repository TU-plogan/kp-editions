ARZILLA, a very ancient maritime town of Africa, in the kingdom of Fez, about five leagues from Tangiers. It is built at the mouth of a river, and inhabited by Moors and Jews, who carry on no trade. It was formerly a Roman colony, under the name of Julia Traducta. It afterwards fell under the government of the Goths, and was next taken by the Mahometans. Alphonse of Portugal, surnamed the African, took it by assault in 1471, and brought away the presumptive heir of the crown. After that prince came to the throne, he besieged it in 1508, with 100,000 men; but was obliged to abandon the undertaking. However, at length the Portuguese forsook it of their own accord. It is now sunk into a very small place, not containing above 1000 inhabitants.
