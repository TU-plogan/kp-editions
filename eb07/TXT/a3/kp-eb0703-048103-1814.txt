AREZZO, a city of Italy, in Tuscany, seated in the territory of Florence, on the declivity of a hill that overlooks the neighbouring plain, between the Citta di Castelli and Florence. It is a bishop’s see, subordinate only to the pope, and has two collegiate churches, 15 parishes, 18 religious houses, and four hospitals. It was at one time famous for a kind of earthenware much esteemed by the Romans. It afterwards fell greatly into decay, until Cosmo dè’ Medici took it under his protection, since which it has been recovering gradually. It is famed for being the birthplace of Maecenas, of Petrarch, and of 2 Guido Aretin, the great improver of musical notation. A popular insurrection broke out here against the French general Macdonald, in his retreat from Naples to Upper Italy in 1799. 25 miles E.N.E. of Sienna, and 34 S.E. of Florence. Long. 11. 50. E. Lat. 43. 28. N.
