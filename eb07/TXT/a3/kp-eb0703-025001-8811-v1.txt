ANTIGONUS I., one of the captains of Alexander the Great, was the son of Philip, a Macedonian nobleman. After Alexander’s death, a division of the provinces taking place, Pamphylia, Lycia, and Phrygia Major fell tohis share. But Perdiccas, well acquainted with his ambitious spirit and great abilities, determined to divest him of his government, and laid plans for his life, by bringing various accusations against him. Antigonus, aware of the danger, retired with his son Demetrius into Greece, where he obtained the favour and protection of Antipater; and in a short time Perdiccas dying, a new division took place, when he was invested not only with the government of the former provinces, but also with that of Lycaonia. He was likewise intrusted with the command of the Macedonian household troops; and upon Eumenes being declared a public enemy, he received orders to prosecute the war against him with the utmost vigour. On the commencement of this war, Eumenes suffered a total overthrow, and was obliged to retire with only 600 brave followers to a castle situated on an inaccessible rock, where he might rest in safety from all the assaults of Antigonus. In the interval, his friends assembled a new army for his relief, which was routed by Antigonus, who now began to exhibit the great projects of his ambition. Polyperchon succeeding to the tutorship of the young king of Macedon after Antipater’s death, Antigonus resolved to set himself up as lord of all Asia. On account of the great power of Eumenes, he greatly desired to gain him over to his interest; but that faithful commander, effecting his escape from the fortress where he was closely blockaded, raised an army, and was appointed the royal general in Asia. The governors in Upper Asia co-operating with him, he succeeded in several engagements against Antigonus; but was at last delivered up to him through treachery, and put to death. Upon this the governor of Upper Asia yielded to Antigonus. Those whom he suspected, he either sacrificed to his resentment or displaced from their offices. Then seizing upon all the treasures at Susa, he directed his march towards Babylon, of which city Seleucus was governor. Seleucus fled to Ptolemy, and entered into a league with him, together with Lysimachus and Cassander, with the intention of giving a check to the exorbitant power of Antigonus, who, notwithstanding this, made a successful attempt upon the provinces of Syria and Phoenicia. But these provinces were soon after recovered by Ptolemy, who defeated his son Demetrius, while he himself was employed in repelling Cassander, who had made rapid progress in Lesser Asia. They were again taken by Antigonus, who, being flushed with his success, planned an expedi·ion against the Nabathaean Arabs, dwelling in the deserts adjacent to Judea; but on the first enterprise against the town of Petra, his general Athenaeus, with almost all his troops, was cut to pieces by the Arabs. Antigonus then sent his son against them, who returned after forcing them to reasonable terms. Demetrius then expelled Şeleucus from Babylon; and success attending his arms wherever he went, the confederates were obliged to make a treaty with Antigonus, in which it was stipulated that he should remain in possession of all Asia, but that the Greek cities should continue in possession of their liberty. This agreement was soon violated, under the pretęnce that garrisons had been placed in some of these cities by Antigonus. At first Ptolemy made a successful descent into Lesser Asia, and on several of the islands of the Archipelago; but he was at length defeated by the successful arms of Demetrius in a sea-fight, who also took the island of Cyprus, with many prisoners. On this victory Antigonus was so elated that he assumed the title of king, and bestowed the same upon his son; and from that time, B. c. 306, his reign in Asia, and that of Ptolemy in Egypt, and of the other captains of Alexander in their respective governments, properly commence.

Irritated at the hostile conduct of Ptolemy, Antigonus prepared a numerous army and a formidable fleet; and having taken the command of the army, he gave the com· mand of the fleet to Demetrius, and hastened to attack him in his own dominions. After enduring the severest hardships, they met in the vicinity 7 of Mount Cassius; but Ptolemy acted with such valour and address that Demetrius could gain no advantage over him; and after several fruitless attempts, he abandoned the undertaking. He next attempted the reduction of Rhodes; but meeting with obstinate resistance, he was obliged to make a treaty upon the best terms that he could, having been called to join Antigonus against Cassander, who at this time had formed a confederacy with Seleucus and Lysimachus. When Demetrius united his forces with those of Antigonus, they advanced to Phrygia, and having met the enemy at Ipsus, a decisive battle was fought, in which Antigonus fell, in the 84th year of his age, b. c. 301.

Antigonus Gonatas, son of Demetrius Poliorcetes, was the grandson of the former Antigonus. His character was eminently distinguished by humanity and mildness of disposition. When he besieged Thebes under the command of his father, he strongly remonstrated against the loss of so many lives for such an insignificant object. Filial affection was so powerful in his mind, that when his father was taken prisoner by Seleucus, he generously offered himself in his stead; and being rejected, he wore deep mourning, and refrained from all festivals and amusements during his father’s imprisonment. Informed of his death, all the floods of sorrow burst from his tender heart, and sailing with a fleet to meet his ashes, he received them with all the demonstrations of filial sensibility and dutiful respect. By the death of his father he became master of all the European dominions of Demetrius, together with the kingdom of Macedon, and various other cities in Greece. The Gauls invading his country, he defeated and expelled them; but was soon after routed by Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Some time after, however, Pyrrhus was slain at Argos; and when his head was brought to him by his son, he expressed the highest displeasure, and throwing his robe over it, he gave orders to search for his body, and to inter the same with all funeral honours. ∙

In the evening of his reign he so cultivated the arts of peace, and so conciliated the minds of his subjects, that he secured their affections both to himself and his descendants. The taking of the citadel of Corinth by intrigue was the meanest action of his reign; but he improved that event in maintaining the freedom of the small estates of Greece, and in increasing his own dominions. The Achaeans, and Aratus their famous chief, vigorously opposed his measures, and at length recovered Corinth; but Antigonus was so inclined to peace, that notwithstanding this event, he pursued his wonted plan, and left his kingdom in peace about the 80th year of his life and the 44th of his reign, b. c. 243; and Demetrius II. his son, next ascended the throne.
