ANTONINUS Pius, a celebrated Roman emperor, was born a. D. 86, at Lanuvium in Italy. His family had long maintained the honour of the house of Nismes in Gaul, from whence they had descended. Both his father and grandfather had held the office of consul. Arius Antoninus, his maternal grandfather, by his amiable disposition and love of literature had acquired an eminent character, and was very intimate with Pliny the younger. Under him the young Titus, after his father’s death, completed his education. His character, On arriving at the age of maturity, manifested itself in the most promising manner. To an improved understanding, a virtuous heart, a mild and dignified character, and a noble eloquence, he joined a happy physiognomy. Simple in his taste, and guided by temperance in all his actions and sentiments, he was entirely free from all affectation and pomposity.

In the year 120, among the many public honours which his birth and connections gave him a claim to, he was elevated to the high post of consul, and was afterwards appointed by Adrian to be one of the four consulars between whom the supreme power of Italy was divided. Becoming in his turn proconsul of Asia, he acquitted himself with such reputation that he even excelled his grandfather Arius, who had formerly enjoyed that high trust. Returning from Asia, he was not only received into the favour, but likewise the confidence and council of Adrian, and was always disposed to act with lenity. He married Annia Faustina, the daughter of Annius Verus, whose character was far from being untaxed with reproach; but his lenient disposition induced him to avoid public scandal, and he behaved towards his aged father-in-law with the most becoming respect. Two sons and two daughters were the fruits of this marriage. The sons died when they were young, and the eldest daughter, who was married to Lamia Sylvanus, died when Titus proceeded towards his Asiatic government. Faustina, the youngest, married Marcus Aurelius, who was afterwards emperor.

After the death of Verus, Adrian resolving to adopt Antoninus, he was induced to accept of the succession to so important a charge as the Roman empire, although with a considerable degree of reluctance, and was accordingly nominated by Adrian in February 25, a. d. 138, in the presence of the council of the chief senators; and he at the same time created him his colleague in performing the proconsular and tribunitial duties. Extending his plans of adoption still farther, Adrian caused Antoninus to adopt the son of Verus, then seven years of age, and Marcus Annius, afterwards named Aurelius, then seventeen years of age, a relation of Adrian’s, and nephew to his own wife. The dutiful and merited attention which Antoninus bestowed on Adrian during the last months of his illness gives a very high idea of his character. On July 10, a. D. 138, he succeeded to the empire amidst the universal acclamations of the senate and people, who anticipated in his well-tried virtues that happiness which a good and wise sovereign is able to bestow upon his subjects.

The Roman world enjoyed such tranquillity under his reign that it affords few materials for history; yet it is to be regretted that Capitolinus is the only historian from whom any direct information can be received concerning this peaceful period, and he is none of the most perspicuous. It however appears that the usual honours and titles, together with the addition of the surname of Pius, which both his conduct and zeal in defending and honou: ing the memory of his predecessor united to suggest, were willingly conferred upon him by the senate. In the beginning of his reign there were several conspiracies formed against him; but this only afforded him an instance of signalizing his clemency, which he did in the most striking manner. Although he was unable to prevent justice from taking its due course against the ringleaders, he prohibited the prosecution of their accom plices, and took the son of Attilius, one of the principal conspirators, under his protection. Various commotions were raised in several parts of the empire; but by the vigilance of his lieutenants these were easily quelled. The incursions of the Brigantes in Britain were restrained, and a new wall which was built to the north of that of Adrian, from the mouth of the Esk to that of Tweed, and which was called the Wall of Antoninus, was fixed as the boundary of the Roman province in Britain. The reign of Antoninus, upon the whole, was singularly peaceful, and realized a saying of Scipio, that “he preferred saving the life of one citizen, to destroying a thousand enemies.”

Jurisprudence was to this emperor, as it was to his predecessor, an interesting subject for improvement; and several decrees which he issued display his commendable, spirit of equity. The natural consequence of this equity was, that Antoninus acquired a reputation and fame which no military achievements could have conferred; and his friendship was courted by the neighbouring princes.

There is scarcely a blot to be found to tarnish his character; and frugality, modesty, and harmless amusement continued to employ his private hours. In the managt ment of his complicated business he was exact to such a degree, that it was even ridiculed by some; but he fount the daily advantage of this accuracy. The growing virtue' of Marcus Aurelius soon drew his attention after he ts cended the throne, and having given him his daughter ir marriage, he declared him Caesar. Nor was he mistaken in his choice; for Aurelius acted with the utmost fidelity) and affection amid all the honours that he continued to confer upon him. Enjoying this large share of domestic bliss, in the 75th year of his life he was seized with a fever, at his favourite country-seat of Lori. Convinced of his approaching fate, he convened the principal officers of the state, and confirmed his election of Aurelius, and gave him the imperial ensigns. A delirium ensued, in an interval of which he gave the watchword AequanimiteSì and calmly resigned his breath in the 23d year of his reign. His ashes were consigned to the tomb of Adrian, and divine honours paid to his memory. He was universally regretted, and succeeding emperors bore his name as a badge of honour. The senate and his successor erected a sculptured pillar to his memory, which is still shown to strangers as one of the chief ornaments of Rome.

Antoninus Philosophus, Alarcus Aurelius, a very eminent Roman emperor, born at Rome on the 26th of April [7:3:271]in the 121st year of the Christian era. He was called by 'several names till he was admitted into the Aurelian family, when he took that of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Adrian, upon the death of Cejonius Commodus, turned his eyes upon Marcus Aurelius; but, as he was not then 18 years of age, and consequently too young for so important a station, he fixed upon Antoninus Pius, whom he adopted, upon condition that he should likewise adopt Marcus Aurelius. The year after this adoption, Adrian appointed him questor, though he had not yet attained the age prescribed by the law. After the death of Adrian, Aurelius married Faustina, the daughter of Antoninus Pius, by whom he had several children. In the year 139 he was invested with new honours by the emperor Pius, in which he behaved in such a manner as endeared him to that prince and the whole people.

Upon the death of Pius, which happened in the year 161, he was obliged by the senate to take upon him 0 the government, in the management of which he took Lucius Verus as his colleague. Dion Cassius says that he was induced to do this on account of his ill state of health, and that he might have leisure to pursue his studies; Lucius being of a strong, vigorous constitution, and consequently more fit for the fatigues of war. The same day he took upon him the name of Antoninus, which he gave likewise to Verus his colleague, and betrothed his daughter Lucilla to him. The two emperors went afterwards to the camp, where, after having performed the funeral rites of Pius, they pronounced each of them a panegyric to his memory. They discharged the government in a very amicable manner. It is said that soon after Antoninus had performed the apotheosis of Pius, petitions were presented to him by the pagan priests, philosophers, and governors of provinces, in order to excite him to persecute the Christians, which he rejected with indignation, and interposed his authority for their protection, by writing a letter to the common assembly of Asia, then held at Ephesus. The happiness which the empire began to enjoy under these two emperors was interrupted, in the year 162, by a dreadful inundation of the Tiber, which destroyed a vast number of cattle, and occasioned a famine at Rome. This calamity was followed by the Parthian war; and at the same time the Catti ravaged Germany and Rhaetia. Lucius Verus went in person to oppose the Parthians; and Antoninus remained at Rome, where his presence was necessary.

During this war with the Parthians, about the year 163 or 164, Antoninus sent his daughter Lucilla to Verus, she having been betrothed to him, and attended her as-far as Brundusium. He intended to conduct her to Syria; but it having been insinuated by some persons that his design of going into the East was to claim the honour of having finished the Parthian war, he returned to Rome. The Romans having gained a victory over the Parthians, who were obliged to abandon Mesopotamia, the two emperors triumphed over them at Rome in the year 166, and were honoured with the title of Fathers of their country. This year was fatal, on account of a terrible pestilence which spread itself over the whole world, and a famine under which Rome laboured. It was likewise in this year that the Marcomanni, and many other people of Germany, took up arms against the. Romans; but the two emperors, having marched in person against them, obliged the Germans to sue for peace. The war, however, was renewed the year following, and the two emperors marched again in person; but Lucius Verus was seized with an apoplectic fit, and died at Altinum. The Romans were now defeated with great slaughter; and the emperor, not choosing to burden his subjects with new taxes, exposed to sale the furniture of the palace, the gold and silver plate belonging to the crown, and his wife’s rich garments embroidered with gold, and a curious collection of pearls, which Adrian had purchased during his long progress through the provinces of the empire, and was called Adrian’s cabinet.

In the year 170 Antoninus made vast preparations against the Germans, and carried on the war with great vigour. During this war, in 174, a very extraordinary event is said to have happened, which, according to Dion Cassius, was as follows: Antoninus’s army being blocked up by the Quadi in a very disadvantageous place, where there was no possibility of procuring water, and being worn out with fatigue and wounds, oppressed with heat and thirst, and incapable of retiring or engaging the enemy, in an instant the sky was covered with clouds, and there fell a vast quantity of rain. The Roman army were about to quench their thirst when the enemy came upon them with such fury, that they must certainly have been defeated, had it not been for a shower of hail, accompanied with a storm of thunder and lightning, which fell upon the enemy without the least annoyance to the Romans, who by this means gained the victory.^[1. The Pagans, as well as Christians, according to Mr Tiilemont (art. xvi. p. 621), have acknowledged the truth of this prodigy, but have greatly differed as to the cause of such a miraculous event, the former ascribing it, some to one magician and some to another. In.Antoninus’s pillar the glory is ascribed to Jupiter the god of rain and thunder. But the Christians affirmed that God granted this favour at the prayer of the Christian soldiers in the Roman army, who are said to have composed the twelfth or Meli- ⅛ne legion; and, as a mark of distinction, we are told that they received the tit le of the Thundering Legion from Antoninus. (Euseb. accIcs. Hist. üb. V. cap. 5.) Mr Moyle, in the letters published in the second volume of his works, has endeavoured to explode this story of ⅛e Thundering Legion, which occasioned Mr Whiston to publish an answer in 1726, entitled, Of the Thundering Legion; or, o] the Miraculous Deliverance of Marcus Antoninus and his Army upon the Prayers of the Christians. ] In 175 Antoninus made a treaty with several nations of Germany. Soon after, Avidius Cassius, governor of Syria, revolted from the emperor. This insurrection, however, was put an end to by the death of Cassius, who was killed by a centurion named Anthony. Antoninus behaved with great lenity towards those who had been engaged in Cassius’s party: he would not put to death, nor imprison, nor even sit in judgment himself upon any of the senators engaged in this revolt; but he referred them to the senate, fixing a day for their appearance, as if it had been only a civil affair. He wrote also to the senate, desiring them to act with indulgence rather than severity; nor to shed the blood of any senator or person of quality, or of any other person whatever; but to allow this honour to his reign, that, even under the misfortune of a rebellion, none had lost their lives except in the first heat of the tumult. In 176 Antoninus visited Syria and Egypt. The kings of those countries, and ambassadors also from Parthia, came to visit him. He staid several days at Smyrna; and, after settling the affairs of the East, went to Athens, on which city he conferred several honours, and appointed public professors there. From thence he returned to Rome with his son Commodus, whom he chose consul for the year following, though he was then but 16 years of age, having obtained a dispensation for that purpose. On the 27th of September in the same year he gave him the title of Imperator ; and on the 23d of December he entered Rome in triumph with Commodus, on account of the victories gained over the Germans. Dion Cassius tells us that he remitted all the debts which were due to [7:3:272]himself and the public treasury during 4G years, and burnt •the writings relating to these debts. In the year 179 he 'left Rome with his son Commodus, in order to go against the Marcomanni and other barbarous nations; and in the year following he gained a considerable victory over them, and would in all probability have entirely subdued them, had he not been seized with an illness, which carried him off on the 17th of March 180, in the 59th year of his age, and 19th of his reign. The whole empire regretted the loss of so valuable a prince, and almost every person had a statue of him. His book of Meditations has been much admired. It is the most precious work that has come down to us from the Stoical school. The Oxford edition of 1704, and that of London, published in 1707; are both esteemed. 'An English translation by Drs Moor and Hutcheson was published at Glasgow in 2 vols. 12mo, in 1749.
