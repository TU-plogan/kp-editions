ARAL, a great lake lying a little to the eastward of the Caspian Sea. Its length from north to south is said to be near 150 miles, and its breadth from east to west about 70. The shore on the west side is high and rocky, and destitute of good water; yet there are abundance of wild horses, asses, antelopes, and wolves; as also a fierce creature called ajolbart, which the Tartars say is of such a prodigious strength as to carry off a horse. Several great rivers, which were supposed to run into the Caspian Sca, are now known to fall into this lake, particularly the Sihun or Sirr, and the Ghihun or Amo, so often mentioned by the oriental historians. This lake, like the Caspian Sea, has no visible outlet. Its water is also very salt, and for that reason is conveyed by the neighbouring inhabitants by small narrow canals into sandy pits, where the heat of the sun, by exhaling the water, leaves them a sufficient quantity of salt.
