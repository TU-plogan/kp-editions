ASSONANCE, in Rhetoric and Poetry, a term used where the words of a phrase or a verse have the same sound or termination, and yet make no proper rhyme. These are usually accounted vicious in English, though the Romans sometimes used them with elegance, as Militem comparavit, exercitum ordinavit, aciem lustravit.
