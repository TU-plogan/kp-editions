ARENSBURG, a circle in the Russian government of Livonia, comprehending the islands of Oesel, Moen, Ruh-na, and several smaller ones, in the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea. The surface of these islands is 2176 square miles, and, in spite of a rigorous climate, they are moderately fertile, producing rye, buck-wheat, flax, hemp, tobacco, potatoes, turnips, and other vegetables, where the land is manured with sea-weed, which abounds on the shores. The cattle, both for the dairy and the butcher, are good; and there are some sheep, which yield fine wool. The island of Arensburg is well watered, though it has no river, but several brooks and lakes. The inhabitants in 1792 were 34,256, and we have no later notices of these islands. The island of Arensburg alone is far more populous than all the others, and contains one city, 12 church parishes, and 16] farms. The people speak a peculiar dialect of German, and adhere to the Lutheran profession of religion. The capital of the circle is a city of the sam e name, on the south-east side of the island of Oesel, in a, small bay, visited yearly by about 40 vessels of easy burden.
