APPARENT, in a general sense, something that is visible to the eyes, or obvious to the understanding.

Apparent, among mathematicians and astronomers, denotes things as they appear to us, in contradistinction from real or true: thus we say, the apparent diameter; distance, magnitude, place, figure, &c. of bodies.

Apparent Heir, in Law. No inheritance can vest, nor can any person be the actual heir of another, till the ancestor is previously dead. Nemo est haeres viventis. Before that time the person who is next in the line of succession is called an heir apparent, or heir presumptive. Heirs apparent are those whose right of inheritance is indefeasible, provided they outlive the ancestor; as the eldest son or his issue, who must by the course of the common law be heirs to the father whenever he happens to die. Heirs presumptive are those who, if the ancestor should die immediately, would in the present circumstances be his heirs, but whose right of inheritance may be defeated by the contingency of some nearer heir being born; as a brother or nephew, whose presumptive succession may be destroyed by the birth of a child; or daughter, whose, present hopes may be hereafter cut off by the birth of a son.
