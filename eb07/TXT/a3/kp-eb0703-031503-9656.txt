AQUAPIM, a kingdom of considerable extent in the interior of the Gold Coast of Africa, immediately behind Aera, and having on the other side Aquamboe. This country is said to vie in beauty and fertility with any in the world. It is finely diversified with wooded hills and highly cultivated valleys, the former having usually towns nd villages situated on their summits. The people are obedient to their chiefs, mild and gentle; they are chiefly employed in agriculture, which they practise with considerable diligence.
