APHRODISIA, in Antiquity, festivals kept in honour of Venus, the most remarkable of which was that celebrated by the Cyprians. At this solemnity several mysterious rites were practised; all who were initiated to them offered a piece of money to Venus as a harlot, and received as a token of the goddess’s favour a measure of salt and a ραλλο;; the former, because salt is a concretion of sea-water, to which Venus was thought to owe her birth; the latter because she was the goddess of wantonness.
