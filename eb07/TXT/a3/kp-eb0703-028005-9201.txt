AOSTA, a duchy of Piedmont, separated by the Alps from Savoy and the Valais, and bounded on the east and south by the Navarese and the provinces of Biella and Yvry. The country is in general mountainous; but there are several valleys of great extent, particularly the Vol dâ€™Aosta. By the industry of the inhabitants these low grounds are very fruitful in wine, oil, and pasture; and the mountains abound in iron and copper.

Aosta, the chief town of the foregoing duchy, and the see of a bishop. It is situated on the river Doria, at the foot of the Alps, where the great commercial roads from Savoy and the. Valais to Piedmont, over the Great and Little St Bernard, meet each other. The town, though large, is . meanly built and thinly peopled. It is remarkable for several, monuments of the Romans, and for being the birthplace of Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury. Long. 7. 33. E. Lat. 45. 58. N.
