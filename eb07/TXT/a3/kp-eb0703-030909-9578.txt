APPOLLONIA, a considerable kingdom in Africa, about 100 miles in length, situated on the Gold Coast, from the western extremity of which it extends to the river Ancobra. The territory being intersected by numerous small streams which overflow their banks during the rainy season, is very well adapted for the growth of rice and the sugar-cane. The coast affords neither harbour nor creek; but goods are conveyed on shore in canoes, which are managed by the natives with great dexterity. The government is monarchical; the people are honest, courteous, and hospitable; and the trader, in dealing with them, finds his person and property quite secure. The ports are Appollonia, Assince, Great and Little Bassam; at each of which may be obtained gold and ivory, the former of rather superior quality. The British had formerly a fort at Appollonia, which they have now withdrawn.
