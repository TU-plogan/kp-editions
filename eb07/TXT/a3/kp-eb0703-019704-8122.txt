ANNOBON, a small island in Africa, on the east coast of Loango, belonging to the Portuguese. It lies in long. 5. 30. E. lat. 1. 32. S., and receives its name from being discovered on the new yearâ€™s day. According to Pyrard, it is about five or six French leagues in circuit; Braud-raud makes it ten leagues. It contains two high mountains, having their tops continually enveloped in clouds, and thus occasioning frequent rains. Off the south-east of the island are two rocks, one of which is low, and upon a level with the surface of the sea; the other higher and larger, but both dangerous to shipping in the night: between them the channel is deep and clear. On the same side of the island is a convenient watering place; but the road [7:3:198]to the north-west side is difficult and dangerous, though the one most frequented by ships that have no intention of touching upon the continent. In either place it is difficult to take in a sufficient quantity of water, on account of the violent surf. The best road for ships lies on the north-east side, where they may anchor in 7, 10, 13, or 16 fathoms, on a fine sand, opposite to the Negro village. The climate is wholesome, and the air clear and serene for the greater part of the year. The island contains a number of fertile valleys, which produce Turkey corn, rice, millets, yams, potatoes, and afford pasture for abundance of cattle and sheep. Poultry and fish also abound; but the only mercantile production is cotton, in small quantity, but esteemed equal in quality to any produced in India.

In the year 1605 the Dutch admiral Matelief found 200 negroes and two Portuguese on Annobon, most of them able to bear arms. The inhabitants are subject to the Portuguese governor, who is the chief person in the island; at the same time the negroes have their own chief, subordinate to him. They are all rigid catholics, having been either compelled or persuaded by the Portuguese to embrace that religion; and, like all other converts, they are bigoted in proportion to their ignorance.
