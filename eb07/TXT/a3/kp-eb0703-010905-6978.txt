ANCONA, a delegation or province of the Papal States, in Italy, a part of the ancient mark of Ancona. It is bounded on the north by Urbino, on the east by the Adriatic Sea, on the south by Macerata, and on the west by Urbino. Its extent is 646 square miles, or 413,440 acres. It is a mountainous district, with scarcely any plains; but between the projections of the Appenines there are some valleys, watered by the Musone, the Esino, the Aspino, and several smaller mountain rivers, which yield good crops of corn, maize, garlic, fruit, almonds, tobacco, and some silk. Agriculture is much neglected, but more attention is paid to cattle. The delegation contains 3 cities, 17 market-towns, and 34 villages; and in 1816 the number of inhabitants was 147,355, who, besides agriculture, find employment in manufactures of linen, silk, stockings, paper, and some other articles. The country is remarkably healthful.

Ancona, the capital of the delegation of the same name. The city is in lat. 43° 43' 36" N. and long. 12° 42' 27" E. It is situated on the declivity of a tongue of land projecting into the Adriatic Sea, on which, after the destruction of the fortifications in 1815, a strong fort was built as a defence towards the sea. It has three gates towards the land. The most striking objects are the government palace, the town-house, the exchange, and the cathedral built at the extremity of the cape, on the site of an ancient temple of Venus. There is a college, an hospital, and several monasteries and nunneries. The inhabitants in 1816 were 29,792, among whom were 5000 Jews, who live in a separate quarter. The streets are narrow, and far from clean. There is a fine mole 2000 feet in length, on which a lazaretto and quarantine-house is built. The harbour is capacious, but complaints are made of the mud gradually increasing and injuring it. The trade is carried on by means of about 1100 vessels, which arrive and depart annually. This place endured a long siege in the year 1799, but at length the French garrison who defended it surrendered to a combined army and navy of Russians, Austrians, and Turks.
