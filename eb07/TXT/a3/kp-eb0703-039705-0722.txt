ARCHCHANCELLOR, a high officer, who in ancient times presided over the secretaries of the court. Under the first two races of the kings of France, when their territories were divided into Germany, Italy, and Arles, there were three archchancellors; and hence the three archchancellors still subsisting in Germanyâ€”the archbishop of Mentz being archchancellor of Germany, the archbishop of Cologn, and the archbishop of Treves.
