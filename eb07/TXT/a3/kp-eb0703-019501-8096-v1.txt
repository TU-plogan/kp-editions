Five years after, his father was obliged to quit Scotland with his family, on account of their loyalty to the king, and adherence to the episcopal government established by law in that country. In 1651 young Annand was admitted a scholar in University College, Oxford; and though he was put under the care of a presbyterian tutor, yet he took all occasions to be present at the sermons preached by the loyal divines in and near Oxford.
