ASCHAM, Roger, a very distinguished scholar and Writer, was born at Kirby Wiske, a village in Yorkshire, near Northallerton, about the year 1515. John Ascham, his father, was house-steward in the family of Scroop, and by his wife, Margaret, was connected with several respectable families. A short time before his death, Sir Anthony Winfield, having conceived a predilection for his third son Roger, took him into his family, and extended his bounty so far as to give him the advantage of a private education along with his own sons. Under a domestic tutor he made a rapid progress in classical learning, and early discovered a great partiality for reading. The superiority of genius and docility of temper which he constantly displayed induced his patron to send him to’St John’s College, Cambridge, in the year 1530.

The revival of Grecian and Roman literature at the period Ascham entered upon his studies was peculiarly favourable to the natural bent of his inclination. A desire of excelling uniformly influenced his conduct, and, adopting the maxim, Qui docet, discit, he began to teach boys the rudiments of the Greek language as soon as he was acquainted with the elementary parts himself. His plan was approved by Pember, and under the direction of this valuable friend he soon became acquainted with the best Greek and Latin authors. But he took particular delight in reading Cicero and Caesar, and upon them formed the elegance of his Latin style, which proved so honourable and so advantageous in the after part of his life.

Ascham took his first degree of bachelor of arts in his 18th year, and was chosen fellow of the college about a month afterwards. The favourable disposition, however, which he manifested towards the reformed religion was no small obstacle in the way of his preferment. He was elected master of arts in the year 1537, and about this period he began to act in the capacity of a tutor.

His reputation for Greek learning soon brought him many pupils; and these were so well instructed that several of them afterwards rose to considerable eminence, Of these William Grindall was one of the most distinguished, who obtained the station of master of languages to the lady Elizabeth, upon the recommendation of Sir John Cheke. It appears uncertain why Ascham himself was not appointed to that honourable station; but his partiality for the university seems, from a hint in one of his letters, to have been the cause. At that period there was no particular chair appropriated to the Greek language, but Ascham was appointed by the university to read lectures upon that language in the schools. A dispute arose in the university at that time about the pronunciation of the Greek language, in which Ascham first opposed the method observed by Sir John Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith; but, upon more mature deliberation, he adopted that method, which has ever since been practised in the English schools. Both on account of the beauty of his handwriting, and the purity and elegance of his Latin, he was employed to write the public letters of the university.

By the advice of his friend Pember, he turned his attention to the study of instrumental music, and thereby enlivened his leisure hours, and prepared his mind for renewed exertion. In his study he also amused himself with embellishing the pages of his manuscripts with beautiful draughts, and in the field he joined in the diversion of the bow and arrow. The learned Ascham did not deem his labour improperly bestowed in writing a book entitled Toxopliilus, in an age when the proper use of the bow was of more importance than for mere amusement. This work was written in a more natural, easy, and truly English diction than had hitherto been in use; and it also abounds with many beautiful allusions and curious fragments of English history. Ascham candidly acknowledges, that being anxious to make the tour of Italy, which was then the great republic of letters, and particularly of Grecian literature, he wished, by dedicating his book to the king, to obtain a pension, to enable him to make that tour. It reflects some lustre on the benevolence of Henry VIII. that in the year 1544 he settled upon him an annual pension of L.10, which Dr Johnson, considering the circumstances of the times, estimates at the value of L.100. Upon the death of Henry this pension was for some time discontinued; but it was again renewed by Edward VI., and doubled by Queen Mary. In the same year, also, Ascham obtained the ap-pointaient[7:3:664] of orator to the university; an office which he retained with great reputation during the period he was connected with the university.

For some years he received an annual gratuity from Lee, archbishop of York, but to what amount is not recorded; and, in 1548, upon the death of his pupil Grindall, preceptor to the lady Elizabeth, his pupils and writings had acquired him such celebrity, that he was appointed to direct the studies of that princess. He successfully acquitted himself in that honourable charge; but two years after, from some unknown cause of dissatisfaction, he returned to the university, having taken an abrupt leave of the princess. This part of his conduct did not lessen him in the esteem of Elizabeth; for in the same year she recalled him to court, and appointed him secretary to Sir Richard Morisine, ambassador to the emperor Charles V. In his way to London he paid a visit to Lady Jane Gray, whom he found in her chamber reading Plato’s Phoedo, in Greek, “and that,” says he, “with as much delight as some gentlemen would read a merry tale in Boccace while the duke and duchess, and the rest of the household, were hunting in the park.

In the character of secretary to Sir Richard, besides aiding him in the management of his public affairs, he also conducted his private studies. During the mornings of four days in the week he read with him a portion of Herodotus or Demosthenes, and in the evenings some pages of Sophocles or Euripides; and on the other mornings he wrote the letters of public business, and on the evenings he either wrote his own private letters or continued his diary and remarks. While Ascham was on his travels, he made a short excursion to Italy; but was much disgusted with the manners of the people, especially of the Venetians. After his return from that tour, he favoured the world with a curious tract, entitled A Report and Discourse of the Affairs and State of Germany, &c.

Upon the death of Edward VI. Morisine was recalled, and Ascham returned to the university. But through the interest of Bishop Gardiner, the fortune of Ascham soon took a favourable turn, who, although he knew him to be a Protestant, obtained him the office of Latin secretary to the queen, with liberty to retain his university emoluments, and the additional salary of L.10 a-year. The prudence of Ascham enabled him to act a respectable part, both under the intolerant reign of Mary, and also in the most perilous situations during the reign of Eliźa-beth; and the readiness and elegance of his Latin style rendered him a useful member at court. He is reported to have written, during the course of three days, 47 letters to persons in the highest ranks of life.

When the crown passed to a Protestant prince, it made little alteration in the condition of Ascham, who still retained his station. He spent several hours every day in reading the learned languages with the queen, and her proficiency was equal to his labours; and it might have been expected that his rewards would have been more ample than L.20 per annum, together with the prebend of Westwang. Some have alleged that the queen kept him poor because he was addicted to cock-fighting, and in other respects extravagant; but the defects in his character should not have deprived him of the rewards due to actual services.

In consequence of a conversation which took place in the apartment of secretary Cecil, upon the subject of education, Sir Richard Sackville, who was present, requested him to write a book on the general subject of education. This work is entitled The Schoolmaster, and contains many excellent instructions to the teachers of youth. It was published by his widow after his death. By too close application to composing a poem, which he intended to present to the queen on the new-year’s day of 1569, he was seized with an illness which proved fatal, and died on the 23d of December 1568. His death was universally lamented, and the queen expressed her regret by saying, that “she would rather have lost L.10,000 than her tutor Ascham.” His epistles, which are valuable both on account of their style and historical information, were published after his death, and dedicated to the queen: the best edition is that of Mr Elstob, published at Oxford in 1703. His English works were published in 4to, with a life by Dr Johnson, in 1767. This edition has been reprinted in 8vo.
