ARNWAY, John, a clergyman distinguished by his benevolence and loyalty to King Charles I., was descended from a very good family in the county of Salop, from which he inherited a considerable estate. He was educated at Oxford; and, having received holy orders, obtained the rectories of Hodnet and Ightfield, where he distinguished himself by his piety and exemplary charity; for it was his custom to clothe annually twelve poor people, and every Sunday to entertain as many at his table, not only plentifully, but with intimacy and respect. The civil war breaking out, he preached against rebellion, and raised and clothed eight troopers for the service of King Charles I., upon which his house was plundered by the parliament’s army. He then went to Oxford to serve the king in person, which subjected him to a new train of misfortunes; for his estate was soon after sequestrated, and . himself imprisoned till the king’s death; after which he went to the Hague, where he published, 1, The Tablet, or the Moderation of Charles I. the Martyr; and, 2, An Alarm to the Subjects of England. He at last went to Virginia, where he died in 1653.
