ANGOU, a small province in the kingdom of Congo, of which, nearly two centuries ago, it rendered itself independent. It extends along the northern bank of the Congo or Zaire, from its junction with the sea upwards. A great proportion of the surface is covered with forests and swamps: cultivation has made little progress, and the population is thin. Captain Tuckey’s expedition must have sailed along the coast of Angou, though it did not recognise it under that name, which was given by the old Portuguese writers. Bomangoi, in the interior, is stated to be the capital; but Cabenda, near the mouth of the Zaire, is the seat of trade, which consists chiefly in slaves, and was considerable previous to the prohibition of that traffic by the British government. See Congo. »
