ANNESLEY, Arthur, earl of Anglesea, and lord privy seal in the reign of King Charles II., was the son of Sir Francis Annesley, baronet, Lord Mount-Norris, and Viscount Valentia, in Ireland, and was born at Dublin on the 10th of July 1614. He was for some time at the university of Oxford, and afterwards studied the law at Lincoln’s Inn. He had a considerable share in public transactions, for in the beginning of the civil war he sat in the parliament held at Oxford; but afterwards became reconciled to the opposite party, and was sent commissioner to Ulster, to oppose the designs of the rebel Owen Roe O’Neal. He engaged in several other affairs with great success. He was president of the council of state after the death of Oliver, and was principally concerned in bringing about the Restoration, soon after which King Charles II. raised him to the dignity of a baron, by the title of Lord Annesley of Newport-Pagnel, Bucks; and a short time after he was made earl of Anglesea. During that reign he was employed in some very important affairs, was made treasurer of the navy, and for some time held the office of lord privy seal. He was a person of great abilities, of very extensive learning, and was well acquainted with the constitution and laws of England. He died in April 1686, in the 73d year of his age.

Truth unveiled, in behalf of the Church of England; being a Vindication of Mr John Standish’s Sermon, preached before the king, and published by his Majesty’s command. 1676, 4to.

A true Account of the whole Proceedings between James Duke of Ormond and Arthur Earl of Anglesea, before the king and his council, &c. 1682, folio. 4. A Letter of Remarks upon Jovian. 1683, 4to. Besides these, he wrote several other works, some of which were published after his decease; as, 5.
