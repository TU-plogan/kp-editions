ARNAUD Belgard, a town of Turkey in Europe, in Albania. It is situated on the Chervesta, 40 miles N. E. of Vallona, in a fertile plain, covered with vines and olives. It is the seat of a Greek bishop, and contains 11,500 industrious inhabitants, who trade largely.

Arnaud de Meyrveilh, or Mereuil, a poet of Provence, who lived in the beginning of the 13th century. He wrote a book entitled Las Recastenas de sa Contesse, and a collection of poems and sonnets. Petrarch mentions him in his Triumph of Love. He died in the year 1220.

Arnaud de Ronsil, George, son of an eminent surgeon at Paris, and some time professor of surgery in the college of St Côsme. On account of an accident that occurred while he was practising midwifery, he removed from Paris to London, where he acquired great repute by his operations, and his writings on surgical subjects. Before his time the treatment of hernia had been but imperfectly understood; and the surgeons of this country are indebted to the observations of Arnaud for many of those improvements which have since rendered their practice so successful in this branch of the art. The following is a list of his principal works:—1, Traité des Hernies ou Descentes, 2 vols. 12mo, Paris, 1749. 2, Observations on Aneurysms, London, 1750. 3, Instructions on the Diseases of the Bladder and Urethra, London, 1763. 4, A Dissertation on Hermaphrodites, London, 1750. These were afterwards collected and published, with additions, under the title of Mémoires de Chirurgie, avec quelques Remarques sur l’Etat de la Médecine et de la Chirurgie en France et en Angleterre, 2 vols. 4to, London, 1768. 5, Remarks on the Use of the Extract of Lead of Goulard, London, 1776. Arnaud died in 1774.

Arnaud de Villa Nova, a famous physician, who lived about the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century. He studied at Paris and Montpelier, and improved himself by visiting the schools of Italy and Spain. He was well acquainted with languages, particularly with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic. His desire after the acquisition of knowledge was ardent, but it carried him too far in his researches. He put unlimited faith in astrology, and published a prediction that the consummation of the world would take place in the middle of the 14th century. He practised physic at Paris for some time; but having advanced some new doctrines, he drew upon himself the resentment of the university; and his friends, fearing he might be arrested, persuaded him to retire from that city. Upon his leaving France he went to Sicily, where he was received by king Frederic of Arragon with the greatest marks of kindness and esteem. Some time afterwards this prince sent him to France to attend pope Clement in an illness; and he was shipwrecked on the coast of Genoa about the year 1313. His works, with a life prefixed, were printed at Lyons in 1520, in one volume folio, and at Basil in 1585, with the notes of Nicholas Tolerus.
