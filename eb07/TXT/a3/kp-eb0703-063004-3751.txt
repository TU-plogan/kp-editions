ARRIAN, a philosopher and historian, who flourished in the time of the emperor Adrian and the two Antonines, was born at Nicoedia in Bithynia. His learning and eloquence procured him the title of The Second Xenophon, and raised him to the most considerable dignities at Rome, even the consulship itself. Many of his pieces have been lost. Of his dissertations upon Epictetus, there have been preserved four of the eight books which he wrote. His history of the expeditions of Alexander the Great, in seven books, is the most valuable of his remains. The work entitled the Periplus of the Red Sea has been ascribed to him by many, but, as Dr Vincent contends, erroneously. (See Vincent, Dr William.) The best editions of Arrian are those of Gronovius and Schmei-der; the one published in 1704, the other in 1798.
