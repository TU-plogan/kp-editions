ANTESIGNANI, in the Roman armies, soldiers placed before the standards, in order to defend them, according to Lipsius; but Caesar and Livy mention the antesignani as the first line or first body of heavy armed troops. The velites, who used to skirmish before the army, were likewise called antesignani.
