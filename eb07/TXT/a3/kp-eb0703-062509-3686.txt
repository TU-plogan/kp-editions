ARPINAS, or Arpino, Joseph Caesar, a famous painter, born in the year 1560, at the castle of Arpinas, in the kingdom of Naples. He lived in great intimacy with Pope Clement VIII. who conferred upon him the honour of knighthood, and bestowed many other marks of his friendship. In the year 1600 he went to Paris with Cardinal Aldobrandin, who was sent legate to the French court on the marriage of Henry IV. with Mary of Medici. His Christian majesty gave Arpinas many considerable presents, and created him a knight of St Michael. The colouring of this painter is thought to be cold and inanimate; yet there is spirit in his designs, and his compositions have somewhat of fire and elevation. The touches of his pencil being free and bold, give therefore pleasure to connoisseurs in painting; but they are generally incorrect. What he painted of the Roman history is the most esteemed of all his works. He died at Rome in 1640.
