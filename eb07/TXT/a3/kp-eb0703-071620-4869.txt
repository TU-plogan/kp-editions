ASSUMPTION, a festival in the Romish church, in honour of the miraculous ascent of the Virgin Mary into heaven. The Greek church also observes this festival, and celebrates it on the 15th of August with great ceremony.

Assumption, in Logic, is the minor or second proposition in a categorical syllogism.

Assumption, or Assongong, one of the Marianne or Ladrone Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, of a conical figure, .and 600 feet in height. It is of a dreary aspect, and almost totally covered with lava from the eruptions of a volcano in the centre. It has no anchorage near the shore. Long. 140. 55. E, Lat. T9. 45. N.
[7:3:717]

Assumption, an island iri North America, in the Gulf of .St Lawrence, at the mouth of the great river of the same name. Long. 60. 40. W. Lat. 49. 30. N.

Assumption, the capital city of the province of Paraguay in South America. It is situated on an obtuse angle formed by the eastern bank of the river Paraguay, 18 miles above the junction of the first mouth of the Pilcomayo, and 48 above that of the second. It was originally a small fort, but, from the convenience of its situation, in a few years it became a city, and in 1547 was erected into a bishopric. The adjacent territory is rich and fertile in a high degree, and abounds in a great variety of fruits. The air is temperate and the climate salubrious; the trees are perpetually green, and the rich pastures in the neighbourhood feed numerous flocks of cattle. The city is inhabited by Spaniards, Indians, and Mestizoes, who trade in hides, tobacco, and sugar. The Paraguay affords a channel of communication between Buenos Ayres and this place; but the passage is long, owing to the rapid flow of the waters of that river: this, however, is considerably obviated by the favourable winds which blow from the south for a great part of the year. Long. 59. 35. W. Lat. 24. 47. S.
