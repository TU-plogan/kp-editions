ANGERMUNDE, a circle in the government of Potsdam, and province of Brandenburg, in Prussia. It extends over 503 square miles, or 321,920 acres; and comprehends six cities, three market-towns, 109 villages, and 4201 dwellings, with 34,896 inhabitants. The river Oder washes its eastern boundary, and receives the several smaller streams by which it is watered. The borders of the rivers present some excellent meadow-land, on which many cattle are pastured. It produces good corn, tobacco, flax, and abundance of garden fruit. There is much wood land, and several lakes which yield fish in great plenty. The capital, of the same name, contains three churches, 291 houses, and 2654 inhabitants, whose chief occupation is making snuff and tobacco.
