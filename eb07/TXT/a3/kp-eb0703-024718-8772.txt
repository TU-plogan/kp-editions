ANTESTARI, in Poman Antiquity, signifies to bear witness against any one who refused to make his appearance in the Roman courts of judicature, on the day appointed, and according to the tenor of his bail. The plaintiff finding the defendant after such a breach of his engagement, was allowed to carry him into court by force, having first asked any of the persons present to bear witness. The person asked to bear witness in this case expressed his consent by turning his right ear, which was instantly taken hold of by the pÄ¾aintiff; and this was to answer the end of a subpaena. The ear was touched upon this occasion, says Pliny, as being the seat of memory, and therefore the ceremony was a sort of caution to the party to remember his engagement.
