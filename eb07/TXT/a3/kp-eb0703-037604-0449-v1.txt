ARBUTHNOT, Alexander, principal of the university of 'Aberdeen in the reign of James VI. of Scotland, was born in the year 1538. He studied first at Aberdeen, and was afterwards sent over to France, where, under the famous Cujacius, he applied himself to the study of the civil law. In the year 1563 he returned to Scotland and took orders. Whether he was ordained by a bishop or by presbyters is a matter of uncertainty. In 1568 he was appointed minister of Arbuthnot and Logie Buchan; and in the following year Mr Alexander Anderson being deprived, our author was made principal of the King’s College at Aberdeen in his room. In the general assembly which met at Edinburgh in the years 1573 and 1577 he was chosen moderator, and to the end of his life was an active supporter of the reformed religion. He died in 1583, in the 45th year of his age, and was buried in the College church of Aberdeen. It was by him that Buchanan’s History of Scotland, published in 1582, was edited. The only production of his own is his Orationcs de Origine et Dignitate Juris, printed at Edinburgh in 1572, 4to. His contemporary Thomas Maitland wrote a copy of Latin verses on the publication of this book: they are printed in the Delit. Poet. Scot. The same collection contains an elegant epitaph on him, written by Andrew Melvil.

Arbuthnot, John, Μ. D. the son of an episcopal r clergyman in Scotland, was born soon after the Restoration, at Arbuthnot near Montrose. After acquiring a competent knowledge of the elementary parts of education, he was sent to the college of Aberdeen, where the buddings of those great qualities and those sallies of wit, which contributed so much to his future greatness, soon made their appearance. Having there gone through a course of academical studies, and obtained the degree of doctor of physic, he went to London in order to reap the fruits both of his natural and acquired abilities. He then began to display his talents in teaching mathematics, in which he was very expert. An Examination of Dr Woodward’s Account of the Deluge, &c. in 1697, first made him known to the learned world. This performance was received with great applause; and in 1700 a treatise On the Usefulness of Mathematical Learning still increased his reputation. A very interesting paper On the Regularity of the Births of both Sexes, demonstrating from authentic proofs the universal similarity which is observed by nature in this circumstance, and drawing from these Several political and moral inferences, which he presented to the Royal Society, procured his election in 1704 into that body. Meanwhile, in his own proper profession, he Was acquiring considerable eminence, and was appointed, on account of his great medical knowledge, physician extraordinary to Prince George of Denmark, and shortly afterwards one of the physicians in ordinary to Queen Anne. He was admitted in 1710 a fellow of the college. He formed about this period a very intimate acquaintance, Which lasted with unabating tenderness and affection during the rest of his life, with these great literary men, Pope, Gay, and Swift. In 1714 he engaged in an extensive design of making a satire upon all the abuses of science in every branch, in co-operation with Pope and’ Swift, which was to be written under the form of the history of a fictitious character, and in the grave ironical style. The plan was never finished, but the Memoirs 0 f Martinus Scriblerus, published in Pope’s works, form a part, of which much is the performance of Dr Arbuthnot. It is very probable that the whole of the first book is of his composition, in which the great profoundness of knowledge that is discerned, and the good-natured pleasantry with which the satire is directed, has gained it the character of one of the most original, learned, and interesting pieces in the English language. Those parts which relate to anatomy, the manners and customs of antiquity, and logic, are particularly his performance. On the death of Queen Anne he made a visit to Paris, in order to drive away the melancholy which attended him on account of that circumstance, which was a severe stroke to him, and destructive not only to his personal, but also to his political views. Returning from thence, as his medical services were no longer required at St James’s, he retired from it, and followed at large the practice of his profession; yet he did not thcnce give up his literary pursuits, but pursued them with great ardour, although long intervals took place between the times of his publications. A work entitled Tables of Ancient Coins, Weights, and Measures, explained and exemplified in several dissertations, appeared in 1727, in a 4to volume, which is the chief of his serious performances. Although there are several inaccuracies in it which could hardly be avoided in so intricate a subject, it is a work of great merit, and has ever since been considered as the standard authority. A treatise On the Nature and Choice of Aliments, which was published in 1732, and another published in 1733, On the Effects of Air on Human Bodies, finish the list of his sterling works. Both these were well received by the faculty, and continue to be still esteemed, and are occasionally read and quoted. Respecting his humorous works, which were the productions of his leisure hours, they are so confounded with those of his contemporaries, that it is not easy to distinguish them. But a piece which, independent of any other, would raise him to the character of the first humorous writer in the English language, entitled the History of John Bull, is confidently ascribed to him. This is conducted with great wit and humour, and all the circumstances and characters are most admirably adapted. Among his several avowed ironical pieces are, A Treatise concerning the Altercation or Scolding of the Ancients, and the Art of Political Lying.

In the year 1751 there were published two small volumes, entitled The Miscellaneous Worhsof Dr Arbuthnot', but the greater part of what they contain is denied by his son to be of his composition. As it was customary for him, when any comical occurrence took place, which struck his fancy, to write concerning it in a large folio which lay in his parlour, it is very probable that many slight and imperfect essays, which had gone out of his remembrance, might get abroad into the world. Through all his pieces of this kind there runs a vein of good-natured pleasantry; and this tends to confirm the character given of him by Swift, to a lady who desired to know his opinion concerning Dr Arbuthnot, “He has more wit than we all have, and his humanity is equal to his wit. Although his writings are free from that gall and rancour too common among party writers, yet they cannot be said to be altogether free from a party spirit; and in one ι∏∙ stance he cannot be excused for allowing his personal disíike to overrule his humanity, viz. in the Memorandums of the six days preceding the death of a late T i 9 [7:3:377] Reverend (meaning Bishop Burnet). The indignation of a virtuous man towards an infamous character is sufficient to justify his severity in his bitter Epitaph on Colonel Chartres, and this severity was probably aggravated by party spirit. Although he had no proper poetical talent, yet he made an effort to try his genius in that kind of composition. A piece published in Dodsley’s collection is valuable for its philosophical sentiment. It is entitled ΓN∩ΘI ΣEA^fTON, Know thyself. He was also skilled in musie; and Sir J. Hawkins mentions an anthem and a burlesque song whieh are ascribed to him.

In these occupations he passed his days, amid all the pleasures that can render domestic life happy, in the affection and estimation of his friends, beloved and esteemed by all his literary associates, who have each taken great pains to celebrate their mutual friendship. Swift, in one of his poems, sincerely laments that he is
Far from his kind Arbuthnot’s aid,
Who knows his art, but not his trade.

Pope has dedicated to him an epistle called a Prologue to the Satires. He was full of humility and resignation in all the dispensations of Providence. Of his two sons, he witnessed the’death of one; and the other, with some daughters, survived him. At length, from an inveterate asthma, he fell into a dropsical disorder; and, in order to try the effect of a change of air, he repaired to Hampstead, but without the least gleam of hope respecting a recovery, as he assured his friends Pope and Swift. Returning to his house in London, he died February 27, 1734-5.
