ANHALT-KOTHEN, an independent duchy in Germany. It .consists of four fragments,' intermingled with thelerritories of surrounding princes.· The most compact portion are the three bailiwicks around the capital. The duchy iš on· both sides of the river Elbe, though only one of its towns, Roslau, comes in contact with that stream, the others reaching it by the rivers Ziethe, the Saale, the Ruthe, or the Wipper.

The chief of that surplus consists of corn, wool, and fruit, especially apples, with which the duchy supplies Berlin to a great extent. The revenue amounts to about L.23,000 sterling, of which the ducal patrimony in Silesia forms L.9000.
