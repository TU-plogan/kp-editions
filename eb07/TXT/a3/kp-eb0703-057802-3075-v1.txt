ARMOUR, a defensive habit, wherewith to cover and secure the body from the attacks of an enemy. In ancient statutes this is frequently called harness. A complete armour anciently consisted of a casque or helm, a gorget, cuirass, gauntlets, tasses, brassets, cuishes, and covers for the legs, to which the spurs were fastened. This formed armour cap-a-ļñe, and was used by the cavaliers and men-at-arms. The infantry had only part of it, viz. a pot or headpiece, a cuirass, and tasses; but all light. Lastly, the horses themselves had their armour, wherewith to cover the head and neck. Of all this furniture of war, scarce any thing is now retained except the cuirass; the gorget or neck-piece worn by officers being at present only a badge of honour, and of no defence.

Armour, Coat, is the escutcheon of any person or family, with its several charges, and otheŗ furniture; as mantling, crest, supporters, motto, &c. Thus we say, a gentleman of coat armour, meaning one who bears arms.
