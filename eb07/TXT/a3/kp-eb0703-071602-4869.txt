ASSER, John, or Asserius Menevensis, that is, Asser of St David’s, bishop of Sherburn in the reign of Alfred the Great. He was born in Pembrokeshire in South Wales, and educated in the monastery of St David’s by the archbishop Asserius, who, according to Leland, was his kinsman. In this monastery he became a monk, and by his assiduous application soon acquired universal fame as a person of profound learning and great abilities. Alfred, the munificent patron of genius, about the year 880 sent for him to court. The king was then at Dean in Wiltshire. He was so charmed with Asser that he made him his preceptor and companion. As a reward for his services, he appointed him abbot of two or three different monasteries; and at last promoted him to the episcopal see of Sherburn, where he died and was buried in the year 910. He was, says Pitts, a man of happy genius, wonderful modesty, extensive learning, and great integrity of life. He is said to have been principally instrumerital in persuading the king to restore the university of Oxford to its pristine dignity and lustre. He wrote De Vita et Rebus Gestis Al-fredi, first published by Archbishop Parker in the old -Saxon character, at the end of Walsinghami Hist. Lond. ,1574. It was reprinted at Frankfort in 1603, in folio, and in 8vo at Oxford in 1722. Various other works have been ascribed to this author by Pitts and by Leland.
