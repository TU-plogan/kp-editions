ARANJUEZ, a town of Spain, about 20 miles from Madrid. It is situated on the banks of the Tagus, a little below the junction of the rivers Xarama, Manzanares, and Tajuna with that stream. The town is small, but well built, and the principal street, the Calle Peyna, is one of the most beautiful in Spain. Near this town is one of the royal residences. The palace has been built and ornamented with most profuse expense by several successive monarchs. The expenditure on this place is estimated to have amounted to more than L.500,000 sterling between the years 1763 and 1776. The gardens were much improved by Wall, the extravagant minister of the grandfather of the present king. Having the advantage of the Tagus and several tributary rivulets, their waters have been employed in forming fountains and . cascades among the various beautiful retreats which the woods afford. The buildings are both spacious and magnificent; and the apartments arc, or rather, before the French plunderers visited it, were, adorned with some exquisite paintings from the pencil of Titian and of Mengs. When this place was first appropriated as a royal residence, Charles HI. was principally induced to occupy it for the sake of the game which abounds, to the pursuit of which hc was excessively addicted. The injury done to the occupiers of the land in the vicinity of Aranjuez by the parties of the royal establishment was such that the compensations which the king made to them for the damages sustained amounted in some years to the enormous sum of L.70,000 sterling. The town contains, when the court is at Aranjuez, about 10,000 inhabitants Lat. 40. 1. 54. N.
