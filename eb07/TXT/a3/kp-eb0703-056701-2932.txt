ARIUS, a divine of the fourth century, the head and founder of the Arians, a sect which denied the eternal divinity and substantiality of the Word, was born in Libya. Eusebius, bishop of Nicoedia, a great favourite of Constantia, sister of the emperor Constantine, and wife of Licinius, became a zealous promoter of Arianism. He took Arius under his protection, and introduced him to Constantia; so that the sect increased, and several bishops embraced it openly. In the cities, however, disputes arose so high, that the emperor was obliged to assemble a council—that of Nice—where, in the year 325, the doctrine of Arius was condemned, he himself banished by the emperor, all his books ordered to be burnt, and capital punishment denounced against whoever dared to keep them. After five years’ banishment, he was recalled to Constantinople, where he presented the emperor with a confession of his faith, drawn up so artfully, that it fully satisfied him. Notwithstanding which, Athanasius, now advanced to the see of Alexandria, refused to admit him and his followers to communion. This so enraged them, that by their interest at court they procured the deposition and banishment of that prelate. But the church of Alexandria still refusing to admit Arius into their communion, the emperor sent for him to Constantinople, where, upon delivering in a fresh confession of his faith in terms less offensive, the emperor commanded Alexander, the bishop of that church, to receive him the next day into his communion; but that very evening Arius died suddenly. The heresy, however, did not expire with the heresiarch: his party continued still in great credit at court. Athanasius, indeed, was soon recalled from banishment, but as soon removed again; for the Arians, under the countenance of government, made and deposed bishops as it best served their purposes. In short, this sect shone with great lustre above 300 years. It was the reigning religion of Spain for above two centuries; it was on the throne both in the East and West; it prevailed in Italy, France, Pannonia, and Africa; and was not extirpated till about the end of the 8th century. It was afterwards set on foot in the West by Servetus. Erasmus seems to have aimed at reviving it in his Commentaries on the New Testament; and the learned Grotius appears to favour the doctrine.
