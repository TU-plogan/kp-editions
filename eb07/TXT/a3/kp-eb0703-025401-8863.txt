ANTIPATER, the disciple of Aristotle, and one of Alexander the Greatâ€™s generals, was a man of great abilities, and a lover of the sciences; but was accused of poisoning Alexander. He subdued the revolted Thracians, relieved Megalopolis, and overthrew the Spartans there. He died 321 years before the Christian era.

Antipater, an Idumean of illustrious birth, and possessed of great riches and abilities, taking advantage of the confusion into which the two brothers Hyrcanus and Aristobulus plunged Judea by their contest for the office of high priest, took such measures as to gain for Hyrcanus that office, and under his government to obtain the absolute direction of all affairs; while his great abilities and application to business made him so considerable, that he was honoured as much as if he had been invested with the royal authority in form: but he was at last poisoned by a Jew named Malachus, 43 years before the Christian era. He left, among his other children, the famous Herod, king of the Jews.

Antipater, Caelius, a Roman historian, who wrote a history of the Punic war, much valued by Cicero. The emperor Adrian preferred him to Sallust.

Antipater of Sidon, a Stoic philosopher, and likewise a poet, commended by Cicero and Seneca. He flourished about the 171st Olympiad. We have several of his epigrams in the Anthologia.
