ANNUALRENT, in Scotish Law, denotes the yearly interest or profit due by a debtor in a sum of money to a creditor for the use of it.â€”A Right of Annualrent was the original method in Scotland of burdening lands with a yearly payment for the loan of money, before the taking of interest was allowed.
