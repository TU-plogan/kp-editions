AQUAMBOE, a large kingdom in the interior of the Gold Coast of Africa, extending 20 miles along the banks of the Rio Volta, which separates it from Aquapim, and reaching 100 miles inland. About a century ago it was considered the most powerful kingdom on all this coast, and the king held all the neighbouring potentates as his subjects or tributaries. His despotism gave rise to a proverbial saying, that “there are only two ranks of men m Aquamboe, the royal family and slaves.” The natives are haughty, turbulent, and warlike; and their territory, though fertile, is indifferently cultivated. Like all the countries in the interior from the Gold Coast, it is now entirely subject to the preponderant power of the king of Ash an t ee.
