ARMS, Arma, in a general sense, includes all kinds of weapons, whether for defence or offence. Arms of stone and of brass appear to have been, used before those of iron and steel. Josephus assures us that the patriarch Joseph first taught the use of iron arms in Egypt, arming the troops of Pharaoh with a casque and buckler. What contributed most to render the Romans masters of the world was, that having successively warred against all nations, they constantly renounced their own methods, arms, &c. wherever they met with better. Thus Romulus, during his war with the Sabines, a bold and warlike nation, adopted their broad buckler, in lieu of the small Argian buckler, which he had used till that time.

Arms, or Armories, in Heraldry, marks of dignity and honour, regularly composed of certain figures and colours, given or authorized by sovereigns, and borne on banners, shields, coats, &c. for the distinction of persons, families, and states, and passing by descent to posterity. They are called arms, in regard they were borne principally on the buckler, cuirass, banners, and other apparatus of war. They are also called coats of arms, coat armour, &c. because anciently embroidered on surcoats, &c. See Heraldry.
