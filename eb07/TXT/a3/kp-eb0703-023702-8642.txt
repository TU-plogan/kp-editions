ANSARIANS, a people of Syria, so called in the country, but styled in Delisle’s maps Ensarians, and in those of D’Anville Nassaris. The territory occupied by the Ansarians is that chain of mountains which extends from Antakia to the rivulet called Nahr-el-Kabir, or the Great River. They are divided into several tribes or sects, among which are distinguished the Shamsia, or adorers of the sun; the Kelbia, or worshippers of the, dog; and the Kadmousia, who are said to pay a particular homage to that part in women which corresponds to the priapus.
