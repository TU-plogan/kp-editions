ANCYLOGLOSSUM (from αy%ι∣λoς, crooked, and yλωo ’ tfa, the tongue), a contraction of the ligaments of the tongue. Some have this imperfection from their birth, others from some disease. In the first case, the membrane which supports the tongue is too short or too hard; in the latter, an ulcer under the tongue, healing and forming a cicatrix, is sometimes the case. These speak with some difficulty. The ancyloglossi by nature are late before [7:3:110]they speak; but when they begin, they soon speak properly. These we call tongue-tied. .
