ARGUS, in fabulous history, was the son of Aristor, and had 100 eyes, 50 of which were always open. Juno made choice of him to guard Io, whom Jupiter had transformed into a white heifer; but Jupiter, pitying Io for being so closely confined, sent Mercury, who with his flute charmed Argus to sleep, scaled up his eyes with his caduceus, and then cut off his head; when Juno, to reward his fidelity, turned him into a peacock, and placed his eyes in his tail.

ARGUS-SHELL, a species of porcelain shell, beautifully variegated with spots, resembling in some measure those in a peacockâ€™s tail.
