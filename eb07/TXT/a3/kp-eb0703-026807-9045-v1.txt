ANTISTHENES, a Greek philosopher, and founder of the Cynics. He was born at Athens, and passed the former part of his life as a soldier. Having afterwards been an attendant at the lectures of Socrates, he was principally charmed with those exhortations of that great philosopher which persuaded to frugality, to temperance, and to moderation; these Antisthenes was resolved to practise by carrying every precept to its utmost extent Permitting, therefore, his beard to grow, he went about the streets in a thread-bare coat, scarcely to be distinguished from a common beggar. He prided himself upon the most rigid virtue, and thought himself obliged to attack the vicious wherever he found them. This gave him some reputation in the city; but it may be supposed that, in a place so very luxurious as Athens, he had more enemies than disciples. His philosophy consisted rather in action than in speculation: it was therefore his constant maxim, that to be virtuous was to be happy, and that all virtue consisted in action; that the wise man should live for himself, contented in all situations, and happy alone in the consciousness of his own virtue. He acknowledged nothing to be good but what was honourable, and asserted that virtue might be acquired by practice. Diogenes Laertius tells us there were 10 volumes of his works; and he has given us many of his apophthegms.
