APOLLODORUS, a famous architect under Trajan and Adrian, was born at Damascus. He had the direction of the bridge of stone which Trajan ordered to be built over the Danube in the year 104, which was esteemed the most magnificent of all the works of that emperor. Adrian, one day as Trajan was discoursing with this architect upon the buildings he had raised at Rome, would needs give his judgment, and showed he understood nothing of the matter. Apollodorus turned upon him bluntly, and said to him, “Go paint gourds, for you are very ignorant of the subject we are talking upon.” Adrian at this time boasted of his painting gourds well. The insult cost Apollodorus his life.

Apollodorus, a celebrated painter of Athens about 408 years before the birth of Christ, was the first who invented the art of mingling colours, and of expressing lights and shades. He was admired also for his judicious choice of subjects, and for beauty and strength of colouring surpassed all the masters that went before him. He excelled likewise in statuary.

Apollodorus the Athenian, a famous grammarian, the son of Asclepiades and disciple of Aristarchus. He wrote many works not now extant; but his most famous production is his Bibliotheca, which treats of the gods and the heroic ages. It is supposed by some that this is only an abridgement by another hand, and not the original work of Apollodorus. In any view it is, however, of value in mythological inquiries. The best edition is that of Heyné, in 2 vols. 8vo, published in 1803. A French translation, with notes, was published at Paris in 1805, in 2 vols. 8vo.
