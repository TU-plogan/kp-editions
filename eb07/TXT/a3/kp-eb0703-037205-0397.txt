ARAFAT, Mount, a celebrated mountain in Arabia, held in high veneration by the Mahometans. A visit to this mountain constitutes a necessary part of the religious pilgrimage to Mecca; which we have described at [7:3:373]length under the article Arabia. The mountain consists of a granite rock about 150 feet high, which is ascended by staircases, partly cut in the rock and partly composed of solid masonry. On the summit is a chapel, which the Mahometans believe to have been built by Adam. On this hill also Adam is said to have met his wife Eve after a long absence; and it is thence called Arafat or Gratitude. The interior of the chapel was destroyed by the Wahabys in 1807.
