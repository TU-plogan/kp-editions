+====================================================================+


ASHMOLE, Elias, an industrious English antiquary and philosopher of the 17th century, was born at Lichfield in 1617. Having enjoyed the advantages of a country education, he went to London at the age of 16, and resided in the family of James Paget, Esq. one of the barons of the exchequer, and then turned his attention to the law and various branches of literature. In the year 1638 he married, and commenced the business of attorney in London. When the civil war began, he, being then a widower, entered into the king’s service in the ordnance department. When residing in the city of Oxford in that capacity, he entered Brazen Nose College, and began the study of natural philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. Naturally inclined to grave and scientific trifles, he wandered too far into the wilds of astrological imposture, not a little encouraged by several eminent meh of that age. From the same cause he entered keenly into the secrets of masonry, and made considerable additions to the history of that sect.

When Worcester was surrendered to the parliament in 1646, Ashmole retired to London, where he became acquainted with the famous astrologers, Moore, Lilly, and Booker. Having removed to Berkshire in the year following, he added the knowledge of botany to his other acquirements. There he became acquainted with lady Mainwaring, a well-jointured widow, whom he married in 1649; and although her estate was sequestrated on account of his loyalty, yet through the interest of Lilly and others he again recovered it, and afterwards settled in London, where his house became the resort of all the curious literati. A taste for chemistry, or rather alchemy, was produced, by his conversation with William Blackhouse; and Ashmole, under a feigned name, published a work upon that subject. The next effort of his industry was a collection of the manuscripts of English alchemy, which he published under the title of Theatrum Chymicum Britannicum, in 4to. This work was the effect of great labour arid expense; and although it procured him much fame among the learned, yet it was only a collection of Alchemy, — he appears to have been ignorant of real chemical knowledge. About this period he began to number among his acquaintances Selden, Oughtred, and Dr Wharton.

The wealth he acquired by his marriage engaged him in several disputes, and the lady herself at last made an attack upon him in chancery, but he was honourably acquitted, and the lady restored to her affectionate husband. His active industry never wearied, and he next attended to the study of antiquity and the investigation of records. Along with Sir W. Dugdale, he about this period traced a Roman road to Lichfield. Abandoning all other pursuits, he began to make preparations for his History of the Order of the Garter. Upon a visit to Oxford, he gave a full description of the coins bequeathed to that university by Laud; and about this time John Trades-cant, the famous gardener of Lambeth, presented him with the collection of curiosities which both he and his father had procured.

Upon the restoration, Ashmole was greatly respected by the king, who made him Windsor herald, and employed him to give a description of the royal medals. The offices of commissioner and comptroller of excise were conferred upon him; and being called to the bar in the Middle Temple, he was afterwards admitted a fellow of the Royal Society. The university of Oxford conferred upon him the degree of doctor of physic; and several other employments and emoluments were given him, until he rose to the highest eminence in the literary world. About this time his second wife died, and he married the daughter of his friend Sir W. Dugdale. In May 1662 he addressed his great work to the king, entitled The Institution·) Laws, and Ceremonies of the most noble Order of the Garter ; folio, London, 1672. In favour of his brother-in-law Mr Dugdale, he resigned his office of herald of Windsor; and when offered the office of garter king-at-arms, he declined it in favour of Sir W. Dugdale. About this time a fire broke out in one of the chambers of the temple [7:3:671] adjacent to his, and consumed a library which he had been collecting during the course of 33 years, together with 9000 coins and many valuable antiquities; but his manuscripts and gold medals fortunately were saved. In 1683 he sent his manuscripts and curiosities to the university of Oxford, which laid the foundation of the AIu-saeum Asĥmoleanum, still in Oxford. On the death of Sir W. Dugdale, he refused a second time the office which that gentleman had enjoyed. He died at the age of 76, and was interred in the church of Great Lambeth.
