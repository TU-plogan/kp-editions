ANCYLE, in Antiquity, a kind of shield that fell, as was pretended, from heaven, in the reign of Numa Pompilius; at which time, likewise, a voice was heard declaring that Rome should be mistress of the world as long as she should preserve this holy buckler. It was kept with great care in the temple of Mars, under the direction of 12 priests; and, lest any should attempt to steal it, 11 others were made so like as not to be distinguished from the sacred one. These ancylia were carried in procession every year round the city of Rome.
