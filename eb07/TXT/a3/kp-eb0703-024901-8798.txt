ANTHROPOSCOPIA (from av0ζω<πος, and ffκmω, I consider), the art of judging or discovering a man’s character, disposition, passions, and inclinations, from the lineaments of his body; in which sense anthroposcopia seems of somewhat greater extent than physiognomy or metoposcopy. Otto has published an Anthroposcopia, sive judicium hominis de homine ex lineamentis externis.
