ANDROS, one of the ancient Cyclades, lying between Tenos and Euboea, being one mile distant from the former, and ten from the latter. The ancients gave it various names, viz. Cauros, Lasia, Nonagria, Epagris, Antandros, and Hydrusia. The name of Andros it received from one Andreus, appointed, according to Diodorus Siculus, by Rhadamanthus, one of the generals, to govern the Cyclades after they had of their own accord submitted to him. It had formerly a city of great note, bearing the same name, and situated very advantageously on the brow of a hill which commanded the whole coast. In this city, according to Strabo and Pliny, stood a famous temple dedicated to Bacchus. Near this temple Mutianus, as quoted by Pliny, tells us there was a spring called the gift of Jupiter, the water of which had the taste of wine in the month of January, during the feast of Bacchus, which lasted seven days. The Andrians were the first of all the islanders who joined the Persians when Xerxes invaded Greece; and therefore Themistocles, after the victory at Salamis, resolved to attack the city of Andros, and oblige the inhabitants to pay large contributions for the maintenance of his fleet. Having landed his men on the island, he sent heralds to the magistrates, acquainting them that the Athenians were coming against them with two powerful divinities, Persuasion and Force, and therefore they must part with their money by fair means or foul. The Andrians replied that they likewise had two mighty deities, who were very fond of their island, viz. Poverty and Impossibility, and therefore could give no money. Themistocles, not satisfied with this answer, laid siege to the town, which he probably made himself master of and destroyed, as we are informed by Plutarch that Pericles, a few years after, sent thither a colony of 250 Athenians. It was, however, soon retaken by the Persians, and, on the overthrow of that empire by Alexander the Great, submitted to him, along with the other islands. On his death it sided with Antigonus, who was driven out by Ptolemy. The successors of the last-mentioned prince held it till the time of the Romans, when Attalus, king of Pergamus, besieged the metropolis at the head of a Roman army, and, having taken it, was by them put in possession of the whole island. Upon the death of Attalus the republic claimed this island, as well as his other dominions, in virtue of his last will.

Andros is now subject to the Turks, and contains a town of the same name, with a great many villages. It is the most fruitful island in the Archipelago, and yields a great quantity of silk. Andros, when visited by Tournefort, contained about 4000 inhabitants. There were seven monasteries, a great number of churches, and a cathedral for the bishops of the Roman Catholic persuasion; but most of the inhabitants were of the Greek communion. It forms a part of the new Greek republic. It is about 23 miles long and 6 broad. Long. 24.50. E. Lat. 37.50. N.
