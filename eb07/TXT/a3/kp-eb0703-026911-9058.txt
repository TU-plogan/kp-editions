ANTONIANO, Silvio, a man of great learning, who raised himself from a low condition by his merit, was born at Rome in the year 1540. When he was but ten years old he could make verses upon any subject proposed to him. The duke of Ferrara, coming to Rome to congratulate Marcellus II. upon his being raised to the pontificate, was so charmed with the genius of Antoniano, that he carried him to Ferrara, where he provided able masters to instruct him in all the sciences. From thence he was sent for by Pius IV., who made him professor of the belles lettres in the college at Rome. Antoniano filled this place with so much reputation, that, on the day when he began to explain the oration pro Marco Marcello, he had a vast crowd of auditors, and among these no less than 25 cardinals. He was afterwards chosen rector of the college; and after the death of Pius IV., being seized with a spirit of devotion, he joined himself to Philip Neri, and accepted the office of secretary to the sacred college, offered him by Pius V., which he executed for 25 years with the reputation of an honest and able man. He refused a bishopric which Gregory XIV. would have given him; but he accepted the office of secretary to the Briefs, offered him by Clement VIII., who made him his chamberlain, and afterwards a cardinal. Antoniano injured his health by too great fatigue; for he spent whole nights in writing letters; which brought on a sickness, of which he died in the 63d year of his age.
