ARCOT, a large district of Hindostan, under the presidency of Madras, to which it was transferred in 1801, being previously an independent state. It is now divided into north and south, and, since 1809, when an improved mode of management was introduced, the condition of the country has been greatly ameliorated under the British administration. The limits of northern Arcot, though they are not very exactly defined, may be stated to be, on the north Cuddapah and Nellore; southern Arcot on the south; the district of Chingleput and the sea on the east; and Balaghaut of Cuddapah on the west. It is watered by the river Palar, and the chief towns are Arcot, Wallajanagur, Vellore, and Tripetty. Southern Arcot has the northern division of Arcot for its boundary on the north; Tanjore and Trichinopoly on the south; on the east the Chingleput district and the sea; and Salem and the Balaghaut Carnatic on the west. The principal trading ports are Cudalore and Porto Novo. The population of both these districts amounted, according to returns received in 1822, to 1,347,312 persons.

Arcot, a city of Hindostan, and formerly the capital of the Carnatic, situated on the south side of the river Palar, which has a channel half a mile in breadth; but, except during the season of the rains, is nearly dry. The town is extensive, and is built round a large fort, of which the principal defences were destroyed more than twenty years ago, and its area is now under cultivation. The town is defended from the inundations of the river when it is swollen by the rains by the remaining ramparts of the fort, which on that side are kept in good repair. It is inclosed by walls, and contains the former palace of the nabobs of Arcot, which, with the exception of a gateway still entire, is in ruins; a handsome Mahometan mosque, and four or five other well-built religious edifices of the Mahometans, and numerous tombs. Arcot is supposed to have been the capital of the Sorae, or the Soramundalum of Ptolemy, whence by an easy derivation Coromandel; but the present town is entirely of modern date. The Mogul armies, after they had captured Gingee, found the situation sυ unhealthy that they were forced to remove to the plains of Arcot, and began to build the present town about the year 1716. The nabob of Arcot, Anwanud Deen, being killed in battle in 1749, the place was taken by his competitor, who was supported by the French. In 1751 it was retaken by Colonel Clive with 500 troops, from a garrison of 1100 men; and here that gallant soldier maintained himself for fifty days against the attacks of the French and their Indian allies, who were finally compelled to raise the siege. It was afterwards taken by the French, but was recaptured in 1760 by Colonel Coote, after the battle of Wandewash. Hyder Ali gained possession of it for a time after he had defeated the British under Colonel Baillie in 1780. Travelling distance, 217 miles E. of Seringapatam, 73 W. of Madras, 1070 S. W. of Calcutta, and 1277 S. of Delhi. Long. 79. 22. E. Lat. 12. 52. N.
