ARNISAEUS, Henningus, a philosopher and physician of great reputation about the beginning of the 17th century. He was born at Halberstadt in Germany, and was professor of physic in the university of Helmstadt. His political works are much esteemed. The most remarkable of them is his book De Authordate Principum in Populum semper Inviolabili, printed at Frankfort in 1612. In this he maintains that the authority of princes ought not to be violated. He wrote also upon the same doctrine his three books, De Jure Majestatis, printed at the same place in 1610; and his Reflectionâ€™s Politicae, printed at Frankfort in 1615. He went to Denmark by invitation, and was made counsellor and physician to the king. He travelled [7:3:624] into Trance and England, and died in November 1635. Besides the pieces already mentioned, he wrote several philosophical, medicinal, and poetical treatises.
