APPIUS Claudius, a Sabine by birth, one of the principal inhabitants of Regillum. His shining merit having drawn the envy of his fellow-citizens upon him, he retired to Rome with all his family. Appius was admitted into the senate, and was made consul with Publius Servilius Priseus in 258 from the building of Rome; but he was hated by the plebeians, being an austere opposer of their clamours and seditions. The Claudian family continued long one of the most illustrious of the patrician families in Rome, and several in succession of the name of Appius supported the same stern character that distinguished their first founder.
