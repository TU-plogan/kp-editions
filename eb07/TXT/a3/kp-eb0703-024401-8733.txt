ANTA, in the Ancient Architecture, a square pilaster placed at the corners of buildings.

Anta, or Ahanta, a small kingdom on the Gold Coast of Africa, extending about ten leagues in length, between Apollonia and the Fan tee territory. The country is covered with large trees, among which stand a number of fine villages. The soil is exceedingly rich, and considered superior to any other on the Gold Coast. Every kind of tropical produce is there reared with advantage, and the sugar-cane grows to a great size and of excellent quality. It contains various species of valuable dyeing and ornamental woods, one of which is considered little inferior to mahogany. There are supposed to be mines of gold in the territory; but the ruling powers do not encourage the working of them, which would perhaps require more skill than the people possess. Gold, however, may be obtained in considerable quantities, being brought down from the interior countries of Warsaw and Dinkira∙ The air is also much more salubrious than in any other place of this coast, the number of deaths' being observed to be smaller than in any other part of Guinea. Formerly Anta was potent and populous, inhabited by a bold and rapacious people, who greatly annoyed the Europeans by their frequent incursions; but by continual wars-with • their neighbours they are now greatly enfeebled, and are disposed to seek protection from the Dutch and other Europeans who have forts On this coast, and to maintain a friendly intercourse with them. Axim, DixcoVei and Succondee are the principal towns; and many commodious [7:3:245]creeks and havens are found along the coast. The British government, however, having since the abolition of the slave-trade limited in a remarkable degree its intercourse 'with the Gold Coast, has withdrawn the garrisons which it maintained in the three places above mentioned.
