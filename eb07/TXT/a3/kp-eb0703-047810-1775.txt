ARDRAH, a considerable town, capital of a territory of the same name, situated on the Slave Coast of Africa. It lies about twenty-five miles inland, on the interior shore of a lake nearly 60 mdes in length and from 3 to 12 in breadth, agreeably diversified with numerous islands. The surrounding country is fertile and beautiful, abounding in the tropical products of sugar-cane, cotton, maize, and fine indigo. Ardrah, with all this coast, was in 1724 conquered and dreadfully desolated by the king of Dahomey, to whom, in 1772, it still continued subject, and had only imperfectly regained its prosperity. Since that time the preponderance acquired by the kingdom of Eyeo or Yarriba, lately visited by CTapperton, has rescued it from this yoke; and it forms now nearly an independent republic, under the protection of that state. The internal constitution is nearly democratic, though there are some great merchants who possess considerable influence. The people are industrious, manufacturing cloth both from cotton and grass, and working with some skill in iron and leather. The population is reckoned by Adams at nearly 10,000, among whom, to his surprise, he found a number of Mahometans who had come from Houssa, with which there is a pretty direct communication through Eyeo. They have introduced the use of horses as domestic animals, and of milk as an article of diet, neither of which is known on any other part of the coast. The market, held every sixth day, presents a crowded and busy scene, at which are exhibited the manufactures of Europe, particularly of Manchester and Silesia, mingled with the calicoes of India, and with cloths and dyed leather brought from the interior countries; also tobacco fronr Brazil, coral, beads, &c. Several of the merchants possess considerable wealth, and imitate in a good measure the European dress, furniture, and mode of living. Long. 3. 42. E. Lat. 6. 26. N.
