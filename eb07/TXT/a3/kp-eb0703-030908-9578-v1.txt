APPLICATION, in a general sense, is the laying of two things together, in order to discover their agreement or disagreement.

Application, in Geometry, is used either for division; for applying one quantity to another, whose areas, but not figure, shall be the same; or for transferring a given line into a circle or other figure, so that its ends shall be in the perimeter of the figure.

Application, in Theology, is particularly used by some divines for the act whereby our Saviour transfers or makes over to us what he had earned or purchased by his holy life and death. Accordingly it is by this application of the merits of Christ that we are to be justified and entitled to grace and glory. The sacraments are the ordinary means or instruments whereby this application is effected.
