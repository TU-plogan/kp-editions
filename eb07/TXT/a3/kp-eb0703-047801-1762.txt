ARDELAN, a province of Persia, which forms the eastern division of Kurdistan. It extends in length 200 miles from the little river Sharook to the Turkish district of Zohaub, and it is nearly 160 miles in breadth. It is divided from the plain of Hamadan by a small range of hills, and its western boundary is 100 miles beyond Senna, the capital, which is situated in long. 40. E. and lat. 35. 12. N. 60 miles from Hamadan. From the Sharook, which separates the province from Azerbijan, to Senna, the country presents either a succession of -hills clustered together, and heaped upon each other, or great table-lands covered with the flocks and tents of wandering shepherds, who pass the summer here, and migrate in the winter to the vicinity of Bagdad. The soil in the valleys or glens, which are narrow strips at the foot of the mountains, is fertile, and yields abundance of wheat and barley. The oil plant is everywhere cultivated, and also tobacco, though in small quantities. The deep valley in which the capital is situated is well cultivated, and interspersed with orchards of fruit-trees. The mountains to the west are covered with forests of oak, which produce fine timber, and abundance of gall-nuts, which are exported to India, while the oak is floated down the Tab into the Tigris. The inhabitants, and other pastoral and rude tribes, make little use of the natural advantages of the country, being addicted to war, cruelty, and rapine. There is another tribe of shepherds named Gheshkee, who are most expert and daring robbers. These tribes arc under the government of a powerful chief, who pays an annual tribute to Persia, but is in all other respects independent. He rules over his vassals with the most absolute power, but is said to govern rather like a patriarch than a tyrant.
