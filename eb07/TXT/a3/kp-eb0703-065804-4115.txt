ARVIRAGUS, an ancient British king, who flourished in the time of the emperor Domitian. He gained a complete victory over Claudius; but being soon after besieged in the city of Winchester, he made a treaty with the Romans, and married the emperorâ€™s daughter Genu-issa. This'monarch lived to a good old age: he confirmed the ancient laws, enacted new ones, and liberally rewarded persons of merit.
