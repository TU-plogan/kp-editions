ARTEMIDORUS, famous for his Treatise on Dreams, was born at Ephesus, and lived under the emperor Antoninus Pius. He styled himself the Ephesian in all his performances but that on Dreams, where he took the cognomen of Daldianus, in compliment to his mother country Daltis. On this work he expended vast labour, not only possessing himself of all that had been written on the subject, but travelling for years in search of fortune-tellers, as well as corresponding with them in various parts, and collecting information on old dreams, and the events which were said to have followed them. It consisted of five books, and, though abounding in frivolous observations, contained others that were interesting. It was first printed in Greek at Venice in 1518; and Rigaltius published an edition at Paris, in Greek and Latin, in 1603, to which he added some notes. Artemidorus wrote also a treatise upon Auguries, and another upon Chiromancy, but they are not now extant.
