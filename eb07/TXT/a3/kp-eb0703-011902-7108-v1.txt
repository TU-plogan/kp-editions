ANDORRE, or Andorra, a valley on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees, of about 190 square miles in extent, containing 6 parishes, and which has ever been considered as neutral. It is a hilly district, with some good pasture for sheep, and several mines of iron, whieh are worked by the numerous rapid streams that pass through the district in their course towards Catalonia. It is a kind of independent republie, governed by two deputies chosen in each of the six parishes, and by two syndics. The expenses of governing are defrayed by a species of rent paid by owners of flocks, to the community, for the use of the pasture land. The king of France is called the protector in civil affairs, and the bishop of Urgel in ecclesiastical matters. It enjoys its peculiar criminal and eivil laws and courts of justice. The chief judge is nominated alternately by the king of France and the bishop of Urgel, but there is no appeal to either France or Spain from his decisions. As the land does not produce sufficient corn for the supply of the inhabitants, a stipulated quantity is allowed annually to be introduced from France, for which permission a subsidy of 960 francs is granted to the king. The whole number of the inhabitants is about 15,000, who are neither French, nor Spaniards, nor Catalans, but speak a language containing a mixture of the three idioms. The council of state and the eourts of justice assemble at the village of Andorra, and the former body retain the ancient Spanish title of cortes.
