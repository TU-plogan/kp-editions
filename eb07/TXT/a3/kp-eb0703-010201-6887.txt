ANAXARCHUS, a Grecian philosopher, who lived under Philip of Macedon and Alexander, was born in Abdera, and belonged to the sect generally known by the name of the Eleatic. He is said to have been conducted in the progress of his early studies by the skilful hands of Diomenes of Smyrna and Metrodorus of Chios. He had the honour to be a companion of Alexander; and a few anecdotes transmitted to posterity concerning him render it evident that he treated him with the usual freedom of a friend. This philosopher candidly checked the vain-, glory of Alexander, when, elated with pride, he aspired to the honours of divinity, by pointing to his finger when it bled, saying, “Sec the blood of a mortal, not of a god.” It is likewise reported, that, on another occasion, while in-∣ dulging immoderately at a banquet, he repeated a verse from Euripides, reminding Alexander of his mortality. It is, however, to be regretted, that the fidelity of the philosopher was wanting at the time when the mind of Alexander was tortured with remorse at having slain his friend Clitus; for it is reported that he on that occasion endeavoured to soothe the agitated mind of Alexander, by saying, that “kings, like the gods, could do no wrong.” It is reported that Nicoreon, king of Cyprus, exposed him to the torture of being pounded in a mortar, and that he endured this torture with incredible patience; but as the same fact is reported of Zeno the Eleatic, there is reason to suppose that it is fabulous; and it may be added, that this narrative is inconsistent with the general character of Anaxarchus, who, on account of his easy and peaceable life, received the appellation of “The Fortunate.”
