ANNAN, a royal borough and parish of Scotland, in the county of Dumfries, situated on the river of the same name, about two miles above its junction with the Solway Frith. An elegant new bridge of three arches has been built within these three years. It has a good harbour; the highest tides rise 21 feet; 23 vessels belonged to the port in 1818, registering 1025 tons; at present (1830) there are 39 vessels, registering 3054 tons. These vessels are chiefly employed in the coasting trade. A cotton spinning manufactory has been long established in the town, giving employment to between 80 and 100 persons of different ages. The salmon fishery, which in former years was so very productive, has fallen off very considerably. The town has recently been much improved by the addition of several new streets and public buildings: among the latter is a handsome new academy, built and endowed by the heritors and borough-council; it is conducted by a rector and two masters, and is in a very flourishing state. The town unites with Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Sanquhar, and Lochmaben, in sending a representative to parliament. The environs are very inviting; and few places are more beautiful than the river and its finely wooded banks, for eight or ten miles above the town. There was formerly a castle, built by the Bruces after they became lords of Annandale. The population of the parish is 4500, of the town 3000. The latter is 16 miles from Dumfries, and 78 from Edinburgh.

The river Annan, on which the town stands, rises in the county of Peebles, and flowing through Dumfriesshire, falls into the Solway Frith after a course of 30 miles. It abounds with trout and salmon. The stewartry or district of Annandale, of which Lochmaben castle was the chief fortalice, is a fertile vale, 24 miles long and about 14 miles broad. From its vicinity to England, and the continual incursions and predatory wars of the borderers, the greater part of it was uncultivated and common; but since the beginning of the last century all these wast≡ 5 and commons have been subdivided and brought ⅛ t0 [7:3:195] culture, and the country has assumed a new appearance, which may be ascribed not only to the division of the commons, but likewise to the improvement made on the roads.

Annandale formed a part of the Roman province of Valentia; and Severus’s wall ending at Bowpess on the opposite coast of the Solway, it abounds with Roman stations and antiquities.

The Roman camps at Birrens in Middlebie, on the hill of Birrenswark, and at Torwood Muir in Dryfesdale, are still nearly entire, and their form is preserved; and the traces and remains of a military road are yet visible in different parts of the country. The ruins of the house or castle of Auchincass, in the neighbourhood of Moffat, once the seat of that potent baron Thomas Randolph, earl of Murray, lord of Annandale, and regent of Scotland during the minority of David II., covers above an acre of ground, and even now conveys an idea of the plan and strength of the building. The ancient castle of Comlongan, formerly belonging to the Murrays, earls of Annandale, and now to the earl of Mansfield, is still in a tolrable state of preservation; but except this castle, and that of Hoddam, most of the other old fortalices and towers are now taken down or in ruins.
