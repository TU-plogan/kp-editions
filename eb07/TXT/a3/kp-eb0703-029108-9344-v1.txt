APORON, or Aporime, a problem difficult to resolve, and which has never been resolved, though it be not in itself impossible. The word is derived from αwogcς, which signifies something very difficult and impracticable, being formed from the privative α, and ∙ποξος, passage. When a question was proposed to any of the Greek philosophers, especially of the sect of hcademists; if he cordd not give a solution, his answer was Affogsω, I cannot see through it. this word is also used by some law writers for an inexplicable speech or discourse.
