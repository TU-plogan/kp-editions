ARCIIIACOLYTHUS (from αgχρς, chief, and axoaou-A>i, minister), an ancient dignity in cathedral churches, the ministers whereof were divided into four orders or degrees, viz. priests, deacons, subdeacons, and acolythi, each of which had their chiefs. The chief of the accly-thi was called archiacolythus.
