ANDREASBERG, a bailiwick in the province of Grubenhagen, in the kingdom of Hanover. It extends over 87 square miles, or 55,680 acres, containing 4250 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in mining. The soil is very poor, and affords scarcely any produce; but, like the rest of the Hartz forest, it abounds with metallic substances. The capital of the bailiwick is of the same name. It is 1880 feet above the level of the sea, on the declivity of the Hartz mountains, containing 400 houses, and 3206 inhabitants, who subsist chiefly by mining, whilst the females are employed in making lace. Near it is the Andreasberg silver mine, from which is produced annually about 40,000 ounces of silver, besides a large quantity of lead and copper, all of which are smelted in the town.
