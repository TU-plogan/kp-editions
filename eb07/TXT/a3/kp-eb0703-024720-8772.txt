ANTHEM, a church song performed in cathedral service by choristers, who sung alternately. It was used to denote both psalms and hymns when performed in this manner; but at present anthem is used in a more confined sense, being applied to certain passages taken out of the Scriptures, and adapted to a particular solemnity. Anthems were first introduced, in tile reformed service of the English church, in the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
