APOTHECARY, one who practises the art of pharmacy. In London, the apothecaries are one of the city companies. They were incorporated by a charter from King James I., procured at the solicitation of Dr Mayerne and Dr Atkins: till that time they only made a part of the grocersâ€™ company; plums, sugar, spice, &c. being sold in the same shop and by the same person. By an act which was made perpetual in the ninth year of George I. they are exempted from serving upon juries, or in ward and parish offices. They are obliged to make up their medicines according to the formulas prescribed in the college dispensatory; and are liable to have their shops visited by the censors of the college, who are empowered to destroy such medicines as they think not good.
