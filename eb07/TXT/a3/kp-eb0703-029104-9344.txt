APOPEMPTIC, in ancient poetry, a hymn addressed to a stranger on his departure from a place to his own country. The ancients had certain holydays, wherein they took leave of the gods with apapemptic songs, as supposing them returning each to his own country. The deities having the patronage of divers places, it was but just to divide their presence, and allow some time to each. Hence it was that among the Delians and Milesians we find feasts of Apollo, and among the Argians feasts of Diana, called Epidemiae, as supposing these deities then more peculiarly resident among them. On the last day of the feast they dismissed them, following them-to the altars with apo-œÅemptic hymns.
