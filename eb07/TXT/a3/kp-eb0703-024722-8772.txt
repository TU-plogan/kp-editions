ANTHĘSTERIA, in Antiquity, was a feast celebrated by the Athenians in honour of Bacchus. The most natural derivation of the word is from the Greek αιθoς {fios), a flower, it being the custom at this feast to offer garlands of flowers to Bacchus.

The anthesteria lasted three days, the llth, 12th, and 13th of the month, each of which had a name suited to the proper office of the day. The first day of the feast was called ¢rôo/y/α, i. e. opening 'of the vessels, because on this day they tapped the vessels and tasted the wine. The second day they called γgος, congius, the name of a measure containing the weight of 10 pounds: on this they drank the wine prepared the day before. The third day they called '∕pryn, kettles : on this day they boiled all sorts of pulse in kettles; which however they were not allowed to taste, as being offered to Mercury.
