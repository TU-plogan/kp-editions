ANECDOTES (Anecdotd), a term used by some authors for the titles of Secret Histories ; but it more properly denotes a relation of detached and interesting particulars. The word is Greek, avixlorct, signifying things not yet known or hitherto kept secret. Procopius gives this title to a book which he published against Justinian and his wife Theodora. Anecdotes is also an appellation given to such works of the ancients as have not yet been published; in which sense Muratori gives the name Anecdota Groeca to several writings of the Greek fathers, found in the libraries, and first published by him. Martene and Durand have given a Thesaurus novus Anecdotorum, in 5 vols. folio.
