APOSTOLICUM is a peculiar name given to a kind of song or hymn, anciently used in churches. The apostolicum is mentioned by Greg. Thaumaturgus as used in his time. Vossius understands it as spoken of the apostlesâ€™ creed: Suicer thinks this impossible, because this creed was then unknown in the churches of the East.
