ASSAULT, in English Law, is an offer or attempt to hurt the person of another; as, if one lifts up his cane or his fist in a threatening manner at another, or strikes at him, but misses him, this is an assault; the actual touching of the person not being necessary to make the offence. Finch describes it to be “an unlawful setting upon one’s person.” No words whatsoever, be they ever so provoking, can amount to an assault. There are, however, opinions to the contrary.
