ASCENSION, a solitary island, or rather rock, in the midst of the Atlantic, about 700 or 800 miles from the western coast of Africa. It was discovered in 1501 by Joao de Nova Gallego, a Portuguese navigator, who named it Ilha de Nossa Senhora de Conceiçao. It was seen a second time by Alfonso d’Albuquerque, in his voyage to India in 1503, and then received its present name. As-censiθ[7:3:663] - n consists of a single rocky mountain, though shooting up into several detached peaks, of the most naked and desolate character, consisting in a'great measure of volcanic remains. The beach, always beat upon by a heavy surf, is covered with a sand of snowy whiteness, which, when acted upon by the sun, is intolerable to the eyes. The sides of the cliffs consist of lava, variously coloured, and in different stages of decomposition. Easter Island and Terra del Fuego do not present a more dreary aspect. At a considerable height occurs a plain about eight miles in circumference, from the south-east quarter of which there rises a lofty hill, presenting an appearance of verdure not discoverable in any other part of the island. Here is found a grass peculiar to the island, and a few goats are fed, whose flesh is extremely delicate. Notwithstanding the unproductive character of this island, its excellent harbour, and the fish, sea-fowl, and turtle, with which it abounds, have made it a place of refreshment for the homeward-bound shipping. A crevice in one of die rocks has been employed for depositing letters, to be taken up by the next ship passing in a contrary direction, and has been hence called the sailor’s post-office. Long.
