ANTALO, â considerable town of Abyssinia, capital of the flat and fertile district of Enderta, which is dependent on ligré. The town is built along the declivity of a mountain, commanding fine views over an extensive range of territory to the south. Though considered in Abyssinia a place of importance, its absolute magnitude is by no means very large. There are not more than 1000 houses, which, with the exception of that destined for the residence of the Ras or sovereign of Tigré, are no better than clusters of huts with conical thatched roofs. As Antalo stands near the border of the provinces now occupied by the Galla, that fierce and turbulent race, who have occupied a great part of Abyssinia, and whose armies continually threaten the rest, the Ras, to watch their movements, has fixed his usual residence at Antalo. There is at this place a manufactory of spears, which are much esteemed, and exported to various parts of the country.
