APONO, Peter d’, one of the most famous philosophers and physicians of his age, born in the year 1250, in a village about four miles from Padua. He was suspected of magic, and prosecuted by the inquisition. “The common opinion of almost all authors,” says Naudé, “is, that he was the greatest magician of his age; that he had acquired the knowledge of the seven liberal arts by means of the seven familiar spirits, which he kept inclosed in a crystal; and that he had the dexterity to make the money he had spent come back into his purse.” The śame author adds, that he died before the process against him was finished, being then in the 80th year of his age; and that, after his death, they ordered him to be burnt in effigy, in the public place of the city of Padua. Hc was the author of various works, the most remarkable of which are the following: Conciliator Differentiarum Philosophorum, first published in 1471; De Venenis eorumque Remediis, which was translated into French by Boet in 1593; Expositio Problematum Aristotelis, 1475; Geomantia, 1549; and Dionocides digestus Alphabet. Ord. 1512.
