ARVALES Fratres, in Roman Antiquity, a college of twelve priests, instituted by Romulus, and chosen out of the most noble families, he himself being one of that body. They assisted in the sacrifices of the ambervalia, annually offered to Ceres and Bacchus for the prosperity of the fruits of the earth, when they wore on their heads crowns made of ears of corn. The original of this institution was as follows: Acca Laurentia, Romulus’s nurse, was accustomed once a year to make a solemn sacrifice for a blessing on the fields, her twelve sons always assisting her in the solemnity; but at last losing one of her sons, Romulus offered himself to supply his place, and gave this small society the name of Arvales Fratres. This order was in great repute at Rome: they held the dignity for life, and never lost it on account of imprisonment, banishment, or any other accident.
