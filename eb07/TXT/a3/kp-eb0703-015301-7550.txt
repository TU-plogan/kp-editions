ANGON, in the ancient military art, a kind of javelin used by the^ French. They darted it at a considerable distance. The iron head of this weapon resembled a Heur-de-luce. It is the opinion of some writers that the arms of France are not fleurs-de-lucc, but the iron point or the angon or javelin of the ancient French.
