APPELLATIVE Names, in Grammar, in contradistinction to proper names, are such as stand for universal ideas, or a whole rank of beings, whether general or special. Thus, ι ∕⅛ bird, man, city, river, are common or appellative names; and so are trout, eel, lobster ; for they all agree to many individuals, and some to many species.
