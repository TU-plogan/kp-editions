APPLAUSE, an approbation of something, signified by clapping pre hands, still practised in theatres. Applause, m antiquity, differed from acclamation, as the latter was articulate and performed with the voice, the former with the hands. Among the Romans, applause was an artificial kind of noise made -by the audience or spectators to express their satisfaction. There were three species of applause, denominated from the different noises made in them, viz. Bombus, Imbrices, and Testae ; the first a confused din, made either by the hands or the mouth; the' second and third, by beating on a sort of sounding vessels placed in the theatres for this purpose. Persons were instructed to give applause with skill; and there were even masters who professed to teach the art. The proficients in this way let themselves out for hire to the vain-glorious among the poets, actors, &c., and were properly disposed to support a loud applause. These they called Laudicceni, and Σοβοκλί/;. At the end of the play a loud peal of applause was expected, and even asked of the audience, either by the chorus or the persons who spoke last. The formula was Spectatores plaudite, or Vakte et plaudite. The plausores or applauders were divided into chori, and disposed in theatres opposite to each other, like the choristers in cathedrals, so that there was a kind of concert of applauses.
