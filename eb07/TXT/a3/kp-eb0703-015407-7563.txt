ANHALT-BERNBURG, one of those small independent sovereignties still left in. Germany, and one of, the monuments of its ancient state. The sovereign bears the title of duke. His territories are much scattered between the Hartz forest and the, rivers Saale and Elbe. Their whole extent, is nearly 242 square, miles, or 154,880 English acres. It is divided into two parts, each of which is denominated a duchy. The upper duchy lies on the side and; at the; foot of the Hartz Mountains, and,-though hilly and woody,: has in it some beautiful valleys. The lower duchy, on the Elbe, is a flat marshy district,' but the part which touches the Saale is dry. and healthy. √In the lower duchy the climate is temperate and∙mild,ibut in the upper it is cold and raw, the harvests are late, and the fruits rarely come to perfect ripeness. The principal products are corn, flax; rapeseed, tobacco, garden fruits, and some wine. The country abounds with game, and the lakes and rivers with fish. There are some mines, which, yield silver, copper, iron, sulphur, alum, and gypsum. The inhabitants in 1817 were 37,046, in 7 cities, 54 villages, and 33 hamlets, and are all of the Protestant profession, The chief employment is agriculture, the next is mining, and preparing the metals; but some little woollen cloth and paper are manufactured. The sovereign rules without limitation. The revenue of the state is about L.45,000 annually, of which L.9000 is derived from the royalties of the forests and mines. The remainder is chiefly derived from the patrimonial lands of the prince, and a part from taxes imposed on the subjects, who are mostly in poor circumstances. The military force required for the contingent is 370 men, of whom 120 are kept up, but the landsturm, a kind of militia, including every man between 20 and 30, amounts to 7000, only 30 of whom have fire-arms.
