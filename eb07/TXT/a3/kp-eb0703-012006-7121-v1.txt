ANDREW, St, the apostle, born at Bethsaida in Galilee, brother to Simon Peter. He had been a disciple of John the Baptist, and followed Jesus upon the testimony given of him by the Baptist. (John i. 35, 40, &c.) This was the first* disciple whom our Saviour received into his train. Andrew introduced his brother Simon, and they passed a day with Christ, after which they went to the marriage in Cana (ibid, ii.), and at last returned to their ordinary occupation. Some months after, Jesus meeting them while they were both fishing together, called them to him, and promised to make them fishers of men. Immediately they left their nets, followed him (Matt. iv. 19), and never afterwards separated from him. After our Saviour’s ascension, his apostles having determined by lot what parts of the world they should severally take, Scythia and the neighbouring countries fell to St’Andrew, who, according to Eusebius, after he had planted the gospel in several places, came to Patrae in Achaia, where, endeavouring to convert the proconsul Aegeas, he was by that governor’s orders scourged, and then crucified. The particular time of his suffering martyrdom is not known; but all the ancient and modern martyrologies, both of the Greeks and Latins, agree in celebrating his festival upon the 30th of November.

Andrew, or Knights of St Andrew, an order of knights, more usually called the Order of the Thistle.

Knights of St Andrew is also an order instituted by Peter the Great of Muscovy in 1698, the badge of which is a golden medal, on one side whereof is represented St Andrew’s cross, with these words, Czar Pierre, monarque de tout le Russie. This medal being fastened to a blue ribbon, is suspended from the right shoulder.

St Andrew's Day, a festival of the Christian church, celebrated on the 30th of November in honour of the apostle St Andrew.
