ASPICUETA, or Azpilcueta, Martin de, commonly called the Doctor of Navarre, was descended of a noble family, and born on the 13th of December 1491, at Vara-sayn, a small city of Navarre, not far from Pampeluna. He entered very young into the monastery of regular canons at Roncevaux, where he took the habit, which he continued to wear after he left the convent. He studied classical learning, natural and moral philosophy, and divinity, at Alcala in New Castile, adopting chiefly the system of Petrus Lombardus, commonly called the Master of the Sentences. He applied himself to the study of the law at Ferrara, and taught it with applause at Toulouse and Cahors. After being first professor of canon law at Salamanca for 14 years, he quitted that place to be professor of law at Coimbra, with a larger salary. The duties of this office he discharged for the space of 20 years, and then resigned it to retire into his own country. Pope Pius V. made him assistant to Cardinal Francis Aciat, his vice-penitentiary; and Gregory XIII. never passed his door without calling for him, and stopped sometimes a whole hour to talk with him in the street. He was consulted as an oracle; and his name became so famous, that even in his lifetime the highest encomium on a learned man was to call him a Navarrus. He died on the 21st June 1586, having by temperance prolonged his life to the age of 94. He wrote a number of treatises on morality, law, &c. These were published in 3 vols, folio in 1589, and in 6 vols. 4to in 1602.
