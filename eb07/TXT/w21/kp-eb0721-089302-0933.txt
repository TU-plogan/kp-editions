WINDLASS, a machine used for raising huge weights, as guns, stones, anchors, &c. It is very simple, consisting only of an axis or roller, supported horizontally at the two ends by two pieces of wood and a pulley: the two pieces of wood meet at top, being placed diagonally so as to prop each other; the axis or roller goes through the two pieces, and turns in them. The pulley is fastened at top where the pieces join. Lastly, there are two staves or handspikes which go through the roller, whereby it is turned, and the rope which comes over the pulley is wound off and on the same.

Windlass, in a ship, is an instrument in small ships, placed upon the deck, just abaft the fore-mast. It is made of a piece of timber six or eight feet square, in form of an axletree, whose length is placed horizontally upon two pieces of wood at the ends thereof, and upon which it is turned about by the help of handspikes put into holes made for that purpose. This instrument serves for weighing anchors, or hoisting of any weight in or out of the ship, and will purchase much more than any capstan, and that without any danger to those that heave; for if, in heaving the windlass about, any of the handspikes should happen to break, the windlass would pall of itself.
