WELLINGBOROUGH, a market-town of the county of Northampton, in the hundred of Hamfordshoe, sixty-eight miles from London, and seven from Northampton, on the river Nen. It is a well-built town, in which the making of boots and shoes and bobbin lace is still carried on, though the latter trade has declined. Near to it are some medicinal springs, not now in request. From these the place derived its name. There is a good market on Wednesday. The population amounted in 1821 to 4454, and in 1831 to 4688.
