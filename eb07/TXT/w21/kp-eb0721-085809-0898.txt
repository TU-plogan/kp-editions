WERREAR, a district of Hindustan, on the north-west frontier of the province of Gujerat, extending along the banks of the Banass river. This country is famed for its excellent grass, to which it is indebted for its name, Wud-dyar or Wandyar signifying in the Gujerattee language a herdsman; and is resorted to by immense herds of cattle sent to pasture on the banks of the Runn. Sheep are cheap and abundant, and it produces also horses of a smaller breed than those of Cottiwar; but few are exported, those of a good quality being in great demand. The district is much infested by plundering Coolees, the principal haunts of these robbers being at Warye, fourteen miles south-west from Rahdunpoor, Barbere, twenty-four miles north, and Therwara, thirty miles north-west from Rahdunpoor, the latter possessed by the Balooches.
