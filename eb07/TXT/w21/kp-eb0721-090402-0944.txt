WIRSWORTH, a market-town of the county of Derby, in the hundred of its own name, 139 miles from London and twelve from the town of Derby. It is situated in a mining district, where it is the chief object to procure lead ore, and the silver frequently combined with it. The principal occupation is connected with the various processes of preparing these metals for use. There are laws regulating the mining, which are here administered by a court consisting of a steward and bar-mast, which has two sessions annually. In the neighbourhood, many millstones and grindstones are drawn from the quarries. Here are two springs, one hot, the other cold, so near together that a man may put a hand in each at the same time. There is a good market on Tuesday, and two fairs yearly. The population amounted in 1821 to 3787, and in 1831 to 4082; but the parish comprehends ten hamlets and townships besides, whose inhabitants amounted in 1831 to 7754.
