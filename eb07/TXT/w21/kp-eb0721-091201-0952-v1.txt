WODSTOCK, amarket and borough town of the county of Oxford, in the hundred of Wootton, sixty-three miles from London. It stands on a small stream that falls into the Isis. It is pleasantly situated, and contains some good houses. There are two branches of manufacture, that of fine leather gloves, and of good steel cutlery and steel ornaments; but they are more celebrated for the finish of the work than for the extent of their productions. Wodstock returns one member to parliament. There is a good market on Tuesday. The magnificent palace of the duke of Marlborough adjoins the town. The building, the gardens, the park, with the pictures and statues that adorn it, are objects of great attraction; and the numerous visitors to it contribute in some degree to the prosperity of the town. The population in 1821 amounted to 1455, and in 1831 to 1380.
