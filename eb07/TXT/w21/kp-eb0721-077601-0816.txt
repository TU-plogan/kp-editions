WARMINSTER, a market-town of the county of Wilts, in the hundred of its own name, ninety-seven miles from London and twenty-two from Salisbury. The river Willy runs through the town, and falls into the Avon. Warminster has a market on Saturday, at which the greatest quantity of corn is sold of any place in the county. It has some employment in making fine cloths, but of late years that trade has much diminished. It is considered one of the healthiest towns in England. There is a spacious parish church with a square lofty tower, and a chapel of ease, besides several places of worship for dissenting sects. The population amounted in 1821 to 5612, and in 1831 to 6115.
