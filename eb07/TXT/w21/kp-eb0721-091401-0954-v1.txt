WOLOGDA, one of those large divisions into which the European part of the Russian empire is formed, and commonly denominated a government or stadtholdership. The extent is given differently by several authors; but as Storch seems the preferable authority, it is here given according to his representation, at 151,074 square miles. It extends in north latitude from 58° 23’ to 64° 56', and in east longitude from 38° 47’ to 57° 10'. It is bounded on the north by Archangel, on the north-east by Tobolsk, on the south-east by Perm and by Wiatka, on the south by Kostroma, on the south-west by Jaroslaw, on the west by Novogorod, and on the north-west by Olonetz.

The surface of this province is a most extensive plain, on the eastern side touching the Ural Mountains, a few branches or spurs from which penetrate into the north-east part. Besides these, no hills are to be seen, and but few elevations, but immeasurable woods, broad heaths and morasses, small lakes, and especially a most abundant supply of water in streams of all dimensions. The soil is of various qualities, clayey, loamy, and sandy, and in some parts there is good marl. There are however some tracts of good alluvial soil to be found over the worst subsoils. In most parts it is capable of cultivation, but the best portions are the south-west parts of the province. Cultivation in the whole province requires watchfulness with respect both to the weather, the nature of the soil, the rotation of crops, and the nature and quantity of manure; but, with the greatest attention to them, it is not common to obtain more than five times the quantity of the seed that is sown, even of rye, which is the most extensive crop; whereas in barley and oats not three times the seed are commonly obtained. Besides those kinds of grain, a little winter wheat is sown, and some pease. It is only in very good years that sufficient corn for the consumption is grown. According to Storch, the annual quantity of rye and wheat together does not exceed four English bushels for each person. Flax and hemp succeed better than either kind of grain. In some of the divisions beyond the Dwina, no other corn but barley is attempted to be raised. In the northeast part no fruit is grown; but in the south-west, in the gardens, apples and cherries come to a tolerable degree of ripeness. The cultivation of potatoes has of late years been introduced or extended, and affords a prospect of increasing the means of subsistence.

The manufacturing industry is not considerable, and only extends to common necessaries, such as woollen and linen goods, from their own sheep and flax. A little paper, some glass and earthenware, and a few metal articles, form the chief part of the products, exclusive of the leather, and of the brandy, which is distilled from corn in prodigious quantities. During the long nights of winter, spinning flax or wool is the constant occupation of the females, and hence much yarn is produced and sold to other districts.

The trade is chiefly in domestic articles; and these are sent by the rivers or canals in summer, or on sledges in winter, to St Petersburg or Moscow, by merchants residing in the large towns. They are tallow candles, tar, peltry, feathers, isinglass, marts, hogs’ bristles, turpentine, potash, and some wooden furniture. There is a transit-trade, by which the productions of Siberia are exchanged with those of Archangel. The number of persons employed in internal navigation is very great; and besides these, others, living on the rivers that are not navigable, are employed in summer in forming rafts of timber, which are floated down by the stream till they reach the barges destined to convey them to the places where the timber is wanted.

The principal rivers are, lst, The Dwina, which is composed of several rivulets, which, when united, first receives that name within the province. It then receives the waters of the Wytschegda, the Sysola, the Wym, the Keltma, and the Ustjuga. After leaving the province, it is increased by the great stream of the Vaga and its tributary brooks, and runs to the sea at Archangel. 2d, The Petschora, a considerable river rising from the Ural Mountains, and forming a means of intercourse between Tobolsk, Wologda, and Perm. It is navigable during the whole summer, with a depth of from twelve to fourteen feet. There is also a canal, constructed in 1786, which connects the waters of the rivers that run to the Caspian with those that run to the Frozen Ocean. There arc many lakes, some of them [7:21:915] very extensive. The largest are the Kubenskoe, the Piati-sorskoi, the Sandor, and the Rondas. This vast province, which in extent is greater than Britain and Ireland, does not contain more than 940,000 inhabitants. These are divided into nobility, civil officers, clergy, colonists, merchants, citizens, and peasants; the last being by far the most numerous. They are in fact slaves, one third of whom belong to the nobility, and two thirds to the crown. The whole of the inhabitants profess the Greek religion, and are under the spiritual government of a bishop, whose see is in the city of Wologda. 'Γhe capital of the province, and also of a circle, is the city from which it takes its name. It stands on both sides the river Wologda, which divides it into two nearly equal parts, and is without fortifications. It contains fifty-one churches, of which six only are of stone, and the others wooden structures. It has a monastery, a nunnery, an ecclesiastical seminary, some charitable institutions, and public schools for 600 sons of the clergy. The dwellings are 1664, of which all but forty-five are of wood. The inhabitants are 12,100, among whom are many tanners, tallow-chandlers, and some makers of silk, linen, and woollen goods. The commerce chiefly consists of the produce of the soil, or of such manufactured goods as are of the simplest fabrication, which are sent to the seaports in exchange for the few foreign commodities which the condition of society may render desirable. The city is 870 miles from St Petersburg. Long. 40. 6. E. Lat. 59. 13. 30. N.
