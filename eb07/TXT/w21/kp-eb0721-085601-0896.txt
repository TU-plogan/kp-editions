WEIMAR, a city, the capital of the grand duchy of that name, in Germany. It stands on the river Ilm, and is surrounded with hills, some of which are covered with woods. The buildings are not remarkable, but are on the whole in a better style and condition than is to be seen in most of the towns in Germany of the same extent. The grand duke has a palace in an unfinished state, but with a valuable library, open to all the inhabitants; and some of the state-apartments are elegantly furnished. The liberal feelings of the reigning family have, by their patronage of the most accomplished men of Germany, given a celebrity to their capital to which it could not have attained on any other account. They brought there men like Schiller, Wieland, Herder, Goethe, and several others, who formed points of attraction, which drew towards them the minds of all literary Germans, and thus diffused a spirit and tone of the most elevating nature. The chief trade is that of composing and printing useful works, in a large establishment, in which are employed several hundred workmen, as authors, engravers, letter-founders, lithographers, and printers. The maps issued from it are generally very correct, and sold at low prices, to suit the finances of the great class of the people. The periodical works on surgery and medicine, and the geographical Ephemeriden, are of high reputation, and issued at similar low rates. One of the most attractive objects is the theatre. Here the plays of Schiller and of Goethe were first performed; and this theatre was during many years under the direction of the latter. Though but a small house, nothing can be more appropriate than the building, the decorations, and the stage accuracy in the common representations.

Weimar contains two Lutheran churches, a chapel for the Catholics, and for the Greeks, with a Jewsâ€™ synagogue. It is well furnished with schools for the several degrees of instruction, and prepares the pupils for the university of Jena, within the dominions of the same prince. There are many charitable institutions, such as an orphan-house, and several hospitals and poor-houses. At Belvedere, the prince has some very fine gardens, with green and hot-houses, and a fine collection of exotic plants. This forms one of the pleasant promenades by which the inhabitants of Weimar are gratified. The city being on the high road from Frankfort to Leipzig, is a great thoroughfare, and furnishes good accommodation for strangers at the hotels. In 1838 the inhabitants amounted to about 12,000.
