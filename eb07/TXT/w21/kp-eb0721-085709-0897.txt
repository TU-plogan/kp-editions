WEMYSS, Easter, a village, situated on the shores of the Firth of Forth, in the county of Fife. Its inhabitants, amounting in 1831 to 858, are principally weavers.

Wemyss, Wester, a seaport town about a mile distant from the above. It consists almost entirely of one street, which is in good order, as is also the small harbour. The principal business is connected with the exportation of coals from the extensive coal-mines belonging to the family of Wemyss, which have been worked for many centuries, and now extend to a considcrable distance under the sea. Weaving is also carried on by a few of the inhabitants. The population amounted in 1831 to 858.
