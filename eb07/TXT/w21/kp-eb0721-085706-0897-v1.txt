WELLS, a city of the county of Somerset, in the hundred of Wellsforum, 120 miles from London and eighteen from Bath. It is situated in a rich valley at the foot of the Mendip Hills, which supply abundance of coal. It is tolerably well built, though many of the houses are of an antique fashion, whilst others of more modern erection are very handsome. The streets are well paved, and remarkably clean. In conjunction with Bath, it is the seat of a bishop, whose palace in the city is one of the best episcopal residences in the kingdom. The cathedral is a spacious Gothic structure in the form of a cross, 380 feet long and 130 feet wide. The most remarkable part of the building is the west front, which is most elaborately ornamented with statues of most excellent carved work in stone. One of the windows contains some beautiful paintings on glass. The chapter-house is remarkable for its structure in the form of a rotunda, having its roof supported by a single pillar in the centre. The deanery is a handsome residence, and the houses of the vicars within the close are very commodious. Besides those belonging to the church, there are several other charitable establishments. Near the city is St Andrew’s Well, whose water is conveyed by pipes to an elegant conduit near the market-cross, and from thence runs through a part of the city. The civil government is vested in the corporation, consisting of a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors; and the city returns two members to the House of Commons. Besides the cathedral, is the parish church of St Cuthbert, with a lofty square tower, and a fine set of six bells; and various places of worship for dissenters. There are good markets on Wednesday and Saturday, and four annual fairs. There are horse-races yearly near the citv. The population amounted in 1821 to 5888, and in 1831 to 6649.

Wells, a market-town of the county of Norfolk, in the hundred of North Greenhoe, 118 miles from London. It stands on the shore of the German Ocean, has a small port and custom-house, but the trade is inconsiderable. The population, including that of the parish, which extends far beyond the town, amounted in 1821 to 2950, and in 1831 to 3624.
