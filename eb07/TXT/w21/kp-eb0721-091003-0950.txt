WOBURN, a market-town of the county of Bedford, in the hundred of Manshead, forty-two miles from London. It has a market on Friday. It is tolerably well built, but the most prominent object is the magnificent seat of the duke of Bedford, erected on the site of the ancient abbey. Its fa√ßade, the interior richly ornamented with pictures and statues, the splendid and appropriate furniture, with the extensive and picturesque park, and the beautiful gardens, attract numerous visitors. The population of the town amounted in 1821 to 1656, and in 1831 to 1827.
