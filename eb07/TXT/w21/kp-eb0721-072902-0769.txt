He became a gentleman commoner of Wadham College, Oxford, but left the university without taking a degree. His writings are to be found among the works of the Minor Poets, printed in 1749. He was [7:21:730]made gentleman of the horse in Queen Anneâ€™s reign, and died in 1708. He was the friend of Dryden and of Pope, the former of whom esteemed him the best critic then living; and Pope has celebrated his character in the Essay on Criticism.
