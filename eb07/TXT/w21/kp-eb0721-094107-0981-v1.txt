WORM, Olaf, or Olaus Wormius, a learned Danish physician, was born on the 13th of May 1588, at Arhusen in Jutland. After beginning his studies at home, he resided in several foreign universities, and travelled to various parts of Europe for improvement. After having taken the degree of M. D. at Basel, he returned to his native country in 1613, and was made professor of polite literature in the university of Copenhagen. In 1615, he was translated to the chair of the Greek professor; and in 1624 to the professorship of physic, which he held till his death. These occupations did not hinder him from practising in his profession, and from being the fashionable physician: the king and court of Denmark always employed him; and Christian IV., as a recompense for his services, conferred on him a canonry of Lund. He published some pieces on subjects relating to his profession; several works in defence of Aristotle’s philosophy; and several concerning the antiquities of Denmark and Norway; for which latter he is principally regarded, as they are very learned, and contain many curious particulars. He died on the 7th of September 1654.
