WAREHAM, a market-town of the county of Dorset, in the hundred of Winfrith and division of Blandford, 112 miles from London. It is situated on an eminence between the mouth of the rivers Frome and Piddle, and consists of four principal and several minor streets. The river Frome is navigable up to the bridge for small craft from Poole. This was formerly a place of more importance, having once seventeen churches, now reduced to three, one only of which is used. There are however several dissenting places of worship. It was once fortified, and some remains of the works are still visible. It has very little trade. The market is on Saturday. It returns, with the parishes of Corfe Castle and Bere Regis, one member to parliament. The population of Wareham amounted in 1821 to 1939, and in 1831 to 2325.
