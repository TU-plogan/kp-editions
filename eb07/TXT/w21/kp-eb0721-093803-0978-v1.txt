WOOLWICH, a large town and parish of the county of Kent, in the lathe of Sutton and the hundred of Black-heath, eight miles from London. It stands on the banks of the river Thames, and contains buildings of great extent connected with the public service, both naval and military. The dock-yard is well calculated for building and equipping ships of war of the largest size. It has attached to it an extensive rope-walk; the building called the Red House, for curing meat for the use of the navy; the government bake-house, a most extensive gun-yard, and magazines for securing in time of peace, and for arranging for immediate service, every thing requisite for fitting out a large fleet in a few days. The barrack for the artillery is a vast and magnificent pile of building, and near to a large field called the Warren, in which cannon and mortars are exercised, and experiments made in the practice of gunnery.

In an adjoining yard is the laboratory, where the several kinds of fire-working are carried on, and the most destructive projectiles are prepared. There is also the Royal Academy, with its appropriate professors and masters, in which the officers of the engineers and artillery receive their professional instructions. Woolwich has a good parish church; and the weekly market, on Friday, is well supplied. The population amounted in 1821 to 17,008, and in 1831 to 17,661.
