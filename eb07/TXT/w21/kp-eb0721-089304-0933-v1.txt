WINDSOR, a borough and market town of Berkshire, twenty-two miles from London, on the banks of the Thames. Old and New Windsor, the castle, and the hamlets of Clewer and Dedworth, are included in the parish. Windsor stands on the side and top of a hill sloping to the river. It is divided into two wards, and is governed by a mayor, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors, and it returns two members to the House of Commons. The parish church is a spacious building in the High-street; and near it is the town-hall, a neat structure supported by columns and arches of Portland stone. There are also many good houses belonging to individuals. The population, including that of the castle, amounted in 1821 to 5698, and in 1831 to 7103. The chief object of admiration is the castle, a royal residence, with its park, and adjoining to it a tract of land of fifty-six miles in extent, denominated Windsor Forest. The castle or palace is a beautiful pile of building, on an eminence, which makes it visible to a large extent of the surrounding country. The terrace, overlooking the Thames, is a magnificent promenade, nearly the third of a mile in length, from which the views are richly expanded. The interior consists of two courts, surrounded with apartments for the royal family and domestics. These are magnificently furnished, and adorned with pictures, statues, and other valuable curiosities. Within the castle is St George’s chapel, a most elegantly finished building, with beautifully painted glass windows; and under it are the vaults in which are deposited the remains of many of the successive monarchs of this kingdom, and of the members of their families. The recent repairs and additions have been made with great taste, and at an enormous expense.
