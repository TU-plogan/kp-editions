WODEVILLE, Αντηονυ, earl of Rivers, brother to the queen of Edward IV., was born in the end of 1442, or in the beginning of 1443. Though one of the most accomplished men of his age, very little is known of his private history. He was early and constantly employed either in the tumults of those turbulent times, or in discharging the duties of some of the highest offices of the state, with which he was invested. Yet he found leisure to cultivate letters, and to be the author of works which, though of little value now, made some noise in that age, when learning was at a low ebb in England. These consisted chiefly of translations from the French; and his lordship, and his printer Caxton, were the first English writers who had the pleasure to see their works published from the press. This accomplished, brave, and amiable nobleman was treacherously imprisoned by Richard III. in Pontefract Castle, where, during his confinement, he composed a short poem, which has been preserved by John Rous of Warwick, and breathes, says Dr Henry, a noble spirit of pious resignation to his approaching fate. He was beheaded on the 23d of June 1483, in the forty-first year of his age.
