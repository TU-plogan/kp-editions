WRIT, in Law, signifies, in general, the kingâ€™s precept in writing under seal, issuing out of some court, directed to the sheriff or other officer, and commanding something to be done in relation to a suit or action, or giving commission to have the same done. And, according to Fitzherbert, a writ is said to be a formal letter of the king in parchment, sealed with his seal, and directed to some judge, officer, or minister, &c. at the suit of a subject, for the cause briefly expressed, which is to be determined in the proper court according to law.

Writs , in civil actions, are either original or judicial. Original are such as are issued out of the court of chancery for the summoning of a defendant to appear, and are granted before the suit is commenced, in order to begin the same; and judicial writs issue out of the court where the original is returned, after the suit is begun.
