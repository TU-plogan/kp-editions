WATERLAND, Daniel, D. D., a learned English divine, who greatly distinguished himself in theological controversies, was born in 1683, at Wasely in Lincolnshire, of which place his father was rector. He had his academical learning at Magdalen College, Cambridge, where he drew up a useful tract, which went through several editions, entitled Advice to a Young Student, with a Method of Study for the first four years. In 1713 he became master of the college, was soon after appointed chaplain to George I., and at the time of his death, in 1740, was canon of Windsor, archdeacon of Middlesex, and vicar of Twickenham. A collective edition of his Works, with a review of his life and writings, was published by Bishop Van Mildert. Oxford, 1823, 10 vols. 8vo. A general index, forming the eleventh volume, was added in 1828.
