WOOLER, a small town in the east division of Glendale, in the ward of Coquetdale and county of Northumberland. It stands on a gentle eminence, on the eastern declivity of the Cheviot Hills, at the foot of which runs the river Wooler, which falls into the Till about a mile below. It is a town of considerable antiquity; but all that now remains of its ancient state is a fragment or two of the castle walls. This vicinity is considered as healthy, and at one time was much frequented by invalids, many of whom were accustomed to drink goats’ milk. The sole trade of Wooler depends on the articles required for the consumption of its inhabitants and those of the neighbourhood. Near to it are the remains of Roman and Scotish camps. It possesses a plain church, and several places of worship for Presbyterians. There is also a dispensary, with two subscription libraries. The market-day is on Thursday. The population in 1821 amounted to 1830, and in 1831 to 1926.
