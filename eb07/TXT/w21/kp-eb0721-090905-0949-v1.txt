WLADIMIR, a province or stadtholderate in the central part of the Russian dominions in Europe. It extends in north latitude from 54° 58' to 57° 11', and in east longitude from 37° 32’ to 43° 11'. It is bounded on the north-west by Twer, on the north by Jaroslaw, on the north-east by Kostroma, on the east by Nishegorod, on the south by Riazan, and on the west by Moscow. It is divided into thirteen circles, and comprehends thirteen cities and 4828 villages, included in 1062 parishes. The extent is 19,338 square miles, and the population is 1,334,500 persons. They are mostly of the original Russian race, and such adhere to the Greek church; but there are some Poles and Germans, and a few Tartars. The greater part of the peasantry is in a state of slavery. Of these upwards of 300,000 belong to the nobility, and about 150,000 to the emperor.

The whole is a level district, with no elevation reaching to 500 feet above the level of the sea. It has much wood, much heath land, and many morasses. The sloping of the land is towards the Wolga, which does not touch the province, but receives the waters of its several streams. The chief of these rivers is the Oka, into which the Kliasma, that comes from Moscow, and the other streams, pour their waters. There are many lakes: the largest of them is the Plestsckeiwo, which is about five miles across, and is the means of communication between the city of Moscow and the Wolga. Peter the Great was induced to form upon it an institution for building vessels. The climate of Wladimir is severely cold in winter and intensely hot in summer, exceeding in both temperatures that of the adjoining province of Moscow. The rivers are generally closed by ice in the beginning of November, and do not open again till towards the end of March. Sharp night-frosts are common even in May. The chief pursuit is agriculture, but it is very slightly productive. Much of the land is clay mixed with stones, and often requires six horses to plough it, and then the product is scarcely more than three times as much as the seed that is sown. The only kinds of grain are winter rye, barley, and oats, and a small portion of summer wheat; but the whole of these do not yield, in the average of years, more than sufficient for the consumption of ten months, and supplies are obtained from the neighbouring provinces. Hemp and flax are more important products of the soil, and are extensively cultivated. The forests yield timber, potashes, and pitch. The breeding of cattle is considerable. The horses in this province are much valued, and great pains have been taken by the government to improve the breed of them.

There are some iron mines, which yield not more than from fifty to sixty quintals of iron in bars. The manufac [7:21:910] tures are, woollen cloths, several kinds of linen, and some cotton goods, a considerable quantity of glass-ware, some paper and soap, all of which are sent by land to Moscow. The capital is the city of the same name, 602 miles from St Petersburg. It is very ancient, and, from 1157 to 1328, was the capital of the empire; but it has vastly declined from its former greatness, nor are many traces of that greatness now to be seen, except the two cathedral churches of St Mary and Dmitriew. It is now a place of little trade; and though, besides the cathedrals, it contains twenty-five churches, there are not more than 1600 inhabitants. It is the capital of a circle of its name.
