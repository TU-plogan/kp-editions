WISCONSIN. The vast tract under this name, erected into a territory of the North American Union, stretches from Lakes Michigan and Superior to the Missouri and White Earth Rivers, and from the northern frontier of the Missouri and Illinois to the boundary between the American and British possessions; extending from 40° 30' on the west of the Mississippi, and 42° 30' on the east of that river, to 49° north latitude, and from 87° to 97° west longitude in the south, and from 90° to 102° in the north. It is about 580 miles in extreme length from north to south, and varies from 300 to 600 in breadth, with an area of about 275,000 square miles. The greater part of the territory is still owned and occupied by Indian tribes, and a large portion of its surface has not been explored by whites.

No general description of the surface and soil of this vast tract, exceeding in dimensions by one third the whole kingdom of France, can be applicable to all portions of it. It is a part of the great central table-land of North America, having a general elevation from 800 to 1200 feet above the level of the sea; and probably the loftiest mountains in the territory do not rise more than 2000 feet above the general level. The northern portion of the section west of the Mississippi is traversed by a broad ridge, presenting few irregularities of surface, and attaining no great elevation, although it forms the water-shed between the Missouri and the Mississippi. Its elevation is only about 500 or 1000 feet above the level of the adjoining country. It is for the most part destitute of trees, but contains numerous lakes, with some wooded patches. There is said to be another ridge between this and the Missouri, but information as to this whole section is very scanty. A low ridge of pine-covered hills runs between the sources of the Mississippi and the tributaries of the Red River; and a similar ridge divides the waters of Lake Superior from those of the Mississippi and Hudson’s Bay. Another hilly tract stretches from the head of Rock River to Lake Superior, between the Fox and Menomonie Rivers on the east, and the Chippewa and Bois Brulé on the west, to which has been given the name of Wisconsin or Porcupine Hills. Lead has been found on the southern part of this tract, where the Ocooch and Smoky Mountains are about 1200 feet above the general level; and copper occurs in the north. By far the greater part of the territory is prairie or unwooded country. Farther north, between Lake Superior and Red River, is a region of lakes, swamps, and savannahs, or wet prairies, overgrown with sedges and rushes, which may well be called the great source of waters, since it gives rise to rivers reaching the Gulf of Mexico Hudson’s Bay, and the Gulf of St Lawrence, at points from 1200 to 2000 miles distant from this common centre. Much of the soil in the northern part is inferior, and unsuitable for cultivation; but on the south the general features of the country resemble those of the adjoining states. That portion of the Upper Mississippi lying between the junction of the De Corbeau and St Anthony’s Falls, presents to the eye a succession of prairie and forest land, which has the general characteristics of a valuable agricultural country. The soil is arable, and apparently light, but of that ferruginous character which has turned out so durable and fertile in Michigan. Wood is often wanting, though forests may be observed on the hilly grounds. Wild hay may be cut in any quantity. The tract here described is included in the recent cessions of the Chippe was and Sioux. Although there are many marshy and barren tracts, yet the rapidity with which this region has been lately filling with settlers is a proof that it contains much land of a superior quality. The southern section of the western district, on the Desmoines and the Iowa, is believed not to be surpassed in fertility by any portion of the United States; and although consisting mostly of prairie, contains woodland enough for economical purposes.

The Mississippi forms the most striking natural feature of the country. Its most remote source, as has been recently ascertained by the expedition conducted by Mr Schoolcraft and Lieutenant Allan, is the little lake called Itasea by the Indians, and La Biche or Elk Lake by the Canadian traders, 3160 miles from the Gulf of Mexico and 1029 from the Falls of St Anthony. The lake is estimated by Mr Schoolcraft to be at an elevation of about 1500 feet above the level of the sea, and is separated from the tributaries of the Red River by the low ridge of hills called by the voyageurs Hauteur des Terres. The rivers in this territory are numerous, and mostly flow into the Mississippi. The Wisconsin, which joins it at Fort Crawford, is one of the most important of its tributaries. It is 550 miles long, and is navigable by steam-boats for about a hundred miles from its junction with the Mississippi.

The settled portion of the territory is divided into twenty-six counties, of which eight are in the western or Iowa section, and eighteen in the eastern or Wisconsin section. The area of the former is about 12,500 square miles, the population at the close of 1837 probably exceeding 20,000; the latter has an area of about 20,000 square miles, with about 30,000 inhabitants. But this extensive region is chiefly inhabited by numerous and powerful tribes of Indians, among whom attempts have been for some time making to introduce the arts of civilized life. Missionaries and teachers have been stationed in various districts, by the different religious societies.

The government was organized in 1836. The legislative assembly consists of a council of thirteen members, elected for four years, and a house of representatives, elected for two years. In 1838, there were published in this infant state three weekly and one monthly newspaper.
