WORK, in the manege. To work a horse, is to exercise him at pace, trot, or gallop, and ride him at the manege. To work a horse upon volts, or head and haunches in or between two heels, is to passage him, or make him go sideways upon parallel lines.

To Wore, in sea-language, is to direct the movements of a ship, by adapting the sails to the force and direction of the wind.
