WOODWARD, John, was born in Derbyshire, on the 1st of May 1665. He was educated at a country school, where he learned the Latin and Greek languages, and was afterwards sent to London, where he is said to have been put apprentice to a linen-draper. He was not long in that station till he became acquainted with Dr Barwick, an eminent physician, who took him under his tuition and into his family. Here he prosecuted with great vigour and success the study of philosophy, anatomy, and physic. In 1692, Dr Stillingfleet quitting the place of professor of physic in Gresham College, Woodward was chosen to succeed him, and the year following was elected F. R. S. In 1695 he was created M.D. by Archbishop Tenison, and in the following year he was admitted to the same degree at Cambridge. His principal work is entitled “An Essay towards a Natural History of the Earth and Terrestrial Bodies, especially Minerals.” Lond. 1695, 8vo. A Latin translation of it appeared at Zürich in 1704; and in 1714 he published “Naturalis Historia Telluris illustrata et aucta.” He wrote many other pieces, which were well received by the learned world. He founded and endowed a professorship of natural history in the university of Cambridge; and this chair was first occupied by the celebrated Dr Middleton. Dr Woodward died in Gresham College, on the 25th of April 1728.
