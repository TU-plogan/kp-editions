WALLSEND, a large village, situated between Newcastle and North Shields, in the county of Northumberland. It is noted for the excellent quality of the coal so abundant in its neighbourhood, as well as for its connection with the celebrated Roman wall built by the emperor Severus, which, as the name of the place indicates, terminated here. There are several building-yards for ships on the banks of the Tyne, and likewise extensive lime-kilns. In addition to the established church of St Peterâ€™s, there are se veral dissenting places of worship. The population of the parish amounted in 1821 to 5103, and in 1831 to 5510.
