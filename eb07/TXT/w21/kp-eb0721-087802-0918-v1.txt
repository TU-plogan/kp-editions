WIBURG, a circle of the Russian province of Finland, extending in north latitude from 60° 10' to 61° 1', and in east longitude from 28° 1' to 30° 17', and containing 3740 square miles, with 31,840 inhabitants. It is bounded on the north-west by Wilmanstrand, on the north by Kekholm, on the north-east by Ladoga, on the east by St Petersburg, on the south by the Bay of Finland, and on the west by Fredrisham. It is an undulatory district, with many morasses, extensive woods, and sandy wastes, which with much labour scarcely yield sufficient food for its scanty population. The principal river is the Sestra, which is the boundary towards St Petersburg. The chief town, of the same name, ninety-eight miles from St Petersburg, is in a bay in the Gulf of Finland. It contains 800 houses, with 3640 inhabitants. It has a small harbour, from whence is exported pitch, tar, tallow, flax, hemp, iron, and some deals, and where salt, coffee, and wine, are imported. Long. 28. 40. E. Lat. 60. 42. N.
