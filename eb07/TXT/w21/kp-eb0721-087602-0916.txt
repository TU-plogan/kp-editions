WHITHAM, a market-town and parish of the county of Essex, which gives its name to the hundred in which it is situated. It stands on a branch of the river Blackwater, thirty-eight miles from London and seven from Chelmsford. It is a well-built town, and pleasantly situated; and being on the great road to Harwich and Ipswich, has much travelling through it. Whitham is said to have been originally built by King Alfred. It afterwards belonged to the Knights Templars, who had a preceptory at Cressing, three miles distant. The church is a neat Gothic structure, containing some ancient monuments. There is a good market on Tuesday. The population amounted in 1821 to 2578, and in 1831 to 2735.
