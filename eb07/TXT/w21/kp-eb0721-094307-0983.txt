WREXHAM, a market-town of the county of Denbigh, in North Wales, in the hundred of the same name, 188 miles from London and ten from Chester. It is finely situated on a rising ground, and has a church, in elegance and beauty surpassing many of the cathedrals of the kingdom, and richly adorned with images and curious carved work, and many handsome monuments. It has a neat town-hall, and a well-endowed free-school. What little trade there is consists in making flannels, but in the vicinity are considerable iron-works. It is a borough, and, conjointly with Denbigh, Holt, and Ruthin, returns one member to the House of Commons. There are markets on Monday and Thursday. The town consists of two parts, called Wrexham Abbot and Wrexham Regis, whose population amounted in 1821 to 4795, and in 1831 to 5484.
