WIMBORN-MINSTER, a market-town of the county of Dorset, in the hundred of Badbury and division of Shaftesbury, 100 miles from London and seven from Poole. It is finely situated between the rivers Stour and Allen, over each of which are bridges. Its name is derived from the minster, a Gothic-Norman structure, which now serves as the parish church. It has a lofty tower in the middle, and another at the west end, and in the choir are fourteen stalls. The town has a good market-place, well attended on Friday, an endowed grammar-school, and several charitable foundations. The population amounted in 1821 to 3563, and in 1831 to 4009; but in this estimate are included the inhabitants of three tythings within the parish.
