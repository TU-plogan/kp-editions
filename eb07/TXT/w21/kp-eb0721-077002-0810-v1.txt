WARARSDIN, a portion of the Austrian province of Croatia, denominated a generality. It is on the frontier towards Turkey, and peopled with military colonists, the males of which are regimented, and held ready for service as one of the conditions of their possessing the land. It extends over 1470 square miles, and comprehends three small towns and 306 villages, with 108,500 inhabitants, two thirds of whom adhere to the Romish church, and the remainder mostly to the Greek. They are divided into two portions called regiments; the head-quarters of one is at Ivanich, of the other at St George’s. Nearly two fifths of the surface are covered with woods, but the remainder is cultivated, and produces more provender than is consumed. It yields moderate crops of corn, tolerable wine, some silk, and abundance of cattle. The climate is mild, and the district is watered by the Drave and its numerous tributary streams. There are no manufactures, but these are purchased with the surplus of the products of the soil. The principal town, Ivanich, has only 650 inhabitants. Long. 16. 25. 5. E. Lat. 45. 42. 9. N.
