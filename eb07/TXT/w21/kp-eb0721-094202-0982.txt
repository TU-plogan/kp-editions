WORONESH, one of the governments or stadtholderates into which the Russian empire in Europe is divided. It takes the name from its capital city, and extends in north latitude from 48째 37' to 52째 53', and in east longitude from 38째 35' to 14째 17'. It is bounded on the north by Tambow, on the north-east by Saratow, on the east and south-east by the country of the Don Cossacks, on the south-west by Jekaterinoslaw, and on the west by Slobodsk-Ukraine and Kursk. It comprehends the vast space, including the circle of Nowochopersk recently added to it, of 34,034 square miles, in which are sixteen cities and towns, 769 parishes with each its church, and numerous villages and hamlets. The inhabitants are 1,445,900, mostly of the race of the indigenous Russians, but having many Cossacks and some Gipsys mingled with them. There are also several newly-planted people, called colonists, of various races. With the exception of some Germans who have settled there, and keep separate, they all adhere to the Greek church. The nobles are less numerous than in some of the other governments, but more than one third of the whole inhabitants are their slaves.

The climate is temperate, as may be presumed from the latitude. The rivers seldom freeze till the end of December, and are open again in March. It is a healthy district, the people attain a great age, the cattle are large and strong, and the vegetable productions of the milder climates make their appearance in the southern parts. The grain chiefly cultivated is rye, some little wheat, barley, oats, buck-wheat, and, in the south, maize. Though the soil is fertile, from careless husbandry the product of corn rarely exceeds the consumption; but, on the other hand, the crops of flax and hemp supply considerable materials for commerce. Some wood for fuel likewise occasions a little trade by the rivers. The principal manufacture is coarse cloth from the wool of the province, which is chiefly used for the clothing of the troops. Some linen is also made; and there are several tanneries, distilleries, and breweries.

The city of Woronesh is the capital of the province, as well as of the circle of its name. It stands on a rising ground near that part of the river Don into which the river Woronesh falls. It is without fortifications, contains the palace of the governor and of the bishop, eighteen churches all built of stone, an ecclesiastical seminary, two monasteries, 3000 houses, and 20,300 inhabitants, who carry on some trade with Siberia and Orenburg. Here Peter the Great founded a dock-yard for building vessels, but it has since been removed to Towrow. It is 790 miles from St Petersburg. Long. 40. 48. 30. E. Lat. 51. 40. 30. N.
