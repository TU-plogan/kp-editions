WESTPORT, a seaport town in the county of Mayo, distant from Dublin, by way of Tuam, 134½ miles. The town is beautifully situated in a small valley, which is watered by a stream running through the centre of the two principal streets. There are various minor streets which diverge on both sides of the valley, and, from the acclivity of the ground, are very steep. Great inconvenience arises from the port and the town being separated by the seat of the marquis of Sligo, and by the steepness of the road between the two places. The town is increasing in prosperity, arising from the agricultural produce of the neighbouring district being shipped here, from the quantity of linen which is still made, and the business which a large distillery and brewery have called forth. The amount of custom-duty collected at the port in 1838 was L.5044; in 1839, L.9121; and in 1840, L.7555. In addition to the parish church, which is situated in the demesne of the marquis of Sligo, there are places of worship in the town for the Presbyterians and Methodists, and a large chapel for the Roman Catholics. The population in 1821 amounted to 4326, and in 1831 to 4448.
