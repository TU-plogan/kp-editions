WITNEY, a market-town and parish of the county of Oxford, in the hundred of Bampton, sixty-nine miles from London and eleven from Oxford. It stands on the river Windrush. It consists of two streets, at the end of one of which is a fine church in the Gothic style. There is also an endowed grammar-school, with a good library. This place has long been celebrated for the manufacture of blankets, which is still carried on extensively, and they still maintain their character for superior warmth and lightness. There is a market on Thursday. The population of this town amounted in 1821 to 2827, and in 1831 to 3190; but the whole parish, comprehending also four hamlets, in 1831 had 5336 inhabitants.
