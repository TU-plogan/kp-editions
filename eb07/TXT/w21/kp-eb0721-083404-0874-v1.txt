WEDNESBURY, a town of the county of Stafford, in the hundred of Offlow, 124 miles from London and seven from Birmingham. It is a place of black and gloomy appearance, inhabited chiefly by persons employed in the extensive and valuable coal-mines in its vicinity, or in some branches of the iron manufacture. The parish church is a fine ancient Gothic structure. A new church has been built of late years, and there are many chapels for several sects of dissenters. The town has a good market on Wednesday. The population amounted in 1821 to 6471, and in 1831 to 8437.
