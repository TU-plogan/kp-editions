WISMAR, one of the provinces into which the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin is divided. It belonged to Mecklenburg till 1648, when it was delivered over to the Swedes, who possessed it till 1803, when it was transferred for a sum of money to the present sovereign. It is situated on the Baltic Sea, and, including the island of PoÃ«l, extends over thirty-eight square miles, or about 25,000 acres, and comprehends one city and thirty-seven villages, with 15,419 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on a bay of the Baltic. It is surrounded with walls and ditches, contains four Lutheran churches, three hospitals, an orphan-house, and several schools, 1350 houses, and 10,070 inhabitants. It has some foreign commerce, especially in the export of wheat and other grain; and has several ships annually equipped for the whale-fishery. There are manufactures of linen goods, especially of sailcloth, with several breweries and distilleries.
