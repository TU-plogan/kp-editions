WRESTLING, a kind of combat or engagement between two persons unarmed, body to body, to prove their strength and dexterity, and try which can throw his opponent to the ground. Wrestling is an exercise of very great antiquity and fame. It was in use in the heroic age; witness Hercules, who wrestled with Antaeus. It continued a long time in the highest repute, and had considerable rewards and honours assigned to it at the Olympic games. It was the custom for the athletae to anoint their bodies with oil, to give the less hold to their antagonists.
