WYE, a town of the county of Kent, in the lathe of Scray and hundred of the same name, fifty-five miles from London. It stands on the river Stour, and had a market, which has of late years been discontinued. The population amounted in 1821 to 1508, and in 1831 to 1639.

Wye, a river of South Wales, which, issuing out of Plin-lymmon Hill, very near the source of the Severn, crosses the north-east corner of Radnorshire, giving name to the town of Rhyadergowy (Fall of the Wye), where it is precipitated in a cataract; then flowing between this county and Brecknockshire, it crosses Herefordshire, and dividing the counties of Gloucester and Monmouth, falls into the mouth [7:21:953]of the Severn below Chepstow. The romantic beauties of the Wye, which flows in a deep bed, between lofty rocks clothed with hanging woods, and here and there crowned by ruined castles, have employed the descriptive powers of the pen and pencil.

Wye is also the name of a river in Derbyshire, which rises in the north-west part, above Buxton; and, flowing south-east, falls into the Derwent below Bakewell.
