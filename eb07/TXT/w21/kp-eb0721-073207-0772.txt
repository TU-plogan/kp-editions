WANDSWORTH, a town and large parish in the county of Surrey, in the hundred of Brixton, six miles from London. It stands at the junction of the river Wandle with the Thames, and contains corn-mills, distilleries, breweries, and boat-building yards upon a large scale, as well as silk and printing works. There are two churches, one of recent erection, some dissenting places of worship, and some charitable establishments founded by Henry Smith, who was buried here in 1627, having left vast sums for benevolent purposes. There are many fine houses within the parish. The population amounted in 1821 to 6702, and in 1831 to 6879.
