WALSH, William, an English critic and poet, the son of Joseph Walsh, Esq. of Abberley in Worcestershire, was born about the year 1660. He became a gentleman commoner of Wadham College, Oxford, but left the university without taking a degree. His writings are to be found among the works of the Minor Poets, printed in 1749. He was [7:21:730] made gentleman of the horse in Queen Anne’s reign, and died in 1708. He was the friend of Dryden and of Pope, the former of whom esteemed him the best critic then living; and Pope has celebrated his character in the Essay on Criticism.
