WORTHING, a town of the county of Sussex, fifty-nine miles from London, in the hundred of Brightford and rape of Bramber. It is in the parish of Broadwater, on the sea-shore, and within the last thirty years has been frequented for the purpose of sea-bathing. From a hamlet with a few fishing cottages, it has thus increased to an elegant and well-built town, containing churches and chapels, a market-house, and splendid hotels. The climate is mild, being defended from the north and east winds by the SouthDown Hills. The population amounted in 1821 to 3725, and in 1831 to 4576.
