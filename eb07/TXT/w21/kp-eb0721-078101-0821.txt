WARWICK, a borough and market town, the capital of the county of that name. It is within the hundred of Kington, and stands on the bank of the river Avon, seven miles from Stratford and ninety-one from London. It is a wellbuilt and regular town. The county-hall is a fine structure, as is also the county gaol. It had once six parish churches, now reduced to two, St Maryâ€™s and St Nicholas. The former is a noble Gothic building, with several grand monuments to members of the noble family who derived their title from the town. The latter church is chiefly distinguished by its lofty tower and musical ring of bells. The most remarkable object connected with this place is the castle, the ancient and magnificent residence of the earl of Warwick, with its gardens, waterfall, bridge, collection of paintings, and other objects of attraction. As one of the most prominent residences of the English nobility, and one most connected with historical recollections, it is much visited, and is deserving of a more elaborate description than the limits of our work [7:21:782] will permit to be given here. Warwick is divided into two wards, and is governed by a corporate body, consisting of a mayor, six aldermen, and seventeen councillors; and it returns two members to the House of Commons. There is a market on Saturday, which is well supplied; and in addition there are no less than eight annual fairs. Within a few years the town of Leamington, one mile from Warwick, has, on account of its mineral waters, grown up to the resemblance of a new city, surpassing Warwick in population, and far exceeding it in the beauty and regularity of its edifices, both public and private. The inhabitants of Warwick amounted in 1821 to 8235, and in 1831 to 9109.
