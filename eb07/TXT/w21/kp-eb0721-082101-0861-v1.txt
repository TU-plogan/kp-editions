WATTS, Isaac, D. D., a learned ano eminent dissenting minister, was born at Southampton in 1674, of parents eminent for piety, and considerable sufferers for conscience-sake. In 1690 he was sent up to London for academical education under the tuition of the Rev. Thomas Rowe; and in 1696 was himself engaged as tutor to the son of Sir John Hartopp, Bart, at Stoke Newington. He began to preach in 1698, and met with general acceptance; and after officiating as an assistant to the Rev. Dr Isaac Chauncy, he succeeded in his pastoral charge in 1702, and continued to preside over that church as long as he lived. Though his whole income did not amount to a hundred a year, he allotted one third of it to the poor. He died in 1748. His numerous works have rendered his name famous among people of every denomination, both in this and other countries, and have been translated into a variety of languages. His Lyric Poems, his Psalms and Hymns, and his Divine Songs for Children, have had an amazing number of editions. His logic and philosophy have been much admired. He also wrote works upon a variety of other subjects, and printed several volumes of his sermons. He was admired for the mildness and benevolence of his disposition. After his death, his Works were collected, and published in six volumes quarto.
