WATFORD, a market-town of the county of Hertford, in the hundred of Caisho, 17Â½ miles from London. It stands on the river Colne, a few miles from its source at Otterpool. It is well built and pleasantly situated, consisting principally of one street. There is a good market on Saturday, and two annual fairs are held. The chief trade is spinning silk. The population amounted in 1821 to 4713, and in 1831 to 5293; but this estimate includes the inhabitants of three hamlets which form a portion of the parish, though not of the town.
