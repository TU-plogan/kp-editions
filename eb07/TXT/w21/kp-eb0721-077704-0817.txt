WARREE, or Sawunt Warree, an extensive district of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapoor, situated between the sea and the western Ghaut Mountains, being forty miles in length and about twenty-five in breadth. It is rocky and unproductive, and formerly the inhabitants were much addicted to piracy. In 1818 the British forces entered the country, and put an end to the government, allowing a pension to the ranny or female ruler.
