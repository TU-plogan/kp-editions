WESTERAS, an internal province of the kingdom of Sweden, formed out of a small portion of the ancient province of Upland, and the eastern part of Westmanland. It is now bounded on the north-west by Kopparberg, on the north-east by Gefleborg, on the east by Upsala, on the south by Malaren and Nykoping, and on the west by Orebro. It extends over 2772 square miles, and comprehends four cities and 2818 villages and hamlets, with 87,600 inhabitants. It is a well-watered district, and, for the climate, very fruitful, but chiefly consisting of pasture-land, and consequently rendered profitable more by its dairies and by fattening cattle than by its ploughed fields. It generally, however, grows corn sufficient for its consumption, and in very favourable years has a surplus. The fisheries arc productive; but the chief demand for labour is in the mines and in their products. The silver-mine of Sala is still worked, being the only one now in Sweden; and the iron-mines of Norberg yield the best quality of metal. The exports are wood, cattle, silver, iron, and cutlery goods, and in some years corn. The province, for the purposes of government and law, is divided into seven bailiwicks. The capital is the city of the same name, at the mouth of the river Swartelf. It is the seat of a bishop, and is finely situated, but irregularly built. In the cathedral are monuments of two of their kings, Gustavus III. and Erick XIV. There is a gymnasium, with nine professors, and an hospital. It contains 570 houses, chiefly built of wood, and 3120 inhabitants. It has some trade by the Malaren Lake, chiefly with Stockholm. Long. 16. 22. 28. E. Lat. 59. 35. 31. N.
