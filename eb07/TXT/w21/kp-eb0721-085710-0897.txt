WENDEN, a circle of the Russian government of Livonia, extending in north latitude from 56° 35’ to 57° 54', and in east longitude from 25° 3' to 27° 22'. It is bounded by Pernau on the north, by Dorpat on the east, on the south-east by Witebsk, and on the south-west and west by Riga. It comprehends 4158 square miles, with two cities, twenty-eight parishes, 229 hamlets and villages, and 136,400 inhabitants. It is generally a level district, with a few undulations, watered by many small streams, all of which end in the Duna. It produces some corn, chiefly rye or oats. The chief object of cultivation next to grain is flax, which, as well as the seed of that plant, is mostly exported from Riga. Some tallow and wood also furnish articles for foreign trade. The capital is the town of the same name on the river Aa. It was once the assembling place of the knights of the Teutonic order, and many of their monuments still exist in the church. Long. 25. 10. E. Lat. 57. 15. N.
