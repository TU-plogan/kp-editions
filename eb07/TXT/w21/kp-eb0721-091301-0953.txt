WOLFE, James, was born at Westerham, in the county of Kent, about the beginning of the year 1726. His father was Lieutenant-general Edward Wolfe. He went into the army when very young, and applying himself with unwearied assiduity to the study of his profession, soon became remarkable for his knowledge and his genius. He distinguished himself at the battle of Lafelt when little more than twenty, and received the highest encomiums from the commanderin-chief. After the peace he still continued to cultivate the art of war. He contrived to introduce the greatest regularity and the exactest discipline into his corps, and at the same time to preserve the affection of every soldier. In 1758 he was present as a brigadier-general at the siege of Louisbourg. He landed first on the island at the head of a division; and in spite of the violence of the surf, and the force and well-directed fire of the enemy, drove them from their post with great precipitation. The surrender of the town, which happened soon after, was in a great measure owing to his activity, bravery, and skill. The fame which he acquired during this siege pointed him out to Mr Pitt, who was then minister, as the most proper person to command the army destined to attack Quebec. This was the most difficult and the most arduous undertaking of the whole war. Quebec was the capital of the French dominions in North America; it was well fortified, situated in the midst of a hostile country, and defended by an army of 20,000 men, regulars and militia, besides a considerable number of Indian allies. The troops selected for this expedition consisted of ten battalions, making up altogether about 7000 men. Such was the army destined to oppose three times their own number, defended by fortifications, in a country altogether unknown, and in a late season in that climate for military operations. But this little army, was always sanguine of success; for they were commanded by an officer who, by a very uncommon magnanimity and nobleness of behaviour, had attached the troops so much to his person, and inspired them with such resolution and steadiness in the execution of their duty, that nothing seemed too difficult for them to accomplish. The admirable skill with which his measures were planned, and the prudence and vigour with which they were executed, are well known. He landed his army on the northern shore of the river St Lawrence, in spite of the enemy, and forced them to a battle, in which they were completely defeated. The consequence of this battle was the reduction of Quebec and the conquest of Canada. In the beginning of the battle General Wolfe was wounded in the wrist by a musket-ball; he wrapt his handkerchief round it, continued to give his orders with his usual calmness and perspicuity, and informed the soldiers that the advanced parties on the front had his orders to retire, and that they need not be surprised when it happened. Towards the end of the battle he received a new wound in the breast; he immediately retired behind the rear rank, supported by a grenadier, and laid himself down on the ground. Soon after a shout was heard, and one of the officers who stood by him exclaimed, “See how they run !" The dying hero asked with some emotion, “Who run ?” “The enemy,” replied the officer; “they give way everywhere.” The general then said, “Pray, do one of you run to Colonel Burton, and tell him to march Webb’s regiment with all speed down to Charles river, to cut off the retreat of the fugitives from the bridge. Now, God be praised, I shall die happy !” He then turned on his side, closed his eyes, and expired.

The death of General Wolfe was a national loss universally lamented. He inherited from nature an animating fervour of sentiment, an intuitive perception, an extensive capacity, and a passion for glory, which stimulated him to acquire every species of military knowledge that study could comprehend, or that actual service could illustrate and confirm. This noble warmth of disposition seldom fails to call forth and unfold all the liberal virtues of the soul. Brave above all estimation of danger; generous, gentle, complacent, and humane, he was the pattern of the officer, the darling of the soldier. There was a sublimity in his genius which soared above the pitch of ordinary minds; and had his faculties been exercised to their full extent by opportunity and action, had his judgment been fully matured by age and experience, be would in all probability have rivalled in reputation the most celebrated captains of antiquity. His body was brought to England, and buried with military honours in Westminster Abbey, where a magnificent monument is erected to his memory.
