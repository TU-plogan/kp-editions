WALURU, a town of Hindustan, province of Mysore. It consists of 500 houses, and is one of the richest and best built towns on this frontier, above the Ghauts. It is defended by a citadel, and has a manufacture of cotton cloth, and another of blankets. There are also distilleries of country rum, in which the bark of the mimosa is an ingredient. A Hindu chieftain, who formerly held this town and the adjoining territory, is allowed to inhabit the citadel, and has a pension from the Mysore government.
