WOODBRIDGE, a market-town of the county of Suffolk, in the hundred of Loes, eight miles from Ipswich and seventy-eight from London. It is situated on the navigable river Deben, and has some ship-building, and some trade by sea with London, Newcastle, and Hull. The principal streets are well built and well paved. The parish church is a fine structure, built of black flints, and has a tower 180 feet in height, which serves as a sea-mark. There is a large market on Wednesday, chiefly for corn. The population amounted in 1821 to 4060, and in 1831 to 4769.
