WERCHNE-DNIAPROWSK, a circle of the Russian government of Jekaterinoslaw. It extends in north latitude from 51째 8' to 52째 7', and in east longitude from 33째 45' to 34째 57'. The land is very fertile, and repays with good interest whatever industry is expended on it. It breeds many valuable herds of horned cattle, as well as sheep. The Dnieper touches the circle on the north-east, and there receives the waters of many small streams. The population is thin, but is not precisely known, as a portion consists of Kossacs, whose residence is not permanent, and some of them are colonists from Poland and Germany, recently established. The capital is the city of the same name on the right bank of the Dnieper, lately founded, and said to contain yet not more than 1500 inhabitants. It is 1066 miles from St Petersburg. Long. 34. 41. E. Lat. 51. 8. N.
