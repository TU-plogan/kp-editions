WAGEEO, or Waygiou, one of the Papuan islands, separated by Dampier’s Strait from New Guinea to the south. It may be estimated in length at ninety miles, by twenty-two miles in average breadth. The island is throughout mountainous at a small distance from the coast, and very woody, being covered with an immense forest reaching to the water’s edge. The trees grow to an immense height; and vegetables are in great variety, namely, oranges, cocoa-nuts, sugar-canes, sago, and pimento. On the north coast of this island is a harbour formed by the island of Rawak, on which grows the ambong tree, the heart of which is an excellent cabbage. On the north-west coast of Waygiou there is another harbour named Piapis, situated in latitude 0° 5' south, long 130° 15' east. It is formed by two capacious bays, where there is fresh water, and abundance of tall timber fit for masts. Both bays have good mud soundings; and on a small island named Sisipa is a pond of fresh water, with sago trees growing close to it. Here the cabbage tree also abounds. The gigantic Kima cockle is found in plenty among the coral reefs. Turtles of large size are found on the shore, and numbers of wild hogs in the woods. Here are seen many rare and beautiful birds, namely, the black cockatoo, the bird of paradise, &c. The natives are of a very suspicious disposition, probably from their being trepanned as slaves. They are barbarous in their habits, going almost entirely naked. The chiefs only have jackets and trousers of Chinese stuffs, and wear a bat and turban. The colour of their skins is not black; their hair is thick and curled, and grows to a considerable length. Their houses, which are built on posts, consist of bamboo, and are elevated above the ground. The aborigines inhabit the interior, the Mahommedans the sea-coast. The island is situatcd about the 131st degree of east longitude, and within the 12th degree of south latitude.
