WINTON, Andrew, prior of Lochleven, appears to have been born during the reign of David the Second, which extended from 1329 to 1370. For the few scattered notices of him that have been preserved, we are chiefly indebted to the valuable work which has transmitted his name to posterity. Of his parentage and education no record has hitherto been discovered; but we learn from his prologue that he was a canon regular of St Andrews, and prior of the monastery of St Serf. The priory of St Andrews was endowed with very ample revenues; and the prior, in consideration of his connection with the metropolitan cathedral, was entitled to take precedence of all priors, [7:21:904]and even of all abbots. There were five subordinate priories belonging to St Andrews; namely, those of St Serf in the inch or isle of Lochleven, Portmoak on the northern bank of the same lake, both in the county of Kinross, Pittenweem in the neighbouring county of Fife, the isle of May near the termination of the Firth of Forth, and Monymusk in the county of Aberdeen. In the isle of Lochleven there was a very ancient religious house belonging to the Culdees, for whom the canons regular of St Augustin were afterwards substituted by the bishop of St Andrews. The beautiful and romantic situation of this priory furnished a very suitable abode for a poet; and here Winton must chiefly have resided during a considerable part of his life. In the Chartulary of the Priory of St Andrews, which is now printed, there are several documents bearing the name of Andrew Winton as prior of Lochleven between the years 1395 and 1413; but his life must have been prolonged several years after this last date, for he mentions the death of Robert duke of Albany, an event which happened in 1420. In the prologue to the last book of his chronicle, he expresses his anticipation of a speedy dissolution.

His Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland was undertaken at the suggestion of Sir John Wemyss, ancestor of the noble family of that name.

Winton’s chronicle, while it yet remained in manuscript, was not entirely neglected by more curious enquirers: it was quoted by Selden, a writer of prodigious research, who was not however acquainted with the author’s name; it afforded some useful information to Ruddiman for his edition of Buchanan, and to Innes for his Critical Essay on the Ancient Inhabitants of Scotland; nor was it completely overlooked by Lord Hailes and Mr Pinkerton. Of that portion which relates more immediately to Scotish affairs, a splendid edition was at length published by the late David Macpherson, who has added a copious glossary, a series of valuable annotations, and other useful appendages.^[1. The orygynale Cronykil of Scotland, be Androw of Wyntown, Priowr of Sanct Serfis Yncbe in Loch Levyn, &c. Lond. 1795, 2 vols. 4to & 8vo. ] It may safely be affirmed that none of our ancient writers has yet been edited in a more faithful and judicious manner. The basis of his text is the Royal MS. in the British Museum: this appears to have been transcribed for George Barclay of Achrody, and its date is supposed to be at least as early as the year 1430; but he likewise had recourse to several other manuscripts, belonging to the same institution and to the Advocates Library.^[2. Of Winton’s chronicle a considerable number of MSS. is mentioned by Macpherson, but several others are known to be preserved. There is one in the Lansdowne collection, lately added to the British Museum, another in the library of the university of St Andrews, and a third in that of Captain Wemyss of Wemyss. ] ®

The chronicle of Winton is valuable as a specimen of the literary taste and attainments of our ancestors at a very remote period, but it is still more valuable as a repository of historical information, and as a delineation of ancient manners. His simple pages present to our view many curious prospects of society; and with a perseverance of industry which had numerous difficulties to encounter, he has collected and preserved many anecdotes that tend to illustrate the history of his native country. He divides his work into nine books, “in honour of the orders nine of holy angels.” Although he merely professes to write an original chronicle of Scotland, yet, like other Gothic chroniclers, he presents his readers with an outline of the ancient history of the world. Towards the beginning of his work, he treats of the nature of angels, the creation of the world, the death of Abel, the generations of Cain and Seth, the primeval race of giants, the situation of India, Egypt, Africa, Europe, Britain, Ireland, and divers other countries, the confusion of tongues, and the origin of poetry and idolatry. One chapter he devotes to the history of the Amazons, and another to that of Samson. After commencing in so hopeful a manner, he continues to amass an immense pile of lumber, till having completed five books in this pantographical spirit, he at last confines himself more soberly to his proper subject. The adoption of such a plan is not to be considered as peculiar to the author: Winton follows the models which at that period were generally approved; and the Latin chronicle of Fordun, who was nearly contemporary, is composed of the same heterogeneous materials.
