WIGAN, a large town of the county of Lancaster, in the hundred of West Derby, 200 miles from London. It stands on the small river Douglas; is a corporation under a mayor, ten aldermen, and thirty councillors; and returns two members to the House of Commons. Being an ancient town, some parts of it are ill built; but of late years, from the extension of its trade, great improvements as well as additions have been made. The church is a stately edifice, with a tower containing eight bells; and there are chapels of ease and several dissenting places of worship. The living of the parish is one of the most valuable in the kingdom, and the incumbent is lord of the manor. Wigan has been long celebrated for its manufactures, which formerly consisted of checks and other linens, but of late the cotton trade has been extended to it, and is flourishing. There is a well-attended market on Friday. The population amounted in 1821 to 17,716, and in 1831 to 20,774 within the town; but the whole parish, which comprehends thirteen town-ships and chapelries, in 1831 contained 44,780 inhabitants.
