WANTAGE, a market-town and parish of the county of Berks, and in the hundred of the same name, sixty miles [7:21:733] from London. This place is celebrated from King Alfred having been born in a royal residence which it once contained. The town stands in the vale of the White Horse; a name given to it from the figure of a gigantic horse cut in the side of a chalk-hill, to commemorate Alfred’s victory over the Danes. It is in a galloping position, and covers nearly an acre of ground. Near to the horse are some stones set on edge, said to be the burial-place of the Danish leaders who fell in the battle, which, according to the tradition, was fought near it. The peasantry in the neighbourhood are accustomed to assemble yearly at midsummer for what is called scouring the horse, when they remove every weed and obstacle that may have obscured the figure, and afterwards spend the day in various rural sports. It is now a place of little trade, except that of making flaxen cloth for sacking. There is a market on Saturday, and four annual fairs. The population amounted in 1821 to 2560, and in 1831 to 2507.
