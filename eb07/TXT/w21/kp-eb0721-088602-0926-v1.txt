+=====================================================================+


WILKIE, William the author of the Epigoniad, was born in the parish of Dalmeny and county of Linlithgow on the 5th of October 1721. His father was a small farmer, and was not very fortunate in his worldly affairs. He however gave his son a liberal education, the early part of which he received at Dalmeny school; and at the age of thirteen he was sent to the university of Edinburgh, where he was soon distinguished as a young man of genius. Among his fellow-students were Dr Robertson the historian, Mr Home the poet, and some other eminent literary characters. In the course of his education he also became acquainted with David Hume and Adam Ferguson. Before he completed his studies at the university, his father died, leaving him only the stock and unexpired lease of his farm, with the care of three sisters, one of whom being afterwards married to an experienced farmer, Wilkie availed himself of his practical knowledge. He formed a system of farming which fully answered his own expectations, and secured to him the approbation of all his neighbours. After becoming a licentiate of the church of Scotland, he still continued his former mode of living, cultivating his farm, reading the classics, and occasionally preaching for the ministers in his neighbourhood. In 1753, he was presented to the living of Ratho by the earl of Lauderdale, who was sensible of his worth, and admired his genius. The duties of his new office he discharged with fidelity, and was celebrated for his impressive mode of preaching, while he did not neglect the amusements of husbandry, and the study of polite literature. In 1757 he published, at Edinburgh, “The Epigoniad, a Poem, in nine books,” which is said to have been the result of fourteen years study. Hume endeavoured to promote its success by addressing a commendatory letter to the editor of the Critical Review. A second edition of the poem was published at London in 1769. In 1759 Wilkie was elected professor of natural philosophy in the university of St Andrews. His whole fortune, when he removed to this place, did not exceed L.200, which he laid out in the purchase of a few acres of land in the vicinity of the city. He lived at St Andrews in the same studious and retired manner as he had done at Ratho. In 1766 the university conferred upon him the degree of D. D. He ended his poetical career by publishing a volume of Fables. Lond. 1768, 8vo. After a lingering illness, he died on the 10th of October 1772, having only completed the fifty-first year of his age. The personal character of Dr Wilkie exhibited many singularities; but the very distinguished individuals with whom he was acquainted were all disposed to regard him as a man of talents as well as learning. The subject of his Epigoniad was injudiciously chosen; nor is it surprising that he did not acquire the reputation of a great epic poet.
