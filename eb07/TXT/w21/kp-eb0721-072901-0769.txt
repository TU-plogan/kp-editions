WALSALL, a town of the hundred of Offlow and county of Stafford, 116 miles from London and fifteen from Stafford. It is a place of great antiquity. It stands on the side of a hill, and consists of several regular and spacious wellbuilt streets, which are well paved, and lighted with gas. The parish church is a spacious building, in the form of a cross, with an octagonal tower. There is also a handsome chapel, called St Paul’s, erected in 1826. The town has a well-supplied market on Tuesday, and three annual fairs. The trade is very extensive, chiefly in various kinds of hardware, but especially in what consists in horses’ furniture, usually called saddlers’ ironmongery. The government is vested in a corporate body, consisting of a mayor, six aldermen, and seventeen councillors. The suburb, called the Foreign, is now the largest portion of the place, or at least contains the greatest number of inhabitants; and by the late act the whole is made one borough for the purposes of election, and has received the power of returning one member to the House of Commons. Walsall contains many dissenters, who have their respective chapels. The population amounted in 1821 to 11,914, and in 1831 to 15,066.
