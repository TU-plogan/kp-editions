WÜRZBURG, a large city of Bavaria, formerly the capital of the sequestrated ecclesiastical principality of that name, but now the chief place of a bailiwick to which it gives the name, in the Bavarian province of the Lower Maine. It still retains the name of a grand duchy, and comprehends an extent of nearly 2000 square miles, with a population of about 290,000 souls. The land is for the most part level, but is surrounded with woody mountains on three sides. It is watered by many small streams which fall into the Maine, and ultimately into the Rhine. The soil is fertile, yielding abundance of corn; but the vineyards occupy a great portion of the land very profitably. The best wines are produced near the capital, and are known by the names of Stein wine, or Leisten wine. The district is not rich in minerals, nor has it much manufacturing industry. The city is built on the river Maine, by which it is divided into two parts connected by a bridge. It is surrounded with walls and ditches; and it is defended by the citadel of Marienburg, built on a hill 400 feet high, which overlooks the city. Some of the streets are broad, and contain fine piles of building; but others are gloomy and narrow. The most distinguished edifice is the former episcopal, now royal residence, a building of vast extent, and of some beauty; and the grounds belonging to it are laid out and preserved in good taste. The university was founded after the model of that of Bologna, in 1403, and after suffering much in stormy times, was renewed in 1582; but since that period it has numbered among its professors some of the most eminent men of Germany. The library of the institution contains upwards of 100,000 volumes, and there are also collections of the different branches of natural history, and all scientific helps. Besides the cathcdral, Würzburg contains several churches and monasteries. The inhabitants are for the most part Catholics, and in 1834 amounted to 22,674. The chief trade is in wine, and some is carried on in timber. Long. 9. 49. 25. E. Lat. 49. 46. 6. N.
