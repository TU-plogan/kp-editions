WINCHELSEA, a town and parish of the county of Sussex, in the hundred of Guestling and rape of Hastings, sixty-seven miles from London. It stands on a rising ground, overlooking marshes which extend to the sea. The ancient town of this name was once a large city, and contained a harbour and eighteen parish churches, nearly the whole of which have been swallowed up by tempests, and by the receding of the land. The present town, which is distant from the sea a mile and a half, is built upon an eminence, and was erected in the reign of Edward I. In various parts of the town are spacious stone-vaults, and extensive ruins. An attempt was made to introduce the manufacture of cambrics into this town, but it was attended with no success. The small market is on Saturday. The population amounted in 1821 to 817, and in 1831 to 772.

Winchelsea Island, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, New Holland, near the coast of Groote Eylandt, with which it forms a bay, called by Captain Flinders North-west Bay. It is about five or six miles long. There is another island of this name in the Pacific Ocean, thirty miles south-east of Sir Charles Hardy’s Island.
