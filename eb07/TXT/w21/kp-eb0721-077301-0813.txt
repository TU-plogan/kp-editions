WARD is variously used in our old books. A ward in London is a district or division of the city, committed to the special charge of one of the aldermen; and in London there are twenty-six wards, according to the number of the mayor and aldermen, of which every one has his ward for his proper guard and jurisdiction. A forest is divided into wards; and a prison is called a ward. Lastly, the heir of the kingâ€™s tenant, that held in capite, was termed a ward during his nonage; but this wardship is taken away by the statute 12 Car. II. c. 24.

Ward, Seth, an English prelate, chiefly distinguished for his knowledge in mathematics and astronomy, was born at Buntingford in Hertfordshire; and his biographer Dr Pope places his birth in the year 1618. He was admitted of Sidney College, Cambridge, where he applied with great vigour to his studies, particularly to the mathematics, and was chosen fellow of his college. He was much involved in the consequences of the civil war, but he was more fortunate than many of his brethren. He was appointed Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford; and here in 1654 he took the degree of D. D. In 1659 he was chosen president of Trinity College; but being disqualified for the office, he was obliged to resign it at the Restoration. In 1661 he became dean, and in 1662 bishop, of Exeter. In 1667 he was translated to Salisbury; and in 1671 was made chancellor of the order of the Garter. He was the first Protestant bishop that enjoyed that honour, and he procured it to be annexed to the see of Salisbury. Bishop Ward was one of those unhappy persons who have had the misfortune to survive their senses, which happened in consequence of a fever ill cured. He lived to the Revolution without knowing any thing of the matter, and died at Knightsbridge on the 6th of January 1689. He had rendered himself odious by the severities which he exercised against the non-conformists. He published various works on theology, philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy.
