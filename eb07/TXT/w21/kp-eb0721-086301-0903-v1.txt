WESTMINSTER, a city which forms the west part of the capital of Britain, but has a government distinct from the rest. This city had its name from the situation of its abbey, anciently called a minster, in respect of that of St Paul. That part properly called the city of Westminster, comprehending the parishes of St John and St Margaret, was once an island formed by the Thames, called Thornry Island, from the thorns with which it was overrun; and the abbey that stood in it, Thorney Abbey. The liberties of Westminster contain the several parishes of St Martin in the Fields, St James’s, St Anne, St Paul, Covent Garden, St Mary le Strand, St Clement Danes, St George, Hanover Square, and the precinct of the Savoy. The government, both of the city and liberties, is under the jurisdiction of the dean and chapter of Westminster, in civil as well as ecclesiastical affairs; and their authority extends to the precinct of St Martin le Grand, by Newgate Street, and to some towns of Essex, which are exempted from the jurisdiction of the bishop of London and the archbishop of Canterbury; but the management of the civil part has, ever since the Reformation, been in the hands of laymen, elected from time to time, and confirmed by the dean and chapter. The chief of these laymen are the high steward, the deputysteward, and the high bailif, who hold their offices for life.
[7:21:864]

There are also sixteen burgesses and their assistants, out of which are elected two head burgesses, one for the city, and the other for the liberties. Another officer is the high constable, who has all the other constables under his direction. See London.
