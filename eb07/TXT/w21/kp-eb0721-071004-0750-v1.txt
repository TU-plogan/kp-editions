WALDECK, a small principality of the north of Germany, deriving its name from a mountain castle, the ruins of which still exist It is between 51° 4' and 51° 31' of north latitude, and between 8° 26' and 9° 7' east longitude, as regards the chief part of the territory; but a small portion of it, the Graffshaft, or county of Pyrmont, is detached from it, and lies between the Prussian and Hanoverian dominions. The entire extent is 480 square miles, or about 307,200 English acres. The whole of Waldeck is a mountainous and woody district, the soil generally is poor and [7:21:711] stony, and in the best years scarcely yielding sufficient corn for home consumption, although potatoes form a large portion of the food of the labourers. It has no large rivers, but many small streams, which ultimately fall into the river Weser. In some parts there are large flocks of sheep, which have been improved by mixing with Spanish and Saxon rams, and now produce fine wool. The horned cattle yield abundance of butter and some cheese, which are the only products of the soil that are sent out of the country in exchange for the few foreign luxuries that are needed. The forests abound with game of all kinds, and some of the wild animals, especially the wild hogs, are a great annoyance to the cultivators. The mountain-streams abound in fish, and the trout in them are reported to be of excellent flavour. There are mines of iron and of copper worked, and the proceeds manufactured on the spots where they are drawn. The annual quantity of iron is about 200 tons, that of copper not exceeding forty tons. There are salt springs, which provide the quantity needed of culinary salt; and there are some quarries of good marble. The countship of Pyrmont consists only of a single valley, surrounded on all sides with lofty hills, through which the river Emmer runs, and on its banks are some rich meadows and a few corn-fields. The mineral spring is the great attraction; and accommodations are well provided for the numerous guests that repair to it in search of health. The government of Waldeck is vested in the prince alone, though, on the ancient principle, the states at times assemble, and form a single chamber, at Arolsen, to make laws, but have little business to do. The capital of the principality is a town of 2060 inhabitants. The other towns are Pyrmont, with 4500, and Arolsen, with 1750. The whole population is 54,000, scattered in ten small towns and 105 villages. They adhere to the Lutheran religion, with the exception of 800 catholics, 600 reformed, and 500 Jews, with a very few quakers. The revenues of the prince amount to about L.40,000, of which L.7000 arises from the water of Pyrmont, and the greater part of the remainder from his landed property; but the revenue is loaded with a heavy debt. At one period the military force was raised to 1700 men, but at present the contingent to the German confederation is 518 men.
