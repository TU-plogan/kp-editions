WUDWAN, a town of Hindustan, province of Gujerat, district of Chalawara. It is of considerable extent and population, and possesses a fort of considerable strength, almost new. It belongs to a rajpoot family noted for their skill and bravery in predatory wars. In 1805 it was besieged for two months without success by the Guicowarâ€™s army. It carries on, by means of caravans, an extensive trade with the Gulf of Cambay. These caravans require an escort of twenty to thirty matchlock-men, to guard against the freebooters that infest the country.
