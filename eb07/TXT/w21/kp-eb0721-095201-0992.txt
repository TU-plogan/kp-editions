WYCOMBE, Chipping or High, a market-town of the county of Bucks and hundred of Desborough, twenty-nine miles from London. It is a well-built town, pleasantly situated on a brook which joins the Thames at Marlow, but near Wycombe turns the wheels of several paper-mills, and of others for grinding corn. It is incorporated under a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors. A good market is held on Friday. The population amounted in 1821 to 5599, and in 1831 to 6299.
