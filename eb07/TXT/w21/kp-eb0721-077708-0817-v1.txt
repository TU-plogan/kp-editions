WARSAW, the capital of the kingdom of Poland, is situated on the left bank of the Vistula, in north lat. 52° 14', and east long. 21° 2', in the midst of a vast sandy plain. The city proper is ill built, with narrow dirty streets; but the suburbs are fine and spacious, with wide, straight and [7:21:778] well-paved streets. At the close of 1835, the number of buildings or houses was 4298, of which 2968 were of stone, and 1330 of wood. The population at the same time amounted to 133,884, including 33,389 Jews. The royal palace is a vast structure; and, besides it, there is a great number of other fine palaces and public buildings, a cathedral dedicated to St John, and many other churches. Since the late revolution and re-subjugation of Poland, the Russian government has constructed a strong citadel at Warsaw, to overawe the Poles. The city still contains a number of scientific and literary establishments; but the principal ones, namely, the university, re-opened so lately as 1818, and the Royal Society of the Friends of Science, have been suppressed. Before the revolution, no other city in eastern Europe issued so great a number of periodical publications, in proportion to the amount of population; it was, besides, the centre of the industry and the commerce of the kingdom. The trade has again revived; and, in 1835, the principal articles manufactured in the town and exported were, carriages, in value 156,000 florins; pianofortes, 87,520; saddlery, 82,480; silver-plated ware, 82,180; carpets, 63,400; agricultural machines and implements, 47,850; woollen goods, 44,200. Praga, the largest suburb, situate on the right bank of the river, and connected with the city by a bridge of boats, is noted in the history of Poland for its terrible capture by Suwarrow in 1795. In the immediate neighbourhood of the city is the superb castle of Villanov or Willanow, built by the great king John Sobieski, who died here in 1696; and the island of Kepa-Saoka, embellished with gardens. Warsaw is 170 miles S. S. E. of Dantzig. (c. h .)
