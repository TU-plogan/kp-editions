WALSINGHAM, a market-town of the county of Norfolk, in the hundred of North Greenhoe, 117 miles from London, and four miles from the sea. It was formerly a large place, when the abbey, whose ruins remain to attest its former magnificence, contained an image of the Virgin Mary, much venerated, and visited by numerous pilgrims, and to which Henry VIII. once repaired barefooted, with the present of a valuable necklace. The reformation caused the town to decline. It has now a handsome church, and a good market on Friday. The country around it is highly fertile, and especially yields abundance of saffron. The population amounted in 1821 to 1067, and in 1831 to 1004.

Walsingham, Thomas, an English Benedictine monk of the monastery of St Alban’s, who lived about the year 1440. He applied himself to the history and antiquity of his country, in quality of historiographer to the king, and composed the History of King Henry VI., with other works.

Walsingham, Sir Francis, secretary of state during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was descended from an ancient family in Norfolk, but was born at Chislehurst in Kent, in the year 1536. After having made great progress in his studies at Cambridge, he was twice sent ambassador to France, and at his return to England was employed in the most important affairs, became secretary of state, and was one of the commissioners for the trial of Mary queen of Scotland. Sir Francis was undoubtedly one of the most refined politicians and most penetrating statesmen that any age has produced. He had an admirable talent, both in discovering and managing the secret recesses of the heart. He had his spies in most courts in Christendom, and allowed them a liberal maintenance; for it was his maxim, that knowledge cannot be bought too dear. In 1587, the king of Spain having made vast preparations, which surprised and kept all Europe in suspense, Walsingham employed his utmost endeavours for the discovery of that important secret; and accordingly procured intelligence from Madrid that the king had informed his council of his having despatched an express to Rome, with a letter written with his own hand to the pope, acquainting him with the true design of his preparations, and begging his blessings upon him; which design for some reasons he could not disclose till the return of the courier. The secret being thus lodged with the pope, Walsingham, by means of a Venetian priest, whom he retained at Rome as a spy, got a copy of the original letter, which was stolen out of the pope’s cabinet by a gentleman of the bed-chamber, who took the key out of the pope’s pocket while he slept. After this, by his dexterous management, he caused the Spaniards’ bills to be protested at Genoa, which should have supplied them with money for their extraordinary preparations; and by this means he happily retarded this formidable invasion for a whole year. In short, he spent his whole time and faculties in the service of Queen Elizabeth, on which account her majesty was heard to say, “that in diligence and sagacity he exceeded her expectations.” However, after ail his eminent services to his country, this man gave a remarkable proof at his death, which happened on the 6th of April 1590, how far he preferred the public interest to his own; he being so poor, that, excepting his library, which was a very fine one, he had scarcely effects enough to defray the expense of his funeral.
