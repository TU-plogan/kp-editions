WIVELSCOMBE, a market-town of the county of Somerset, in the hundred of West Kingsbury, ten miles from Taunton and 156 from London. It stands on the river Tone. It formerly had considerable manufactories of coarse woollen goods, which have nearly disappeared by the rivalry of the northern counties. The town has a corporation, and is governed by a portreeve. It has a good market on Tuesday, and two annual fairs. The population amounted in 1821 to 2791, and in 1831 to 3047.
