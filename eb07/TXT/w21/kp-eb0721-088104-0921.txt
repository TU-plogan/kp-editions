WIESBADEN, one of the provinces into which the duchy of Nassau in Germany is divided. It is on the Rhine, and is bounded by other provinces of the duchy on every part except the south-east, where it touches Hesse-Darmstadt. It comprehends one city, two market-towns, twelve villages, 2272 houses, and 18,922 inhabitants. A part is hilly, but much of it a rich level country. The sides of the hills are covered with highly productive vineyards, and their summits with rich forests. The corn grown is much more than sufficient for its own population.

Wiesbaden , a city of the duchy of Nassau, and now its capital, where the states assemble, and in which the chief courts of justice are held. It is an open place, having only the ruins of walls at the ancient parts of it. The new town is an elegant mass of buildings, both for private residences and public purposes. The old city is ill built. Both together contain 8970 inhabitants, who are regular residents; but in the summer months the number of temporary visitors is greater than the permanent population. They are chiefly attracted by the reputation of the warm baths, but many also by the pleasures and accommodations attainable in a more favourable degree than at any of the other German watering-places. The assembly-rooms and the hotels are striking objects. There is a Catholic, a Lutheran, and a Calvinist church, and a ducal palace. The adjacent country is often picturesque, and, from the good state of the roads, the excursions are agreeable. The town contains a variety of manufactures of what may be called fancy articles and luxuries, and, on the whole, has many attractions.
