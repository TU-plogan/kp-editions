WELSHPOOL, a borough-town and parish of the county of Montgomery, in North Wales, in the hundred of Pool, 177 miles from London. It is pleasantly situated and well built, with a convenient county-hall, in which the assizes are held. It is near the river Severn, and is connected with it by a canal, and by another with Ellesmere. It is the chief place where the Welsh flannels are collected from the neighbouring peasantry. The corporation consists of four aldermen and twelve councillors, and the borough returns one member to the House of Commons. The population amounted in 1821 to 3535, and in 1831 to 3500.
