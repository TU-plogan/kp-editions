WILEIKA, a circle of the Russian government of Minsk, extending in north latitude from 54째 24' to 54째 58', and in east longitude from 26째 7' to 28째 22'. In the west part it is filled with sandy heaths, and in the east with morasses. Between these are extensive woods, with portions among them of land highly productive of corn, hemp, and flax. Several rivers have their sources within the circle, the most considerable of which are the Wilia and the Beresina. A canal of thirty miles in length has been constructed, which unites the river Duna with the Beresina; but, from want of a sufficient head of water, it is only navigable in the spring of the year, even by small barks. The capital of the circle is of the same name, on the river Wilia. It has nothing remarkable, and contains scarcely more than 1000 inhabitants. It is 554 miles from St Petersburg. Long. 26. 40. E. Lat. 54. 35. 30. N.
