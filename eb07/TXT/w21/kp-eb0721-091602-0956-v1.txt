WOOD, Αντηονυ, a well-known literary historian, was the son of Thomas Wood, bachelor of arts and of the civil law, and was born at Oxford on the 17th of December 1632. He studied at Merton College, and in 1655 took the degree of master of arts. He wrote, 1. The History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford; which was afterwards translated into Latin by Mr Wase and Mr Peers, under the title of Historia et Antiquitates Universitatis Oxoniensis, 2 vols, folio. 2. Athence Oxonienses; or an exact Account of all the Writers and Bishops who have had their education in the University of Oxford, from the year 1500 to 1600, 2 fols, folio; which was enlarged in a second edition published in 1721 by Bishop Tanner. This work, which is highly valuable as a collection of materials, has been greatly improved by Dr Bliss. Upon its publication, the author was attacked by the university in defence of Edward earl of Clarendon, lord high chancellor of England, and chancellor of the university, and was likewise animadverted upon by Bishop Burnet; upon which he published a Vindication of the Historiographer of the University of Oxford. He died at Oxford on the 29th of November 1695.

Wood , a substance of which the trunks and branches of trees consist. See Planting, Timber , and Vegetable Physiology. Wood , Fossil. Fossil wood, or whole trees, or parts of them, are very frequently found buried in the earth, and that in different strata; sometimes in stone, but more usually in earth, and sometimes in small pieces loose among the gravel. These, according to the time they have lain in the earth, or the matter they have lain among, are found differently altered from their original state; some of them having suffered very little change, and others being so highly impregnated with crystalline, sparry, pyritical, or other extraneous matter, as to appear mere masses of stone, or lumps of the common matter of the pyrites, &c. of the dimensions, and more or less of the internal figure, of the vegetable bodies into the pores of which they have made their way. See Geology.
