WHIDAH, a kingdom of Africa, on the coast of Guinea, and to the west of the Gold Coast; extending about ten miles along the sea. It is a populous country, well furnished with large villages; and there are so many small ones, that they are not above a musket-shot from each other. Whidah was conquered by the king of Dahomy. Its trade consists of slaves, elephantsâ€™ teeth, wax, and honey.
