WILLIS, T homas, a celebrated English physician, was born at Great Bedwin, in Wiltshire, on the 27th of January 1621, and studied at Christ Church, Oxford. When that city was garrisoned for the king, he, among other scholars, bore arms for his majesty; and he devoted his leisure hours to the study of physic. The garrison of Oxford at length sur rendering to the parliament, he applied himself to the practice of his profession, and soon rendered himself famous by his care and skill. He appropriated a room as an oratory for divine service according to the church of England, whither most of the loyalists in Oxford daily resorted. In 1660, he became Sedleian professor of natural philosophy, and the same year took the degree of doctor of physic. In 1664, he discovered the famous medicinal spring at Alstrop, near Brackley. He was one of the first members of the Royal Society, and soon made his name illustrious by his excellent writings. In 1666, after the fire of London, he removed to Westminster; and his practice became greater [7:21:888] than that of any of the physicians his contemporaries. He died at his house in St Martin’s, on the 11th of November 1675, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was justly admired for his deep insight into natural and experimental philosophy, anatomy, and chemistry, for his successful practice, and for the elegance and purity of his Latin style. He wrote in English “A plain and easy Method for preserving those that are well from the Infection of the Plague, and for curing such as are infected.” All his Latin works were printed in two vols. 4to, at Geneva in 1676, and at Amsterdam in 1682. His grandson, Browne Willis, LL. D., was the author of several antiquarian works.
