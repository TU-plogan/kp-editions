WEST, one of the cardinal points of the horizon, diametrically opposite to the east; and strictly defined the intersection of the prime vertical with the horizon on that side the sun sets in.

West, Gilbert, was the son of Dr West, prebendary of Winchester, who published an edition of Pindar in 1697. He studied at Winchester and Eton, and from thence was placed in Christ Church, Oxford. His studious and serious turn inclined him to take orders; but Lord Cobham, his maternal uncle, diverted him from that pursuit, and gave him a cornetcy in his own regiment. This profession he soon quitted on account of an opening of another nature, [7:21:860]which presented him with a flattering prospect of advancement in life. A number of young gentlemen were to be selected from the universities, and, at the expense of government, were to be taught foreign languages, and then sent to the secretary’s office, to be initiated into business, and trained there for the public service, as envoys, ambassadors, &c. West was one of the few pitched upon; and on his first introduction into that office, Lord Townshend, secretary of state, treated him with singular marks of regard, and the strongest inclinations to serve him were testified from all quarters. But Lord Cobham’s strong opposition to the measures of the government rendered these advantages entirely fruitless; and the ministers honestly told Mr West that he must not expect them to distinguish his merit, as any favours conferred upon him would be imputed as done to his uncle. He now left that office, and all his views of making his fortune; and entering into the married state, retired to Wickham in Kent, where he lived in great domestic comfort and tranquil happiness. He was there visited by his valuable friends, who held the most delightful converse of wit, humour, and learning, supported upon the principles of virtue, sound reasoning, and solid friendship, which rendered the whole cheerful, animating, and instructive. In 1752 he was appointed one of the clerks of the privy council; and Pitt, on becoming paymaster, nominated him treasurer of Chelsea Hospital. Towards the end of his life, he wholly applied himself to the study of the Scriptures, being extremely anxious to try his utmost endeavours to reconcile the seeming inconsistencies which gave the enemies of revealed religion a handle to doubt and discredit their authenticity. The result of his inquiries was partly communicated to the public in his “Observations on the Resurrection.” Lond. 1747, 8vo. This work procured him from the university of Oxford the degree of LL. D. conferred by diploma. On the evidences of the truth of the New Testament he meditated another work, but did not live to execute his design. He lost his only son in 1755; and on the 26th of March in the following year, a stroke of palsy terminated his own career. He left behind him the character of an amiable and pious man. His Observations, which, it has been said, were written to confirm the wavering faith of his great friends Pitt and Lyttelton, bear ample testimony to his reasoning powers and the sincerity of his religion, while his translations from Pindar shew him to have been a respectable Greek scholar, and very considerable poet. His “Dissertation on the Olympick Games” is likewise a creditable specimen of his learning.
