WUDWAN, a town of Hindustan, province of Gujerat, district of Chalawara. It is of considerable extent and population, and possesses a fort of considerable strength, almost new. It belongs to a rajpoot family noted for their skill and bravery in predatory wars. In 1805 it was besieged for two months without success by the Guicowar’s army. It carries on, by means of caravans, an extensive trade with the Gulf of Cambay. These caravans require an escort of twenty to thirty matchlock-men, to guard against the freebooters that infest the country.
