GOLTZIUS, Henry, a celebrated engraver and painter, was born in 1558, at Mu)breck, in the duchy of Ju)iers. He was taught engraving by Theodore Cuerenhert, and succeeded well in the practice of the art, notwithstanding the disadvantage of a lame hand, which was occasioned by his falling into the fire whilst young. He was first employed by his master, and afterwards he worked fo» Philip Galle. Domestic troubles and ill health having induced him to travel, he went through Germany into Italy; and passed under a feigned name, that his studies might not be interrupted. He visited Bologna, Florence, Naples, and Venice, constantly applying himself to drawing from the antique statues, and studying the works of the great masters. At Rome he resided longest; and in that city he produced several excellent engravings from Polidoro, Raphael, and other eminent painters. Ön his return to his native country he established himself at Haerlem, where he engraved many of the drawings which he had made during his abode in Italy. He died at Haerlem in 1617, aged fifty-nine.
