GRATIUS, Faliscus, a Roman poet, the contemporary of Ovid, and from his name probably a slave or freedman, but respecting whose life we have no particulars. A poem of his on hunting has been preserved, entitled Cynegeti-eon, in 540 hexameters; but its conclusion has been lost. The language is pure, and worthy of the age in which he lived, though in some passages he is obscure. Gratius seems to have imitated the work of Xenophon on the same subject, though it also contains much which can be found nowhere else. ( Burmann, Poet. Lal. Min. tom. i.; Wernsdorf, Poet. Lat. Min. tom. i., in the preface “De Gratio et Nemesiano et utriusque CynegeticoProoemium.” Gratius Faliscus, Cynegelicon, &c. Mitau, 1775.)
