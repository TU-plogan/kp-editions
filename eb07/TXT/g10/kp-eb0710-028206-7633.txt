GAINSBOROUGH, a market-town of the county of Lincoln, in the hundred of Corringham, and the Lindsay division, 148 miles from London. It is situated on the right bank of the Trent, which divides it from Nottinghamshire, and consists principally of one street running parallel to the river. The tide comes in with more rapidity, and rises higher, than in any other port of England except Chepstow, though it is nearly forty miles from the Humber. The Trent being thus far navigable, conveys the agricultural produce of the vicinity to distant markets, and makes Gainsborough a kind of emporium for such heavy articles as coal, salt, timber, iron, and others; but it has no manufactures, and little other trade. There is no corporate body of magistrates. The market is held on Tuesday. The population amounted in 1821 to 5893, and in 1831 to 6658.
