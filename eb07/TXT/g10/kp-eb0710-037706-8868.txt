+====================================================================+


GELLERT, Christian Furghtegott, was born on the 4th of July 1715, at Haynichen, near Freyberg, where his father was a clergyman. He was extraordinary professor of philosophy at Leipsic, and a distinguished writer among the Germans. When only thirteen years of age he showed himself possessed of poetical genius; but having none to guide his taste for composition, he was led to imitate Gunther, Neukerch, and Hanke, men of indifferent abilities. He studied theology at Leipsic in 1734, and returned home at the expiration of four years, when he commenced public speaker; but his timid disposition prevented him from shining as an orator in the pulpit. The delicacy of his constitution forbidding him to aspire after extensive learning, he confined himself to the acquisition of that which might render him useful. He was much respected for his first attempts in poetry, called Amusements of Reason and Wit, ¼'hich appeared in 1742.

The labour which he found requisite for the composition of sermons inclined him to lay aside the clerical profession, and devote himself wholly to the instruction of youth, in which he not only implanted knowledge in the minds of his pupils, but also inspired them with the love of religion and virtue. He was made master of arts in 1744, and published the first volume of his Fables in the ensuing year. His Swedish Countess was the first German romance deserving of notice. He gave the world the second part of his Fables in 1748, although two years before this period he had been much afflicted with an hypochondriacal affection. In 1751 he was solicited to accept the office of extraordinary professor of philosophy, together with a decent salary, which was augmented on the termination of the war.

Assailed by unconquerable lowness of spirits and confirmed melancholy, he still exhibited the same patience, resignation, and universal philanthropy, as he had ever shown, qualities which excited the admiration of the enemy during the war. His sufferings continued to increase in severity, and at last terminated his existence on the 13th of December 1769. He contributed much to the improvement of the taste and morals of his countrymen, and their gratitude for his services made them deeply lament his loss. His praise ∙was resounded by every voice, and his likeness was cast in gypsum and moulded in wax; it was engraved on copper, and represented in sculpture and in painting.

It is said of this amiable man and captivating writer, by Kutner, who wrote the lives of German authors, that it will probably be a century before the appearance of another poet, so fully qualified to excite the love and admiration of his contemporaries, and to obtain so powerful an influence over the taste and habits of thinking of all descriptions of men. It would indicate too much partiality to call him a genius of the first class, but he certainly was a most agreeable and fertile writer; a poet to whom religion and virtue are deeply indebted; an able reformer of public manners, and fonder of affording consolation than of plunging into despondency. “As long,” says Kutner, “as the Germans shall understand their present language, will the works of Gellert be read; and his character will be honoured while virtue is known and respected.” The following is a list of his principal works: 1. Dissertation on the Epistolary Style; 2. Canticles, or Religious Poetry; 3. Moral and Didactic Poetry; 4. Tales and Fables; 5. Comedies, Leipsic, 1745, in 8vo; 6. The Swedish Countess of C ∙ * * Leipsic, 1746, in 8vo; 7. Mixed Works; 8. Dissertations on Literature and Morals, Leipsic, 1747, in 8vo; 9. Moral Lessons, published after his death by J. 1. Schlegel and G. L. Heyer, Leipsic, 1770, in 2 vols. 8vo.
