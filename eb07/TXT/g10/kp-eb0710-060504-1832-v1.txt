GOLDEN, something which has a relation to gold, or consists of gold.

Golden Calf was a figure of a calf, which the Israelites cast in gold, or some preparation of that metal, and set up in the wilderness to worship during Moses’ absence in the mount; and which that legislator at his return burned, ground to powder, and mixed with the water the people were to drink.

Golden Fleece, in the ancient mythology, was the skin or fleece of the ram upon which Phryxus and Hella are supposed to have swum across the sea to Colchis, and which being sacrificed to Jupiter, was hung upon a tree in the grove of Mars, guarded by two brazen-hoofed bulls, and a monstrous dragon that never slept. The fleece was taken and carried off by Jason and the Argonauts.

Many authors have endeavoured to show that this fable is an allegorical representation of some real history, particularly of the philosopher’s stone; whilst others have explained it by the profit of the wool trade to Colchis, or the gold which they commonly gathered there with fleeces in the rivers.

Order of the Golden Fleece is a military order instituted by Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1429. It took its denomination from a representation of the golden fleece, borne by the knights on their collars, which consisted of flints and steels.

Golden Number, in Chronology, a number showing what year of the moon’s cycle any given year is. See Chronology. Golden Rule, in Arithmetic, a rule or praxis, of great use and extent in the art of numbers, by which we find a fourth proportional to three quantities given. The golden rule is also called the Rule of Three and Rule of Proportion. See Arithmetic.
