GRANTHAM, a borough-town of the county of Lincoln, in the liberties of Grantham Soke, and parts of Kesteven. It is on the great north road, distant from London 112 miles, on the river Witham, in a healthy and fertile district. It is a corporate town, with a mayor and aiderman, and returns two members to parliament. The church is a fine object, with a tower, one of the loftiest in the kingdom, being 246 feet in height. There are two charity schools in the town, at one of which Sir Isaac Newton received his first lessons. It is a place of very little trade, but has a good market on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 3301, in 1811 to 3646, in 1821 to 4148, and in 1831 to 4590.
