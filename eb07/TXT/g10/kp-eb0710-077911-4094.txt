GRONINGEN, one of the provinces of the Netherlands. It is bounded on the north by the German Ocean, on the east by the mouth of the Ems, the Dollart, arid the kingdom of Hanover, on the south by the province of Drenthe, and on the west by that of Friesland. Il extends over 806 square miles, and contains 159,321 inhabitants. On the shore there is a tract of land from eighteen to twenty miles in breadth, which, by being well drained âˆ£ and embanked, bears excellent crops of oats and some barley, and feeds a great number of cows. The butter and cheese is however inferior to what is produced in the provinces of Holland and Friesland. The land farther from the shore is generally sandy heath, producing much turf, and yielding with much care, on a large extent, a supply of potatoes. The province is divided into three circles, viz. Groningen, Windshotten, and Apingadam.

Groningen, a city, the capital of the province of the same name, in the Netherlands. It stands on the rivers Hunse and Aa, the waters of both which run through the city, and fill the ditches which surround the walls. It is a well-built town, very strongly fortified, with broad streets and good houses. It contains 6000 dwellings, and in 1819 27,800 inhabitants, who were lessened by the fatal fever which visited the province in 1826, so as in 1831 to be only 26,069. There are manufactures of linen and woollen goods. The university contains nineteen professors, and commonly 200 students. The commerce chiefly consists of the export of oats, butter, cheese, and turf. Long. 6. 34. E. Lat. 53. 10. N.

Groningen, a town of the Prussian province of Saxony, in the circle of Oschersleben. It stands on the river Bode, and contains 421 houses, with 2354 inhabitants, employed in flax and wool spinning. Long. 11. 6. 27. E. Lat. 51. 36. 3. N.
