GETHIN, Lady Grace, an English lady of uncommon talents, was the daughter of Sir George Norton of Abbot’s Leigh, in Somersetshire, and born in the year 1676. She [7:10:495]had all the advantages of a liberal education, and became the wife of Sir Richard Gethin, of Gethin Grott in Ireland. She was mistress of great accomplishments, natural and acquired, but did not live long enough to display them to the world, having, unfortunately, died in the twenty-first year of her age. She was buried in Westminster Abbey, where a beautiful monument with an inscription is erected over her remains; and for perpetuating her memory, provision was made that a sermon should be preached in Westminster Abbey yearly, on Ash Wednesday. She wrote, and left behind her, in loose papers, a work, which soon after her death was methodized, and published under the title of Reliquite Gethiniantε ; or, some Remains of Grace, Lady Gethin. This was a collection of choice discourses, pleasant apophthegms, and witty sentences, written by her, for the most part, by way of essay, and at leisure hours. London, 1700, 4∙to.
