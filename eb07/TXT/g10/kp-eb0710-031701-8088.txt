GARD, a department of the south-east of France, formed in part of the ancient province of Nismes, and of Uzes and Alais, formerly portions of Languedoc. It is bounded on the north by the departments of Lozère and Ardêche, on the east by Vaucluse, on the south-east by the Mouths of the Rhone, on the south by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south-west by Hérault, and on the west by Aveiron. It extends over 2082 square miles, containing, according to the Statistique de la France, 592,108 hectares. It is divided into four arrondissements, thirty-eightcantonβ, 342 communes, and contains 366,259 individuals, of whom about one third profess the Protestant religion. There is great variety in the face of the country. The southern part, which extends to the sea, and was probably once covered by it, is a level plain, with many morasses, lakes, and dykes. The northern parts are higher, and some of them mountainous. The range of the Cevennes Hills passes through these portions, and from them issue the rivers Allier towards the north, the Lot and the Tam towards the west, the Hérault and the Bedourle towards the south, and the Ardêche and the Gardon towards the east, abundantly watering the valleys on both sides. The soil is generally either calcareous or schistose, resting on a bed of granite, and better adapted for the growth of olives, grapes, and other fruits, than tor com. The climate, especially to the south, is mild; snow rarely falls, and quickly disappears; but, on the other hand, the summers are excessively hot, and the air arid.

Although some good wheat is grown near Nismes, yet it is insufficient for the few who eat it, and the greater part of the inhabitants are fed with rye, oats, and buck-wheat, and during a great part of the year with chestnuts. This latter, amongst the peasantry, furnishes a meal three times a day, either boiled or fried in olive oil; and when a bad year for them happens, the sufferings of the poor are excessive.

The chief products of the department are wine, brandy, and oil; but large quantities of silk are made in some districts. The yearly production at present is calculated to be 150,000 pounds of raw silk; before the Revolution it was 350,000 pounds. The horses and cows have no distinguishing properties, but the sheep are an excellent race, producing good wool, milk that is made into cheese, and very savoury meat. The manufacturing industry is not considerable, consisting of the fabrication of cloth, silks, hats, glass, earthenware, and perfumery.

The trade of the department is confined to the export of wine, brandy, raisins, chestnuts, capers, liquorice, coal, salt, and wool.
