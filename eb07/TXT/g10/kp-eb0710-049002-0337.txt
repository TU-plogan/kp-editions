GERMINATION, amongst botanists, comprehends the precise time which the seeds take to rise after they have been committed to the soil. The different species of seeds are longer or shorter in rising according to the degree of heat which is proper to each. Millet, wheat, and several of the grasses, rise in one day; blite, spinach, beans, mustard, kidney beans, turnips, and rocket, in three days; lettuce and dill, in four; cucumber, gourd, melon, and fress, in five; radish and beet, in six; barley, in seven; orach, in eight; purslain, in nine; cabbage, in ten; hyssop, in thirty; parsley, in forty or fifty days; peach, almond, walnut, chestnut, peony, horned poppy, hypecoum, and ranunculus falcatus, in one year; rose bush, cornel tree, hawthorn, medlar, and hazel nut, in two. The seeds of some species of orchis, and of some liliaceous plants, never rise at aD. Of seeds, some require to be sown almost as soon as they are ripe, otherwise they will not sprout or germinate; and of this kind are the seeds of coffee and fraxinella. Others, particularly those of the pea-bloom flowers, preserve their germinating faculty for a series of years.
