GOSLAR, a city of the province of Hildesheim, in the kingdom of Hanover. It stands in the Hartz. Mountains, at the foot of the Rammelsberg, on the river Gosse. It is an ancient town, with narrow streets and large antiquely-fashioned houses. It contains four churches and two religious houses, and is the seat of some provincial courts of law. Much of the ore extracted from the mines in the neighbourhood is here purified, and a great part of it converted into appropriate utensils in some large manufactories. It has considerable breweries and distilleries, and two vitriol works, and it contains 6700 inhabitants. LongÂ· 10. 14. 1. E. Lat. 54. 27. N.
