GEMAPPE, or Jemmappes, a village of the Netherlands, in the province of Hainault, near the river Scheldt, on the road from Valenciennes to Mons. It is remarkable for the victory gained by the French under Dumouriez over the Austrians in 1792, by which the former became masters of the Austrian Netherlands.
