GALENISTS, a denomination given to physicians who practise, prescribe, or write, on the Galenical principles, and are opposed to the chemists.

Galenists, or Galenites, in Ecclesiastical History, a branch of Mennonites or Anabaptists, who adopt several of the opinions of the Socinians, or rather Arians, respecting the divinity of our Saviour. In 1664 the Waterîand-ians were divided into two parties, of which the one was called Galenists, and the other Apostolians. They are so denominated from their leader Galenus, a learned and eloquent physician of Amsterdam, who considered the Christian religion as a system which laid much less stress on faith than on practice, and who was for admitting into the communion of the Mennonites all those who acknowledged the divine origin of the books of the Old and New Testaments, and led holy and virtuous lives.
