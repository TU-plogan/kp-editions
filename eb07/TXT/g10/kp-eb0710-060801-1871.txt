GOLF, the name of a certain game amongst the Scotch, and said to be peculiar to their country. Amongst this people it has been very ancient; for there are statutes prohibiting it as early as the year 1457, lest it should interfere with the sport of archery. It is commonly played on rugged or broken ground, covered with short grass, in the neighbourhood of the sea shore. A field of this sort is in Scotland called linkt. The game is generally played in parties of one or two on each side. Each party has an exceedingly hard ball, somewhat larger than a pullet’s egg; and this they strike with a slender and elastic club, of about four feet in length, crooked in the head, and having lead run into it to make it heavy. The ball being struck with this club, flies sometimes to the distance of two hundred yards, and the game is gained by the ≈who puts his ball into the hole with the fewest es. But the game does not depend solely upon striking the longest ball, but also upon measuring the strength of the stroke, and applying it in such direction as to lay the ball in smooth ground, whence it may easily be moved at the next stroke. To encourage this amusement, the city of Edinburgh, in the year 1744, gave to the company of golfers a silver club, to be played for annually by the company, the victor to append a gold or silver piece to the prize. For their better accommodation, twenty-two members of the company, in the year 1768, subscribed L30 each to build a house where their meetings might be held. The spot chosen for this purpose was the southwest corner of Leith Links, where an area was taken in feu from the magistrates of Edinburgh, and a house and tavern built upon it. St Andrews has long been celebrated tor the game of golf.
