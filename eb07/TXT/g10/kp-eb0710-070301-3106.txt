GRAMMARIAN, one who is skilled in or teaches grammar. Anciently the name grammarian was a title of honour in literature and erudition, being given to persons accounted learned in any art or faculty whatsoever. But it is otherwise now, being frequently used as a term of reproach, to signify a dry plodding person, employed about words and phrases, but inattentive to the true beauties of expression, and also to delicacy of sentiment. The ancient grammarians, called alsophilologers, must not, however, be confounded with grammatists, whose sole business was to teach children the first elements of language. Varro, Cicero, Messala, and even Julius Caesar, thought it no dishonour to be ranked as grammarians, who in fact had many privileges granted to them by the Roman emperors.
