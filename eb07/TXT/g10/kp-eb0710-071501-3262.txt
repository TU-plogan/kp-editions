GRAVE, in Grammar, a species of accent opposed to acute. The grave accent is expressed thus('); and shows that the voice is to be depressed, and the syllable over which it is placed to be pronounced in a low deep tone.

Grave, in Music, is applied to a sound which is in a low or deep tone. The thicker the chord or string, the graver the tone or note will be, and the smaller the more acute. Notes are supposed to be grave in proportion as the vibrations of the chord are less frequent.

Grave, in the Italian music, serves to denote the slowest movement.

Grave is also used to signify a tomb, in which a person defunct is interred. Graves, amongst the Jews, were generally without the city, though we meet with instances of their interring the dead in towns. Frequent mention is made of graves upon mountains, in highways, in gardens, and even in private houses; so that nothing on this head seems to have been fixed by any invariable usage. The same thing may be observed with respect to the Greeks. The Thebans had a law that every person who built a house should provide a burial ground. Men who had distinguished themselves were frequently buried in the public forum. The most general custom, however, was to bury without the city, chiefly by the side of the highway. The Romans were forbidden by the law of the Twelve Tables to bury or burn the dead in the city; but some, we find, had their sepulchres in Rome, though they paid a fine for this indulgence.
