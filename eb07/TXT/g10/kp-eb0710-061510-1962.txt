GORDIAN Knot, in Antiquity, a knot made in the leathers or harness of the chariot of Gordius king of Phrygia, so very intricate that there was no finding where it began or ended. The inhabitants had a tradition, that the oracle had declared that he who untied this knot should be master of Asia. Alexander having undertaken it, was unable to accomplish it; when, fearing lest his not untying it should be deemed an ill augury, and prove a check in the way of his conquests, he cut it asunder with his sword, and thus either accomplished or eluded the oracle.
