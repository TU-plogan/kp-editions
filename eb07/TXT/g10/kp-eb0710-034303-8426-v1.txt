GARLAND, a sort of chaplet made of flowers, feathers, and sometimes precious stones, and worn on the head in the manner of a crown. The word is formed from the French guirlande, and that of the barbarous Latin gaτ-landa, or ha\\&n ghirlanda. Menage traces its origin from gyrus through gyrulus, to gyrulare, gyrlandum, ghirlan-dum, and at length ghiτlanda and guirlande ; but Hick rejects this derivation, and brings the word from gardel han-da, which in the northern languages signify a nosegay artfully wrought with the hand.
