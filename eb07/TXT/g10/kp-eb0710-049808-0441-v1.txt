GIAGH, in Chronology, a cycle of twelve years, in use amongst the Turks and Cathayans or Chinese. Each year of a gιagh bears the name of some animal; the first that of a mouse, the second that of a bullock, the third that of a lynx or leopard, the fourth that of a hare, the fifth that of a crocodile, the sixth that of a serpent, the seventh that of a horse, the eighth that of a sheep, the ninth that of a monkey, the tenth that of a hen, the eleventh that of a dog, and the twelfth that of a hog. The day is also divided into twelve parts, called giaghs, and distinguished by the name of some animals. Each giagh contains two of two of our hours, and is divided into eight kehs, each equal to a quarter of an hour with us.
