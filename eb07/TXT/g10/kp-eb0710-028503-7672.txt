GALERICULUM was a cap worn both by men and women amongst the ancient Romans. It consisted of skin, which was so neatly dressed with human hair that the artificial covering could scarcely be distinguished from the natural. It was used by those whose hair was thin; and also by wrestlers, in order to keep their own hair from receiving any injury from the oils with which they were rubbed over before they exercised. It seems to have resembled our wigs.
