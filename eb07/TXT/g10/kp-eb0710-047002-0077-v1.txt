GEPIDAe, Gepides, or Gepidi, in Ancient Geography, according to Procopius, were a Gothic people, or a branch of that race, some of whom, in the migration of the Goths, settled in an island at the mouth of the Vistula, [7:10:471] which they called Gepidos, after their own name, which signifies lazy or slothful; whilst others established themselves in Dacia, and called their settlement there Gepidia.
