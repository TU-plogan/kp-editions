GENERATION, in Physiology. See Physiology. Generation is used, though somewhat improperly, for genealogy, or the series of children issuing from the same stock. Thus the gospel of St Matthew commences with the book of the generation of Jesus Christ. The latter and more accurate translators, instead of generation use the word genealogy. Generation is also used to signify a people, race, or nation, especially in the literal translations of the Scripture, where the word generally occurs wherever the Latin has generatio, and the Greek ymftς.

Generation is also used in the sense of an age, or the ordinary period of man’s life. Thus we say, to the third and fourth generation. In this sense historians usually reckon a generation the space of thirty-three years or thereabouts.
