GEFLEBORG, one of the provinces of Northern Sweden, extending from latitude 60. 10. to 62. 25. north, and from longitude 17. 15. to 21. 43. east, being 8008 square miles in extent. It comprehends four cities and 1807 insulated establishments, with 79,100 inhabitants. It is generally a hilly country, but abounding in extensive lakes. Not more than one fiftieth part of the land is cultivated, and much of that yields but scanty crops of rye or oats; but in bad years, food is so scarce that the rind of the fir-trees is used as a substitute for other aliment. The chief produce is iron, millstones, whetstones, and wood for fuel and building. Spinning and weaving for the families are conducted in each house, and their home-made woollen goods arc both warm and durable.

Geflebohg, a city, the capital of the province of the same name, in Sweden. It stands on the river Geflean, which collects the waters of several lakes, and conveys them to the Gulf of Bothnia. It contains 1200 houses, and 5930 inhabitants. It is a town of considerable trade for the export[7:10:377] of iron, wood, pitch, and tar, and has some manufactures of sail-cloth, coarse linen, and leather, and some sugar refineries, distilleries, and breweries. Long. 17. 3. 10. E. Lat. 60. 39. 45. N.
