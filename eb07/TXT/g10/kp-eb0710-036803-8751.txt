GASSENDI, Peter, one of the most celebrated philosophers France has produced, was born at Chantersier, near Digne in Provence, in 1592. When a child, he took particular delight in gazing at the moon and stars as often as they appeared in clear unclouded weather; and the pleasure he thus experienced frequently drew him into bye places, so that his parents had often to seek him, not without many anxious fears and apprehensions. They therefore put him to school at Digne, where, in a short time, he made such extraordinary progress in learning, that some persons who had seen specimens of his genius resolved to have him removed to Aix, in order to study philosophy under Fesaye, a learned Carmelite friar. This proposal was so disagreeable to his father, who intended to breed him up in his own way to country business, that he would consent to it only upon condition that his son should return home in two years at farthest. Accordingly, young Gassendi, at the end of the appointed time, repaired to Chantersier; but he had not been long there when he was invited to become professor of rhetoric at Digne, before he was quite sixteen years of age; and he had been engaged in that office but three years, when his master Fesaye dying, he was made professor in his stead at Aix. When he had been a few years at the latter place, he composed his Paradoxical Exercitations against Aristotle, which having fallen into the hands of Nicholas Peiresc, that great patron of learning joined with Joseph Walter, prior of Valette, in promoting the author; and the latter having entered into holy orders, was first made canon of the church of Digne and doctor of divinity, and then advanced to the wardenship or rectory of that church. Gassendi’s fondness for astronomy grew with his years; and as his reputation daily increased, he was in the year 1645 appointed royal professor of mathematics at Paris. This professorship being chiefly designed for astronomy, our author read lectures on that science to a crowded audience. However, he did not hold this place long; for a dangerous cough, accompanied by inflammation of the lungs, obliged him in the year 1647 to return to Digne for the benefit of his native air.

Antiquarian, historian, biographer, natural philosopher, naturalist, astronomer, ‘geometrician, anatomist, preacher, metaphysician, hellenist, dialectician, an erudite scholar, an able critic, and withal an elegant writer, Gassendi ranged through nearly the whole circle of the sciences and arts, at a period when the sciences and arts had been but recently revived; and throughout his laborious and ingenious researches he constantly manifested an excellent spirit. He was the first disciple of Bacon in France, the friend of Galileo and Kepler, the opponent of Descartes, and the precursor of Newton and of Locke. For an eloquent and comprehensive view of his labours and researches as a metaphysician, the reader is referred to the first Dissertation, prefixed to the present work.
