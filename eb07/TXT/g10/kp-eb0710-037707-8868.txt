+====================================================================+


GELLI, John Baptist, an eminent Italian writer, was born of mean parents, at Florence, in the year 1498. He was bred a tailor, some say a shoemaker; but he had such an extraordinary genius, that he acquired several languages, and made uncommon progress in the belles-lettres; and, though he continued to work at his trade, became acquainted with all the wits and learned men at Florence, and his merit was universally known. He was chosen a member of the academy there, and the city made him a burgess.
[7:10:378]

He acquired the highest reputation by his works, which are, 1. Capricc; del Bottajo, Florence, 1548, in 8vo; 2. La Circe, Florence, 1549, in 8vo; 3. Two comedies in prose, one entitled La Sporta, and the other Lo Errore; 4. Tutti i Trionfi, Carri, Mascherate o Canti carnascialeschi, or songs composed for the popular festivities of Florence, from the time of Lorenzo the Magnificent till 1559; 5. Various translations from the Latin, as the Hecuba of Euripides, from the Latin of Erasmus, the Life of Alphonse of Este, Duke of Ferrara, from the Latin of Paulus Jovius, &c. Gelli died in 1563.
