GORGED, in Heraldry, the bearing of a crown, coronet, or the like, about the neck of a lion, a swan, or other animal; in which case it is said the lion or cygnet is gorged with a ducal or other coronet.

Gorged is also used when the gorge or neck of a peacock, swan, or the like bird, is of a different colour or metal from the rest.
