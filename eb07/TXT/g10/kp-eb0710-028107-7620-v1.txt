GADES, called by the Greeks Gadeira, an ancient city of Spain, situated on an island of the same name, now Isla de Leon, 750 stadia west of Calpe, the Straits of Gibraltar. It was placed on the western side of the island, being, it is said, founded by a colony from Tyre, 348 years before the building of Rome. It seems to have been a flourishing city at a very early period, being the central point from which the Phoenicians directed all their commercial expeditions to the west of Africa and Europe. From this city Hanno started in his exploratory expedition towards the western coasts of Africa, and the Carthaginian IIimilco in his voyage to the north-western parts of Europe. Gades and Carthage alone reaped the fruits of their discoveries; they concealed the knowledge thus acquired from the rest of the world. Gades thus became one of the richest cities in Europe; and, as a proof, Strabo states that she could produce in his time five hundred knights, a greater number than could be found in any city of Italy excepting Rome and Padua.

In the first Punic war Gades submitted to the Carthaginians, and at the conclusion of the second it followed the example of the rest of Iberia, in yielding to the superior arms of Rome. From Julius Caesar it received the privileges of a Roman colony, and at a later period the honorary title of Angusta Julia Gaditana. It was celebrated for a temple of Hercules, the ruins of which are said to be still seen at the tower of Saint Peter, on the side of the island nearest to the main land.

Gades gradually sunk, till in the fourth century we find Avienus lamenting bitterly over its fallen state, and adding that it afforded nothing worthy of notice, excepting the festival which was celebrated in honour of Saturn. In later times the city of Cadiz occupied the position of the ancient Gades.
