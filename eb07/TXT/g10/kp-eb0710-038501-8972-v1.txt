GENTLEMAN. Under this denomination are comprehended all above the rank of yeomen, and hence noblemen are truly called gentlemen.

The word is formed of the French gentilhomme, or rather of gentil, fine, fashionable, becoming, and the Saxon man, honestus, or honesto loco natus. The same signification belongs to the Italian gentilhuomo, and the Spanish hidalgo, or hijo dalgo, that is, the son of somebody, or a person of note. If we go farther back, we shall find gentleman originally derived from the Latin gentilis homo ; which was used amongst the Romans to signify a race of noble persons of the same name, born of free or ingenuous parents, and whose ancestors had never been slaves or put to death by law. Hence Cicero in his Topics says, Gentiles sunt, qui inter se eodem sunt nomine, ab ingenuis oriundi, quorum majorum nemo servitutem servivit, qui capite non sunt diminuti. Some hold that it was formed from gentile, meaning pagan; and that the ancient Franks, who conquered Gaul, then converted to Christianity, were called gentiles by the natives, as being yet heathens. Others state, that in the decline of the Roman empire, as recorded by Ammianus Marcellinus, there were two companies of brave soldiers, the one called gentiles, and the other scutarii ; and that hence we derive the names gentleman and esquire. (See Esquire.) This opinion is confirmed by Pasquire, who supposes the appellation gentiles and ecuyers to have been transmitted to us from the Roman soldiery; especially as it was to the gentiles and scutarii, the bravest of the soldiery, that the principal benefices and portions of land were assigned.
