GRENADA, an island in the West Indies, situated between the parallels of 12. 20. and 11. 58. N. lat., and 61. 20. and 61. 35. W. long. It was discovered in the year 1498, by Christopher Columbus, who found it possessed by a numerous and warlike people, from whom, however, the Spaniards were attracted by the nobler prize which they had to contend for upon the American continent. The Charaibes remained in peaceful possession of their territory until the year 1650, when Du Parquet, the French governor of Martinique, sent out an expedition, consisting of 200 adventurers, to take possession of it. This they finally effected, first by treachery, and then upon the principle of wholesale extirpation. The inhabitants were divested of their property by a fictitious purchase, and refusing to surrender their natural heritage for a few knives, glass-beads, and other trinkets, a war ensued, which ended in the extermination of the natives. The colony, however, underwent a series of revolutions and calamities, but the result was the establishment of the authority of Du Parquet and his lieutenant. In a few years, however, the island became vested in the crown of France, after the colonists had severely suffered from the cruelty and rapacity of an insolent governor. For many years the colony remained in a state of poverty and depression; and the Abbé Raynal informs us that, in 1700, the island contained no more than 251 whites and 525 blacks, who were employed on three plantations of sugar, and fifty-two of indigo. Grenada surrendered on capitulation to Great Britain in 1762, to which country it was finally ceded by the definitive treaty of peace which took place in the year following. The island hav- ⅛g become a British colony, certain stipulations were made in favour of the inhabitants; but it does not seem to have prospered; and it was retaken by the French in 1779. By the general pacification which took place in January 1783, it was restored to Great Britain, to which it has ever since been attached, although the French, during an insurrection of the slaves, which took place towards the close of the last century, attempted again to obtain possession of it. Grenada is computed to be about twenty-five miles in length, and twelve miles in breadth at the centre, but it gradually narrows towards eithēr extremity. It contains about 80,000 acres of land, but the quantity actually under cultivation has never exceeded 60,000. The general aspect of Grenada is extremely lonely, but mountainous and picturesque. The interior and northwest coast consist of continuous ridges of hills, rounded in their outline, and clothed with vast forest trees and brushwood. An irregular range of mountains runs across the island from north to south, which in some parts has an elevation of 3000 feet above the level of the sea. From this main chain several lesser ridges strike off, forming rich and picturesque valleys. The island is in general very fertile and well cultivated.

With regard to the geology of Grenada, a regular definition of the stratification can scarcely be given, on account of the country being rugged and abrupt. The great mass of the mountains consist of sandstone, greywacke, hornblende, and argillaceous schist. The animals of Grenada are few and uninteresting to the naturalist The medium temperature throughout the year is estimated at eighty-two degrees of Fahrenheit in the low country, but in the more elevated parts it is of course lower. A considerable quantity of rain falls, and throughout the year showers descend. Hurricanes are comparatively mild and infrequent, but shocks of earthquakes are sometimes experienced. Of late years the climate has been materially improved. Grenada is watered by rivers and fresh-water springs, which derive their source from a lake called the Grand Etang, which is situated near the centre of the island, at an elevation of 1740 feet, amidst mountain scenery. Along thecoast are numerous safe and handsome bays and harbours. The chief products are sugar, cocoa, coffee, and cotton; indigo and tobacco are also raised, together with luxuriant crops of fruits and vegetables, which here grow in great abundance, and arrive at high perfection. The waters abound with fish, and there is also a profusion of wild game. The island is divided into six parishes, St Patrick, St Andrew, St John, St Mark, St David, and St George. In the last of these is situated the capital, St George, or George Town, which is built upon a peninsula projecting into a spacious bay on the west or lee side of the island, not far from the southern extremity. It is embosomed in an amphitheatre of hills, and chiefly situated on elevations which rise from the bay; the consequence is, that the streets are steep. The houses are well built, and on the whole the town has a handsome appearance. It is divided by a ridge, which, running into the sea, forms on one side what is termed the Carenage, which is a large basin of water, surrounded by wharfs, and in the vicinity of which the principal merchants reside. In this carenage the ships lie landlocked, and in deep water, close to the wharfs. The entrance is defended by a citadel called Fort George, which is built upon a rocky eminence. On the left the land rises gradually to some height, on which elevation the fortifications of Hospital Hill are erected, and a long ridge, which falls towards the middle, connects this fort with Richmond heights, which constitute the background of the scene, and which are also fortified. The ridge which connects Fort George with Hospital Hill also divides the carenage from the larger portion of the town, which contains the market-place, and looks upon the bay. Upon this hill are built some of the principal houses, the church, and the parsonage. At its extremity is the court-house, and, nearly opposite, the Catholic chapel. Besides the carenage, there is another spacious[7:10:772] sheet of water, called the Lagoon, which is separated from the former by a reef passable only in boats. This of itself would constitute an excellent harbour, and it was at one time contemplated to join the two, but this has never been effected. The public buildings of George Town are the court-house, which is a fine building, provided with etery necessary accommodation; the jail, which is of considerable dimensions, having a yard and tread-mill; the church, a handsome building, with a spire and clock; the Roman Catholic chapel, the Methodist meeting-house, the custom-house, and the offices of the secretary and treasurer. The market-place is a square piece of ground of considerable dimensions, surrounded by houses irregularly built. The other towns of Grenada are, properly speaking, only inconsiderable villages or hamlets, which are generally situated at the bays or shipping places.

Between St Vincent and Grenada there is a cluster of islands called Grenadines, some of which are dependencies of Grenada. Of these, Cariacou is the most important. It constitutes a parish containing 6913 acres of land, and is about nineteen miles in circumference. It is fertile and well cultivated, but it suffers from drought Cotton was formerly the chief article of cultivation, but sugar is the staple article now raised. In a good season the average produce is upwards of 2,000,000 lbs. The chief town is called Hillsborough: it contains a church and rectory.

The following return shows the different products of Grenada and the Grenadines in 1830: Sugar, 22,100,953 pounds; rum, 890,434 gallons; molasses, 255,679 gallons; coffee, 26,122 pounds; cocoa, 337,903 pounds; cotton, 97,804 pounds. The following is an account of the quantities of the three great articles, sugar, coffee, and rum, imported from Grenada into the united kingdom, in the year 1832: Sugar, 188,231 hundredweights, 1 quarter, 14 pounds; coffee, 8749 pounds; rum, 103,654 proof gallons. The official value of the imports into the united kingdom from Grenada was, in 1806, L.509,010; in 1823, L.387,546; and in 1831, L.303,906. The declared value of British and Irish produce and manufactures exported from the united kingdom to Grenada was, in 1823, L.67,792, and in 1831, L.68,377. The number and tonnage of vessels to and from the united kingdom and Grenada, for the years 1823 and 1831, were as follow:

In 1824 the population of Grenada and the Grenadines amounted to 29,648, and in 1832 to 28,439.
