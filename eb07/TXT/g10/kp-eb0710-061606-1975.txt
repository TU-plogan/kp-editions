GORGONS, in Antiquity and Mythology. Authors are not agreed in the accounts which they give of the Gorgons. The poets represent them as three sisters, whose names were Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa, the last of whom was mortal; and having been deflowered by Neptune, was killed by Perseus; but the two former were subject neither to age nor to death. They are described as having wings on their shoulders, and serpents round their heads; their hands were of brass, and their teeth of a prodigious size, so that they were objects of terror to mankind. After the death of Medusa, her sisters, according to Virgil, were appointed to keep the gate of the palace of Pluto.

Multaque praeterea variarum monstra ferarum, Gorgones, Harpyiaeque.

Diodorus Siculus represents the Gorgons and Amazons as having been two warlike nations of women, who inhabited that part of Libya situated on the lake Tritonidis. The extermination of these female nations was not effected till Hercules undertook and performed the task.

Pausanias says that the Gorgons were the daughters of Phorbus, after whose death Medusa his daughter reigned over the people dwelling near the lake Tritonidis. The queen was so passionately fond of hunting and war, that she laid waste the neighbouring countries. At last Perseus made war on them, and killed the queen herself; [7:10:617]but when he came to view the field of battle, he found the queen’s corpse so extremely beautiful, that he ordered her head to be cut off, and carried it with him to show it to his countrymen the Greeks, who could not behold it without being struck with astonishment.

Others represent them as a kind of monstrous women, covered with hair, who lived in woods and forests; and other«, again, make them animals resembling wild sheep, whose eyes had a poisonous and fatal influence.
