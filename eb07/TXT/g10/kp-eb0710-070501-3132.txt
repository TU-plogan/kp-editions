GRANADIER, or Grenadier, originally a soldier armed with a sword, a firelock, a bayonet, and a pouch full of hand grenades; whence the name. Grenadiers now differ from the rest of the battalion only in their superior size and stature, and in certain distinctive peculiarities of uniform. They are always composed of the tallest and stoutest men, and employed on services where strength and courage united are necessary to ensure success; and, in some armies, they have more pay than the common soldiers. Every battalion of infantry has generally attached to it a company of grenadiers, who take the right of the battalion, the left being occupied by the light company. Grenadiers were first instituted in France in 1667, when four or five were attached to each company; but in the year 1670 they were formed into companies, and, in 1685, introduced into the British service.
