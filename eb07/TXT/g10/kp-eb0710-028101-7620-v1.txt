GABION, in Fortification, is a kind of basket made of ozier twigs, of a cylindrical form, having different dimensions, according to the purpose for which it is used. Some gabions are five or six feet in height and three feet in diameter, and serve in sieges to carry on the approaches, when these have advanced near the body of the place. Those used in field-works are from three to four feet in height, and from two and a half to three feet in diameter. Gabions of a still smaller size are placed along the top of the parapet, to cover the troops in firing over it.
