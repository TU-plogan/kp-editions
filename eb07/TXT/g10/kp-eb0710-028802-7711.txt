GALILEANS, a sect of the Jews. Their founder was one Judas, a native of Galilee, from which place they derived their name. Their chief, esteeming it an indignity for the Jews to pay tribute to strangers, stirred up his countrymen against the edict of the Emperor Augustus, which had ordered an enrolment or taxation of all the subjects of the Roman empire. They pretended that God alone should be owned as master and lord, and in other respects they were of the opinion of the Pharisees; but as they judged it unlawful to pray for infidel princes, they separated themselves from the rest of the Jews, and performed their sacrifices apart. As our Saviour and his apostles were of Galilee, they were suspected to belong to the sect of Galileans; and it was upon this principle, as St Jerome observes, that the Pharisees laid a snare for him, asking, whether it was lawful to give tribute to Caesar, that if he denied it, they might have an occasion of accusing him.
