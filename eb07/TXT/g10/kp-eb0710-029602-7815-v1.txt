GALL, in the animal economy, the same thing as bile. Gall was generally given amongst the Jews to persons suffering death under the execution of the law, to make them less sensible of pain; but gall and myrrh are supposed to have been the same thing, because at our Saviour’s crucifixion, St Matthew says that they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall; whereas St Mark calls it wine mingled with myrrh. The truth of the matter perhaps is, that they distinguished every thing bitter by the name of gall. The Greeks and Romans also gave such a mixture to persons suffering a death of torture.

Gall, in Natural History, denotes any protuberance or tumour produced by the puncture of insects on plants and trees of different kinds. These galls are of various forms and sizes, and not less different in their internal structure than in their external form. Some have only one cavity, and others a number of small cells communicating with one another; and some of them are as hard as the wood of the tree they grow on, whilst others are soft and spongy. The former are termed gall-nuts, and the latter berrygalls or apple-galls.
