GERMANO, St, a city of the province Terra di Lavoro, in the kingdom of Naples. It stands at the foot of the mountain on which the magnificent convent of Monte Cassino is built. It contains 4839 inhabitants. It is remarkable as the spot where the battle was fought, in 1815, in which Nugent scattered and destroyed the army of Murat.
