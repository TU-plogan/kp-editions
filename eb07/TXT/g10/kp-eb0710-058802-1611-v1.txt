+=====================================================================+


GLOVER, Richard, was the son of Richard Glover, a Hamburg merchant in London, and was born in St Martin’s Lane in the year 1712. He very early evinced a strong propensity for poetry, and whilst at school wrote, amongst other pieces, a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton, which is prefixed to the view of that incomparable author’s philosophy, published by his intimate friend Dr Pemberton, 1728, in 4to. But though possessed of talents which were calculated to obtain distinction in the literary world, he was content to devote his attention to commerce, and at a proper period commenced Hamburg merchant. He still, however, cultivated literature, and associated with those who were eminent in science. One of his earliest friends was Matthew Green, the author of some poems, which after his death were collected and published by Mr Glover in 1737. In that year Mr Glover married Miss Nunn, with whom he received a handsome fortune; and in the same month published Leonidas, a poem in quarto, which in two years passed through three editions. This poem was inscribed to Lord Cobham, and upon its first appearance was received by the world with great approbation, though it has since been unaccountably neglected. Lord Lyttleton, in a popular publication called Common Sense, and in a poem addressed to the author, praised it in the warmest terms; and in 1738 Dr Pemberton published observations on poetry, especially epic, occasioned by the poem of Leonidas, merely with a view to point out its beauties. In 1739 Mr Glover published London, or the Progress of Commerce, quarto; and a ballad entitled Hosiers Ghost. Both these pieces seem to have been written with a view to incite the public to resent the misconduct of the Spaniards; and the latter had a very considerable effect. At this period political dissensions raged with great violence, more especially in the metropolis; and at different meetings of the livery on these occasions, Mr Glover was always called to (he chair, and acquitted himself in a very able manner, his conduct being patriotic and his speeches masterly. In the year 1744 the Duchess of Marlborough died, and by her will left to Mr Glover and Mr Mallet L.500 each, to [7:10:589] write the hîstöry of the Duke of Marlborough’s life. This bequest, however, never took effect. It is supposed that Glover early renounced his share of it; and Mallet, though he continued to talk of performing the task almost as long as he lived, is now known never to have made the least progress in the work. About this period Mr Glover withdrew a good deal from public notice, and lived in retirement. He had been unsuccessful in business, and with a laudable delicacy had preferred an obscure retreat to popular observation, until his affaire should be placed on a better footing. He had been honoured with the attention of Frederick prince of Wales, who once presented him with a complete set of the classics, elegantly bound, and, on his absenting himself for some time on account of the embarrassment in his circumstances, sent him, it is said, L.500. The prince died in March 1751; and in the May following Mr Glover was once more drawn from his retreat by the importunity of his friends, and stood as candidate for the office of chamberlain of London. But it unfortunately happened that he did not declare himself until most of the livery had engaged their votes, and hence he lost his election. In 1753 Mr Glover produced at Drury Lane his tragedy of Boadicea, which was acted nine nights, in the month of December. It had the advantage of the performance of Garrick, Mossop, Mrs Cibber, and Mrs Pritchard. From the prologue it seems to have been patronised by the author’s friends in the city; and Dr Pemberton wrote a pamphlet to recommend it. In 1761 Mr Glover published Medea, a tragedy written on the Greek model; but it was not ιacted until 1767, when it appeared for the first time on the stage at Drury Lane for Mrs Yates’ benefit. On the accession of George III. he appears to have surmounted the difficulties of his situation. In the parliament which was then called, he was chosen member for Weymouth, and continued to sit as such until its dissolution. In 1770 a new edition of the poem of Leonidas being required, it was republished in two volumes duodecimo, corrected throughout, and extended from nine books to twelve. It had also several new characters added, and the old ones were placed in new situations. The improvements made in it were very considerable; but public curiosity was not at this period sufficiently alive to recompense the pains bestowed on this once popular performance. The calamities arising from the wound given to public credit in June 1772, by the failure of the bank of Douglas, Heron, and Company, in Scotland, occasioned Mr Glover’s taking an active part in settling these complicated concerns, and also in endeavouring to relieve the distress then so universally fell. In February 1744 he called the annuitants of that banking house together, at the King’s Arms Tavern, and laid proposals before them for the security of their demands, with which they were fully satisfied. He also undertook to manage the interests of the merchants and traders of London concerned in the trade to Germany and Holland, and of the dealers in foreign linens, in their application to parliament in May 1774. The speeches which he made on both these occasions were published in a pamphlet. In the succeeding year he was engaged in behalf of the West India merchants in their application to parliament, and examined the witnesses and summed up the evidence in the same masterly manner as he had done on former occasions. For the assistance he afforded the merchants in this business, he was complimented by them with a service of plate, of the value of L.300; and the speech which he delivered in the house was also printed. This, we believe, was the last opportunity he had of displaying in public his oratorical talents. Having now arrived at a period of life which demanded a retreat from business, Mr Glover withdrew to ease and independence, and spent the remainder of his days with dignity and honour. It is probable that he still continued his attention to poetry, as it appears that, besides an epic poem of considerable length, he left some tragedies and comedies behind him in manuscript. After experiencing the infirmities of age, he died on the 25th of November 1785, leaving behind him a most estimable character as a man, a citizen, and a writer.
