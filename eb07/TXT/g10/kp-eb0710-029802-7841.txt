GALLAND, Antony, a celebrated orientalist and numismatist, was born, in 1646, at Rollat, near Montdidier, in Picardy. His life shows what may be effected by the love of study, firm resolution, and irreproachable morals. By a rare perseverance in his pursuits, Galland triumphed over the caprices of fortune; by the rectitude and nobleness of his character he was enabled to overcome all the disadvantages of his humble lot. Born of poor parents, he lost his father at the age of four, being the youngest of seven children. But his mother, though reduced to live by the labour of her hands, contrived to place him in the college of Noyon, where the principal and a canon of the cathedral charitably undertook the care and expense of educating young Galland. At the age of fourteen he lost both his benefactors at the same time, and returned to his mother with no other wealth than the knowledge of a little Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, a decided taste for letters, and a firm resolution to apply himself to learning. But as his mother could not of course furnish the means necessary for the completion of his studies, it became necessary to learn a trade and renounce literature. This cruel distraction Galland supported for a year, when, finding it intolerable, he one day set out for Paris, with no other resource than the address of an old relation who was in good circumstances, and that of an ecclesiastic whom he had sometimes seen at the house of the canon of Noyon. The hardihood of this resolution created an interest in his favour į the sub-principal of the college of Plessis made him continue his studies at that seminary, and then confided him to the care of Μ. Petitpied, doctoι of the Sorbonne. Anything more fortunate could not have happened to Galland than this last act of kindness, which may be said to have prepared, and indeed ensured the success of his literary career. He now extended his knowledge of Hebrew and the other oriental languages, attended the courses of instruction in the Royal College, and even undertook to make a catalogue of the oriental manuscripts of the Sorbonne. Doctor Petitpied had jusl placed him in the house of Μ. Godouin, professor in Mazarin College, when Μ. de Nointel set out, in 1670, on hit embassy to Constantinople, and took along with him young Gatland, whose labours and acquirements had already attracted notice. The intention of this minister was to employ Galland in procuring from the Greek churches formal attestations of the articles of their faith, which ther [7:10:299] formed the subject of a grand controversy between Arnauld and Claude. Galland soon acquired at Constantinople a knowledge of the vulgar Greek, from his long conferences with the Greek prelates, and obtained from them attestations, along with much information on the subjects discussed in France. De La Croix, secretary of the embassy, makes no mention of these researches in his Mémoires; but it may be supposed that he found them useful in the composition of Etat present de l’ Eglise Grecque et Maronite, published in 1695, 12mo, and reprinted without any alteration under the title of Turquie-Chrétienne. Galland accompanied Μ. de Nointel in his journey to Jerusalem, and availed himself of the opportunity to copy a great number of inscriptions, and even to remove them, as often as he found it practicable to do so. Of these, Montfaucon has published some fragments in his Palcεo∙ graphie. From Syria Galland returned directly to France, whence he immediately set out again for the Levant with the intention of collecting more medals. In 1679 he undertook a third voyage, being charged by the India company to collect every thing calculated to enrich the cabinet of Colbert; but this commission having ceased in consequence of changes which took place in the company, Colbert, and, after his death, Louvois, instructed Galíand to continue his researches, and caused the title of antiquary to the king to be conferred on him. At the moment when he was about to embark at Smyrna to return to his native country, he was on the point of perishing in an earthquake. The house which he occupied fell, and buried him in the ruins, under which he remained until next day, breathing with difficulty through accidental openings in therubbish. On his return to Paris, Thevenot, keeper of the king’s library, and D’Herbelot, the celebrated oriental scholar, availed themselves of his labours. But death having soon deprived him of both these learned men, he attached himself to Bignon, a zealous protector of men of letters, whom he also lost the following year. It appears to have been the fortune of Galland continually to lose those useful protections which acknowledged merit is sometimes long in obtaining; but such was the esteem inspired by his attainments and his character, that death no sooner deprived him of one support than he found another. Foucault, intendant of Lower Normandy, supplied the place of Bignon, and received Galland into his house, where, in the midst of a fine library, and a numerous collection of medals, he applied himself to the composition of different works, in which he turned to account his knowledge of the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish languages, with which he had rendered himself familiar during his residence in the East. In 1701, he was admitted into the Academy of Inscriptions, although he resided at Caen; in 1706 he returned to take up his habitation in Paris; and, three yeprs afterwards, he obtained the chair of Arabic in the Royal College of France. This learned man terminated his laborious, useful, and irreproachable life, on the 17th of February 1715, at the age of sixty-nine. The following is a list of his printed works: 1. Trois Lettres touchant la critique Μ. de Guillet, sur le Voyage de Grèce de Spon, printed in the reply of Spon, Lyons, 1679, in 12mo; 2.
