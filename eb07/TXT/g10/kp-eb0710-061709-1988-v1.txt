GOSPORT, a market-town of Hampshire, in the parish of Alverstoke, in the Portsdown division of the hundred of Christchurch, seventy-eight miles from London. It may be considered as one of the suburbs of Portsmouth, from which it is separated by the mouth of the harbours, over which boats of all descriptions are constantly passing from one side to the other. As a part of our greatest naval arsenal, the town is fortified on the land side by a chain of redoubts, and some of the most important fortifications which command the entrance of the harbour; and the anchoring places of Stokes Bay are in this town. The royal brewery and cooperage, the storehouses for various kinds of provisions, and the grand powder magazines of Priddyshard, are all here. To the south is the magnificent hospital for sick and wounded sailors, which is capable of accommodating more than two thousand patients. There is also an extensive establishment for the manufacture of anchors. Besides the trade which Gosport derives from the royal navy, it enjoys considerable foreign commerce. There are markets on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, which are amply supplied. The population depends on the state of peace or of war. It amounted in 1801 to 11,295, in 1811 to 11,279, in 1821 to 10,972, and in 1831 to 12,637.
