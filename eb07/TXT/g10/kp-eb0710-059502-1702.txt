GODAVERY, a large river of India, which has its rise in the Western Ghauts, seventy miles to the north-east of Bombay, and which, with a circuitous curve, flows nearly over the whole breadth of the peninsula in a southeast direction. After traversing the province of Aurungabad and the country of Tellingana from west to east, it turns to the south-eastward, and, receiving the Bain Gonga about ninety miles above the sea, besides many smaller rivers, separates into two principal channels at Rajamundry, one of which falls into the Bay of Bengal a few miles south of the town of Coringa, and the other a little below Narsipore, forming between them the island of Nagur, comprehending 500 square miles, and which, being intersected by various ramifications from these rivers, includes several tide-harbours for vessels of moderate burden, and is highly fertile and productive. Ingeram, Coringa, Ya-nam, Bandarmalanka, and Narsipore, are among the places situated at the mouth of this river, which, appears to be the most considerable stream that rises between the Ganges and Cape Comorin. Its whole course may be estimated at nearly 800 miles, having, owing to the peculiar configuration of the Indian peninsula, which rises to its height much nearer the western than the eastern shore, nearly traversed the country from sea to sea. During the rainy season the Godavery rolls a prodigious volume of water to the ocean; in many places it is more than a mile in breadth. During the dry season its bed consists in many places of an expanse of sand, the river being divided into numerous shallow streams. Extensive forests of teak trees line the shores of the river until it emerges from the Ghaut Mountains.
