GOTTINGEN, one of the provinces, called a principality, into which the kingdom of Hanover is divided. It was formerly a part of the duchy of Brunswick, but was afterwards united with Calenburg. Of late some parts of Hesse, and the bailiwick of Hunnersruck in Hildesheim, have been united with it, and the whole extends over 640 square miles, or 409,600 English acres. The province is bounded on the north by the duchy of Brunswick and the province of Grubenhagen, on the east by Grubenhagen, on the south by the Prussian provinces and by Hesse Cassel, and on the west by Hesse and the Prussian Westphalian dominions. In 1812 it contained 96,593 inhabitants, of whom 2374 were Catholics, 5680 Reformed, 1166 Jews, and the remainder Lutherans. There has been a rapid increase in the population since that period.

The face of the country is hilly, almost mountainous; but between the elevations are valleys, through which the various rivers run, of greater or less extent, and of very high fertility. The Weser, formed by the junction of the Werra and the Fulda, is the principal river, into which the Line falls, and is navigable to MÃ¼nden. The soil is good, and the cultivation well conducted, so that the province yields much more both of corn and cattle than it consumes. Besides food, the soil produces flax, hemp, and tobacco. The products of mines are some iron and rock salt, coals, and alum. The manufacture of linen is of the domestic kind, carried on by spinning in the long nights of the winter. The chief foreign trade consists in the exportation of linen, yarn, wax, and honey. The chief place is the city of the name of the province, celebrated for its university, founded in 1734. The professors in it are numerous and learned, and the students vary from 1200 to 2000. It possesses a most valuable library of 300,000 volumes, a botanic garden, several museums, and philosophical apparatus. The collection of models, and the observatory, are valuable establishments. The city contains 923 houses, and about 11,000 inhabitants, exclusively of the members of the university who carry on manufactures of linen, woollen, and other goods. Besides, there are many printing presses.
