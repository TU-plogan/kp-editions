GEMISHKHANA, or Silver-house, a town of Asia Minor, on the borders of Armenia, so called from a silver mine in its neighbourhood, which, however, has greatly declined in its produce. The town is better built than most towns in the Turkish dominions, and is said to contain 7000 inhabitants. It is thirty miles south from Tre-bisond.
