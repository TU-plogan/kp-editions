GRAPE, the fruit of the vine. See Vine and Wine. G rape- Shot, in artillery, is a combination of small shot, put into a thick canvass bag, and corded strongly together, so as to form a kind of cylinder, the diameter of which is equal to that of the ball adapted to the cannon. The number of shot in a bag varies according to the service or size of the guns. In the naval service, for instance, nine is always[7:10:712] the number; but by land it is increased to any number or size from an ounce and a quarter in weight to three or four pounds. In the naval service the bottoms and pins are made of iron, whereas those used by land are of wood.
