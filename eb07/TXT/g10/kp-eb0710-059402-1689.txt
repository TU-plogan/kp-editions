GOALPARAH, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Bengal, and district of Rangamatty, situated on the south shore of the Brahmapootra, near the frontier of Assam. Here is carried on a very considerable trade with the Assamese, who bring coarse cloths, stick-lac, gold, ivory, wax, and tar, which they exchange for salt, silks, and fine muslins. The trade would be more considerable, were it not impeded by the disorderly state of the country, and the savage manners of the chiefs, who defraud and frequently murder the traders. A detachment of native infantry is stationed here to guard the frontier, and no European is allowed to proceed beyond it without a pass from the government. It is a hundred and seventy miles north by east from Dacca. Long. 90. 32. E. Lat. 26. 8. N.
