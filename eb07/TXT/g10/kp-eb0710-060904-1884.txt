GOMOR, a circle of the Hungarian province of the Hither Theiss, extending over 1596 square miles, and comprehending a city, twelve market-towns, and two hundred and sixty villages, with 164,000 inhabitants. It is the most mountainous portion of Hungary, and includes part of the Carpathian range. It contains many mines, and the metals obtained from these give occupation to the people, who apply them to making hardware. The climate is cold and raw, but the soil produces flax, tobacco, and some corn, abundance of cattle, and some butter and cheese. Linen goods are manufactured to some extent. The capital is a small town of the same name, where the Lutherans have a college with a good library.
