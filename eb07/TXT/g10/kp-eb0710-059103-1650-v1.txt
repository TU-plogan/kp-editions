GLUTTONY, a voracity of appetite, or a propensity to gormandising.

One of our Danish kings, named Hardyknute, was so great a glutton, that a historian calls him Bocca de Porco, Swine s Mouth. His tables were covered four times a day with the most costly viands which the air, the sea, or the land could-furnish; and as he lived, so he died; for he fell down dead whilst revelling and carousing at a wedding banquet at Lambeth. His death was so welcome to his subjects that they celebrated the day with sports and pastimes, calling it Hock-tide, which signifies scorn and contempt. With this king ended the reign of the Danes in England.
