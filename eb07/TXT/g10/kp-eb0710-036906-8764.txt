GATH, or Geth, a city of the Philistines, and one of ∣ their five principalities. It is celebrated as having given ’ birth to Goliath. David made a conquest of Gath in the ’

beginning of his reign over all Israel; and it continued subject to the kings his successors till the declension and decay of the kingdom of Judah. Rehoboam rebuilt or fortified it, üzziah retook it, and Hezekiah once more reduced it under his subjection. Gath stood about five or six miles from Jamnia, about fourteen south of Joppa, and thirty-two west of Jerusalem.
