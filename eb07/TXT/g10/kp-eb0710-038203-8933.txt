GENITIVE, in Grammar, the second case of the declension of nouns. The relation of one thing considered as belonging in some manner to another, has occasioned a peculiar termination of nouns, called the genitive case ; but in the modern languages a sign is made use of to express the relation of this case. In English the particle of, in French de or du, is prefixed. But in strictness there are no cases in either of these languages, inasmuch as they do not express the different relations of things by different terminations, but by prepositions, which is otherwise in the Latin.
