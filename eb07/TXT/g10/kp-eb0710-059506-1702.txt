GODFREY of Bouillon, prince of Lorraine, a celebrated crusader, and victorious commander. He was chosen general of the expedition which the Christians undertook for the recovery of the Holy Land, and sold his dukedom to prepare for the war. He took Jerusalem from the Turks in 1099; but his piety would not permit him to wear a diadem of gold in the city where his Saviour had been crowned with thorns. The sultan of Egypt afterwards sent against him a powerful army, which he defeated with terrible slaughter. Godfrey died in 1160.
