GLOUCESTER, a city, the capital of the county of the same name, 106 miles from London. It is situated in a rich and beautiful valley, on the banks of the river Severn. It is sheltered on the east by a range of hills, on descending which the vale displays itself, containing the verdant plains, the ancient buildings of the city, the winding river, and, in the distance, the group of picturesque eminences called the Malvern Hills. The city consists of four streets, distinguished by the names of the cardinal points, and crossing each other in the centre at right angles. They are broad, well built, clean, and excellently paved. The chief building ⅛ t h e cathedral, begun in 1047, and the ecclesiastical residences around it. That edifice was enlarged at subsequent periods, till it was erected into a bishop’s see m the reign of Henry VIII. It is four hundred and twenty feet in length, a hundred and forty-four in breadth, and adorned with a tower a hundred and ninety-nine feet in height. The interior has an impressive aspect, and is decorated with several monuments and a lofty choir. For municipal purposes the city is divided into three wards, and is governed by a mayor, six aidermen, and seventeen councillors. This city g i ves the title of duke. which lias been commonly conferred upon a member of the royal family. The principal manufacturing employment is making pins, great quantities of which are sent to London; but, besides this, making malt and cordage, and building barges, afford some occupation. There is a little foreign trade in the importation of wine, spirits, and West India produce; and this has been increased by the construction of a canal parallel to the Severn, which allows ships to avoid the shoals and sinuosities of that river. There is also some transit trade in iron ware, pottery, salt, and in timber, which ,descend the Severn from the counties to the northward. Some mineral springs, similar to those of Cheltenham, have lately been discovered, which have been resorted to by visitors, and have occasioned an increase of buildings appropriated for their reception. There are well-supplied markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays. It returns two members to parliament. The population amounted in 1801 to 7ã97, in 1811 to 8280, in 1821 to 9744, and in 1831 to 11,993.

Gloucester is the name of several counties and towns in the United States of America. The counties will be described in the articles upon the several states where they are situated; and the towns are too unimportant to require separate notice.
