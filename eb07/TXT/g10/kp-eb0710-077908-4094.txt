GROIN, that part of the abdomen next the thigh.

Groin, amongst builders, is the angular curve formed by the intersection of two semicylinders or arches, and is either regular or irregular. A regular groin is when the intersecting arches, whether semicircular or semielliptical, are of the same diameters and heights. An irregular groin is where one of the arches is semicircular and the other semielliptical.
