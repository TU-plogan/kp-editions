GELLIBRAND, Henry, a laborious astronomer of the seventeenth century, was born in the year 1597. Though he was not without prospects of advancement in the church, yet he became so enamoured of mathematical studies, that on the death of his father he became a student at Oxford, contented himself with his private patrimony, and devoted himself solely to this study. On the death of Mr Gunter, he was recommended by Mr Briggs to the trustees of Gresham College, for the astronomical professorship there; and to this he was elected in the year 1627. As Mr Briggs died in 1630, before he had finished his Trigonometria Britannica, the work was, at his request, completed by Gellibrand. He wrote several other things, chiefly tending to the improvement of navigation; and died in 1636.
