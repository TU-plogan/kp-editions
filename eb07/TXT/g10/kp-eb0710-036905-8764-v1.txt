GATAKER, Thomas, a learned critic and divine, was bom at London in 1574, and studied at St John’s College, Cambridge. He was afterwards chosen preacher at Lincoln’s Inn, a situation which he quitted in 1611 for the rectory of Rotherhithe in Surrey. In 1620 he made a tour through the Low Countries; and in 1624 he published at London a book entitled Transubstantiation declared by the confession of the Popish Writers to have no necessary foundation in God’s Word, of which he likewise wrote a defence. In 1642 he was appointed one of the assembly of divines, and was engaged with them in writing annotations upon the Bible. He died in July 1654, in the eightieth year of his age. Besides the above works, he published, 1. A Dissertation upon the Style of the New Testament; 2. De Nomine Tetragrammato, in defence of the mode of pronouncing the word Jehovah in England; 3. De Diphthongis, sive Bivocalibus; 4. An Edition and Translation of Marcus Antoninus’s Meditations; 5. A Collection of Sermons in folio; and many other works. His piety and charity were exemplary; and his modesty was so great, that he declined all ecclesiastical dignities and court preferments. His extensive learning was admired by Salmasius and other great men abroad; his house was a prii vate seminary for young gentlemen of this nation; and many foreigners resorted to him to receive advice in their studies.
