GIJON, a city of Spain, in the province of Asturias. It is built at the foot of a hill, on the sea shore, and has a port, which is by far the best in the province, and in which the greater portion of its foreign commerce centres. The harbour is well defended by a castle on the hill nearthecity, and by batteries constructed on the mole. The entrance is very narrow and difficult, and the difficulty gradually increases, from the sea receding in such a manner as to alarm the merchants with the apprehension that their harbour will in a few years, become wholly dry land. The city is very beautiful, the streets are wide and straight, and cross each other at right angles; and most of the houses are of recent construction, and well built. An institution for the promotion of scientific knowledge was formed here in 1794, and the pupils are instructed in mathematics, and the application of geometry to mechanics, navigation, and the other arts; and mineralogical and geological lectures are delivered. Its longitude is 5. 13. 39. west from London, and its latitude 43. 35. 10. north. This town contains 3200 inhabitants, who are employed in making earthenware, buttons, and cider.
