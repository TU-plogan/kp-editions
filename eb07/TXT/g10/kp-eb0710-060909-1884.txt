GONIEH, a fortified town on the coast of the Black Sea, on the south of the Phasis, and which, though properly forming part of Georgia, is almost entirely dependent on the Turkish government. It was formerly a considerable[7:10:610] place, but is now sunk into a miserable village. It is 80 miles east-north-east of Trebisond.
