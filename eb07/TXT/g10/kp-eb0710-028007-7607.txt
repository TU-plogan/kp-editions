GABINIUS, Aulus, a Roman general, the chief events of whose life are included between his tribunate, b. c. 67, and his death, b. c. 49. He seems to have been of an active, enterprising disposition, but without principle, and ready to prostitute his talents to advance his interest«.
[7:10:281]

In the Mithridatic war, b. c. 81, be served under Sy Ila with considerable distinction; but it was not till be had reached the dignity of tribune that he took an important share in public transactions. He proposed to the peoples law, by which an unlimited power over the Mediterranean was intrusted to Pompey, on the pretence of putting down the Cilician pirates; and though the senate could not prevent its enactment, they determined that Gabinius should not succeed in his desire of being appointed lieutenant to Pompey. Through the interest of Caesar we find him consul, B. c. 58, and lending his official influence to Clodius to procure the banishment of Cicero. Neither the known wishes of the senate, nor the entreaties of the knights, could alter his determination, and Cicero found himself obliged to .yield to the storm. The reward he received for this conduct was the province of Syria, and money from Clodius to enable him to equip his troops. Upon his arrival in Syria he made war on the Jews, and, having defeated Aristobulus, their king, compelled him to sue for peace. Gabinius addressed a public letter to the senate annoι ncing his victory, and demanding that a day of public thanksgiving should be appointed. This the senate refused, and ordered him to return; but he was not of a disposition likely to attend to their orders, if it did not suit his inclination. He continued in Syria, and was preparing an expedition against the Arabians, when he received a letter from Pompey, requesting him to restore the exiled Ptolemy to his kingdom of Egypt. Though both the Sibylline books and the senate forbade an army to be led into Egypt, Gabinius disregarded all consequences, and immediately restored Ptolemy. Such conduct was heard with astonishment at Home, and imperative orders were given him to return home. This time he thought proper to obey, and the exertions of Pompey and his friends procured his acquittal. In the civil wars he joined the party of Caesar, and we find him commanding the troops in Illyria, where he was cut off by a body of the enemy, or, according to others, being shut up in Salona, died of vexation.
