GRISGRIS, a superstition very prevalent amongst the negroes in the interior parts of Africa. The grisgris, according to Le Maire, are certain Arabic characters mixed with magical figures drawn by the marabouts or priests upon paper. Labat affirms that they are nothing else than scraps of the Koran in Arabic; but this is denied by Barbot, who brought over one of these grisgris to Europe, and showed it to a number of persons deeply skilled in oriental learning, none of whom could find in it the least trace <>f any character they understood. Yet, after all, this mig t be owing to the badness of the handwriting; and â€œhe words are probably of the Mandingo language, though the characters are an attempt to imitate the Arabic. The poorest negro never goes to war without his grisgris, as a charm against wounds; and if it proves ineffectual, the priest transfers the blame on the immorality of his conduct. These priests invent against all kinds of dangers, and provide in favour of all desires and appetites, grisgris, by virtue of which the possessors may obtain or avoid whatever they like or dislike. These, according to the marabouts, defend them from storms, enemies, diseases, pains, and misfortunes; and preserve health, long life, wealth, honour, and merit. No clergy in the world are more honoured and revered by the people than these impostors are by the negroes; nor are any people in the world more impoverished by their priests than the negroes, a grisgris being frequently sold at three slaves and four or five oxen. The grisgris intended for the head is made in the form of a cross, reaching from the forehead to the neck behind, and from ear to ear; nor are the arms and shoulders neglected. Sometimes they are planted in their bonnets in the form of horns; and at other times they are made like serpents, lizards, or some other animals, cut out of a kind of pasteboard. There are not wanting Europeans, otherwise intelligent seamen and merchants, who are in some degree infected with the weakness of the country, and believe that the negro sorcerers have an actual communication with the devil, and that they are filled with the malignant influence of that evil spirit when they are seen to distort their features and muscles, make horrid grimaces, and at last imitate tha appearances exhibited by epileptics.
