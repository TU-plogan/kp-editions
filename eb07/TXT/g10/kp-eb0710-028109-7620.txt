GAFFAREL, James, a French divine, and learned writer, born about 1601. He acquired great skill in the oriental and several other languages, and was particularly conversant in the cabalistic and occult sciences, which he learned, exposed, and refuted. Cardinal Richelieu made choice of him as his librarian, and sent him into Italy to collect the best manuscripts and books. He published a work entitled Curiositez Innouies. It is said the cardinal designed to employ him in his grand project for the reunion of religions. He died in 1681, aged fourscore.
