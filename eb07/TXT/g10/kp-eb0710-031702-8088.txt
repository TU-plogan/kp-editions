GARDA, a beautiful lake in the Austrian dominions in Italy, called by the ancients Benacus. It is situated at the foot of the Tyrolean Alps, and formed by numerous rivulets, chiefly issuing out of the province of Styria. It forms a river at Peschiera, then called by the name of the Mincio. It is about thirty-five miles in length, varying in its breadth, but nowhere more than fourteen miles across. In the centre it is said to be three hundred feet deep. A small town of the same name is situated on the eastern side of the lake, which, in the ancient civil wars, was a port of some importance. On the banks of this lake Bonaparte defeated the Austrians commanded by Wurmser: in 1796.
