GERUND, in Grammar, a verbal noun of the neuter gender, partaking of the nature of a participle, but declinable only in the singular number, through all the cases except the vocative. The word is formed from the Latin gerundivus, and that from the verb gerere, to bear. The gerund expresses not only the time, but also the manner of an action; as, he fell in running post. It differs from the participle in this, that it expresses the time, which the participle does not; and from the tense properly so called, in expressing the manner, which the tense does not. See Grammar.
