GIBSON, Richard, an English painter, commonly called the Dwarf, was originally page to a lady at Mortlake, who, observing that his genius led him to painting, had the generosity to get him instructed in the rudiments of that art. Having devoted himself to Sir Peter Lely’s manner, he copied his pictures*to admiration, especially his portraits; and his paintings in water colours were also esteemed. He was in great favour with Charles I. who made him page of the back stairs; and he had the honour to instruct in drawing Queen Mary and Queen Anne when they were princesses. He married one Mrs Anne Shepherd, who was also a dwarf, on which occasion King Charles I. honoured their marriage with his presence, and gave away the bride. Mr Waller wrote a poem on this occasion, entitled The Marriage of the Dwarfs; in which are these lines:

Design or chance makes others wive. But nature did this match contrive; Eve might as well have Adam fled. As she deny’d her little bed To him for whom heav’n seem’d to frame And measure out this only dame.

Mr Fenton, in his notes on this poem, observes that he had seen this couple painted by Sir Peter Lely; and that they were of an equal stature, each being three feet ten inches high. They had nine children, five of whom arrived at maturity, and were well proportioned, being of the usual standard of mankind. But what nature denied this couple in stature, she gave them in length of days; for Mr Gibson died in the seventy-fifth year of his age, and his wife having survived him almost twenty years, died in 1709, aged eighty-nine.

Gibson, Dr Edmund, bishop of London, was born in Westmoreland in 1699. He applied himself early and vigorously to learning, and displayed his knowledge in several writings and translations, which recommended him to the patronage of Archbishop Tennyson. He was appointed domestic chaplain to his grace; and soon afterwards became rector of Lambeth, and archdeacon of Surrey. Becoming thus a member of the convocation, he engaged in a cęntroversy, which was carried on with great warmth by the members of both houses, and defended his patron’s rights, as president, in eleven pamphlets; he then formed and completed his more comprehensive scheme of the legal duties and rights of the English clergy, which was at length published under the title of Codex Juris Ecclesiastici Angliaιni, in folio. Archbishop Tennyson having died in 1715, and Dr Wake bishop of Lincoln having become archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Gibson succeeded the latter in the see of Lincoln, and in 1720 was promoted to the bishopric of London. He now not only governed his diocese with the most exact regularity, but by his great care promoted the spiritual affairs of the church of England colonies in the West Indies. He was extremely jealous of the privileges belonging to the church; and therefore, though he approved of the toleration of the Protestant Dissenters, he continually guarded against all the attempts made to procure a repeal of the corporation and test acts; but his opposition to those licentious assemblies called masquerades gave great umbrage at court, and effectually excluded him from all further favours. He spent the latter part of his life in writing and printing pastoral letters, visitation-charges, occasional sermons, and tracts against the prevailing immoralities of the age. His pastoral letters are justly esteemed as the most masterly productions against infidelity and enthusiasm. His most celebrated work, the Codex, has been already mentioned. His other publications are, 1. An edition of Drummond’s Polemo-Miđdinia, and James V. of Scotland’s Cantilena Rustica, with notes; 2. the Chroniam Saxonicum, with a Latin translation, and notes; 3. Reliquia: Spelmanniance, the posthumous works of Sir Henry Spelman, relating to the laws and antiquities of England; 4. An edition of Quintilian De Arte Oratoria, with notes; 5. An English translation of Camden’s Britannia, with additions, two volumes folio; and, 6. A number of small pieces, which have been collected together and printed in three volumes folio. His intense application to study impaired his health; notwithstanding which, he attained the age of seventy-nine. He expired in September 1748, after an episcopate of nearly thirty-three years.
