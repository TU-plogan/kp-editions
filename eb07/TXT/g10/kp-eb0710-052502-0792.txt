GINGERAH, a fortified island on the western coast of India, at the mouth of a river, on the bank of which is situated the town of Dimda Rajepore. This place is celebrated in history, first as being one of the stations of the fleet commanded by the Siddees or AbyÎ²sinians, who were first in the service of the kings of Bijapoor, and deserted with their ships in the year 1661 to Aurungzebe; and, second, it was exposed to a long siege by the Mahratta chief Sevagee.
