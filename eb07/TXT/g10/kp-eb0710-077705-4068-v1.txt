GRIMSBY, Great, a borough-town of the county of Lincoln, of the hundred of Bradley, in the division of Lindsay, 171 miles from London, and thirty-six from Lincoln. It stands at the mouth of the river Humber, opposite to Hull. The harbour having been injured, the trade declined; but some recent improvements have produced a revival. It is an ancient borough, and now returns one member to parliament, but formerly two, who were chosen by the freemen, which privilege was obtained by being born in the town, or by marriage with the daughter of a freeman. It had formerly two churches, but only one remains, which is large, in the form of a cross, and contains some handsome monuments. There is an excellent corn market on Thursday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1524, in 1811 to 2747, in 1821 to 3064, and in 1831 to 4225.
