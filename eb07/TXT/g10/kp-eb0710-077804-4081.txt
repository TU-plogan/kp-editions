GRISONS, one of the cantons of Switzerland, called by the inhabitants Graubundten. It has been composed out of three confederacies, called the League of God’s House, the League of the Ten Bailiwicks, and the Grey League. These, with some other small portions, had long continued independent states, until 1798, when, after invasion by the French, they were formally united into one state, and admitted as such into the Swiss confederation. It is one of the largest of the cantons, being about 3010 square miles in extent. It is bounded by Glarus, St Gall, and Austria, on the east by the Tyrol, on the south by Austrian Italy and the canton Ticino, and on the west by Uri. It is a most picturesque country. The Alps reach the height of 11,000 feet, with a line of perpetual snow of from 8200 to 8400 feet. There are said to be within the canton 240 glaciers and 56 waterfalls. The valleys are strikingly beautiful, and in them both the Rhine and the Inn have their sources. There are five of these greater valleys, distinguished as the Hither Rhine, the Farther Rhine, Engadine, the Albula, and the Brettegau, and nearly 150 smaller valleys are connected with them, each with its peculiar features. The chief products are those of the dairy, which are exchanged for corn, of which only half as much is raised as the consumption requires. The chief trade is by the passes of the Alps with Milan. The inhabitants are about 83,000, of whom 40,000 speak a lingua-franca, the old .Romana rustica; about 30,000 speak German, and 13,000 Italian. The Roman Catholic church has 33,000 adherents, with six ministers and eighty-six parish churches. The Protestants are 50,000, of the Helvetic confession, and have six colleges, with 132 parish churches; but the pastors are so poor that they are often compelled to have recourse to manual labour or trade to support themselves. The government is a pure democracy. The three divisions, as in old times, are still adhered to, and deputies, twenty-one from each portion, meet, and all have separate presidents, and are assisted by councils annually elected. The contingent of men furnished by the cantons to the Swiss confederacy is 1600, and of money 12,000 francs. The annual revenue was, in 1831, L∙21,590, and the expenditure L.20,100. The public debt is now nearly extinguished. Chur is the capital of the whole, as well as of [7:10:779]the League of God’s House; but the League of the Bailiwick has for its capital the town of Davos, and that of ’ the Grey League the town of Dissentis. Chur contains 3350 inhabitants, and is on the great road from Germany to Lombardy.
