The capital is the city of the same name, situated near the Rachet Mountains, on a beautiful plain, ’ which is watered by the river Isère, after it has been increased by the stream of the Drac. It is surrounded by walls and ditches, and defended by a citadel, which serves the purpose of an arsenal. The cathedral, the episcopal palace, the hall of justice, and the great hospital, are the principal buildings. There is an academy with the power of conferring degrees; a public library of 60,000 volumes; a botanic garden; a museum of natural history, antiquities, and medals; and other establishments appropriate to the purposes of medical, legal, and military education.
