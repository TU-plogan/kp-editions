GERVAISE, or Gervase, of Tilbury, an historian of the thirteenth century, was a native of Tilbury in Essex, and nephew of Henry II. The exact date of his birth has not been ascertained. Having visited part of Europe, he arrived, about the year 1208, at the court of Otho IV. emperor of Germany, who, being descended by his mother from an illustrious family in England, received Gervase with the greatest distinction, made him one of his orators, then nominated him chancellor, and, lastly, appointed him marshal of the kingdom of Arles. Gervase died about the year 1218. His productions are, 1. Otia Imperialia, libri tres, a work which is also known under the titles Mappa sive Descriptio Mundi, and De Mirabilibus Orbis; 2. Illustrationes Galfridi Monemuthensis, libri iv.; 3. Historia Terrae Sanctae; 4. De Origine Burgundiorum; 5. Facetiarum liber, dedicated to Henry II. of England; 6. Tricolumnium Angliae; and, 7. Metrica Descriptio Balneorum Puteolanorum. The compilation of the Exchequer book, entitled Liber Niger Saccarii, was ascribed to Gervase; but Madox, who published a correct edition of this Black Book, attributes it to Richard Nelson, bishop of London. There are two manuscript copies of this work; one in the Exchequer, presented, according to Strype, by Archbishop Parker; and another in Caius College, Cambridge, which is supposed to have been the original, whence the archbishop’s copy was transcribed. Bale and Pitts differ considerably in their accounts of Gervase’s works, the greater part of which still remain in manuscript, and are but little known.
