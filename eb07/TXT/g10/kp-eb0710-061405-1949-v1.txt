GOOLPUSSRA, a town or village in the Nepaul dominions. It stands on the skirts σf the great forest; and although it is the thoroughfare for most of the merchandise which passes between Nepaul, Benares, Oude, and Patna, over the Cheesapany Mountains, it is but a mean village. The road thence to Becbiacori through the great forest is practicable for wheel-carriages, and there are two or three stations on the way. In the vicinity of thiι place is an extensive forest of fine timber, especially ol that kind called saul, next in value to teak, some of the trees of which measure a hundred feet between the branches, and from eight to nine feet in the girth. Long. 85. 10. E. Lat. 27. 1. N.
