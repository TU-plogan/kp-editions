GILOLO, one of the Molucca islands, in the Eastern Seas, which is of a large size and very irregular form, consisting of a long mainland, extending in length north and south 220 miles, and composed of four large peninsulas, separated from one another by deep bays. It extends from the latitude of 3.10. south, to 0.50. north. The island is generally very fertile, and abounds with bullocks, buffaloes, goats, deer, and wild hogs; but there are few sheep. The sago and fruit-trees flourish here in great abundance; the former yielding to the inhabitants their chief subsistence. This island also produces nutmegs and cloves; but, by the narrow and malignant policy of the Dutch, the trees which produced these spices were rooted up in all places near the sea-coast, or to which there was a ready access by sea. All foreign trade was also discouraged, in order to [7:10:524] prevent the smuggling of spices; and the natives were even prohibited, under severe penalties, from manufacturing cloth. These violent edicts, however, the inhabitants contrived to evade, by secretly sending to the other islands for supplies of material. Ossa bay, on the east coast of the island, is an extremely narrow and deep inlet, penetrating about half way through the island. The town of Ossa, situated on the south side of the bay, in longitude 128. 22. east, and latitude 0. 45. north, affords every convenience for ships touching at the island, either for water, provisions, timber, spars, or other articles. There are several other towns in the island, viz. Maba, Patany, and Weda; but being seldom visited by Europeans, they are little known. This island was formerly under the control of the Dutch; but is at present independent of that or any other European nation, and under the government of several independent rajahs or chiefs. A considerable trade is carried on in their own vessels with Amboyna and the neighbouring islands, whence they import cutlery, cloth, China-ware, gold-lace, iron in bars, opium, piece-goods, and steel. The articles imported are nutmegs, cloves, mace, biche-de-mer, bird-nests, tortoise shells, &c.
