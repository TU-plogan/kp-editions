GODFATHERS and Godmothers, persons who, at the baptism of infants, answer for their future conduct, and solemnly promise that they will renounce the devil and all his works, and follow a life of piety and virtue; and by this means lay themselves under an indispensable obligation to instruct them, and watch over their conduct. This custom, which is of great antiquity in the Christian church, was probably instituted to prevent children being brought up in idolatry, in case their parents died before they arrived at years of discretion. The number of godfathers and godmothers is reduced to two in the church of Rome, and three in the church of England; but formerly there was no limit to the number.
