GABEL (Gabella, Gablum, Gablagium), in French Gabelle, that is, Vectigal, has the same signification among the ancient English writers which gabelle has in France. It is a tax, but the term has been variously used for a rent, custom, service, and the like. Where it was a payment of rent, those who paid it were termed gablatores. When the word was used without any addition to it, it signified the tax on salt, though afterwards it was applied to all other taxes. See the article France. Gabel, or Gablona, a city of the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia, in the circle of Buntzlau. It is surrounded with walls, and contains 380 houses, and 1980 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in making woollen cloths. It is celebrated for a battle fought there in 1757, with the Prussians.
