GIDEON, the son of Joash, of the tribe of Manassch. He dwelt in the city of Ophrah; and had a very extraordinary call to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites, to which they had become subject after the death of Barak and Deborah. Having effected their deliverance by supernatural aid, he was chosen judge of Israel in the year of the world 2759, and died in 2768.
