GOOLE, a hamlet in the parish of Snaith and the wapentake of Osgoldeross, in the west riding of Yorkshire. As it stands on the river Ouse, which is navigable to that point, it has appeared advisable to establish a customhouse there, by which the trade of the whole surrounding country has been considerably facilitated and increased. The population amounted in 1801 to 294, in 1811 to 320, in 1821 to 450, and in 1831 to 1671.
