GLADBACH, a town of Prussia, in the government of Cleves, and the capital of a circle of the same name. It is a place which has grown up in a few years to great manufacturing prosperity. It makes large quantities of linen and cotton goods, and many silks; and though within the town the inhabitants do not exceed 2000, yet the villages in contact with it, and forming the suburbs, contain more than 5500 persons.
