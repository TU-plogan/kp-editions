GALASHIELS, a town of Scotland, situated in a parish of the same name, which lies partly in the county of Roxburgh, and partly in that of Selkirk. The town stands upon a low piece of ground on the right bank of the Gala, about a mile above its embouchure into the Tweed. The old village of the same name is now abandoned and destroyed, and the new town has been built within the last fifty years. It consists of one long street, with some small lanes striking off from it, and also scattered clusters of houses, the whole being built of blue whinstone, and slated. Galashiels being situated in the midst of an extensive pastoral country, which yields abundance of wool, the manufacture of woollen cloth, and the spinning of woollen yarn, is carried on to a considerable extent, notwithstanding the disadvantage arising from expensive inland carriage, and the distance of the place from coal mines. The value of the manufactures of this description amount to about L.20,000 per annum, and the trade is upon the increase. The cloth produced here, which is coarse and strong, has long been remarkable for its durability; the quality, however, has been much improved within these few years. Only a small quantity of the goods manufactured is exported, the greater part of them being consumed at home. Flannels and blankets of an excellent quality are also made here from foreign wool. The tanning of leather and the dressing of skins are likewise carried on to some extent, and the town possesses a brewery. There are here several schools besides that for grammar, a parish church, and two or three dissenting meeting-houses. Galashiels is a burgh of barony. It is situated thirty-one miles from Edinburgh, five from Selkirk, and about five from Melrose. The population of the town and parish amounted in 1821 to 1545, and in 1831 to 1534.
