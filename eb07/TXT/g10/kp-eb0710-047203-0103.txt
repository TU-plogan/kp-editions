GERMAN, in matters of genealogy, signifies whole, entire, or own. Germani, quasi eadem stirpe geniti. Hence brother-german denotes a brother both by the father’s and mother’s side, in contradistinction to uterine brothers, who are so only by the mother’s side; or brothers consanguinean, who are so by the father’s side alone. Cousins-german are those in the first or nearest degree, being the children of brothers or sisters. Amongst the Romans we find no instance of marriage between cousins-german before the time of the Emperor Claudius, when they were very frequent. Theodosius prohibited such marriages under very severe penalties, including even fine and proscription.
