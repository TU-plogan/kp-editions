GOMBROON, a celebrated sea-port of Persia, in the province of Laristan, situated in a barren country on a bay of the Gulf of Ormus. This was at one time the first sea-port in the kingdom of Persia, being the port of Shiraz, and of all the southern provinces; and it was at that time strongly fortified. The houses were large and handsome, but the place was considered very unhealthy. Gombroon is still a place of considerable trade. The customs amount to about 20,000 rupees a year, for which the imaum of Muskat, to whom the town is subject, accounts to the kings of Persia. The town is large, and the houses are built in a much more commodious manner than is usual in the towns of Persia. The fort of Minab, by which the town is defended, is divided into the upper, centre, and lower forts. Close to the fort a small river breaks through the hills, and forms a pass from the eastward. This river, together with the canals made to diffuse its waters, serve as ditches to the fort The country for forty-five miles around Minab is covered with villages, abounds in dates, and supplies all the neighbouring country with grain. Forage is so plentiful that the cattle of the adjoining districts are sent in great numbers to feed there during the hot season. The English obtained permission to settle a factory here in 1613. About 1620 the Dutch obtained the same privilege; and when Ormus was captured in 1622, by the English and Persians, merchants resorted thither in great numbers, and commerce greatly increased The English remained here till 1759, when the factory, defenceless and totally neglected, was attacked by the French under Count dâ€™Estaing, to whom it surrendered. The factory was afterwards re-established, but has long since been withdrawn, in consequence of the unhealthiness of the climate. Long. 56. 12. E. Lat. 27. 18. N.
