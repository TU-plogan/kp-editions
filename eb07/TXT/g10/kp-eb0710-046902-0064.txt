GEORGIA, or Grusia. This extensive tract of country, which is situated between the Black and the Caspian Seas, now forms a province of Russia by the encroachments of that power on the side of Persia. It is diversified by great inequalities of surface; but contains many fertile and beautiful valleys, which are finely contrasted with the mountainous character of the regions of Caucasus. The hills are clothed with the finest woods, consisting of oak, ash, chestnut, beech, and elm. Some vines grow perfectly wild, producing the finest grapes; and the wines produced have always, according to the report of Sir R. K. Porter, been esteemed for softness, lightness, and delicacy of taste. The valleys are extremely fertile, producing cotton, as well as the finest European fruit trees, and abundance of hemp, flax, rice, millet, barley, and wheat. The country is copiously watered by the rivers which flow from the mountains, and produce great variety of delicious fish. Pheasants, wild fowl of every kind, antelopes, deer, sheep, with all sorts of domestic cattle, are found in the valleys. In the mountains are found mines of gold, silver, and other minerals. The habits of the people are such as might be expected in their low state of civilization. A struggle for independence was long maintained by the Georgians against the inroads of Persia. But it was at last reduced into a province of that vast monarchy, and it was afterwards the arena of the Persian and Russian wars, by which the country was ravaged; and the people, far from being naturally industrious, appeared to despise every pursuit which required labour. They neglected agriculture, and were often engaged in intestine wars, or in forays on their neighbours for the sakeof plunder; and were frequently exposed, in consequence, to severe retaliation from the Lesghees, a barbarous tribe, subsisting, like most of the mountain tribes of Asia, by pillage. But about the year 1800 it was reduced into a province of the Russian empire; and, under the iron rule of that despotic power, order has been re-established, the traveller has been protected from robbery, commerce and agriculture begin to be followed, and a favourable revolution appears to have taken place in the habits and manners of the people. Sir R. K. Porter, who has given an interesting account of these newly-conquered provinces, mentions that the different European governors have generally endeavoured to conciliate the people and the nobles, and that the country being now effectually guarded from the destructive inroads of plundering banditti or foreign enemies, the nobles begin to feel the importance of the station they hold in the country; whilst they have been still further countenanced by the distribution of medals and orders of distinction amongst the leading men, with titles also and commissions of military rank in the Russian armies. The Georgians are tall and well formed. The Georgian noble is distinguished by a sombre cast of visage, which, though stem, is of a fine contour, and harmonizes well with the minuteness of his figure, and the style of his dress, which consists of an under garment of fine pink cloth worn as a shirt, but leaving the neck entirely bare; a vest of cloth with sleeves sitting easy on the arm; a tunic descending over this to the knees, opening before, and bound round with a white sash, to which is attached the sword trousers to the knees; whilst a sort of stocking, and a close-laced half boot, complete this picturesque costume. The Georgian women equal the men in grace, and are famed all over the East. Their dress is cumbersome and overloaded with ornament, and the face painted so as entirely to injure its expression. Under its gallant prince Heraclius, Georgia rose to the dignity of a separate kingdom. This country originally included nearly the whole northern declivity of the Caucasus, extending from the Black Sea to the Caspian. It is now divided into the four provinces of Cartuel, Kaket or Kacheti, Kisik called sometimes Tomehet, and Georgian Armenia. The inhabitants consist chiefly of Christians of the Greek communion; to which are added Jews, Tartars, Armenians, and Russians. The chief rivers are the Kur and the Araxes, which fall into the Caspian. The chief, and indeed the only place of any consequence, is Tiflis, which, under the protecting policy of Russia, has rapidly grown up into a considerable mart of eastern commerce, and is on the increase. The inhabitants are not estimated at more than 320,000.

Georgia, one of the United States of North America, is situated between 30. 19. and 35. north latitude, and 3. 52. and 8. 47. west longitude. It is bounded on the north by Tennessee and North Carolina, on the northeast by South Carolina, on the south-east by the Atlantic, on the south by Florida, and on the west by Alabama. In length it extends 300 miles, having an average breadth of about 200 miles, and containing about 58,000 square miles. For nearly 100 miles along the sea-shore there is a broad maritime belt of level country. Along the coast there are a number of islands; whilst the numerous rivers, creeks, and inlets of the sea overflow the swamps or marshes with which they are bordered at almost every return of the tide. These swamps, however, constitute the rice plantations. Beyond the sea-marshes commences an extensive belt of pine barrens, extending from sixty to ninety miles from the sea, and closely resembling those of South Carolina. Beyond this belt the country becomes diversified with hills and mountains, and possesses a strong rich soil, called technically mulatto soil. This region is bounded on the west by a chain of hills called the Blue Ridge, which here swells into elevations about 1500 feet in height. An extensive track of table-land now succeeds, possessing a black soil of great fertility, in which pines and evergreens are more rare, their place being supplied by black walnut and other forest trees, which indicate a rich soil.

The principal rivers are, the Savannah, Ogeechee, Alatamaha, Satilla, Oakmulgee, Oconee, St Mary’s Flint, Chatahoochee, Tallapoosa, and Coosa. Tides flow up the Savannah for twenty-five miles, and the largest vessels can approach within three miles of the city of Savannah, eighteen miles from the ocean. The Ogeechee river pursues a south-east course through the state for 200 miles. A canal from the Savannah to the Ogeechee has been finished, and it is in contemplation to extend it to the Alatamaha, [7:10:470]which will make in all seventy-two miles. The latter river is a broad and deep stream, having numerous branches.

Amongst the mineral productions of Georgia may be mentioned copper and iron ores, the latter being found in great abundance. The gold region extends in a broad belt through this state; and it is conjectured that gold would be found much more abundantly in the high lands of Georgia and Alabama than in the eastern section of the gold region.

In front of the broad belt of salt marsh which skirts the sea-shore, there is a chain of islands of great value for their capability of yielding sea-island cotton, and as retreats, during the sickly months, for the low country planters. The soil of these islands is rich, and covered with pine, hickory, and live oak, in their natural state. The names of the principal of these are, Tybee, Assaw, Ossa-baw, St Catherine’s, Cumberland, Jeíćyl, Sapelo, and St Symon’s.

The climate is similar to that of South Carolina; indeed in a variety of its features Georgia resembles that state. The low countries have their sickly season, and the planters are compelled to fly in summer to retreats amongst the high .pine woods. The districts central to the rice swamps are invariably insalubrious. In some portions of Georgia the temperature approaches the tropical more than it does in any part of South Carolina, and these districts are accordingly better adapted to .the cultivation of the sugarcane, the olive, and sweet orange. The hilly and western parts of the state are as healthy as any part of America. Winter may be said to commence in the middle of December, and to end in the middle of February.

The staple production of the country is cotton, of which both the black-seeded and sea-island kinds are reared. The product next in importance is rice, with which grain the swamps are sowed. Indigo and tobacco are also cultivated to some extent, but sugar and wine are only produced in small quantities. The cultivation of silk has been successfully attempted, and the quality is said to be excellent. The forests afford an abundant supply of fine timber, consisting chiefly of oak, pine, hickory, mulberry, and cedar. Melons grow in high perfection, and figs are also common. Oranges, limes, citrons, pears, peaches, and a few other fruits of mild climates, are likewise cultivated. The exports, consisting chiefly of cotton, rice, deer skins, timber, &c. amounted in 1828 to 4,981,376 dollars. The tonnage was at that period 13,959 tons.

Savannah is the commercial capital of Georgia. It is situated on the western bank of the river of the same name, at about eighteen miles from its estuary. It stands upon a low sandy plain, and contains twelve public buildings and eight churches. There are ten public squares planted with trees, amongst which the beautiful China trees are conspicuous. Savannah is a place of considerable trade, and occasionally exports annually 120,000 bales of cotton, besides large amounts of rice and tobacco. The exports of rice were, in 1826, 11,455 tierces, and of tobacco 170 hogsheads. The town is defended by two forts, and the entrance to the river is indicated by a lighthouse on Tybee Island. The population was, in 1830, 7473. Augusta is a handsome town, situated on the western bank of the Savannah, about 127 miles above Savannah. It is well laid out, and chiefly built of brick. Being midway between the upper and lower country, it constitutes a central emporium of business; no town of the same size enjoys more. There is a communication by means of steam-boats between it and Savannah. The population in 1830 amounted to 6696. Milledgeville is situated on the western bank of the Oconee, 300 miles, by the curves of the river, from the ocean. Its situation is elevated and pleasant, and it is central to a fertile and populous country. It contains several public buildings, two or three churches, and about 3000 inhabitants. Athens, which also lies on the west bank of the Oconee, is the seat of the university of Georgia. The names of the other principal towns or villages are, Waynesborough, Louisville, Georgetown, Warrenton, Dublin, Laudersville, Sparta, Eatonton, Greensburgh, Madison, Jefferson, Clarksborough, Watkinsville, Marion, Darien, Hinton, Monticello, Sunbury, and St Mary’s.

The legislature of Georgia, which is called the general assembly, consists of a senate and a house of representatives. It meets on the first Monday of November. The members are chosen by the counties, each county sending one senator, and from one to four representatives, according to the amount of its population. In various parts of the state a number of negroes are employed by government in working on roads, rivers, &c. The university at Athens is a well-built edifice, furnished with a respectable library, and an assortment of philosophical apparatus. The funds amount to 136,000 dollars. According to a Gazetteer of Georgia, there are about eighty incorporated academies in this state, sixty-four of which have been brought into operation. The average number of pupils in each is forty-seven, making in all 3008. In the northern and southern sections of the state there are probably five common schools in each county, forty counties, thirty pupils each, 6000; in the middle section say seven common schools in each county, twenty-five counties, 5250; total number of pupils in the academies and common schools, 14,258. The state possesses academy and poor-school funds to a considerable amount. In 1792 an act was passed by which every county was allowed to purchase the value of L.1000 of confiscated property; in each county 1000 acres of land were granted for the support of schools, and also a fund of 250,000 dollars to be vested in stocks for the same purpose. The prevailing religious denominations of Georgia are the baptists and methodists.

The first settlement of this state was made at Savannah by General Oglethorpe in the year 1733. The native Indians of this state having been more disposed to adopt the arts and modes of civilized life than in others, the white inhabitants have gradually acquired a superiority over the lands. The greater portions of two considerable tribes, the Cherokees and Creeks, reside within the chartered limits of Georgia. Those of the former tribe in particular have made very considerable advancement in civilization. They possess good houses, live in villages, pursue agriculture, and have 1277 slaves. They have amongst them carpenters and blacksmiths, and the women spin and weave, and make butter and cheese. The number of these Indians is about 15,000, and they have increased within the last six years. Their form of government is similar to that of the country in which they live. Numerous missionary establishments have been fixed amongst them, in the schools of which, according to the Gazetteer formerly referred to, 500 children are learning the English language. Georgia is divided into seventy-eight counties, and the population in 1830 amounted to 516,504, of which number between the third and the half are slaves.
