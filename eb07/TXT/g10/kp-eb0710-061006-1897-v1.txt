Good Friday, a fast of the Christian church, in memory of the sufferings and death of Jesus Christ. It is observed on the Friday in holy or passion week; and it is called, by way of eminence, good, because of the blessed effects of our Saviour’s sufferings, which were a propitiatory or expiating sacrifice for the sins of the world. The commemoration of our Saviour’s sufferings has been observed from the very first ages of Christianity, and was always kept as a day of the strictest fasting and humiliation. Amongst the Saxons it was called Long Friday, but for what reason, except perhaps the long fastings an.l offices then used, is uncertain.
