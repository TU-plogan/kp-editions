GOD, one of the many names of the Supreme Being God is also used in speaking of any false deity of th e heathens. The Greeks and Latins, it is observable, did not mean by the name of god, an all-perfect being, 0 f whose nature, eternity, infinity, omnipresence, and omnipotence, were essential attributes; amongst them, the word only implied an excellent and superior nature, and, accordingly, they gave the appellation of gods to all being, of a rank or class higher and more nerfect than men, espe [7:10:595]r cially to those who were inferior agents in the divine administration. Thus men themselves, according to their system, might become gods after death; inasmuch as their souls might attain to a degree of excellence superior to that which they were capable of while in life.
