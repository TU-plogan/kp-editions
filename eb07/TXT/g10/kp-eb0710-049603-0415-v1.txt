GHERIAH, a fortress of Hindustan, in the south of India, situated on a rocky promontory in the province of Concan, about one mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad. It is joined to the main land by a narrow neck of land; and lies about a mile from the entrance of a capacious harbour, formed by the mouth of a river which descends from the Western Ghauts. It was taken possession of by the Mahrattas in the seventeenth century; and in 1707, Conajee Angria had established an independent sovereignty here, and possessed a numerous piratical fleet. The depredations of these pirates drew on them the vengeance of the British; and in 1756 Angria’s fleet was destroyed by Admiral VVatson and Colonel Clive. The first which was taken was found to contain 206 pieces of ordnance, and an immense quantity of ammunition and naval stores, besides L.120,000 in specie or valuables.
