GODDARD, Jonathan, an eminent physician and chemist, and one of the first promoters of the Royal Society, was born about the year 1617. He was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians in 1646, and appointed reader of the anatomical lecture in that college in 1647. As he took part against Charles I., accepted the wardenship of Merton College, Oxford, from Oliver Cromwell when chancellor, and sat as sole representative of that university in Cromwell’s parliament, he was removed from his wardenship by Charles II. He was then, however, professor of physic at Gresham College, to which he retired, and continued to attend those meetings which gave birth to the Royal Society, upon the first, establishment of which he was nominated one of the council. Being fully persuaded that the preparation of medicines was not less the physician’s duty than prescribing them, he constantly prepared his own; and in 1668 he published a treatise recommending his example to general practice. He died of an apoplectic attack in 1674; and his memory has been preserved by the drops which bear his name, otherwise called Gutta Anglicana, the secret of which he sold to Charles II. for L.5000.
