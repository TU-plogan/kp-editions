GENEVA, a canton of Switzerland, comprehending the city of that name, and the territory around it to the extent of about 93 square miles, containing, in 1834, 56,655 inhabitants, four fifths of whom reside within the city. Geneva, the largest city of Switzerland, is situated on the Lake of Geneva, where the river Rhone issues from it, and is divided by that river into two parts of unequal size. The streets are narrow, the houses lofty, and the appearance, except on the boulevards, is gloomy. It contains five reformed, one Lutheran, and one Catholic church, and about 30,000 inhabitants. It is a place of great activity in many branches of manufacture. The chief of these in amount is watchmaking and jewellery, in which many workmen are employed. Tanning, calico-printing, twine-spinning, hatmaking, whitesmiths’ work, copper utensils, saddlery, silk and woollen shawls, besides copperplate and letterpress printing, are all occupations carried on, and the amount of which exported to other countries is very considerable. The fisheries in the Lake of Geneva and on the Rhone are also important branches of industry. Many individuals are said to have amassed very large fortunes, which they employ extensively in speculations in the funds of all nations, in banking, and in exchanges.

Much learning still exists in the city, and in former times it produced men of eminence in most branches of literature and science, among whom may be mentioned Calvin, Diodati, Tronchen, Casaubon, Rousseau, Neckar, Bonnet, and others. Long. 6. 4. 49. E. Lat. 46.12.15. N. See Switzerland. Geneva Lake. This lake is in the shape of a crescent. Switzerland forms the hollow, and Savoy the convex part, the greatest breadth being about twelve miles. The country on the side of Savoy is full of high and craggy mountains; but from Geneva to the environs of Lausanne it slopes to the margin of the lake, and is very rich and fertile. The banks rise considerably in the neighbourhood of Lausanne, and form a most beautiful terrace, with a rapid descent a few miles beyond the town. In the neighbourhood of Vevay a plain begins, and continues for a great way beyond the end of the lake, but is contracted towards the water by the approach of the mountains. The lake itself appears at a distance of a beautiful blue colour, and the water is very clear and transparent. Near Geneva the coast of the lake abounds with pebbles; between that city and Lausanne it is sandy; from thence to Chillon it is bounded by hard calcareous rocks; and the extremity of the shores is a marsh formed by mud collected from the river Rhone. The greatest depth of this lake found by Μ. de Luc is a hundred and sixty fathoms.

Geneva, or Gin, among distillers, an ordinary malt spirit, distilled a second time, with the addition of some juniper berries.
