GREW, Neiiemiah, the first vegetable anatomist and physiologist of this country, was born at Coventry about the year 1628. He was educated as a Presbyterian; and on the change of the national form of religion, at the restoration of Charles Il., he was sent to study at some foreign university, where he took his degree of doctor of physic. He settled first at Coventry, but removed afterwards to London, where he obtained considerable practice as a physician; and at length succeeded Mr Oldenburg in the office of secretary to the Royal Society. In this capacity, pursuant to an order of council, he drew up a catalogue of the natural and artificial rarities belonging to the society, under the title of Musteum Regalis Societatis, 1681. Besides several papers in the Philosophical Transactions, he also wrote, 1. The Comparative Anatomy of the Stomach and Guts, folio; 2. The Anatomy of Vegetables, of Roots and of Trunks, 1682, in folio; 3. Tractatus de Salis Cathartici Natura et Usu; 4. Cosmologia Sacra, or a Discourse of the Universe, as it is the Creature and Kingdom of God, folio. The works of Grew were translated into French and Latin; but, as it appears, by no means correctly, at least in the latter of these languages. He died suddenly, on the 25th of March 1711.
