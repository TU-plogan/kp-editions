GOGO, a sea-port of Hindustan, in the province of Gujrat,and district of Goelwarah, situated on the west side of the Gulf of Cambay. It is considered as a safe roadstead during the south-west monsoon, where ships may be supplied with stores and provisions, and repair any damage they may have sustained. The inhabitants, who are principally Mahommedans, build vessels of from fifty to three hundred tons burden; and carry on a considerable trade with Bombay and other places, the chief export being cotton. The Lascars of this place are named Siddhees; they are descendants of the Abyssinians, and are held in much estimation for their nautical skill and bravery. It is an ancient town, and has fallen greatly into decay; but since it came into the possession of the British it has been gradually increasing in commerce and population. Long. 72. 21. E. Lat. 21. 4L N.
