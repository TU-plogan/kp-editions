GAUZE, in Commerce, a very thin, slight, transparent kind of stuff, woven sometimes of silk, and sometimes only of thread. To warp the silk for making gauze, a peculiar kind of mill is used, upon which the silk is wound. Th⅛ mill is a wooden machine, about six feet high, having an axis placed perpendicularly in the middle, with six large wings, on which the silk is wound from off the bobbins by the axis turning round. Whęn all the silk is on the mill, another instrument is used to wind it off again upon two beams; and this being done, the silk is passed through as many little beads as there are threads of silk, and thus rolled upon another beam to supply the loom. The gauze loom is much like that of the common weavers, though it has several appendages peculiar to itself.
