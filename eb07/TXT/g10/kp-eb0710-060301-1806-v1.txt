GOG and Magog, two names generally joined together in Scripture. Moses, however, speaks of Magog the son of Japhet, but says nothing of Gog. Gog was prince of Magog, according to Ezekiel, in whose writings Magog signifies the country or people, and Gog the king of that country. The generality of the ancients considered Magog as the father of the Scythians and Tartars; and several interpreters discovered many traces of their name in the provinces of Great Tartary. Others have been of opinion that the Persians were the descendants of Magog; and some have imagined that the Goths were descended from Gog and Magog, and that the wars described by Ezekiel, [7:10:604] and undertaken by Gog against the saints, were no other than those which the Goths carried on in the fifth age against the Roman empire. Bochart has placed Gog in the neighbourhood of Caucasus. He derives the name of this celebrated mountain from the Hebrew Goff Chasan, the Fortress of Gog. He maintains that Prometheus, who is said to have been chained to Caucasus by Jupiter, is no other than Gog. In Iberia there was a province called the Gogarene. Lastly, the generality of writers believe that Gog and Magog, mentioned in Ezekiel and the Revelation, are to be taken in an allegorical acceptation, as signifying such princes as were enemies to the church and saints. Thus, by Gog in Ezekiel many understand Antiochus Epiphanes, the persecutor of the Jews who remained firm to their religion; and by the person of the same name in the Revelation they suppose to be meant Antichrist, the great enemy of the church and faithful. Some have endeavoured to prove that the Gog spoken of in Ezekiel, and Cambyses king of Persia, were one and the same person; and that Gog and Magog in the Revelation denote generally the enemies and persecutors of the church.
