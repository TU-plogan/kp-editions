GALILEE, once a province of Judaea, now of Turkey in Asia, was bounded by Mount Lebanon on the north, by the river Jordan and the sea of Galilee on the east, by the Chison on the south, and by the Mediterranean on the west. It was the scene of many of our Saviour’s miracles; but the boundaries of the country are not now well known, nor even the places where many of the towns were situated.
