GONONG TELLOO, a town in the island of Celebes, situated on a river of the same name, two miles from the sea, on the north side of the great bay of Tominie or Gonong Telloo, which stretches inland nearly to the west side of Celebes. It was subject to the Dutch, who had a considerable fort on the river, with two small ones at its entrance, but it was reduced when the island of Celebes was taken possession of by the British in 1812. Ships can anchor at the entrance of the river in deep water; and just within the entrance are two small coves, either of which a ship may haul into, and be sheltered from the strong freshes that come down the river. The inhabitants are Malays and Mahommedans. A considerable trade is carried on, and the rajah is the principal merchant. The articles chiefly imported are opium, iron, gunpowder, piece-goods of a common kind, and coarse cutlery. Gold is one of the principal exports, and also tortoise-shell; the gold is procured from a mine to the westward of Gonong Telloo. Long. 123. E. Lat. 0. 30. S.
