GROOTE EYLANDT, a large island on the north coast of New Holland, and on the western shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It was so called by the Dutch navigators who first visited this gulf, and is about sixty miles from north to south. It is generally barren and unproductive on the coast; but towards the interior is covered with wood. It extends from lat. 13. 39. to 14. 17. 8.
