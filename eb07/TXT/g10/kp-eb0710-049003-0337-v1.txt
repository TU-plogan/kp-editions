GERONA, a city of Spain, in the province of Catalonia. It is situated on the river Ter, at its confluence with the Oña, and is a strongly fortified city, of great celebrity in the military history of Catalonia, by the sieges it has sustained at various periods. None of the resistances it has made, or indeed of those made by any other city, surpasses the obstinate defence which it sustained against the armies of France during the late war. It is the see of a bishop, and has a magnificent cathedral, with many other substantial public buildings. The diocese of Gerona was one of the best cultivated and most flourishing districts of Spain. The portion of it on the sea coast abounds in wheat, wines, and vinegar; the sides of the mountains are covered with vineyards and olive gardens, and the tops yield the best oaks and other useful trees. The ravages of war have been very severely felt; but the fertility of the soil, and the industry of the inhabitants, will, it is hoped, speedily repair the injuries it has endured. Its inhabitants amount to 14,000. It is in north latitude 42. 0. S.
