GLASTONBURY, a town of Somersetshire, in the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides, 130 miles from London. It is situated in a district of peculiar fertility, and much of the pasture land within the two parishes of which the town consists is of higher value for fattening cattle than any other in the rich county in which it stands. This place was once an island, called in Latin Avalonia. It was surrounded by water forced up by the strength of the tide, but embankments having been made and drains constructed in very remote ages, the land has been con-

, verted into rich pasture. This was effected by the abbot ι and his monks, who, notwithstanding the vast expenditure ï lavished upon their abbey, were the great leaders of the agricultural improvements of their age.

ľ The abbey, founded at a very early period, was, for ex- • tent and wealth, the next to that of Westminster. The ab-

bot was a lord of parliament; and the ruins which remain are sufficient proofs of the magnificence of the whole estaI blishment. Although, as might be expected from its age,: the abbey is in a dilapidated state, yet the architectural beauty of what remains, and especially that of the chapel, causes the whole to be visited with eager curiosity. The abbot’s kitchen is tolerably perfect, and the eastern window of the chapel is worthy of admiration. The legend of the visit of Joseph of Arimathea, and his budding staff converted into a thorn, blooming at Christmas, is well known; as well as that of St Dunstan having taken the devil by his nose with a pair of red hot tongs. Both are related of this place, though the first is doubted and the second ridiculed.

Near the town, upon an insulated and lofty mount, Glastonbury tower is visible from all parts of the surrounding country. It was formerly an oratory, dedicated to St Michael, and afterwards enlarged so as to form a magnificent church and monastery, both of which were destroyed by an earthquake in 1271. Many of the private buildings in the town still display curious decorations of carved work of very ancient date. The present town contains two parish churches, dedicated to St John and to St Benedict. It was an ancient corporation, and returned members to parliament till the year 1539, when the abbot was put to death, and that charter taken away. A new charter was granted in the reign of Queen Anne, under the powers of which the town was governed by a mayor, eight aidermen, and sixteen burgesses. It is now governed, under the municipal corporation act, by four aidermen and twelve councillors. The population amounted in 1821 to 2630, and in 1831 to 2984. There is now but little trade in the town, and the making of stockings, which once afforded employment, is nearly lost. Being on the great road leading from Bristol and Bath to Exeter and Plymouth, there is much travelling, especially of late years, since the roads have been improved.
