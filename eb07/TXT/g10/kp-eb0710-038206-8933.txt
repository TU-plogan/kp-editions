GENOA, a duchy forming a part of the kingdom of Sardinia, in Italy, which, till the congress of Vienna, was the ancient republic of that name. On the north it ia bounded by Piedmont, Parma, and Tuscany, on the east by Massa-Corrara, on the south by the Mediterranean Sea, and on the west by Nice. It extends over 2420 square miles. It was before transferred to the king of Sardinia, and divided into provinces; but when the Ligurian republic was established by the French, it was by them formed into four departments. These lines of demarcation have, however, been abolished, and now the duchy is formed into fifteen circles or arrondissements, the boundaries and extent of which are not accurately defined, but each of which has its separate intendancy. The population is 208,000, living m nineteen cities and 725 towns and villages.

The duchy is a narrow strip of land bordering on the Mediterranean, and enclosed by the Apennines, Ä¼which separate it from the rest of Italy. It may be viewed in two parts: Is/, The mountains, which are mostly bare and barren, except in some valleys between them, and are impassable, except by two roads which lead to Piedmont and eastern Italy; 2dly, the sea-coast, where the land rises slip by slip in the form of terraces, and is for the most part sandy on the lower elevation; whilst on the higher, what little soil there is is mixed with slate.

The greater part of the land belongs to the old Genoese noble families, or to the clergy; and the cultivator either farms it at a rent in produce, or on joint account with the proprietor. The whole duchy scarcely grows as much wheat, maize, and barley, as serves for three months' consumption. and the deficiency is supplied either from Piedmont or from more remote countries. The chief product of the soil is the olive, the oil of which forms the most valuable article of export; but besides that, large quantities of oranges, citrons, pomegranates, and pine-apples, are sent to France, to Switzerland, and to Germany. Figs, almonds, capers, truffles, and morels, are exported to more distant markets. Chestnuts are grown abundantly on the mountains, and, with potatoes, form among the poorer classes substitutes for bread. The wine in general is of a bad quality, with few and insignificant exceptions. The cultivation of silk is moderate in quantity and inferior in quality. The fishery is pursued with little success, as the fish is scarce, except those of the smaller kinds.

(- The manufactures sank during the revolutionary scenes which the republic of Genoa witnessed; but they have been gradually returning to their former prosperity of late years. They now make silks and silk hosiery, fine thin woollens, hats, shoes, paper, chocolate, white lead, silver goods, and much candied fruit, which form articles of export. The restoration of the Bank of St George, which has now a capital of 1,220,000 livres, has been found highly beneficial to commerce. The other sea-ports, besides Genoa, are Spezzia, Savona, Porto Maurizzio, Vintigmilia, Finale, and Sestri. The population at present amounts to about 100,000.

Genoa, a city, the capital of the duchy of that name, is the seat of an archbishop, of the government boards, and of the senate. It is in the form of an amphitheatre, the streets rising above one another from the sea-shore, so that it has a magnificent appearance at a distance. It is surrounded with fortifications, which are very extensive, as they enclose both gardens and fields. The interior of the enclosure or city consists of irregular and narrow streets, in which magnificent palaces and houses six stories high are crowded together. The Strada Novi and [7:10:383]the Strada Balbi, which consist of palaces, are not more than twenty-four feet wide, and the Piazza Reale is the only part which is tolerably open and airy. The city contains, besides the cathedral, fifty-two parish churches, and sixty-nine others belonging to different convents. There are several hospitals, two of which receive 1000 patients each, and several other charitable institutions. There is a university, with a library of 70,000 volumes and 1000 manuscript works, besides other establishments for instruction in the fine arts and the sciences.

The most remarkable object is the harbour, enclosed by two moles, each 7000 feet in length, at the termination of which stand the light-houses. It is capable of receiving ships of the greatest draught of water, which are secure against all winds but that directly south. More than 3000 vessels, besides coasters, enter it yearly. The inhabitants are industrious, and provide many articles for commerce, which are noticed in the account of the duchy in this work. The theatres and other conveniences are numerous, and splendidly conducted, as in other Italian cities. Long. 8. 53. 2. E. Lat. 44. 23. 48. N.
