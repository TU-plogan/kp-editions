GARROWS, a mountainous district of Hindustan, on the north-east frontier of Bengal, tributary to the British. It is situated between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. Its boundaries are said to be Rangamutty on the north and Assam on the east, though its limits have never been exactly ascertained. The country is mountainous, but fertile and tolerably well inhabited. The chief rivers which flow from the hills are the Nati, the Maharishi, the Sumaserry, and the Mahadeo. The rivers are of a sandy, gravelly bottom, and contain limestone and iron ore. In the bed of the Mahadeo is found abundance of coals: these might be a valuable article of import into Bengal; but the inhabitants, still in a barbarous state, are ignorant of the art of mining. The people arc of a stout make, vigorous and athletic, but ill looking. They are not so dark as those in Bengal. They go nearly naked; and although calling themselves Hindoos, eat all kinds of food, and drink spirituous liquors. They worship Mahadeva; and at Banjam, a pass in the hills, they worship the sun and moon. They are poor and barbarous in their habits. Their houses are of the rudest description, being raised on piles three or four feet from the ground. The houses of the better classes are more neatly executed. They are said to be cheerful in their dispositions and mild in their manners. At the foot of the Garrow Hills reside a tribe of people called HaÄµins, who are more like the Hindoos, and who will not kill a cow.
