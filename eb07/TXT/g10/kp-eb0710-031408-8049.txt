GAONS, a certain order of Jewish doctors who appeared in the East after the closing of the Talmud. The word gaons signifies excellent or sublime; as in the divinity schools we formerly had irrefragable, sublime, resolute, angelic, and subtile doctors. The Gaons succeeded the Seburaeans, about the beginning of the sixth century. Chanan Meiscbtia was the head of the excellents, and [7:10:315]restored the academy of Pandebita, which had been shut up for thirty years.
