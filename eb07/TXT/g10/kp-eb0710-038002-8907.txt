GEMONIAE Scalae, or Gradus GemoxÄ³, amongst the Romans, was much the same as gallows or gibbet in England. Some say they were thus denominated from the person who raised them; others, from the first criminals who suffered on them; and others, from the verb gemo, I sigh or groan. The gradus gemonii, according to Publius Victor or Sextus Rufus, was a place raised on several steps, whence criminals were precipitated; others represent it as a place whereon offenders were executed, and afterwards exposed to public view. The gemoniae scales were in the tenth region of the city, near the temple of Juno. Camillus first appropriated the place to this use in the year of Rome 358.
