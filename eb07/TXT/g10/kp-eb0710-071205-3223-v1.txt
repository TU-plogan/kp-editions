GRATES for Fires are composed of ribs of iron placed at small distances from one another, so that the air may have sufficient access to the fuel, and the accumulation of the ashes, which would choke the fire, may be prevented. Grates seem peculiarly adapted to the use of pitcoal, which requires a greater quantity of air to make it burn freely than other kinds of fuel.

The hearths of the Britons seem to have been fixed in the centre of their halls, as is yet practised in some parts of Scotland, where the fire is nearly in the middle of the house, and the family all sit around it. Their fire-place was perhaps nothing more than a large stone, depressed a little below the level of the ground, and thereby adapted to receive the ashes. About a century ago, the fireplace was on the floor of the room, with the addition of a bank or hob of clay. But amongst gentlemen this was changed for a portable fire-pan,, raised upon low supporters, and fitted with a circular grating of bars.
