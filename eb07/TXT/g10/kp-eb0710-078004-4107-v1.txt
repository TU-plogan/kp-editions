GROSE, Francis, born about the year 1731, was the son of Francis Grose, a jeweller of Richmond, by whom the coronation crown of George H. was filled up. Young Grose obtained an independent fortune by the death of his father, which happened in the year 1769. He was then paymaster and adjutant in the Surrey militia, but dissipation so far prevented him for some time from giving proper attention to his duty, that, in his own humorous mode of expressing himself, he kept but two books of accounts, his right and left hand pockets. The losses which this thoughtless conduct occasioned him awakened his dormant talents, and he resolved to turn his attention to literary pursuits. Having received a classical education, he united to it an excellent taste for drawing, which induced him to commence his Views of Antiquities in England and Wales. He began this work in numbers in 1773, and completed it in 1776; and by it he obtained both reputation and profit, which last his unpardonable prodigality had rendered extremely welcome. In 1777 he added to his English Views other two volumes, including the islands of Guernsey and Jersey, finished in 1776. All his expectations were fully gratified by the publication of this work; and during the remainder of his life he continued to publish others, which in general increased his reputation[7:10:781] as an author, and tended to augment his substance. In the summer of 1789 he paid a visit to Scotland, and in 1790 began to publish in numbers, the Views taken by him in that country. He next proceeded to Ireland, with a view to give a similar description of that country; but on the 6th of May 1791, whilst at Dublin, in the house of Mr Horne, he Was suddenly seized at table with an apoplectic fit, and immediately expired. He was buried in Drumcondra churchyard, near Dublin. Although his literature was very respectable, it was exceeded by his good humour, his convivial turn of mind, and his friendly disposition. Both at home and abroad he was always in the best company, and his knowledge of the world was so extensive that his conversation was useful and entertaining. He was free from the malignity and pride of some authors; for as he felt the independence of his own talents, he scorned to depreciate those of others. Of the most careless, open, and artless disposition, he was often the prey of the designing, and more than once embarrassed himself by placing too implicit confidence in the probity of others. A tale of distress never failed to touch his heart, and to bedew his cheek with tears of commiseration. His works are, 1. The Antiquities of England and Wales, in 8 vols. 4to and 8vo; 2. The Antiquities of Scotland, in 2 vols. 4to and 8vo; 3. The Antiquities of Ireland, in 2 vols. 4to and 8vo, a posthumous work edited by Mr Ledwich, 1794; 4. A Treatise on ancient Armour and Weapons, 1785, in 4to; 5. A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue,

1785, in 8vo; 6. Military Antiquities, being a History of the English Army from the Conquest to the present time,

1786, 1788, in 2 vols. 4to; 7. The History of Dover

Castle by the Rev. William Darell, 1786, in 4to; 8. A Provincial Glossary, with a Collection of Local Proverbs and Popular Superstitions, 1788, in 8vo; 9. Rules for Drawing Caricatures, 1788, in 8vo; 10. Supplement to the Treatise on ancient Armour and Weapons, 1789, in 4to; 11. A Guide to Health, Beauty, Honour, and Riches, being a collection of humorous advertisements, pointing out the means to obtain these blessings, with a suitable introductory preface, 8yo; 12. The Olio, a Collection of Essays, Jests, and small pieces of Poetry, highly charac-teπstιc of Grose, though not made by hirΛ, nor all of his composition, 1793, in 8vo. j
