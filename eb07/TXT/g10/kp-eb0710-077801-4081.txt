GRINSTEAD, East, a borough-town and extensive parish of the county of Sussex, in the hundred of Rushmonden and rape of Pevensey, twenty-nine miles from London. It is situated on an eminence, and its tower is a prominent object to a large extent of country. It was a burgage tenure borough, and returned two members to parliament; but has been disfranchised. The houses were the property of the Duke of Dorset, but are now in possession of the Earl of Plymouth, to whom they descended by marriage. There is a market, chiefly for corn, held on Thursday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2659, in 1811 to 2804, in 1821 t o 3153, and in 1831 to 3364. The assizes for the county are held here alternately with Horsham.
