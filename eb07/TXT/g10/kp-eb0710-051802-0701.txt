GIGG, Giga, or Jig, in Music and Dancing, a gay, brisk, sprightly composition, yet in full measure, as well as the allemand, which is more serious. MÃ©nage conceives the word to spring from the Italian gieg, a musical instrument mentioned by Dante. Others suppose it to be derived from the Teutonic giga, or ghiighe, a fiddle. This is a favourite air in most nations of Europe; its characteristic is duple time, and it consists of two strains, without any determinate number of bars.
