GRAVESEND, a market-town of the county of Kent, in the hundred of Toltingtrough, of the lathe of Aylesl√≤rd, twenty-three miles from London. It is situated on the south bank of the river Thames, from which the principal street ascends up a gentle hill. It depends chiefly on the ships which resort to the port of London, as at the customhouse all vessels report their arrival, and outward bound ships receive their clearances. There are strong batteries above and below the town, which defend the passage, in conjunction with Tilbury Fort, opposite the town, on the Essex shore. There is a constant, almost hourly, intercourse with the metropolis by steam, and other passage boats, which find ample employment in conveying the numerous pilots, custom-house officers, masters of vessels, merchants, and seamen, backwards and forwards. The soil round the town is favourable for gardens, and the supply of vegetables to ships departing is amply furnished; and this, with the sale of poultry, fresh butter, eggs, and meal, is a source of profit to the inhabitants. A little below the town, establishments have been formed of late years for bathing, as the river, with the flood tide, is perfectly salt. The great road to Dover passes the end of the town, and contributes in some degree to its prosperity. It is a corporate borough, governed by a mayor, twelve jurats, and twenty-four common councilmen, who have an elegant town-hall, but return no members to parliament. The church is a modern building, erected, under the act ofQueen Anne, for building fifty churches, in 1731. There is a good market on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2483, in 1811 to 3119, in 1821 to 3814, and in 1831 to 5097.
