GRANDEE is a term applied to a lord of the first rank or highest quality. In Spain the name grandees is used absolutely to denote the great lords of the court, to whom the king has granted permission to remain covered in his presence. There are some grandees for life only, who are made by the king’s saying simply, “Be covered others are grandees by descent, and made by the king’s saying, “Be covered for thyself and heirs.” The latter are of course the higher and nobler grade.
