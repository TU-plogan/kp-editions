GOORACKPOOR, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Oude, situated to the north of the Goggrah or Dewah river, and between the 26th and 28th degrees of north latitude. To the north it is separated by hills and forests from the Nepaulese territories, to the south it is bounded by the Dewah or Goggrah river, and on the east by the Gunduck. In 1801 this district was ceded to the British, in virtue of a treaty concluded between the nabob of Oude and the Marquis Wellesley. The country abounds with forests of fine timber; and since it came into the possession of the British, periodical fairs have been established, in order to promote a free intercourse with the Nepaulese, and the other inhabitants of the mountains to the north, and with Goorackpoor. These fairs are numerously attended by traders from the neighbouring provinces, and to them also was sent part of the company’s investment of woollens. The principal towns are Goorackpoor, Buckrah, and Mutgur. If this district were properly cleared and cultivated, it is thought that it would be one of the finest parts of the British dominions in India, being situated to the north of Bengal, and watered by three rivers, and various streams from the hills.

Goorackpoor, the capital of the above-mentioned district, situated on the eastern bank of the Boora Rapty river, which is navigable for boats at all seasons of the Ĩear. It had formerly a brick wall, which is now in ruins, t is the residence of the civil establishment of the district. The travelling distance east from Lucknow is 170 miles. Long. 83. 22. E. Lat. 26. 45. N.
