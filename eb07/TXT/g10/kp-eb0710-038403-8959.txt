GENTILESCHI, Horatio, an Italian painter, was born at Pisa in 1563. After having made himself famous at Florence, Rome, Genoa, and other parts of Italy, he removed to Savoy; whence he proceeded to France, and at last, upon the invitation of Charles I., came over to England. He was well received by that king, who appointed him lodgings in his court, together with a considerable salary, and employed him in his palace at Greenwich, and other public places. The most remarkable of his performances in England, were the ceilings of Greenwich, and York House. He also executed a Madona, a Magdalen, and Lot with his two daughters, for King Charles; all which he performed admirably well. He made several attempts in face painting, but with little success; his talent lying altogether in histories, with figures as big as the life. After twelve years continuance in England, he died at eighty-four years of age, and was buried in the Queenâ€™s Chapel, at Somerset House.
