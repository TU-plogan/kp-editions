GANYMEDE, in Mythology, a beautiful youth of Phrygia, son of Tros, and brother of Ilus; but, according to Lucian, he was the son of Dardanus. Jupiter having been charmed with him, carried him away, and made him his cup-bearer in the room of Hebe. Some say that the chief of the gods caused him to be carried away by an eagle, whilst others affirm that he was himself the ravisher under the form of that bird. He deified this youth; and, to comfort his father, presented him with some of those very swift horses upon which the gods indulged in equitation.
