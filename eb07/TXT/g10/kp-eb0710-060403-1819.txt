GOGUET, Antoine-Yves, a distinguished French writer, was born at Paris on the 18th January 1716. From his infancy he was connected by the ties of friendship with Alexander Conrad Fugère, the learned editor of the Journal des Savants; and there never perhaps existed between two friends such an entire conformity of tastes and character. They studied philosophy together at the college of Harcourt, and after having terminated their studies there, both felt the necessity of recommencing them. To this laudable object they accordingly applied themselves with an ardour which was at length crowned with success. The former laboured without any other object than that of instructing himself; but the latter had a plan to which all his studies were directed. When Goguet undertook the work which distinguishes his name, Fugere assisted him with criticisms and materials. The success of this work was well deserved; and of the two friends, Fugère was the one whom that success flattered the most. Robust health appeared to promise long life to Goguet; and he had applied himself to new labours, when he was seized by the smallpox, a disease which he had always dreaded, but without deciding to have recourse to inoculation. He died on the 2d of May 1758, at the age of forty-two years and three months. By his will, he bequeathed his library to Fugère, but the latter was so deeply affected by the death of his friend, that he only survived him three days. This affecting incident is perhaps without a parallel in the history of friendship. The work of Goguet is entitled De l’ Origine des Lois, des Arts, et des Sciences, et des leur Progrès chez les anciens peuples, Paris, 1758, in three volumes 4to. Of this valuable work there have been several editions; but the first is the best. An excellent translation of it was published at Edinburgh in 1761, in three volumes octavo. It is stated in the Edinburgh Review (vol. xiv. p. 409) as a fact “not generally known, that this translation came from the pen of Dr Henry, the historian of Great Britain.” The period embraced in the work extends from the establishment of civil society to the reign of Cyrus. It is divided into three parts, and each into six books, which treat separately of government, the arts and manufactures, the sciences, commerce and navigation, the military art, and, lastly, manners and usages. The state of each of these objects of inquiry at different epochs is examined continuously; and facts, investigated with equal erudition and good faith, always serve as the basis of the reasonings. The style is agreeable, without, however, being exempt from some indications of bad taste. At the end of each volume are discussed, in learned dissertations, those points the detailed examination of which could not easily enter into the body of the work. Goguet intended to write a History of the Progress of Laws, Arts, and Sciences in France, since the establishment of the Monarchy; and it is much to be regretted that he did not live to carry into execution an undertaking which, proceeding from his pen, would have been invaluable. An Eloge of Goguet was printed in the Année Littéraire, 1758, tome iv, and in the supplement to the Journal des Savants for the month of July in the same year. (a.)
