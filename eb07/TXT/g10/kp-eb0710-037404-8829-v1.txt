GAZETTE, a newspaper, or account of the transactions of all the countries in the world, printed on a loose sheet or half sheet. This name is with us confined to that paper of news published by authority. The word is derived from gazetta, a Venetian coin, which was the usual price of the first newspaper printed there, and which was afterwards given to the paper itself. The first gazette in England was published at Oxford, whilst the court resided there, in a folio sheet, dated 7th November 1665. On the removal of the court to London the title was changed to that of the London GazeUe.
