GOHUD, afortified town of Hindustan, in theprovinceof Agra, and capital of an extensive district of the same name. The district is situated on the south side of the river Chumbul, and between the 26th and 27th degrees of north latitude. It is a mountainous territory, but is fertile in the valleys, and abounds with strong positions, particularly the celebrated fortress of Gualior. About the middle of the last century Gohud was a small village attached to the district of Gualior, and the rannah’s ancestors were zemindars of this village. Bheem Singh, the rannah, prior to the battle of Paniput, in 1761 acquired possession of Gualior, but it was taken from him by the Mahrattas. When this nation lost the battle of Paniput, the rannah of Gohud attempted to shake off their yoke, but was conquered by Ra-goonauth Row in 1766, and compelled to continue tributary. On a subsequent rupture Gohud was taken by Scindia in 1784. On the 17th of January 1804 a treaty was concluded by the British government with the rannah of Gohud, by which he was to be established in the sovereignty of Gohud, Gualior, and a considerable number of adjacent districts. This treaty, however, was never carried into effect, and a new treaty was concluded, by which the rajah agreed to relinquish the country and fort of Gohud, and the adjoining districts. Gohud is sixty-five miles south-west from the city of Agra. Long. 78. 21. E. Lat. 26. 21. N.
