GENTILE, in matters of religion, a pagan, or worshipper of false gods. The origin of this word is deduced from the Jews, who called all those who were not of their name ≡' m i□ gojim, or gentes, which in the Greek translations of the Old Testament is rendered rα tim ; and in this sense it frequently occurs in the New Testament. The Latin church also used gentes in the same sense as gentiles, especially in the New Testament. But the word gentes soon obtained another signification, and no longer meant all such as were not Jew’s, but those only who, being neither Jews nor Christians, followed the superstitions of the Greeks and Romans. In this sense it continued amongst the Christian writers, till their manner of speech, together with their religion, was publicly and by authority received in the empire; and then, in treatises and laws concerning religion, gentiles signified pagans, in opposition to Jews and Christians; and in civil affairs the word was used to signify all such as were not Romans.

Gentile, in Roman law and history, a name which sometimes expresses what the Romans otherwise called barbarians, whether they were allies of Rome or not; but this word was used in a more particular pense to indicate all strangers and foreigners who were not subject to the Roman empire.
