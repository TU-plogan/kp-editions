GORCAH, or Ghoorcah, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Nepaul. It is situated between the 28th and 29th degrees of north latitude, and between the 84th and 85th degrees of east longitude. The country is mountainous and barren, and is intersected by a branch of the Kaly Gunduk river. The territory is principally occupied by the Brahminical and Khebric tribes, though it contains several Rajpoot families. It was formerly ruled by an aristocracy, consisting of thirty heads of families; but about fifty years ago one of their chiefs having gained the ascendency, conquered Nepaul, and became the sovereign of the whole country; since which period the history of this district is merged in that of Nepaul.

Gorcah, or Ghoorca, is the capital of the above-mentioned district. After the conquest of Nepaul in 1768, the seat of government was transferred to Catmandoo; and this place having been neglected, is now gone to decay. Near the city is a considerable mass of rock crystal.
