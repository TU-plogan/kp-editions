GALENIC, or Galenical, in Medicine, is the manner of considering and treating diseases, founded on the principles of Galen, or introduced by Galen.

Galenic is more frequently used as contradistinguished to chemical. The distinction of galenical and chemical was occasioned by a division of the practitioners of medicine into two sects, which happened on the introduction of chemistry into medicine. Then the chemists, arrogating to themselves every kind of merit and ability, stirred up an opposition to their pretensions, founded on the invariable adherence of the other party to the ancient practice; and though this division into the two sects of Galenists and chemists has long since ceased, yet the distinction of medicines which resulted from it is still sometimes observed. Galenical medicines are those which are formed by the easier preparations of herbs and roots, by infusion or decoction, and by combining and multiplying ingredients; whilst those of chemistry derive their more remote virtues from elaborate preparations, as calcination, digestion, fermentation, and the like.
