GOBELIN, Giles, a celebrated French dyer, in the reign of Francis I., who, having discovered a method of dyeing a beautiful scarlet, had his name given to the finest French scarlets. His house, in the suburb of St Marcel at Paris,and the rivulet which he made use of, are still called the Gobelins. An academy for drawing, and a manufactory of fine tapestries, were erected in this quarter in 1666; for which reason the tapestries are called Gobelin.
