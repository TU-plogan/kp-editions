GRACCHUS, Tiberius Sempronius, the son of Tiberius. Gracchus, who had been censor, twice consul, and had triumphed twice. His mother was the celebrated Cornelia, daughter of Scipio Africanus the Elder, and she was left by the death of her husband with the charge of no fewer than twelve children. She lost all except three; one daughter, married to Scipio the Younger, and two sons, Caius and Tiberius. Tiberius was born about 163 B. c. and was murdered 133 b. c. He began early to exhibit proofs of great talents, and his mother appears to have cultivated his mind by every means in her power. He was distinguished from his brother Caius by his mildness of manner and the dignity of his deportment. The language of Tiberius was chaste and polished; that of Caius exhibited more of pretension and splendour. The two brothers, however, were equally attentive to their duty as magistrates, and in their self-government in respect to pleasure they were perfectly alike. Tiberius served his first campaign under Scipio the Younger in Africa (b. c. 146), and made himself much beloved by the army. He was some time afterwards (b. c. 137) appointed quaestor, and attended the consul C. Mancinus in the Numan-tian war. This consul was one of the most unfortunate generals the Romans ever had, and conducted matters so ill that he and his whole army were obliged to submit to conditions of peace imposed by the Numantians. That people refused to treat with any one except Tiberius Gracchus, and he was employed to draw up the articles of peace. The peace, however, was disavowed at Rome, and Mancinus was delivered up to the Numantians naked and in chains. Tiberius was spared, chiefly through the interest and influence of Scipio, his brother-in-law. It was now that Tiberius entered on the stormy path of politics, and the measure which he first advocated was of a magnitude suited to the part he intended to act in the affairs of his country. It was to restrain the avarice of the rich, and to compel them to give up the possession of the public lands, of which they had unjustly become masters. Caius Laelius, the friend of Scipio, had attempted to correct this disorder; but, frightened by the opposition of men in power, he gave up the undertaking. No sooner, however, had Tiberius been elected tribune of the people, than he determined to make an attempt to restore their share of the public lands to the poor. No law could have been of a milder nature than that which he proposed to introduce; for, instead of punishing those who had infringed the rights of the community, they were to receive a sum of money for foregoing their groundless claims. Nothing, however, could induce the rich to listen for a moment to the proposal; and, like all reformers of abuses, he was accused of attempting to throw the country into disorder, and to subvert the constitution of the state. Incensed at this, Tiberius no longer kept on terms with his opponents, but proposed another law of a severer character, which commanded all toquitthe lands which they held contrary to law. This law was confirmed by the people, and three commissioners were appointed to survey the public domain. Tiberius, his brother Caius, and his father-in-law Appius Claudius, received orders to make the survey. If he had contented himself with the passing of this measure, we should have regarded him as a patriot rather than a demagogue; but his position had now become so critical, and his enemies so numerous, that he was urged forward in his career by a regard to his own personal safety rather than by a reference to the good of the republic. In retiring to a private station he would have been exposed to the vengeance of his enemies, and he could not expect to be re-elected tribune, unless by some new proof of his devotion to the popular cause. He therefore proposed laws for shortening the time of military service, and for granting an appeal from the judges to the people. As the bench of judges consisted entirely of senators, he proposed that an equal number of knights and senators should be admitted. On the day when these laws were to be put to the vote, his opponents resolved to create a disturbance, during which they would have an opportunity of putting him to death. Tiberius became acquainted with it during the meeting of the assembly, and as there was great clamour, he had no other way of communicating the information than by touching his head with his hand, to signify the danger he was in. Some one ran to the senate and informed them that Tiberius had demanded a diadem of the people. This excited a great commotion in the senate, and Scipio Nasica rushed out with numerous attendants, and having put the people to flight, killed Tiberius in the Forum. (Plutarch, Life of Tiberius Gracchus ; Liv. Epit. 58.)

Gracchus, Caius Sempronius, was nine years younger than bis elder brother Tiberius, having been born in the year b. c. 154. He had as yet taken no part in public affairs when his brother was murdered, but he soon showed that he did not intend to lead a life of idleness. He cultivated his powers of eloquence, and the senate began to have apprehensions of his succeeding to the power of his brother. They were not therefore sorry when he was appointed quaestor to the consul Aurelius Orestes, b. c. 126, in Sardinia, as it took him away from Rome. He became so great a favourite with the inhabitants of Sardinia, that though they had obtained from the senate an exemption from the burden of clothing his men, he had so much influence with them, that he prevailed on them to send a voluntary supply. On hie return to Rome, whither he repaired contrary to orders, he offered himself a candidate for the tribuneship, and was elected b. c. 123, against the wishes of the nobility. He now brought forward a number of laws to increase the authority of the people, of a nature similar to those which his brother had advocated. He proposed to divide the public lands among the poor, to clothe the soldiers at the public expense, without diminution of their pay, and to give to the Italian allies the right of voting at elections; but his most important measure was, that he took the judicial authority from the patricians, and conferred it on the equestrian order. He took great interest also in the constructing of public roads through Italy, and building granaries. He kept up his influence amongst the people by sending colonies of the poorer citizens to Tarentum and Capua; but the senate, fearing that his power would soon no longer be capable of being controlled, tried to draw the people from him by gratifying them in every thing. Caius however was appointed tribune a second time (b c. 122), without even declaring himself a candidate, and proceeded to Africa to plant a colony at Carthage. During his absence one of his colleagues, Drusus, succeeded in gaining the favour of the people; and this induced Caius to hasten home. The following year the consul Opimius determined to repeal many of the laws which had been passed by Caius; and as the party of the latter mustered in great force, and that of the consul was equally resolute, an engagement took place, in which the friends of Caius were defeated, and he himself killed, to the great grief of the Roman people, whose interests he had laboured to promote. (Plutarch, Life of Caius Gracchus; Liv. Epit. 60, 61.)
