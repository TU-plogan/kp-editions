GANGOUTRI, Î± celebrated place of Hindoo pilgrimage, situated among the Himalaya Mountains, in the province of Serinagur, on the Ganges, which is here not above fifteen or twenty yards broad, with a moderate current, and not in general above three feet deep. The course of the river is here north by east; and on the bank near Gangoutri there is a small temple about eight or ten feet high, in which are two images representing the Ganges and Bhagirathi rivers. The bed of the river adjoining the temple is divided off by the Brahmins into three basins, where the pilgrims bathe. One of these portions is dedicated to Brahma, the other to Vishnu, and the third to Seva. The pilgrimage to Gangoutri is considered as a great achievement of Hindoo piety, and efficacious in washing away all the previous sins of the devotee, and ensuring him eternal happiness in the world to come. The water taken from this sacred spot is exported by pilgrims to India, and sold at a high price; it is drawn under the inspection of a Brahmin, to whom a trifling sum is paid for the privilege of taking it; and the vessels are then sealed. In 1808 Lieutenant Webb and his party approached within sixteen or eighteen miles distance of this consecrated spot. The pilgrims report that the current of the Ganges, only a few miles from this place, issues from under a bed of perpetual snow, where the roads are so bad, that few persons have been able to penetrate to the spot.
