GOOSE. See Ornithology. Goose-Neck, in a ship, a piece of iron fixed on the one end of the tiller, to which the lanyard of the whip-staff or the wheel-rope comes, for steering the ship.

Goose-Wing, in nautical language. When a ship sails before or with a quarter-wind on a fresh gale, to make the more way, a boom and sail are launched out on the leeside, and the sail so fitted is called a goose-toing.
