GOOLPUSSRA, a town or village in the Nepaul dominions. It stands on the skirts of the great forest; and although it is the thoroughfare for most of the merchandise which passes between Nepaul, Benares, Oude, and Patna, over the Cheesapany Mountains, it is but a mean village. The road thence to Becbiacori through the great forest is practicable for wheel-carriages, and there are two or three stations on the way. In the vicinity of thiÎ¹ place is an extensive forest of fine timber, especially ol that kind called saul, next in value to teak, some of the trees of which measure a hundred feet between the branches, and from eight to nine feet in the girth. Long. 85. 10. E. Lat. 27. 1. N.
