QUIRITES, in Roman antiquity. In consequence of the agreement entered into by Romulus, and *Tatius king of the Sabines, Rome was to retain its name, and the people were to be called Quirites, from Cures, the principal town of the Sabines. Dionysius of Halicarnassus says that each particular citizen was to be called Pomanus, and the collective body Quintes; yet it appears by the ancient form of Avoids used at funerals, Ollus Quiris lethÎ¿ datus est, that each private citizen was also called Quiris. The origin of the Avord Quirites has been much sought for; and the most probable account antiquity gives us of it is, that the Avord Quir, or Quiris, signified in the Sabine language a dart and a warlike deity armed with a dart. It is uncertain whether the god gave name to the dart, or the dart to the god.
