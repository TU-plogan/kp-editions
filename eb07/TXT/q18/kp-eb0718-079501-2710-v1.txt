QUINTILIANS, a sect of ancient heretics, who were so called from their prophetess Quintilia, In this sect the women [7:18:796] were admitted to perform the sacerdotal and episcopal functions. They attributed extraordinary gifts to Eve for having first eaten of the tree of knowledge; and told great things of Mary the sister of Moses, as having been a prophetess; adding, that Philip the deacon had four daughters, who were all prophetesses, and were of their sect. In these assemblies it was usual to see the virgins entering in white robes, and personating prophetesses.
