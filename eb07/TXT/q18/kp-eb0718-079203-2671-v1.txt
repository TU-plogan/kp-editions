QUILOA is the name of a kingdom of Eastern Africa, situated to the north of Mozambique. The island of Quiloa, which appears to constitute the principal part of the sovereignty, lies opposite a peninsula formed by two great rivers, the most important of whieh is called Coavo. This situation confers on it the accommodation of three safe and spacious ports. It is accessible at all times, and forms the mart for the trade of slaves of the whole coast of Zanguebar; but the king is compelled to yield half of the profits to the powerful schick of the island of Zanzibar, who appoints a vizier to look after his rights. Indeed the negro monarch enjoys little more than a nominal sovereignty; for the viceroy of Zanzibar, generally a Moor, keeps him in a state of tutelage, and rules supremely in his name. The continent produces a species of teak-wood, as durable as that from Surat, of the greatest beauty, and well adapted for ship-building. The sugar-eane, cotton-tree, and indigo, are indigenous to the soil. The gigantic baobab, the tamarind, the cedar, the tree which yields gum-copal, and the coffee-plant of Madagascar, arc also found here. Game, and herds of every species of wild animal, particularly the wild ox, as well as river and sea-fish, are abundant. Lions, panthers, elephants, and other formidable tenants of the forest or the desert, often visit the banks of the two rivers for the purpose of quenching their thirst. These banks are ornamented by large trees, interspersed with villages subject to the authority of the king of Quiloa. Fruits and vegetables are scarce, and millet forms the principal food of the natives. The women cultivate millet and potatoes from custom and necessity; and some also make mats and coarse stuffs for their own use. Hunting or fishing forms the ehief employment of the male part of the population. The chief town of the island, whieh bςars the same name, was the capital of Eastern Africa, when first visited by the Portuguese in [7:18:793] the beginning of the sixteenth century. They succeeded in establishing themselves, but were at last driven out by the Imam of Muscat. There are but few traces of its ancient splendour and power now remaining. Long. 39.47. E. Lat. 8. 41.
