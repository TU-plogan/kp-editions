QUANGTONG, a large and populous province in the south of China, bounded on the east and south by the China Sea. Along the sea-coast the country is flat and extremely fertile, producing every species of grain, of which it yields two crops in the year. The northern frontier, by which it is separated from the province of Quangsee, consists of a range of high mountains, which produce gold, copper, and iron; and also a remarkable species of timber called ironwood, from its resemblance in its properties, namely, its colour, weight, and hardness, to that metal. A beautiful species of rosewood is also found here; and in many parts an osier, the shoots of which spread along the ground, resembling twisted cords, and are so tough and pliable that they may be [7:18:775]formed into baskets, chairs, and other pieces of furniture, and even serve for cables and ropes. Quangtong is considered as one of the most important provinces of the empire; it is well situated for trade, and, amongst numerous other ports, contains Canton, by which all the commerce between China and Europe is now carried on. The mountains on the northern frontier form the Only interruption to the navigable communication between Pekin andUanton. The goods being transported across the mountains by land-carriage, are embarked upon the river of Canton, and thus conveyed by water to this great emporium. The population of this province is estimated by Sir George Staunton at 21,000,000. The governor maintains a respectable naval and military force for the suppression of piracy, as well as for overawing the rude tribes of the adjacent mountains.

Quangtong, a town of the Birman empire, in the province of Ava, being situated on the Irrawaddy River, twenty-five miles from the frontiers of China. The meaning of the word Quangtong, or Canton, being a port or mart, numerous towns of this name are found in the vicinity of the Chinese empire; and it is likely that the town in question was either named or built by them. It is frequented by Chinese merchants, who bring thither tea, porcelain, silks, rubies, iron, and cotton. One of the staple commodities is the brown cotton of which nankeens are made. Under a liberal commercial policy it might become a mart for European goods. Long. 96. 55. E. Lat. 24. 2. N.
