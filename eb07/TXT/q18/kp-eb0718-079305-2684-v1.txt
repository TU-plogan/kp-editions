QUINAUT, Philip, a celebrated French poet, born of a good family, at Paris, in 1635. He cultivated poetry from his infancy, and sixteen dramatic pieces of his were acted between the years 1653 and 1666. In the mean time, Quinaut was not so much devoted to poetry but that he applied himself to the study of the law, and made his fortune by marrying the widow of a rich merchant to whom he had been useful in his profession. Quinaut afterwards turned his attention to the composing of operas, which were set to music by Lully, who was charmed with a poet whose verses were not too nervous to yield to the capricious airs of music. He died in 1688, after having for many years enjoyed a handsome pension from Louis XIV.; and he was extremely penitent in his last illness for all those of his compositions which tended to inspire love and pleasure.
