QUOTIENT, in Arithmetic, the number resulting from the division of a greater number by a smaller, and which shows how often the smaller is contained in the greater, or how often the divisor is contained in the dividend. The word is formed from the Latin quoties, which is as much as to say or ask, how often is such a number contained in such another. See Arithmetic.
