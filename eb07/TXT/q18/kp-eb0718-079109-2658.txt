QUICK-MATCH, amongst artillerymen, a kind of combustible preparation, formed of three cotton strands, drawn into length, and dipped in a boiling composition of white-wine vinegar, saltpetre, and mealed powder. After this immersion it is taken out hot, and laid in a trough, where some mealed powder, moistened with spirits of wine, is thoroughly incorporated into the twists of the cotton, by rolling it about therein. Thus prepared, they are taken out separately, and drawn through mealed powder; then hung upon a line and dried, after which they are fit for immediate service.
