QUINTAL, the weight of 100 lbs. in most countries, but in England it is the cwt. or 112 lbs. Quintal was formerly used for a weight of lead, iron, or other common metal, usually equal to 100 lbs. at six scores to the hundred.

'QÜINTETTO (English, Quintet), in music, a composition for five voices, or for five instruments, each of which is obbligato. The remarks that have been made upon the construction of .the quartette apply generally to that of the quintette. Amongst the finest instrumental quintettos are those of Boccherini, Mozart, Beethoven, and Onslow. The best that have been composed for wind-instruments only, are A∙ Reicha’s for flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon.
