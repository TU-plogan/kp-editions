QUILLET, Claude, an eminent Latin poet of the seventeenth century, was born at Chinon, in Touraine, and practised physic there with reputation; but having declared against the pretended possession of the nuns of Loudun, in a manuscript treatise, the original of which was deposited in the library of the Sorbonne, he was obliged to retire into Italy, where he beeame secretary to the Marshal d’Estrées, the French ambassador at Rome. In 1655, Quillet having published in Holland a Latin poem, entitled Callipaedia, under the name of Galvidius Laetus, he there inserted some verses against the Cardinal Mazarin and his family; butthat cardinal making him some gentle reproaches, he retrenched what related to the cardinal in another edition, and dedicated it to him, Mazarin having, before it was printed, given him an abbey. He died in 1661, aged fifty-nine, after having given Menage all his writings, and five hundred crowns to pay the expense of printing them; but the Abbé took the money and papers, and published none of them. His Callipaedia has been translated into English verse.
