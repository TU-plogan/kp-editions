QUICK or Quickset Hedge, amongst gardeners, denotes all live hedges, of whatever sort of plants they are composed, to distinguish them from dead hedges; but in a more limited sense of the word, it is restricted to those planted with the haw thorn, under which name the young plants or sets are sold by the nursery-gardeners, who raise them for sale.
