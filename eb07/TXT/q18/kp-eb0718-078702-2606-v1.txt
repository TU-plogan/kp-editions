QEENSFERRY, South, a royal burgh and parish in the county of Linlithgow, Scotland. It is situated on the south side of the Frith of Forth, nine miles west from Edinburgh, and consists of one irregular street of a mean appearance, from which branch various narrow alleys. The town is a place of considerable antiquity, having been in early times a burgh of regality, held under the abbey of Dunfermline. It obtained the privileges of a burgh of regality from Malcolm IV., which were confirmed by David II. and afterwards by Charles I.; and in the year [7:18:788] 1633 the burgh sent its first commissioner to the Scottish parliament. In 1641, by act of parliament, it was dismembered from the parish of Dalmeny, and erected into a separate parish. Before the union it possessed a considerable trade, but what it now has depends on a soap-work, a brewery, and a distillery. The regular ferry is at Newhall, a little to the east of the town, where the frith contracts to one and a half mile in breadth. It is under the direction of trustees; and, in addition to the sail-boats, a steam-vessel, carrying the mail, plies regularly at all times of the tide. There are at both sides low-water piers, on which the passengers are landed, and excellent inns for their accommodation. The revenue of the burgh is about L.88, arising from customs, anchorages, shore-dues, and other small items; and its permanent expenditure is L.70. 2s. The revenue for 1837-38 amounted to L.135. It is governed by a provost, three bailies, a treasurer, a dean of guild, and fifteen councillors, and, with Culross, Dunfermline, Inverkeithing, and Stirling, returns a member to parliament. The population in the year 1821 amounted to 690, and in 1831 to 684.
