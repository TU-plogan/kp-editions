QUINTIN Matsys, called also the Farrier of Antwerp, famous for being transformed, by the force of love, from a blacksmith to a painter. He had followed the trade of a blacksmith and farrier for nearly twenty years; when, falling in love with a painterâ€™s daughter who was very handsome, and disliked nothing but his trade, he quitted it, and betook himself to painting, in which he made very great progress. He was a diligent and careful imitator of ordinary life, and succeeded better in representing the defects than the beauties of nature. Some historical performances of this master deserve commendation, particularly a Descent from the Cross, in the cathedral at Antwerp; but his best known picture is that of the two Misers in the gallery at Windsor. He died in the year 1529.
