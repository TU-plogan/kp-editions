QUENTIN, St, an arrondissement of the department of the Aisne, in France. It extends over 430 square miles, comprising ten cantons, divided into 121 communes, with 91,200 inhabitants. The capital is a city of the same name, situated on a hill, at the foot of which flows the Somme, which is joined by two inland canals. It is strongly fortified, and has a fine old cathedral and good market-place, 1650 houses, and 10,740 inhabitants, who have been long celebrated for their fabrics of fine linens, especially cambrics and lawns, and thread-lace. These trades have, however, of late years declined, the manufactures of cotton have been substituted, and, now that spinning-mills have been at work, many muslins and fine calicoes are produced. Near this city was fought, in 1557, a great battle between the French and Spaniards. Long. 3. 12. 18. E. Lat. 49. 50. 51. N.
