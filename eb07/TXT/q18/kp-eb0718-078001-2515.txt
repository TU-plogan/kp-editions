QUARANTINE is a trial which ships must undergo when suspected of pestilential infection. It may be ordered by the king, with advice of the privy-council, at such times, and under such regulations, as he judges proper. Ships ordered on quarantine must repair to the place appointed, and continue there during the time prescribed; and they must have no intercourse with the shore, except for necessary provisions, which are conveyed with every possible precaution. When the time is expired, and the goods have been opened and exposed to the air as directed, if there be no appearance of infection, they arc admitted to pork See Plague.
