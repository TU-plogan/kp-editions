QUINTUS Calaber, a Greek poet, who wrote a large supplement to Homer’s Iliad, in fourteen books, in which a relation is given of the Trojan war from the death of Hector to the destruction of Troy. It is conjectured, from his style and manner, that he lived in the fifth century. Nothing certain can be collected either concerning his person or country. His poem was first made known by Cardinal Bessarion, who discovered it in St Nicholas’s Church, near Otranto, in Calabria; and hence the author was named Quintus Calaber. It was first published at Venice by Aldus, but it is not stated in what year.
