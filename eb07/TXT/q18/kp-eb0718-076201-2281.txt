Q or q, the sixteenth letter and twelfth consonant of our alphabet, but one not to be found either in the Greek, old Latin, or Saxon alphabets; and indeed some would entirely exclude it, pretending that k ought to be used wherever this occurs. But as it is formed by the voice in a different manner, it is undoubtedly a distinct letter; for, in expressing this sound, the cheeks are contracted, and the lips, particularly the under one, are put into a canular form, for the passage of the breath.

The q is never sounded alone, but in conjunction with u, as in quality, question, quite, quote, and the like, and never ends any English word. As a numeral, Q stands for 500; and with a dash over it, thus, Q, for 500,000. Used as an abbreviature, q signifies quantity or quantum. Thus, amongst physicians, q. pl. is quantum placet, as much as you please; and q. s. is quantum sufficit, as much as is necessary. Q.E.D. amongst mathematicians, is quod erat demonstrandum, which was to be demonstrated; and Q. E. F. is quod erat faciendum, which was to be done. Q. D. amongst grammarians is quasi dictum, as if it were said, or, as who should say. In the notes of the ancients, Q stands for Quintus or Quintius ; Q. B. V. for quod bene vertat ; Q. S. S∙ S. for quae supra scripta sunt ; Q. Μ. for Quintus Mutius, or quomodo ; Quint, for Quintilius ; and Quaes. for quaestor.
