QUILLOTA, a province of the republic of Chili, in South America, about twenty-five leagues in length from north to south, and nearly twenty-one leagues in breadth from east to west. It is rich in metallic ores, and also very productive in an agricultural point of view. All kinds of grain and vines are here cultivated, and the hemp and honey of the province are much esteemed. The capital, St Martin de la Coucha, or Quillota, is built upon a fertile valley on the banks of the Aeoueagua, one of the rivers whieh descend from the western declivities of the Andes, and flow into the ocean. It contains about 8000 inhabitants, and is situated about one hundred miles north-west from Santiago. The population of the whole province is estimated at between forty and fifty thousand.
