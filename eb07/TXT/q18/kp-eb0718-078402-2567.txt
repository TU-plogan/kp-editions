QUEDA, or Quedah, a country of Asia, and a Malay principality, situated on the west coast, between the fifth and eighth degrees of north latitude, immediately opposite to Prince of Wales Island. It extends about 150 miles along the coast, between 5° 10' and 7° 30' of north latitude, and stretches inland from twenty to twenty-five miles. Along the shore, for a distance of about twenty-four leagues, there arc numerous islands, that shelter the coast, which is low and covered with woods. The water, to a great distance from the shore, is extremely shallow, with sand-banks, so that ships are obliged to anchor at a great distance from the shore. Twenty-three rivers, all deep enough for prows, and some for larger vessels, empty themselves into the sea. The [7:18:785]town is called Queda by strangers. It is situated in latitude 6° north, upon one of the largest rivers, which is navigable-for vessels of 300 tons burden, and is 300 yards in width at the mouth, where was formerly a brick fort, now in ruins. The entrance into this river is choked up by a flat mud-bank, over which, at spring tides, there is only nine feet water. The road where the ships anchor is about two leagues from the shore. The town of Queda formerly contained about 300 houses, inhabited by Chinese, Chulias, and Malays; and it enjoyed a considerable trade; but since the establishment of Pulo Pinang, the Malay prows have chiefly resorted to the latter place. Allistar, seven miles up the river, is the residence of the king, to which place all vessels can ascend when their draught enables them to pass the bar. The river here is narrow, but deep; and both shores are muddy, swampy, and covered with jungle. A little above Allistar the ground rises, and the river is then only navigable for prows. There are in the interior tin-mines, the produce of which is conveyed to the coast by the Qualla Moorba, a rapid and shallow stream, yet navigable for small craft. The exports of this district consist of elephants’ teeth, wax, See., but principally tin, which are chiefly exchanged for opium and Spanish dollars. The king, as in most of these eastern countries, engrosses the chief share of the trade. In 1786 an agreement was made with the king of Queda for the cession of Pulo Pinang or Prince of Wales Island; and in 1792 a regular treaty was concluded on the subject, by which the East India Company agreed to pay 6000 dollars annually whilst they retained possession of the island. A new treaty was made in 1802, for the cession of additional territory, which tract of country the company engaged to protect from all enemies, robbers, and pirates. The free exportation of provisions and other articles to Prince of Wales Island was also agreed on, besides a clause for the apprehension and delivery of insurgents, felons, debtors, and slaves; in consideration of which the company agreed to pay 10,000 dollars annually, as long as they held possession of the island and the coast.
