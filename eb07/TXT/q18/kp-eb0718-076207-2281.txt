QUADRANTAL, in Antiquity, the name of a vessel in use amongst the Romans for the measuring of liquids. It was at first denominated amphora ; and afterwards quadran tal, from its form, which was square every way like a die. In capacity it contained eighty librae or pounds of water, which made forty-eight sextaries, two urnae, or eight congii.
