QUARTATION is an operation by which the quantity of one thing is made equal to a fourth part of the quantity of another thing. Thus when gold alloyed with silver is to be parted, we are obliged to facilitate the action of the aquafortis, by reducing the quantity of the former of these metals to one fourth part of the whole mass; which is done by sufficiently increasing the quantity of the silver, if it be necessary. This operation is called quartation, and is preparatory to the parting; and many authors even extend this name to the operation of parting.
