QUARTERING, in Heraldry, is dividing a coat into four or more quarters or quarterings, by parting, couping, and otherwise, that is, by perpendicular and horizontal lines.

QUARTO-Decimans, an ancient sect in the Christian church, who taught that Easter should always be celebrated according to the custom of the Jews, on the fourteenth day of the moon in the month of March, whensoever that day might fall out; and hence they derived their name, quarto-decimani, or fourteenth-men. The Asiatics were mightily attached to this opinion, pretending that it was built on the authority of St John, their apostle; and Pope Victor could never bring them to obedience in this article, though he was upon the point of excommunicating them.
