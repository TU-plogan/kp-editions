TAY, in Latin Tavus or Taus, the largest river in Scotland, rises in Braidalbane, on the frontiers of Lorne, and having in the passage of a few miles augmented its stream by the accession of several small rills, spreads itself into the lake called Loch Dochart, out of which having run but a little space, it again expands itself. Leaving this second lake, it rolls some miles with a considerable body of water, and then diffuses itself in the spacious Loch Tay; which, reckoning from the sources of the river, is twenty-four miles in length, though, strictly speaking, the lake is but thirteen. Almost as soon as it issues from hence, it receives the river Lyon, coming out of Loch Lyon, and running through Glen Lyon. The Lyon, having travelled in a manner parallel to it, from its source, for a space of twenty-five miles, at length joins the Tay as it enters Athole, which it next traverses, and, directing its course towards the east, receives almost all the waters of that country. Bending then to the south, at the distance of six miles it reaches Dunkeld; which, in the language of our ancestors, signifies “the hill of hazels,” and was the very centre of the old Caledonia. Here the river is very broad. Declining still to the south-east, with a winding course, for above twelve miles, the Tay receives a large supply of waters from the county of Angus; and then running south-west for eight miles more, is joined in that space by several rivers, the most considerable of which is the Almond. Turning then to the south-east, at the distance of about three miles, this copious river comps with a swelling stream to Perth. The Tay, continuing still a south-east course, receives, a few miles below Perth, the river Erne, which, issuing from a loch of the same name, traverses the district of Stratherne, and passes by Abernethy, once the capital of the Pictish kingdom. Swelled by the waters of this last river, the Tay, running next directly east, enlarges itself till it becomes about three miles broad; but contracts again before the town of Dundee; soon after which it opens into the German Ocean. At the entrance of the firth, there are sands both on the north and on the south side; the former styled Goa, the latter Aberlay and Drumlan, and, in the very mouth of the firth, those which are called the Cross Sands. At Buttonness, which is the northern promontory, there are two light-houses. The space between the north and the south sands may be nearly a mile, with about three fathoms water; but being within the firth, it grows deeper, and in the road of Dundee is full six fathoms. The Firth of Tay is not indeed so large or so commodious as that of Forth, but from Buttonness to Perth it is not less than forty miles; and the whole might, without any great impropriety, be styled a harbour, which has Fife on one side, and the shires of Perth and Forfar on the other.
