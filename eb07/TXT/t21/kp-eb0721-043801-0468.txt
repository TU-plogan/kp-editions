TYRHOOT, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Bahar, principallysituated between the 27th and 28th degrees of N. lat. On the north it is bounded by the districts of Moc-wanpoor and Muchwany, which are subject to Nepaul; on the south it has Hajypoor and Boghpoor; to the east, the Bengal district of Purneah; and on the west, Bettiah and Hajypoor. It is estimated to contain 5033 square miles. The surface, though not hilly, is more elevated, the soil drier, and the climate generally healthier, than those more to the south; although during summer it is liable to intense heats. It is well adapted for the breed of horses; and many of these valuable animals have accordingly been reared in this and the adjoining district of Hajypoor, to purchase which numerous horse-dealers from upper Hindustan have resorted to the fairs. The district is well cultivated, and produces grain, sugar, and indigo. Towards the northern frontier are extensive forests; but the timber cannot be floated down, owing to the want of water. The names of the rivers are, the Little Gunduck, the Bhagmati,and the Gogary. Along with the rest of the province, it devolved to the British, and was permanently attached in 1794, since which period it has improved greatly in population, cultivation, and commerce, large tracts of jungle having been brought into cultivation by the zemindars. In 1801. according to a census ordered by Marquis Wellesley, the inhabitants amounted to 2,000,000, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to four Hindus.
