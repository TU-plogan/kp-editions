TOLAND, J ohn, a well-known writer, was born near Londonderry, in Ireland, in 1670, and educated in the Popish religion, but at sixteen years of age embraced the principles of the Protestants. He studied three years in the university of Glasgow; took the degree of A. M. in that of Edinburgh; and afterwards completed his studies at Leyden, where he resided two years. He then went to Oxford, where, having the advantage of the public library, he collected materials upon various subjects, and composed some pieces; among which was, a dissertation to prove the received history of the tragical death of Atilius Regulus, the Roman consul, to be a fable. He began likewise a work of greater consequence, in which he undertook to show that there are no mysteries in the Christian religion. He published it in 1696, at London, under the title of Christianity not Mysterious. This book gave great offence, and was attacked by several writers. He afterwards wrote in favour of the Hanoverian succession, and many other pieces. In 1707 he went into Germany, where he visited several courts; and in 1710 he was introduced to Prince Eugene, who bestowed upon him several marks of his generosity. Upon his return to England, he was for some time supported by the liberality of the earl of Oxford, lord-treasurer, and kept a country house at Epsom; but soon losing his lordship’s favour, he published several pamphlets against that minister’s measures. During the last four years of his life he lived at Putney, but used to spend most part of the winter in the metropolis. He died at London in 1722. He was a man of uncommon abilities, published a number of curious tracts, and was perhaps the most learned of all the infidel writers; but his private character was far from being an amiable one, for he was extremely vain, and wanted those social virtues which are the chief ornaments as well as duties of life. Four years after his death, appeared “A Collection of several Pieces of Mr John Toland, now first published from his original manuscripts: with some memoirs of his life and writings.” Lond. 1726, 2 vols. 8vo. The memoirs were written by Des Maizeaux. The first volume includes a History of the Druids, extending to 228 pages.
