TULA, a province of European Russia, extending in east longitude from 35° 49' to 38° 45' and in north latitude from 52° 53' to 54° 56', and comprehending 11,997 square miles. It is generally a level district, with a few undulations; there are no lofty hills, very few forests, and no large lakes. It is chiefly drained by the river which conies from the province of Kaluga, and enters that of Moscow, and sometimes by overflowing inundates a great extent of land. The climate is healthy, and much milder than that of the adjoining province of Moscow. It is chiefly an agricultural country, yielding abundance of corn, but the growth of rye very far exceeds that of wheat. Of each description of grain there is a yearly surplus for exportation. The population amounts to 1,393,700 persons, all of the Greek church, except a few Germans established in or near the cities. The province is divided into twelve circles.

Tula, a city of Russia, the capital of a circle and of a province of its name. It is 606 miles from St Petersburg, and stands at the junction of the river Upa with the Tuliza. It is in part surrounded with a wall, is very antique, with crooked and narrow streets, and houses chiefly built of wood. It is the seat of a Greek bishop, whose diocese comprehends the whole province, as well as that of Kaluga. It has twentyeight churches, a seminary for ecclesiastical education, a public college for the education of nobles, about 4000 houses, and 38,000 inhabitants. Among its establishments of manufactories, the most prominent is that of the emperor for the fabrication of arms of every description, which employs near 500 workmen, and provides arms and equipments for more than 15,000 men yearlv.
