TROMP, Martin Happertz Vax, a celebrated Dutch admiral, was born at the Baille, in Holland. He raised himself by his merit, after having distinguished himself on many occasions, especially at the famous engagement near Gibraltar in 1607. He passed for one of the greatest seamen who till that time bad appeared in the world; and was declared admiral of Holland, even by the advice of the prince of Orange. In that character he defeated a large Spanish fleet in 1630, and gained thirty-two other victories at sea; but was killed when under deck, in an engagement with the English, in 1653.
