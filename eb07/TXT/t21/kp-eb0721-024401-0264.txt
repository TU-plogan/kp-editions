THIRLWALL, a hamlet within the parish of Haltwhistle, in the west division of the ward of Tindal, in the county of Northumberland. It is remarkable from being situated on the Pictsâ€™ wall, at the place where the Scots made gaps to force a passage into England. It has an ancient castle built on the north side of the wall, about twenty yards long and twelve broad, with walls nine feet thick. It is curiously vaulted underneath, and on the top are six small turrets. Though this place had in 1831 only 328 inhabitants, they have rapidly increased, and are still increasing, in consequence of the railway from Carlisle to Newcastle, which passes by it, and from the extensive fields of coal which are in its neighbourhood.
