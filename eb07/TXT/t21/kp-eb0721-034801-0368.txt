Lords of the Treasury. In lieu of one single director and administrator of the sovereign’s revenues under the title of lord high treasurer, it is at present thought proper to put that office in commission, i.e. to appoint several persons to discharge it, with equal authority, under the title of Lords commissioners of the Treasury. Treasury Islands, a small group, consisting of five or six islands of very unequal size, forming part of Solomon’s Islands. They are low, and covered with trees. That on the north is the lowest. Its middle is in long. 155. 29. E. Lat. 7. 23. S.
