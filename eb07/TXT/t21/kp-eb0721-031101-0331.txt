TIMOR, East, the largest and southernmost of the Molucca Isles, intersected by the ninth degree of south latitude, and extending obliquely in a north-east and south-east direction. In length it is 250 miles, and from thirty to sixty in breadth. It is mountainous in the interior, the ridge by which it is intersected rising as high as the Peak of Teneriffe; while the south-east shores are exceedingly low, and overrun with mangroves. Gold, washed down from the mountains, is said to be found in the streams; but the natives are represented as extremely jealous of the researches of Europeans; and a body of Dutch sent into the interior on an exploring expedition was cut off by them. The chief products of the island are sandal-wood and bees’ wax. Another article of export is biche de mer or sea-slug, which is partly procured near the island, and partly fished on the coast of New Holland, and brought to this island for sale. The bread-fruit tree grows here in great luxuriance, as does also mountain rice. Sandal-wood, bees’ wax, honey, and slaves, are exported; and rice, arrack, sugar, tea, coffee, betel-nut, and the manufactures of China, with some from India and Europe, are received in return. The Dutch established themselves in this island at Coepang in 1630. Their territory did not extend beyond four or five miles round Fort Concordia. During the war which terminated in 1801, the communication with Batavia was interrupted, and the town was taken by the English. When Captain Flinders visited the island in 1803, he saw only two European residents at Coepang, besides the soldiers and the governor. The original inhabitants retain the mountains of the interior, to which they have been driven by the Malays, who possess the sea-coast. Some attempts have been made by the Dutch to establish Christianity, but with little success, the inhabitants remaining mostly in their original ignorance.
