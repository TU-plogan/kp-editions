TROUBADOURS, poets that flourished in Provence during the middle ages. They wrote poems on love and gallantry; on the illustrious characters and remarkable events of the times; satires, which were chiefly directed against the clergy and monks; and a few didactic pieces. The troubadours were great favourites in different courts, diffused a taste for their language and for poetry over Europe, which was about that time sunk in ignorance and rudeness. An “Histoire des Troubadours,” in 3 vols. 12mo, was published by Millot; but it has been entirely superseded by the more recent labours of Raynouard and Dies.
