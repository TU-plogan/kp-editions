TRAFALGAR, a cape on the coast of Spain, just without the Straits of Gibraltar, and opposite to Cape Esparto on the African shore. It was called by the ancients the promontory of Juno. It is in latitude 36° 10' 15" north, and longitude 6° 1' 30" west. It is not high, but may be known by its remarkable figure, being flat, and terminating with two sharp corners or angles, near to which is a round tower. To the eastward of this flat the land is very uneven, and indeed mountainous. This spot is remarkable from the great naval victory achieved near it on the 21st October 1805.
