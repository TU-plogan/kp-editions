TIRHOOT, an extensive district of Hindustan, province of Bahar, situated principally between the 27th and 28th degrees of north latitude. It is generally well cultivated, and productive of grain, sugar, indigo, tobacco, opium, and of late years has bred numbers of horses and cattle. Towards the northern frontier it possesses extensive forests, but unfortunately no rivers to float the timber to the Ganges. It came into the possession of the British in 1765. Its population is estimated at 2,000,000, in the proportion of three Hindoos to one Mahommedan.
