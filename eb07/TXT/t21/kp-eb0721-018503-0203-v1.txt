TERM, in Grammar, denotes some word or expression in a language. The word term, terminus, is borrowed metaphorically, by the grammarians and philosophers, from the measurers or surveyors of lands: as a field is defined and distinguished by its termini, or limits, so is a thing or matter by the word or term by which it is denoted.

Term, in Law, is generally taken for a limitation of time or estate; as, a lease for a term of life or years. Term, however, is more particularly used for the time when the English courts of justice are open; in opposition to which, the rest of the year is called vacation.
