TREASON, a general appellation to denote not only offences against the king and government, but also that accumulation of guilt which arises whenever a superior reposes a confidence in a subject or inferior, between whom and himself there subsists a natural, a civil, or even a spiritual relation; and the inferior so abuses that confidence, so forgets the obligations of duty, subjection, and allegiance, as to destroy the life of any such superior or lord. Hence treason is of two kinds, high and petty. High Treason, or Treason Paramount (which is equivalent to the crimen loesoe majestatis of the Romans, as Glanville denominates it also in the English law), is an offence committed against the security of the king or kingdom, whether by imagination, word, or deed. In order to prevent the inconveniences which arose in England from a multitude of constructive treasons, the statute 25 Edw. III. c. 2, was made; which defines what offences only for the future should be held to be treason.

Petty or Petit Treason, according to the statute 25 Edward III. c. 2, may happen three ways: by a servant killing his master, a wife her husband, or an ecclesiastical person (either secular or regular) his superior, to whom he owes faith and obedience.
