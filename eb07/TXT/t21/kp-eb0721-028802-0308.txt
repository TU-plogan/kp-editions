TILBURG, a city of the Netherlands, in the province of North Brabant. It has been only of late years raised from the class of towns to that of cities. It stands on the river Lay, in a healthy district, chiefly flourishing by the extension of its manufactures, which provide fine broad clothe, casimeres, common cloths, beavers, and military cloth. In 1833 it contained 11,726 inhabitants, most of of them adhering to the Romish church.
