TREBISOND, a considerable trading city of Asia Minor, on the coast of the Black Sea. It is of an oblong shape, and occupies a slope gently rising from the sea. The houses are mostly built of stone and lime. They are roofed with small red tiles, and are mean in their outward appearance and comfortless within. It carries on a considerable trade; and the principal exports are silk and cotton stuff’s manufactured by the inhabitants, also fruit and wine. The imports are sugar, coffee, and woollen cloths from Constantinople; corn, salt, and iron from the Crimea and Mingrelia. It contains eighteen large mosques, eight khans, five baths, and ten small Greek churches, governed by a metropolitan. But the most curious edifice in the city is a huge structure, with two small windows on each face. It is supposed to have been erected for a powder magazine. On the east and west the city is defended by two deep ravines, connected by a ditch cut in the rock behind the castle. The ancient ramparts of the city, which are built of stone, are in general very lofty. At the southern extremity of Trebisond is the citadel, which commands a full view of the city and environs. Behind the city, rise mountains of a moderate elevation, which are in a high state of cultivation, producing barley, flax, and wine. The population of Trebisond amounts to 15,000, and consists of a mixture of Turks, Greeks, Jews, Armenians, Georgians, Mingrelians, Circassians, and Tartars. Long. 39. 43. E. Lat. 37. 23. N.
