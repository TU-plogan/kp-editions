TINE, an island of Turkey, on the western side of the Archipelago, separated from Andros by a channel three quarters of a mile across. It is about ninety square miles in extent, and contains about 16,000 inhabitants, who cultivate the land with great care. It yields corn, pulse, cheese, and fruits; but the product which affords the greatest employment is the breeding of silk-worms and the winding of silk. Although naturally sterile and rocky, it is more productive than any of the islands in its vicinity. Long. 25. 14. E. Lat. 37. 50. N.
