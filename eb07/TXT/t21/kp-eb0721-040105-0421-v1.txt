TÜBINGEN, a city of the kingdom of Wirtemberg, in the circle of the Black Forest, the capital of a surrounding bailiwick of the same name. It stands at the junction of the river Ammer with the Neckar, and is enclosed by walls and ditches, and has a castle, called the Pfalz, which contains many antiquities and curiosities. There are four churches, 880 houses, and, in 1830, 7220 inhabitants, some of whom are employed in making hosiery goods. Tübingen is chiefly an object of interest on account of its university, which has long been celebrated for the number of eminent scholars that it has produced. Many of the professors in the other German universities have been students at Tübingen. The branches of study pursued are, theology both Catholic and Protestant, jurisprudence, medicine in all its branches, philology, philosophy, and agriculture. There are two hospitals, an anatomical theatre, an observatory, a veterinary school, a chemical elaboratory, and several collections of natural history, with a library of more than 30,000 volumes, besides valuable manuscripts. The students amounted in 1831 to 887. They board among the inhabitants at very cheap rates. Long. 8. 58. 16. E. Lat. 48. 31. 9. N.
