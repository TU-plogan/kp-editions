THETIS, in Pagan mythology, the wife of Oceanus, and the mother of Nereus and Doris, who were married to each other; and from this marriage sprung the nymphs of the earth and sea. Among the sea-nymphs there was one named Thetis the younger, who excelled all the rest in beauty, and for whom Jupiter conceived such a passion, that he resolved to espouse her; but being informed by the Destinies that she would bring forth a son who would rise above his father, he married her to Peleus. To their nuptials all the gods and goddesses were invited except Discord, who, to be revenged for this contempt, threw a golden apple into the assembly, on which was engraven, For the Fairest. Juno, Pallas, and Venus, disputed for this apple; but Paris being chosen to decide the difference, adjudged it to Venus. From this marriage of Thetis and Peleus sprung Achilles.
