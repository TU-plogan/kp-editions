TOGA, in Roman antiquity, a wide woollen gown or mantle, which seems to have been of a semicircular form, without sleeves; differing both in richness and largeness, according to the circumstances of the wearer, and used only upon occasion of appearing in public. Every body knows that the toga was the distinguishing mark of a Roman. Hence the jus togae, or privilege of a Roman citizen, i.e. the right of wearing a Roman habit, and of taking, as they explain it, fire and water through the Roman empire.
