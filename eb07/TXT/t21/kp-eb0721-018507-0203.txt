TERMINUS, in Pagan worship, an ancient deity among the Romans, who presided over the stones or land-marks, called termini, which were held so sacred that it was accounted sacrilege to move them; and as the criminal became devoted to the gods, it was lawful for any man to kill him. The worship of this deity was instituted by Numa Pompilius, who, to render land-marks, and consequently the property of the people, sacred, erected a temple on the Tarpeian Mount to Terminus.
