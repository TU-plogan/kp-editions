TURON Bay, a fine bay of Cochin-China, on which is situated Faifo, the capital and principal scat of commerce in the country. The adjacent district is remarkably fertile and beautiful. The channel into this bay is round the north-east end of the Hansan peninsula, having an island to the north. All the coast is safe to approach, the water shoaling gradually from twenty to seven fathoms. Cape Turon, in long. 108° 15' east, and lat. 16° 5' north, forms its eastern extremity, in which Turon Island, situated six miles to the north, makes an excellent harbour, where vessels are sheltered from all winds. At the southern extremity of this harbour is the mouth of the river which leads to the city of Turon. It is about 200 yards wide, with about two fathoms depth. The town of Turon stands about a mile above the mouth of the river, and, as well as the peninsula, harbour, and river, is named by the natives Hansan. The houses which it contains are low, and mostly built of bamboos. The ruins of some better houses are still visible. the port was anciently the chief mart for the trade of Cochin-China with the Chinese empire and Japan; but prior to 1793, when it was visited by Lord Macartney, the city of Turon had suffered greatly by civil wars, and was surrounded by extensive masses of ruins. The vessels that resort thither are either junks from different parts of China, or craft belonging to the Portuguese of Macao.
