TRONAGE, an ancient customary duty or toll, for the weighing of wool. According to Fleta, trona is a beam to weigh with, mentioned in the stat. Westm. 2, cap. 25. And tronage was used for the weighing of wool in a staple or public mart, by a common trona or beam; which, for the tronage of wool in London, was fixed at Leadenhall. The mayor and commonalty of London were ordained keepers of the beams and weights for weighing merchants’ commodities, with power to assign clerks and porters, &c. of the great beam and balance; which weighing of goods and wares is called tronage; and on pain of forfeiture, no stranger was to buy any goods in London before they were weighed at the king's beam.
