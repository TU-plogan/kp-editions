TAUNUS Mountains, a district of Germany, in the dominion of the prince of Nassau. In Germany this range of mountains was long denominated the Heights of Homburg, and belonged to the duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt before it came to the house of Nassau, as a portion of the duchy of Katzerellenbogen. It lies between the Rhine and the Maine, the former being its western, and the latter its southern boundary. The face of the country is very irregular; it consists almost wholly of hills and valleys, especially in the eastern part, where streams and wood present themselves to the traveller in great variety. The most lofty points of these hills are the Gros-feld-berg, 2605 feet, and the Altkonigberge, 2450 feet, in height. In these mountains are the mineral springs which form the great source of the wealth of the duchy. The chief of them are at Ems, Schwalbach, Schlangenbad, and Soden. There is another spring at Selzers, whose water is not drunk at the well, but put into stone bottles, of which about 1,500,000 are annually distributed over Europe. These mountains contain abundance of iron ore, which is worked extensively by the charcoal made from the neighbouring hills. There are also some mines of lead and of silver, but not productive to any great extent. Except the making of stone bottles and ironware, the chief occupation is agriculture, and even on the table-land, lofty as it is, good crops of rye are produced. The only river among these mountains is the Lahn, a romantic stream falling into the Rhine below the town of Ems, and navigable by boats in wet weather as high up the valley as Weilbourg. Over this stream, at Nassau, an iron suspension bridge has been constructed, being the first erection of that kind in Germany.
