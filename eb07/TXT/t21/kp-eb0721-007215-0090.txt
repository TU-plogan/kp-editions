TAMBOW, a government of Russia, one of the East Sea provinces, extending in east longitude from 38째 31' to 43째 20', and in north latitude from 51째 8' to 55째 9', being 26,072 square miles. It is a level district in the northern part, sandy and swampy; but in the south it is of moderate fertility. It is well watered, some of its many streams running to the Wolga and others to the Don. The climate is healthy, but the winters are severely cold. The corn is more than sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, and a large quantity is distilled. The crown forests cover a large proportion of the district, and create a large export of timber and fuel. Many herds of cattle yield both hides and tallow, and the former are converted into leather for exportation. The growth of flax is extensive, and the manufactory of linens from it flourishing. There are also some manufactures of cloth, and many of iron, and some of glass ware. The trade is almost exclusively internal, the province having no communication by water with the sea. The population, by the latest accounts, is 1,422,000 persons.

Tambow, a city of Russia, the capital of the province of that name, 804 miles from St Petersburg. It is an ancient place, but has been much modernized of late years. It contains six wooden and seven stone churches, about 1600 houses, mostly of wood, and 15,000 inhabitants, who subsist by making linen goods and cordage, and in a greater degree by agriculture.
