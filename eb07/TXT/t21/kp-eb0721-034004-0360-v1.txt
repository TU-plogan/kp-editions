TORTOLA, the principal of the Virgin Islands, is situated in long. 64° 39' west, and lat. 18° 20' north. It is about twelve miles long from east to west, and on an average four miles wide. It consists of one mountain mass, running along the middle of the island in abrupt and irregular forms, which, on the west side of the island, rise above 1500 feet. The shores are indented with bays, harbours, and creeks, affording shelter and anchorage to a great extent of shipping. A great part of the interior consists of large tracts of waste land. Along the shore are a few tracts of flat ground, but the soil is thin and impoverished. The population amounted in 1835 to 7731. In 1836 the value of the exports was L.23,129, of which L.21,213 was for sugar and molasses. The imports were L.15,225, consisting chiefly of corn and British manufactures.
