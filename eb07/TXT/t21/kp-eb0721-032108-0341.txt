TOKAY, or T okai, a town of the Austrian kingdom of

Hungary, in the division of Semplin. It is situated on the river Theiss, at the point where the waters of the Bodrog fall into that stream. It was once considered an important military post; and was then the great store-cellar of the wine of Prince Bagotzky. Tokay contains 3200 inhabitants, of the Lutheran, Calvinistic, and Catholic confessions, each of which has its church. From this town the celebrated wine produced in the vicinity has received its name in most parts of Europe, though at home, ever since 1741, it is more commonly denominated Theresienberg, from the name of a hilly district. The best is produced on the hills of Mada, Tarckzal, and Zomba, which are connected with the Carpathian range of mountains. The whole quantity of this wine which is yearly produced does not on an average amount to more than 110,000 cimers, a measure equal to twenty English gallons.
