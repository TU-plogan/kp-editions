TRINCOMALEE, a town, fortress, and excellent harbour in the island of Ceylon, situated on the north-east of the island. It is of greater extent than Colombo, but contains fewer houses, and is much inferior in population and appearance. The fort is very strong, and commands the principal bays, particularly the entrance into the harbour. It has also a citadel, called Fort Ostenburg, erected on a cliff which projects into the sea; nor can it be attacked till after the capture of the lower fort. It was originally built by the Portuguese, from the ruins of some celc-l>rated pagodas. In the bay the shores arc so bold, and the waters so deep, that it is almost possible to step from the rocks into the vessels moored alongside. At the extremity of the rock on which the fort stands, a strong battery is erected, and there the flag-staff is placed. The harbour is good, and affords security to shipping in all seasons and weathers, being deep and capacious, and landlocked on all sides. From its convenient situation, it is of great consequence to a maritime power; for when the violent monsoon commences, all vessels on the coast of Coromandel, and the east side of the Bay of Bengal, are obliged to put to sea, and then Trincomalee is their only place of refuge. The great expectations that were formed of this place by the British government have not however been realized. Owing to the barren and unproductive nature of the surrounding country, but few inhabitants have been collected. Provisions are scarce, and there is nothing to induce merchants to settle in the town. Hence the society is almost exclusively composed of the officers of the regiments stationed here. The lower classes are chiefly Hindus from the opposite coast, and a few gold and silversmiths, who are native Ceylonese. the adjacent woods abound with wild hogs, buffaloes, and elephants, the latter being frequently shot within a mile of the town. The Portuguese were the first Europeans who were in possession of this place. It was taken from them by the Dutch, with whom it remained till the year 1782, when it was captured by the British. From them it was taken by the French under Admiral Suffrein, who restored it to the Dutch; but it was retaken by the British in 1795, and has ever since remained in their possession. Long. 81. 23.E. Lat. 8. 31. N.
