TOTNES, a town of the hundred of Coleridge, in the county of Devon, 195 miles from London. It stands on the side and the top of a steep hill, at whose foot the river Dart flows. It is about twelve miles from the sea, but the tide flows up to the bridge, by which the river is connected with the suburb. It is a place of little trade. The church is a spacious building, with a lofty tower. Totnes was once fortified, and was defended by a castle, the remains of which are still visible. It is a corporate town, governed by a mayor and eleven councillors, and returns two members to the House of Commons. There is a market on Saturday, which is well supplied with every kind of provisions at cheap rates. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 3128, and in 1831 to 3442.
