TYRTAEUS, a renowned poet, was an Athenian by birth, and flourished about 682 years before the commencement of the Christian, era. He followed the occupation of a schoolmaster, was lame in one foot, and was considered as scarcely sound in mind. By the foolish, genius is sometimes mistaken for fatuity. The causes which led to his being placed in a more conspicuous situation were very peculiar. During their second war with the Messenians, the Lacedaemonians having consulted the oracle of Delphi, were directed to request the services of an Athenian general. The Athenians were unwilling to disregard the injunctions of the oracle, but they were also unwilling to assist a rival state in extending its dangerous power in the Peloponnesus; and with the view of at once complying [7:21:442]with the form, and evading the spirit of the response, they sent the lame and eccentric poet to Sparta. By the force of his genius, he speedily effaced the first impressions occasioned by the meanness of his personal appearance; but his victories were achieved by the lyre and not by the sword. He composed various poems in praise of valour and patriotism, and breathed a new spirit into the rude soldiers of Sparta. When they had been thrice repulsed, and their leaders were on the point of ordering a retreat, Tyrtaeus, by loudly reciting his noble verses, roused the drooping courage of the army to such a height, that every warrior prepared to conquer or die. In the anticipation that they might all perish on that bloody field, they each fastened on the right arm a ticket, containing his own name and that of his lather, lest, in the general mass of carnage, it might be impossible to recognise their mangled bodies. The Messenians fought with great valour and determination, but the Lacedaemonians at length obtained the victory. When civil discords afterwards arose at Sparta, they were dispelled by the potent song of Tyrtaeus. As a reward of his eminent services, he was admitted to the rights and privileges of a citizen. According to the statement of Lycurgus, they passed a law, enjoining as a preparation for battle, that the soldiers were to assemble at the king’s tent, in order to listen to the recitation of this poet’s verses, so well calculated to inspire them with a contempt of danger and death.^[1. Oratores Attici, torn. iv. p. 451. edit. Dobson. ] Of the literary history of Greece, very few portions are so singular as that which we have now detailed; nor must it be forgotten that the people among whom poetry effected such wonders, were never distinguished by the cultivation of literature.

Of the fragments of Tyrtaeus, the earliest edition is supposed to be that which M. Aurogallus published along with the Hymns of Callimachus, Basil. 1532, 4to. They were afterwards inserted in various collections, those of Tumebus, Winterton, Brunck, Gaisford, and others. A separate edition was published by Dr Moor, Glasg. 1759, 4to. Two editions, much more elaborate, were published by Klotz, Bremae, 1764, 8vo, Altemb. 1707, 8vo. This second impression contains various additions and improvements. But the most valuable edition that has yet appeared is included in a volume bearing the title of “Jo. Valentini Franckii, Philos. D. Callinus; sive, Quaestionis de Origine Carminis Elegiaci Tractatio critica. Accedunt Tyrtaei Reliquiae, cum prooemio et critica annotatione.” Altonae et Lipsiae, 1816, 8vo. The fragments of Tyrtaeus, almost entirely in elegiac verse, are eleven in number, but only two of them extend to any considerable length. One of them consists of a single verse. The fragment beginning M έχgις τευ xατἀxεισθε ; which is frequently printed among those of Tyrtaeus, is by the best critics assigned to Callinus.
