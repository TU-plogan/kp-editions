THANET, or Isle of Τηανετ, a part of the county of Kent, in the north corner of it, surrounded by the sea, except at one part, where the river Stour, which was once a large estuary, divides it from the rest of the county. It extends nine miles from east to west, and eight miles from north to south, and contains 24,880 acres of fertile land, with a population in 1831 of 26,090 persons. It comprises eight parishes, and three other divisions called Villa. Within it are the towns of Margate, Ramsgate, and Broad-stairs, which have rapidly increased in extent, in the number of good houses, as well as in inhabitants; and from the number of persons who resort to them for the purpose of sea-bathing, a continued increase may with certainty be anticipated. The soil of the island is remarkably fertile, and is perhaps better cultivated than any other district of the same extent in England. Besides the corn consumed at home, it is enabled to supply the city of London with 30,000 quarters annually, which is forwarded by means of water-carriage. The wheat and barley sent from hence is com-sidered[7:21:191] among the best brought to the London market. Here many kinds of seeds are produced for the seedsmen of the metropolis; not only the seeds of clover, lucerne, sainfoin, and trefoil, but also of canary, anis, radish, spinach, cabbage, and mustard. About 4000 acres are valuable pasture, and used for the fattening of sheep and cattle. Except in the towns, there are no gentlemen’s seats in the island, most of them having been converted into farm-houses, and occupied by the holders of large farms. The people on the shore are for the most part occupied in maritime affairs, especially in assisting ships in distress, in which they display great boldness, skill, and activity.
