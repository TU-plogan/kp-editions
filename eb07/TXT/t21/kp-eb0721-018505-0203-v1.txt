TERMINI, a city of the island of Sicily. It stands on the northern shore of the island, near the mouth of the river Leonardo. Its appearance from the sea is very respectable. It is surrounded with walls rapidly tending to decay, but is protected by a castle on a high rock, which commands the town and coast. The streets are narrow and filthy, but there are some tolerable buildings; and it has the convenience of a good carriage-road to the metropolis, twenty-four miles distant. In ancient times it was celebrated for its thermal baths, supplied by chalybeate sulphureous springs, of the heat of 121° of Fahrenheit. Though in bad repair, they are resorted to for the cure of rheumatic complaints. The city contains 12,800 inhabitants, who derive considerable profit from the anchovy fishery, and from the exportation of oil, olives, wine, sumach, corn, and rice.
