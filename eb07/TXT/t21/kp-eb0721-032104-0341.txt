TOCKENBURG, a long and narrow valley of the canton of St Gall, in Switzerland. The length of this valley is thirty-six miles; and through the whole of it the river Thur rushes with impetuous force, from its source on the western side of the Sentis, to its entrance into the Rhine at Elken, in the canton of Zurich. A range of lofty and picturesque mountains, forming a rampart round this valley, separates it from the Rhinthal and the lake of Wallenstadt. the valley contains 50,000 inhabitants, who adhere to the reformed religion. The weaving of linen forms one part of their occupation. The chief place is the small town of Lichtenseig.
