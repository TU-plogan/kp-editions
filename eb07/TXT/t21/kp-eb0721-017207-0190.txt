TEMESWAR, an extensive palatinate in the Austrian kingdom of Hungary. It is bounded on the north by Arad, on the east by Krassova, on the south by the Turkish dominions, and on the west by Torontal. It extends over 2254 square miles, and comprises one city, six market-towns, and 180 villages, besides hamlets, containing 43,270 houses, with 268,400 inhabitants, the majority of whom are Greeks, Walachians, or Servians, but having among them several German and Maygaren colonists of their several religions and languages. One half of the cultivated land is devoted to the growth of com, about one fortieth part is planted with vines, and the rest is allotted to pastures and wood. The country is generally level, and is well watered by the streams of the Maros, the Ternes, and the Vega. The climate is hot, moist, and not very healthy. The soil is fertile, producing, when well cultivated, abundant crops of wheat, maize, and rice. the produce also of hemp, flax, tobacco, and safron, is copious, and occasions a considerable trade to other districts. Wine is very good in some parts, in others but indifferent. Both red and white wines arc made. The rivers are well stored with fish of all kinds, and the fields abound in game. The whole trade centres in the capital city, of the same name as the palatinate. This country belonged to the Turks till the year 1716, when it was a mere military occupation of the Austrians, and was overrun with wild people from the surrounding countries. In 1772 a civil government was formed, since which it has gradually become orderly, and [7:21:173]the condition of society has much improved. Under the old name it formed a part of the Bannat, which was divided in 1779 into three sections, Torontal, Temeswar, and Krassova.

Temeswar, a city of the kingdom of Hungary, in the province of the Farther Theiss, and in the county of its own name, of which it is the capital. It stands near the river Vega, to which a canal leads. It is one of the best built places of the kingdom, and is most strongly fortified, as one of the chief barriers towards Turkey. It is the seat of the staff of the military colonies, and the see of a bishop both of the Catholic and of the Greek church. The former has a fine Gothic cathedral, and the latter an elegant modern building. It is a place of considerable trade, making oil, tobacco, paper, iron wares, with silk and woollen cloths.
