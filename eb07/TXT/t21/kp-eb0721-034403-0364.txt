TRANQUEBAR, a small seaport of the south of India, in the province of the Carnatic and district of Tanjore, situated at one of the mouths of the Cavery river. It was formerly a village belonging to the rajah of Tanjore, from whom it was purchased by the Danes in 1616. Here they erected the fort of Dansborg, to which population and commerce were soon attracted by the protection derived from the Danish flag, and by the correct conduct of the companyâ€™s servants. The company however did not prosper; and in 1624 they surrendered their charter and property to the king of Denmark, in payment of a debt owing to him. The revenues however continued, under frugal management, to defray all the expenses; and while Denmark remained neutral, the merchants here profited greatly by lending their names during the war to cover British property. In 1807, when the war commenced with Great Britain, the Danes were deprived of this with all their other settlements, which were however restored to them on the conclusion of a general peace.
