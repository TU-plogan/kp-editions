TREASURER, an officer to whom the treasure of a prince or corporation is committed to be kept and duly disposed of, in payment of officers and other expenses.

The lord high treasurer of Great Britain, or first commissioner of the treasury, when in commission, has under his charge and government all the king’s revenue which is kept in the exchequer. He holds his place during the king’s pleasure, being instituted by the delivery of a white staff to him. He has the check of all the officers employed in collecting the customs and royal revenues; and in his gift and disposition are all the offices of the customs in the several parts of the kingdom; escheators in every county are nominated by him; and he also makes leases of the lands belonging to the crown.

Treasurer of the Household is an officer who, in the absence of the lord-steward, has power, with the comptroller and other officers of the board of green-cloth, and the steward of the Marshalsea, to hear and determine treasons, felonies, and other crimes committed within the king’s palace.
