TAVOY, a town and district of the province of Pegu, in the Birman empire, which so late as the year 1753 was the seat of an independent principality. The town is advantageously situated on the eastern side of a fine bay, formed by an extensive island of the same name. Tavoy formerly belonged to the king of Siam, but was taken by the Birmans in 1785. It was besieged without success by the Siamese the following year, and remained in possession of the conquerors till 1790, when it was surrendered for a bribe to the Siamese troops. It was retaken by the Birmans in 1792, and was confirmed to them by the treaty of peace in 1793. Long. 98. 20. E. Lat. 13. 20. N.
