TARANTO, a city of Italy, in the Neapolitan province of Otranto. It stands on a rocky island near to Cape St [7:21:80] Vito, but is joined to the continent by a long bridge. It is surrounded with walls, and defended by batteries and a strong castle. It is the capital of a district, is the seat of an archbishop, and contains a cathedral, several churches and monasteries, an orphan-house, a naval hospital, and two Latin schools. It is irregularly built, and occupies but a small part of the ancient Tarentum. The harbour is now nearly filled with sand, but is accessible and secure for vessels of light draught of water, and for the craft of the numerous fishermen. About sixty coasting vessels belong to the port, trading, for the most part, in the Adriatic Sea. The city is supplied with water by means of an aqueduct. It contains 14,150 inhabitants, employed in trade in corn and oil, and other products of the land, in the fishery, and in making some cotton goods and hats, and in collecting salt. Long. 18. 25. E. Lat. 40. 45. N.
