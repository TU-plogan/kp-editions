TATIANUS, a Greek writer of the primitive church, was a native of Syria, and by profession a rhetorician. He was educated in paganism, but became a convert to Christianity, and a disciple of Justin Martyr, whom he attended at Rome. After the death of Justin, in the year 165, he adopted some very unsound opinions, and appeared as the author of a new sect, condemning marriage, enjoining abstinence from wine and animal food, and suffering only water to be used in the holy mysteries; whence his followers were called Encraritae and Hydroparastatae. From Rome he returned to the east, and opened a school in Mesopotamia; but when or where he died, we do not find recorded. His only work, “Oratio ad Graecos,” was first printed at Zürich in 1546. An elaborate edition was published by William Worth, A. M. Oxon. 1700, 8vo.
