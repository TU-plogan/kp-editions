TRURO, a town in the hundred of Powder and county of Cornwall. It stands at the confluence of two rivers, the Kenwyn and the Allen, which surround the place, and below it unites with an estuary which is a part of the harbour of Falmouth, so that at spring tides it is navigable for vessels of 200 tons burden. In this way the chief products of the tin-mines are conveyed to the requisite markets for consumption. The town is well built, and some recent additions have been made, which have increased its beauty. The church is a spacious building, and is a good specimen of the architecture of the age in which it was erected, that of the reign of Henry V Ill. The town-hall, besides its peculiar purpose, is used for holding the quarter-sessions for the county. There is a building called the Coinage Hall, where the process of coining the tin is carried on, and where the parliaments of the lord warden of the stanneries and the courts of the vice-warden are held, for the adjudication of whatever relates to the trade in tin, the chief object of pursuit in this place. Truro is an incorporated town, and by the recent law is divided into two wards, having a mayor, six aldermen, and seventeen councillors. It returns two members to the House of Commons. It has an endowed grammar-school, with exhibitions at Oxford. There are two weekly markets, one on Wednesday, the other on Friday. The population amounted in 1821 to 2719, and in 1831 to 2925.
