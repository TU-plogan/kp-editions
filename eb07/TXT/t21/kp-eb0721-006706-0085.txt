TABOR, a celebrated mountain of Palestine, situated to the south-west of Lake Tiberias, over which, and all the surrounding country, it commands an extensive prospect about two leagues south-east from Nazareth, and nearly the same distance from Jordan. In shape it resembles a truncated cone. It is entirely calcareous, and is covered to the top with a forest of oak, and wild pistachio, and other trees, and a variety of plants. It is completely insulated from any of the neighbouring mountains, none of which is of equal height. It is estimated by Buckingham to be about 1000 feet above the adjacent country. It is covered in the morning, and during a great part of the day, with thick clouds, which disperse towards midday. A strong wind blows on it during the day; and Burckhardt mentions that more copious dews fall in the night than he had seen in any other part of Syria. Here this traveller found a single family of Greek Christians, who had resided on the top for several years. They rented the oval plain into which the summit is extended for about a quarter of a mile, at fifty piastres, and had retired to this remote spot to avoid paying taxes. Here are found the remains of a large fortress, the thick wall of which may be traced quite round the summit. The area of the plain is overspread with ruins of private dwellings, built of stone, of great solidity, and with the vestiges of churches, grottoes, and other ancient relics. There are no springs; but numerous reservoirs have been cut in the rock, two of which are still of service in supplying water. Mount Tabor is celebrated as the Mount of Transfiguration.
