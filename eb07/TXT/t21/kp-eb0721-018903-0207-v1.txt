TEUTONES, or Teutoni, a people always by historians joined with the Cimbri; both seated, according to Mela, beyond the Elbe, on the Sinus Codanus, or Baltic; and there, it is supposed, lay the country of the Teutones, now Ditmarsh; diversity of dialects producing the different terms Teu, Tut, Bit, Tid, and Thod, which in the ancient German language signified people. Of these Teutones, Virgil is to be understood in the epithet Teutonicus; an appellation which more lately came to be applied to the Germans in general, and later still the appellation Alemanni. The Teutones, in conjunction with the Cimbri and Ambrones, made war on the Romans, and marched towards Italy in the year 101 b. c. We are told, that the Teutones alone were so numerous, that they were six whole days without intermission in passing the Roman camp. In transalpine Gaul they engaged the consul Marius, but were defeated with incredible slaughter; 100,000 of them, according to the lowest calculations, being killed on the spot. According to others, the number of those killed and taken prisoners amounted to 290,000.
