TEWKESBURY, a town of the hundred of the same name, in the county of Gloucester, 104 miles from London, It stands on the banks of the river Severn, near to the junction of the Avon with that stream. It is finely situated on a rising ground, and for the most part is well built. The church is a Gothic structure, one of the finest and largest in England, and formerly occupied by a mitred abbot. It is 300 feet in length and 120 feet broad; the chancel has several painted windows, and many fine monuments. There is a brisk trade carried on by both rivers, and in the town there are small manufactures. It is an ancient borough, and is governed by a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors, and returns two members to parliament. There arc good markets on Wednesday and Saturday. Near this place was fought the great battle between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians in 1471, when the former became the conquerors. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 4962, and in 1831 to 5780.
