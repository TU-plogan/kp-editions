TERTULLIAN, or Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus, one of the Latin fathers, was born at Carthage about the middle of the second century. Dr Allix, in his “Dissertatio de Tertulliani Vita et Scriptis,” has remarked that those who suppose him to have flourished about the year 160, have referred his birth to too early a period. His father was a centurion in the legion of the proconsul. The son was well instructed in elegant as well as useful learning, and in particular acquired much skill in the civil law. Having renounced the errors of paganism, he distinguished himself by his able apology for the Christians. It appears from his works that he was married. He became a presbyter of the church of Carthage, and afterwards paid a visit to Rome, where he was a spectator of the games celebrated by the emperor Severus in the year 204. On his return, he embraced the errors of Montanus. He then thought proper to assume the pallium, or robe of the ancient philosophers, and to defend his conduct in a learned and singular tract “De Pallio.” He at length relinquished his connexion with the Montanists, but still retained some peculiar opinions. Tertullian reached an advanced age, and we may perhaps place his death about the year 240. He was a man of much fervour and ingenuity, conjoined with various learning; but his works contain many erroneous, and some pernicious opinions, among which we may class his notion as to the benefit of prayers for the dead. He writes in an African style of eloquence, and his meaning is not unfrequently obscure. Lactantius, no mean judge, has censured him as deficient in ease and perspicuity. The earliest edition of his works was published by Beatus Rhenanus, Basil. 1521, fol. Many editions followed, but we shall only refer the reader to that of Rigault, or Rigaltius, Paris. 1634, fol.^[1. See Du Pin, Bibliothèque des Auteurs Ecclesiastiques, tom. i. p. 106. Dr Kaye, bishop of Lincoln, has published a work of considerable value, under the title of “The Ecclesiastical History of the second and third Centuries illustrated from the Writings of Tertullian.” Cambridge, 1826, 8vo. ] A separate volume, containing the commentaries of former editors, was added in 1635. Some of his treatises have received much learned illustration in a separate form; particularly the Apologeticus from Heraldus, Lutet. Paris. 1613, 4to, and from Havercamp, Lugd. Bat. 1718, 8vo, and the tract “De Pallio” from Salmasius, Lugd. Bat. 1656, 8vo. This tract, very brief in itself, is suffused with an immense stream of erudition.
