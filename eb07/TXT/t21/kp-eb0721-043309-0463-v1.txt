TWICKENHAM, a parish of the hundred of Isleworth and county of Middlesex, ten miles from London. It lies on the river Thames, opposite to Richmond, with which it is connected by an elegant bridge. It is remarkable as the residence of Pope, who was buried in the parish church, and for Strawberry Hill, the elegant dwelling of Horace Walpole. There are many other distinguished private houses within the parish. The population amounted in 1821 to 4206, and in 1831 to 4571.
