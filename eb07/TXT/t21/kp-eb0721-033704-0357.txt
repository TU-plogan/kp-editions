TOOMBUDDRA, a celebrated river of the south of India, which takes its name from the junction of the Toom and the Bhadra, which rise in the western mountains. After flowiug through a jungly country for nearly a degree, it joins its name and waters with the Tunga at Koorly. From thence taking a sweep, first northerly, and then westerly, and afterwards to the east, it continues a winding course until it falls into the Krishna, skirting the north-western frontier of the British dominions.
