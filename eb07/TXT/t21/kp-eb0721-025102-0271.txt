THORDA, or Τηοrenburg, a district of the province of Suabenburgen, in the Austrian kingdom of Hungary. It is a long narrow district, extending nearly the length of the whole province. It covers nearly 2000 square miles, but scarcely contains more than 70,000 inhabitants, the northern part comprising a great portion of the sterile Carpathian Mountains; but the southern part produces good corn, wine, and fruits, and rears some large flocks of sheep. The capital is a town of the same name, on the river Ar-anyos, which divides it into the old and new town. It contains two Catholic and two Calvinist churches, a Lutheran, a Greek, and a Unitarian church, and 7100 inhabitants. The Unitarians have a college, and the Franciscan monks a monastery. Near Thorda there are some mines of rock-salt, yielding 25,000 tons of culinary salt annually. Long. 23. 42. 12. E. Lat. 46. 31. 53. N.
