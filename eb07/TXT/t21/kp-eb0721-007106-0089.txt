TALIO (lex talionis), a species of punishment in the Mosaic law, by which an evil is returned similar to that committed against us by another; hence that expression, “Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.” This law was inserted in the twelve Tables of the Romans; but it was afterwards set aside, and a power was given to the praetor to fix a sum of money for the injury inflicted.
