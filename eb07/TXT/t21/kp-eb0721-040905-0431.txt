TURBAN, the head-dress of most of the eastern nations, lt consists of two parts, a cap, and a sash of fine linen or taffety artfully wound in divers plaits about the cap. The cap has no brim, is pretty flat, though roundish at top, and quilted with cotton, but does not cover the ears. There is a good deal of art in giving the turban a fine air; and the making of this article is a particular trade. The sash of the Turks' turban is white linen; that of the Persiansâ€™ red woollen. These are the distinguishing marks of their different religions. Sophi king of Persia, being of the sect of Ali, was the first who assumed the red colour, to distinguish himself from the Turks, who are of the sect of Omar, and whom the Persians esteem heretics.
