THISTLE, Order of the, or of St Andrew, a military order of knighthood in Scotland, the rise and institution of which are variously related by different authors. Lesley bishop of Ross reports, that the night before the battle between Athelstan king of Northumberland and Hungus king of the Picts, a bright cross, in form of that upon which St Andrew (the tutelary saint of Scotland) suffered martyrdom, appeared to Hungus; who, having gained the victory, ever after bore the figure of that cross on his banners. Others assert, that Achaius king of Scotland first instituted this order, after having made the famous league offensive and defensive with Charlemagne king of France. But although the thistle had been acknowledged as the symbol of the kingdom of Scotland from the reign of Achaius, yet some refer the beginning of this order to Charles VII. of France. Others place the foundation of it as low as the year 1500. The chief and principal ensign is a gold collar composed of thistles and sprigs of rue interlinked with amulets of gold, having as a pendant the image of St Andrew with his cross, and the motto Nemo με Impune lacesset, “Nobody shall provoke me with impunity.” The ordinary or common ensign worn by the knights is a star of four silver points, and over them a green circle, bordered and lettered with gold, containing the said motto, and in the centre is a thistle; all which is embroidered on their left breast, and worn with the collar, with a green ribband over the left shoulder, and brought under the right arm: the pendent image of St Andrew, with his cross, in a purple robe, is within an oval of gold enamelled vert, with the former motto; but sometimes they wear, encircled in the same manner, a thistle crowned. About the time of the Reformation, this order was dropped, and James 11, of Great Britain resumed it, by creating eight knights. the Revolution again unsettled it; and it lay neglected till Queen Anne, in 1703, restored it to the primitive design, of twelve knights of St Andrew.
