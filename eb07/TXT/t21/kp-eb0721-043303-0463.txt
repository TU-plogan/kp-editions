TWEED, the fourth river in Scotland for size, and the boundary between England and Scotland, from Carham burn, on its south side, six miles above Coldstream, till it falls into the German Ocean at Berwick. It takes its rise in the upper part of the parish of Tweedsmuir, in the county of Peebles, at the foot of a hill called Tweed Well, and flows in a north-easterly direction, having its waters augmented by the numerous small streams which descend from this hilly district. Three miles above Peebles it is joined by the Lyne, which issues from the confines of Edinburghshire; and here it takes an easterly bend, which it maintains during the rest of its course. Two miles farther down it receives the Manor, and at Peebles the Eddlestone. By these accessions it is now a considerable stream; and although only thirty miles from its source, it has in that distance fallen 1000 feet, being two thirds of its descent in a course from eighty-five to ninety miles. In its progress towards Selkirkshire, it receives additional strength from the Yair and the Leithen. It is next joined on the right by the united waters of the Yarrow and the Ettrick; and, after passing Abbotsford, it receives the Gala on the left, and enters Roxburghshire. During its progress to Kelso, it passes the celebrated ruins of Melrose Abbey, as well as those of Dryburgh, in which are deposited the remains of Sir Walter Scott. The Leader falls into it below Dry-grange, and is the only stream which it receives till it is united to that of the Teviot. From the volume of water added by the Teviot, the Tweed is almost doubled in size; and as it flows majestically down Berwickshire, it receives in its way the waters of the Eden, four miles on the left from Kelso; the Leet at Coldstream; and the sluggish Till from the English side, three miles below Coldstream. From these accessions its increase is attain perceptible. After passing the ruins of Norham Castle, it flows for several miles through a rich and highly-cultivated district, receiving the large stream of Whitadder on the left; and passing the ancient town of Berwick on the same side, it discharges itself into the German Ocean. The distance from Peebles to Berwick is nearly sixty miles, yet its descent in that distance is only 500 feet. It is computed to drain in its course 1870 square miles. This river is of no consequence in a commercial view. It is principally famed for the rural scenery through which it flows, for the importance in which it was formerly held as being in part the boundary between the two kingdoms, and for the associations with which it is connected in Scotish song. From its source to where it enters the ocean, the whole run is denominated the Vale of the Tweed.
