THORNHILL, Sir James, an eminent English painter, was born in Dorsetshire in 1676, of an ancient family, but was constrained to apply to some profession by the distresses of his father, who had been reduced to the necessity of selling his family estate. His inclination directed him to the art of painting; and on his arrival at London he applied to his uncle, the famous Dr Sydenham, who enabled [7:21:252]him to proceed in the study of the art under the direction of a painter who was not very eminent. The genius of ' Thornhill, however, made ample amends for the insufficiency of his instructor; and by a happy application of his talents he made so great a progress, that he gradually rose to the highest reputation. His genius was well adapted to historical and allegorical compositions; he possessed a fertile and fine invention; and he sketched his thoughts with great ease, freedom, and spirit. He equally excelled in portrait, perspective, and architecture; showed an excellent taste for design, and had a free and firm pencil. He was so eminent in many parts of his profession, that he must ever be ranked among the best painters of his time; and his performances in the dome of St Paulâ€™s church at London, in the hospital at Greenwich, and at Hampton Court, are such public proofs of his merit as will convey his name to posterity with honour. This painter lived in general esteem: he enriched himself by the excellence of his works; was appointed state-painter to Queen Anne, from whom he received the honour of knighthood; had the singular satisfaction to repurchase his family estate; and was of sufficient importance to be elected a member of parliament. He died in 1732.
