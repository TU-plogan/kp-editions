TILLOTSON, John, archbishop of Canterbury, was the son of Robert Tillotson of Sowerby, in the parish of Halifax in Yorkshire, clothier; and was born there in the year 1030. He studied at Clare Hall, Cambridge, and in 1651 became a fellow. In 1656 he left the university, in order to become tutor to the son of Edmund Prideaux, Esq. of Ford Abbey in Devonshire. He was afterwards curate to Dr Hacket, vicar of Cheslmnt, in Hertfordshire. In 1663 he was presented by Sir Thomas Barnardiston to the rectory of Ketton or Ked-dington, in the county of Suffolk; but was the next year chosen preacher to Lincoln’s Inn, when he procured Ketton to be bestowed on his curate. He was greatly admired in London for his sermons; and in the same year was chosen Tuesday-lecturer at St Lawrence’s church, where his lectures were frequented by all the divines of the city, and by many persons of quality and distinction. In 1666, he took the degree of D. D. at Cambridge; in 1669, was made prebendary of Canterbury; in 1672, was admitted dean of that cathedral; and three years afterwards, was made a prebendary of St Paul’s cathedral. In 1679, he became acquainted with Charles earl of Shrewsbury, whom he converted from popery; and the next year he refused to sign the clergy of London’s address of thanks to King Charles II. for not agreeing to the bill for excluding the duke of York. In 1683, he visited the unfortunate Lord Russell when under condemnation, and attended him in his last moments on the scaffold. In 1689, he was installed dean of St Paul’s; made clerk of the closet to King William and Queen Mary; and appointed one of the commissioners to prepare matters to be laid before the convocation, in order to a comprehension of all Protestants, as well dissenters as churchmen; but this attempt was frustrated by the bigotry of those members of that body who refused to admit of any alteration in things confessedly indifferent. In 1691, Dr Tillotson, notwithstanding the warmest remonstrances and entreaties on his part, was consecrated archbishop of Canterbury, and four days after was sworn one of the privy council; their majesties always reposing an entire confidence in his prudence, moderation, and integrity. In 1694, he was seized with a palsy, of which he died in the 65th year of his age. He was interred in the church of St Lawrence Jewry, where a handsome monument is erected to his memory. This learned and pious divine, while living, was greatly inveighed against by the enemies of the revolution. After his death there was found a bundle of bitter libels which had been published against him, on which he had written with his own hand, “I forgive the authors of these books, and pray God that he may also forgive them.” It is remarkable, that while this truly great man was in a private station, he always laid aside two tenths of his income for charitable uses. One volume in folio of Dr Tillotson’s sermons was published in his lifetime, and corrected by his own hand. They were translated into French by Barbeyrac. Those which were published after his death by his chaplain Dr Barker, form two volumes in folio, the copy of which was sold for L.2500. This was the only legacy he left to his family, his extensive charity having consumed his yearly revenues as constantly as they came to his hands. King William however gave two grants to his widow; the first of which was an annuity of L.400 during the term of her natural life, and the second of L.200 as an addition to the former annuity. Tillotson wrote some other works besides his Sermons; and also published Dr Barrow’s Works, and Bishop Wilkins’s Principles and Duties of Natural Religion, as well as a volume of that prelate’s Sermons.^[1.
