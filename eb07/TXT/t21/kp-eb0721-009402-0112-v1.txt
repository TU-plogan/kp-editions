The town is advantageously situated on the eastern side of a fine bay, formed by an extensive island of the same name. Tavoy formerly belonged to the king of Siam, but was taken by the Birmans in 1785.

It was retaken by the Birmans in 1792, and was confirmed to them by the treaty of peace in 1793. Long. 98. 20. E. Lat. 13. 20. N.
