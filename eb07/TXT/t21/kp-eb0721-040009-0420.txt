TSCHERNIGOW, a province or government of European Russia, which extends in north latitude from 52° 22’ to 53° 17', and in east longitude from 30° 13' to 34° 43', and comprehends 25,564 square miles. It is an undulating district, with no lofty hills. The soil is of moderate fertility, producing rye, barley, and oats, and a small quantity of inferior wheat. The crops of hemp and flax afford the chief employment. The heavy products are sent by water to Odessa; and many cattle are bred, and sent to Germany for sale. The population amounts to 1,378,000 persons, all professing the Greek religion. The province is divided into twelve circles, which contain very few large towns for their extent.

Tschernigow, the capital city of the province of that name, as well as of the circle in which it stands. It is 773 miles from St Petersburg. It is situated on the banks of the river Desna, is defended by a fortress on a hill; and is the seat of an archbishop, who has a cathedral with a magnificent cupola. It contains about 2000 houses, with 10,000 inhabitants, who make some linen goods. Long. 31. 13. E. Lat. 51. 27. 10. N.
