TAGUS, or Tajo, the largest river of Spain; which, taking its rise on the confines of Aragon, runs south-west through the provinces of New Castille and Estremadura; and passing by the cities of Aranjuez, Toledo, and Alcantara, and then crossing Portugal, forms the harbour of Lisbon, at which city it is about three miles broad; and about eight or ten miles below this it falls into the Atlantic Ocean.
