THEODORETUS, or, as he is frequently called, Τneodoritus , was born at Antioch towards the close of the fourth century. According to his own account, his birth was preceded by divers miracles. He received his education in the neighbouring monastery of Euprepius, where he had Chrysostom for one of his instructors. About the year 420 he became bishop of Cyrus in Syria. His connection with Nestorius involved him in a charge of heresy; and in 449 the council of Ephesus deposed him from his bishopric; but in 451 the council of Chalcedon recalled him from exile, and restored him to his office. He survived till 457 or the following year. His works, compared with those of the other Greek fathers, are of very considerable value. He has written commentaries on most of the books of the Old Testament, and on the epistles of Paul. His ecclesiastical history, divided into five books, prosecutes the narrative from the year 322 to the year 427. It is printed with different editions of Eusebius, and the other Greek historians of the church. A collective edition of his works, with a Latin version, was published by Sirmond, Lutet. Paris. 1642, 4 tom. fol. A supplementary volume was added by Garnier in 1684. Another edition was long afterwards published by J. L. Schulze, Hate Sax. 1769-74, 5 tom. 8vo. Each volume is however divided into two parts. Dr Gaisford has very recently published a valuable edition of his “Graecarum Affectionum Curatio,” Oxon. 1839, 8vo. This treatise is important as a contribution to the history of philosophy, and its merits have been fully discussed by Luzac.
