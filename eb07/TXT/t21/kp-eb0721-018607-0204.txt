TERRIANI or Terrai, a district in Northern Hindustan, situated about the twenty-seventh degree of north latitude, partly comprehended in the British dominions, and partly in those of Nepaul. The word properly signifies marshy land, and is sometimes applied to the flats lying below the hills in the interior of Nepaul, as well as to the low tract bordering on the companyâ€™s northern frontier. To the south it is bounded by Gorackpoor, Bettiah, and Tyrhoot. The Terriani of Nepaul is confined between the Gunduck and the Teesta, and is divided into five soubahs or governments, from which however the rajah of Nepaul does not draw any considerable revenue, owing partly to mismanagement, and partly to the low state of the population from the unhealthiness of the country. The western Terriani contains inexhaustible forests of the most excellent timber. The pines of Bechiacori, and the saul trees both of that and of the Jhurjoory Forest, are not surpassed anywhere for straightness or durability, and might be floated south on the Boora Gunduck. Pure turpentine of the Sulla pine might also be procured.

So extremely unhealthy is this dreary tract, that Heber (vol. ii. p. 157) mentions, on the authority of those who had resided in the vicinity, that not only the inhabitants, but every thing which has the breath of life, instinctively deserts it from the beginning of April to October. The tigers go up the hills, and the antelopes and wild hogs make excursions into the cultivated plain; and those who are obliged to traverse the forests during the intervening months, such as military officers or Dak bearers, agree that not so much as a bird can be heard or seen in the frightful solitude. In the time of the heaviest rains, and while the water falls in torrents, the country may be passed in comparative safety. It is during the extreme heat, and while the exhalations are ascending from the damp ground after the rains have ceased, namely, in May, the latter end of August, and the early part of September, that the climate is most fatal. The season is more healthy in October, when the animals return, and the woodcutters and cowmen venture, though cautiously. From the middle of November to March, troops pass and repass without any danger. The forest extends at the foot of the lowest hills in a long black level line, so black and level that Heber remarks it might seem to have been drawn with ink and a ruler. Fever and ague are the diseases to which this district is liable. The inhabitants are few, and unhealthy in their appearance, and are rather decreasing, owing to the fatality of the climate. The principal rivers are the Bhagmutty, the Bukkia, and the Jumne, besides many nullahs and inferior streams.
