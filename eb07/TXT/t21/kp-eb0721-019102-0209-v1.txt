THASO, or Tasso, an island on the northern coast of Greece, the Thasos of antiquity. It stands in the Gulf of Contessa, about four miles from the mainland, and seven leagues to the eastward of Cape Karca or Kofani. It is thirteen miles long from north to south, and eleven broad from east to west. It is mountainous, particularly in the south and in the east parts, but affords excellent wine, with a quantity of honey and bees' wax. The gold mines mentioned by ancient writers are not now known to exist, but it still supplies some fine marbles. In former times it was celebrated for its fertility, but of late years it has been much neglected. On the shore of the mainland, opposite to Thaso, is the town of Cavalla, before which is good anchorage in from eight to ten fathoms water, under the protection of a castle. On the north-east side there is a good roadstead, near the town of Tasso Paolo. The centre of the island is in long. 24. 39. E. and lat. 40. 41. N.
