TRIPOLI, called Tripolis of Syria, to distinguish it from Tripoli in Barbary, received its name from its being anciently formed of three cities at a small distance from each other, one of which belonged to the A radians, or ancient kingdom of Arad, the second to the Sidonians, and the third to the Tyrians, perhaps as a common mart to those maritime powers. The present town of Tripoli is built at the distance of a mile and a half from the other, upon the declivity of a hill facing the sea, in longitude 35. 59. east from Greenwich, and latitude 34. 20. north.
