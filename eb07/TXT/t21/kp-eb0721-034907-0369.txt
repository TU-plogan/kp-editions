TREVIGLIO, a city of the north of Italy, in the Austrian kingdom of Milan and the delegation of Bergamo. It stands on the river Adda, in a district that is not very productive of any other article but silk, of which a great quantity is supplied and disposed of at an annual fair. Tre-viglio contains but one church, but has an hospital. The inhabitants are 6700, who are employed in making linen and silk goods of various kinds.
