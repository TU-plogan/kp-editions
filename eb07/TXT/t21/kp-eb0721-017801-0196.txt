TEMPLES among us denote two inns of court in London, thus called because anciently the dwelling-house of the knights templars. At the suppression of that order, they were purchased by the professors of the common law, and converted into hospitia or inns. They are called the Inner and Middle Temple, in relation to Essex-house; which was also a part of the house of the templars, and called the Outer Temple, because situated without Temple-Bar.
