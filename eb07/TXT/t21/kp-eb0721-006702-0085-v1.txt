TABLATURE (Ital. Talndatura, or Intavolatura), an old species of musical notation by means of letters of the alphabet applied to a staff of four or more lines and their spaces, and most usually employed in music written for the guitar, or for instruments of the lute kind. It has long been disused, and is now generally unintelligible. For some explanations of Tablature, see Graham’s Essay upon Music.
