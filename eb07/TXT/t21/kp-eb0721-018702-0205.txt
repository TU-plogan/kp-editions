TERUEL, a department of the southern division of the province of Aragon, in Spain, a rich district, watered by the streams of the rivers Guadalaviar and Alhambra. The borders of the department are mountainous and sterile, but the valleys are very productive. The capital is a city of the same name, upon the river Turia, at the point where it falls into the Alhambra. It is situated on a hill, is surrounded with walls, and is the seat of a bishop. It has a cathedral, seven other churches, five convents tor males and females, and 1200 houses, with 5600 inhabitants, who deal largely in fine wool, and make some woollen cloths. Near the city are the remains of a noble aqueduct constructed by the Romans. There are also mines of quicksilver at some distance from the city, which were formerly worked, but are now abandoned. Lat. 40. 38. 2. N.
