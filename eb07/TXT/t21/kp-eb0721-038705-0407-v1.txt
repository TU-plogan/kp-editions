TRINOMALEE, a town and fortress of the south of India, in the Carnatic. During the wars of the last century, this place was often taken and retaken by the contending parties. Among the natives it was always more famous for its sanctity than its strength. Its situation is on a mountain, on the top of which is a Hindu temple, from which it is believed that a subterranean fire will issue, to destroy any profane intruder. In its vicinity the British defeated the combined armies of the nizam and Hyder Aly. Trinomalee is thirty miles south-south-west from Chittapet, and thirty west from Gingee. Long. 79. 10. E. Lat. 12. 16. N.
