Talent, as a species of money, among the Hebrews, was sometimes used for a gold coin, the same with the shekel of gold, called also stater, and weighing only four drachms. The Hebrews reckoned by these talents as we do by pounds, &c. Thus a million of gold, or a million of talents of gold, among them, was a million of shekels or nummi; the nummus of gold being the same weight with the shekel, viz. four drachms. But the Hebrew talent weight of silver, which they called cicar, was equivalent to that of 3000 shekels, or 113 lb. 10 oz. 1 dwt. 10 2 /7 gr. English Troy weight, according to Arbuthnotâ€™s computation.
