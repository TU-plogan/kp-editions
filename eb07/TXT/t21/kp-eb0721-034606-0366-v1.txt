TRAVANCORE, a province situated at the south-west extremity of Hindustan, between the eighth and tenth degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the territories of the Cochin rajah; on the south and west by the sea; and on the east by a range of woody mountains, by which it is divided from the British district of Tinnevelly. It is estimated to extend 140 miles in length by forty in average breadth. The country possesses a diversified surface, and exhibits in the vicinity of the mountains a varied scene of hill and dale, with winding streams which flow from the hills, and give to the valleys a perpetual verdure[7:21:347]. The mountains are covered with lofty forests, which enhance the grandeur of the scene, and which produce pepper, cardamoms, cassia, frankincense, and other aromatic gums. These woods afford ample cover for the wild animals, which are found here in abundance, namely, elephants, buffaloes, and tigers of the largest size; also monkeys and apes, which keep together in flocks. The climate is so moist that the cultivation of rice is conducted without the aid of tanks. It is produced in great abundance, insomuch that, according to the statement of the natives, the whole government expenses, civil, military, and religious, are defrayed from the wet cultivators alone, without infringing on the revenues which arise from those articles that are produced from the dry mode of culture, which are pepper, betel-nut, cocoa-nut trees, &c. The timber forests of Travancore are in general fanned, the revenue varying according to circumstances. Among other articles of monopoly are ginger, coir, turmeric, and dried cocoa-nut kernels. Tobacco for consumption is generally brought from Ceylon. In the interior of the country, duties are exacted on the transit of all articles, and the payment at one place scarcely ever exempts the trader from a repetition at another. The articles which are taxed are cassia-buds, mace, long nutmegs, wild saffron, coculus indicus, narwally, bees’ wax, elephants’ teeth, and sandal-wood. Custom-duties are also imposed, and are let out to farm. There are various other sources of revenue, such as taxes on Christian festivals, and upon nets and fishermen. But the most important is a capitation tax on all males from sixteen to twenty, with the exception of Nairs, Moplays, and artificers. The number taxed is estimated at 250,000. The sum-total of all these exactions is computed to amount to twenty lacs of rupees, or L.250,000, besides the taxes on the wet cultivation. The principal seaports in this province are Anjengo, Coulan, Aibecca, and Coleshy. The ancient capital of the country was Travancore, but the rajah now generally resides at Trivandapatam. On the coast there are strong currents, which frequently carry ships round Cape Comorin to a considerable distance westward. This being one of those countries which the Mahommedan warriors never succeeded in conquering, the primeval manners of the Hindus are retained in greater purity than in those others to the north, whose laws and religion have long been trampled under foot by their barbarous conquerors. At a very early period the Christian religion gained a footing in Travancore; and it is now computed that 90,000 persons have become proselytes to its doctrines. In some parts, churches are so numerous, and Hindu temples so rare, that the traveller with difficulty believes himself to be in India. A great proportion of the fishermen on the sea-coast of Travancore and Malabar are considered as Christians.

The territories of the Travancore chief were formerly of small extent, and he paid tribute to Madura; but from 1740 to 1755, the ruler extended his territories, owing to a series of military successes, as far north as the boundaries of Cochin. In 1790 Travancore was attacked by Tippoo, who, having penetrated to Virapelly, would, but for the interference of Lord Cornwallis, have wholly subdued the province. In 1795 a treaty of alliance was concluded between the rajah and the British; and in consequence of some disputes, into which it is unnecessary to enter, a war took place in 1809, when the British troops took possession of the country with little opposition. The capital, which bears the same name, was formerly an extensive city, but is now much decayed, since the rajah removed his residence. Long. 77. 22. E. Lat. 8. 25. N.
