TOWCESTER, a town in the hundred of the same name, in the county of Northampton, sixty miles from London. It stands on the banks of the river Weedon, and was formerly a place of great repute. It has now only a little trade in making lace, and what arises from its being on the great north-west road. There is a well-supplied market on Tuesday. In 1821 the inhabitants amounted to 2554, and in 1831 to 2671.
