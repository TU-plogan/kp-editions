T, or t, the nineteenth letter and sixteenth consonant of our alphabet; the sound of which is formed by a strong expulsion of the breath through the mouth, upon a sudden drawing back of the tongue from the fore-part of the palate, with the lips at the same time open. The proper sound of t is expressed in most words beginning or ending with that letter; as in take, tell, hot, put. Ti before a vowel has the sound of si, or rather of shi, as in creation, except when s precedes, as in question ; and derivatives from words ending in ty, as mighty, mightier. Th has two sounds; the one soft, as thou, father; the other hard, as thing, think. The sound is soft in these words, then, thence, and there, with their derivatives and compounds; and in the words that, this, thus, thy, they, though; and in all words in which th comes between two vowels, as, whether, rather; and between r and a vowel, as burthen.

In abbreviations, among the Roman writers, T. stands for Titus, Titius, &c.; Tab. for Tabularius; Tab. P. H. C. Tabularius Provincia Hispania citerioris; Tar. Tarquinius; Ti. Tiberius; Ti. F. Tiberii filius; Ti. L. Tiberii libertus; Ti. N. Tiberii Nepos; T. J. A. V. P. V. D. tempore judicem arbitrumve postulat ut der; T. Μ. P. terminum posuit; T. M. D. D. terminum dedicavit; Tr. trans, tribunus; Tr. M. or Mil. tribunus militum; TR. PL. DES. tribunus plebis designatus; TR. AER. tribunis ararii; TRV. CAP. triumviri capitales; T. P. or TRIB. POT. tribunicia potestate; Tul. H. Tullus Hostilius. Among the ancients, T, as a numeral, stood for one hundred and sixty; and with a dash at top, thus T̅ , it signified one hundred and sixty thousand. In music, T stands for tutti, “all, or altogether.”
