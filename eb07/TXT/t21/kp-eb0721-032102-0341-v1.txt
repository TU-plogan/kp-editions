TOCAT, or Tokat, a large and commercial city of Asia Minor, in the pachalic of Sivas. It is built in the form of an amphitheatre, and is situated in a deep valley on the banks of the Jekil Irmak, the ancient Iris. The streets, though steep, from the unevenness of the ground, are well paved. Several manufactures are carried on in the place, namely, of vessels of copper, kettles, candlesticks, with which it supplies the neighbouring provinces; also of blue morocco and silk stuffs. It is a commercial mart of some note to and from all parts of Asia Minor. The population, amounting, according to Kinneir, to 60,000, consists chiefly of Turks, a considerable number of Armenians, who have seven churches, and a few Greeks, who have only one church. The trade is carried on by means of caravans, which arrive in eighteen days from Diarbekir, in six from Sinope, in twenty from Boursa, and in twenty-seven from Smyrna. Tocat is the ancient Berisa. Forty miles north-west of Sivas. Long. 36. 30. E. Lat. 39. 35. N.
