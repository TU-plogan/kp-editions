Teniers, David, the younger, also an admirable painter, was the son of the former, and was born at Antwerp in 1610. He obtained the name of Ape of Painting, from his imitating the manner of different painters with such exactness as to deceive even the nicest judges. He greatly improved under his father, and obtained such reputation as introduced him to the favour of the great. The archduke Leopold William made him gentleman of his bed-chamber; and all the pictures of his gallery were copied by Teniers, and engraved by his direction. The king of Spain and Don Juan of Austria set so high a value on his pictures, that they built a gallery to receive them. William prince of Orange honoured him with his friendship; and Rubens not only esteemed his works, but assisted him with his advice. His principal talent lay in landscapes adorned with small figures. He also painted men drinking and smoking, chemists’ laboratories, country fairs, and the like. His small figures are superior to his large ones. He died in 1694. Abraham, another son of the elder David Teniers, was equal, if not superior, to his father and brother in the expression of his characters, and his understanding the chiaroscuro; though he was inferior in the sprightliness of his touch, and the lightness of his pencil.
