TROYES, an arrondissement of the department of the Aube, in France. It extends over 589 square miles, is divided into nine cantons, and these into 121 communes, containing, in 1836, 90,923 inhabitants. The chief city, of the same name, is also the capital of the department. It is situated on the river Seine, and is the seat of a bishop, and of the departmental courts of law and revenue. The cathedral, dedicated to St Peter, is a fine old and large Gothic building. There are other four churches, among which that of St Martin is distinguished by remarkably fine painted glass windows. Troyes is now a place of great manufacturing industry, making large quantities of woollen and cotton goods. Much linen is made and admirably bleached. It has also establishments for making glass paper, leather, brandy, and vinegar. Its traffic is very considerable, and it has an appearance of great prosperity.
