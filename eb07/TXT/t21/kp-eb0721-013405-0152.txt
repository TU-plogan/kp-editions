TECHNICAL expresses somewhat relating to arts or sciences: in this sense we say technical terms. It is also particularly applied to a kind of verses in which are contained the rules or precepts of any art, thus digested to help the memory to retain them. An example may be seen in the article Μeμοrυ.
