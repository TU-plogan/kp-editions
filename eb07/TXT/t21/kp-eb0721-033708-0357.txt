TOOTING, a large village of the county of Surrey, in the western division of the hundred of Brixton, six miles from London. It consists of many seats of the richer merchants and gentry of the metropolis. It has a church, remarkable from being of a circular form. The river Wandle passes through the parish, and turns mills as well for grinding corn as for other mechanical operations. There is also a hamlet near it called Upper Tooting. The population amounted in 1821 to 1863, and in 1831 to 2063.
