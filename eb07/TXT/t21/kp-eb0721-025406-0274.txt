THUROCZ, a palatinate or district of the province of the Hither Danube, in the Austrian kingdom of Hungary. It extends over 460 square miles, but contains only about 45,000 inhabitants, of whom two thirds are Lutherans, and the remainder of the Greek church. The soil is poor, and the climate mountainous and raw; and the country better adapted for breeding cattle than for growing corn. The chief corn raised is buckwheat; but excellent crops of turnips and carrots are produced. The district produces no wine. The chief article for sale is the cheese of the milch cows. The district comprises four circles, six market-towns, and ninety-eight villages, besides a few hamlets, and it confers the dignity of a palatine on the noble family of Erbober. The capital is St Martin, a town situated on the river which gives its name to the palatinate, and contains about 2000 persons.
