TIARA, an ornament or dress with which the ancient Persians covered their head, and with which the Armenians and the kings of Pontus are represented on medals; these last, because they were descended from the Persians. Latin authors call it indifferently tiara and cidaris. Strabo says the tiara was in the form of a tower; and the scholiast on Aristophanes affirms that it was adorned with peacocks’ feathers.
