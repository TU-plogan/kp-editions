TINDAL, Nicholas, the nephew of Dr Tindal, was born in 1687, and educated at Exeter College, Oxford, where he took the degree of A. Μ. in 1713. He became a fellow of Trinity College, and obtained several pieces of preferment in the church. In 1738 he was appointed chaplain of Greenwich Hospital; and here he died on the 27th of June 1774, at the age of eighty-seven. He was the author or translator of several works, but is chiefly remembered for his translation and continuation of Rapin’s History of England.
