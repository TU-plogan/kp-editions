TARN and Gabonne, a department of the south-west of France. In 1808 it was formed out of portions of the several existing departments of Lot, Upper Garonne, Lot-Garonne, Gers, and Aveiron. In times before the revolution it was known as the Agenois, Lomagne, and Basse Marche du Rouergue of Upper Languedoc. According to its present state, it is bounded on the north by the Lot, on the east by the Aveiron and the Tarn, on the south by the Upper Garonne, and on the west by the Gers and the Lot-Garonne. Its area contains 366,976 hectares, equal to 872,440 acres, or 1363 square miles. It is divided into three arrondissements, twenty-four cantons, and 191 communes, with 242,184 inhabitants in 1836, who chiefly adhere to the Roman Catholic church, but among whom are between 30,000 and 40,000 Protestants. The face of the country consists of several extensive plains, about 1000 or 1200 feet above the level of the sea, with valleys of various extent intersecting them, through which their several streams flow. The principal rivers are the Garonne, the Tarn, and the Aveiron. The soil is various in fertility, but on the whole is productive. The plain of the Garonne is peculiarly so, and on both sides is lined with hills, which are covered with fruit trees and vineyards. The banks of the other two streams are rich, and present most picturesque prospects. Many of the farms on the Garonne are sold as high as from L.50 to L.60 the English acre. The climate is temperate, and sometimes the winter passes without snow, and the streams are scarcely ever frozen; but violent storms of hail, collected on the Pyrenees, occasionally descend and destroy the hopes of the cultivators. The business of agriculture is conducted with great care, and on the best of the soil the practice of fallowing is abandoned; but on the inferior land a yearâ€™s fallow is succeeded by two corn crops, as in most of the other parts of France. Much good wheat is raised, and the best of it is converted into flour for the West India markets. Other kinds of grain arc raised with success. Fruit is abundant, and forms articles of export when preserved, especially the plums and figs. Almonds, chestnuts, and walnuts, are also collected for trade, with abundance of wine, and wood for fuel and building. The only mineral procured is iron, and of that but little; but there are valuable quarries of marble, and some of mill-stones. Next to wheat, the amount of the value of the wine exceeds that of all the other products. There are manufactories of linen and woollen cloths, of china and earthen ware, of paper, cutlery articles, leather, and some silk goods. The three rivers already mentioned are navigable, and afford the greatest advantage to commerce by the facilities which they offer for the distribution of the heavy productions of the department. The capital is the city of Montauban, and it is also the chief scat of manufacturing industry. Its population in 1836 amounted to 23,865.
