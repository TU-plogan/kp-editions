TORO, a province in the north-west of the kingdom of Spain, which in ancient times formed the chief part of the kingdom of Leon. It is a large division, extending over 2025 square English miles, and is subdivided into three partidos. The most northern of these partidos is Reynosa, a very mountainous district, with narrow valleys. The other two, Carrion and Toro, have several mountains, but many plains, where, though the ground is rocky and stony, yet there are many spots of rich and fertile soil. The chief production is wheat, the next in quantity rye, which forms the principal food of the inhabitants of the mountains, and after that follow oats, linseed, beans, and a little maize. On the whole, the province raises more corn than it consumes, and some is annually transported to the neighbouring districts. The vineyards are extensive, yielding good wine, and much brandy is distilled from the grapes. the stock of cattle consists of 260,000 sheep, 10,800 black cattle, 3100 horses. 3900 mules, 4700 asses, 11,900 goats, and 15,200 swine; and its bees yield 3400 pounds of wax, and a proportionate but unascertained quantity of honey. According to Arguelles, the population was 97,370 persons, in 19,474 families. The number of houses inhabited was 17,875, and of those in ruins 2413. Two of the principal rivers of the peninsula, the Ebro and the Duero, water this province. The cities are Toro, Carrion, and Reynosa, the towns 82, the villages 239, the hamlets 391.

Toro, a city of Spain, the capital of the province of the same name, stands on the most fruitful of the plains, on the river Duero, over which is a bridge. It is not ill built, and the streets, though filthy, are not narrow. Toro is surrounded with old and dilapidated walls. It contains twenty-two parish churches, fourteen monasteries, four hospitals, 1606 houses, and 7500 inhabitants, who subsist chiefly by the little rent which they draw from the soil that surrounds them. It has nothing approaching to trade, except the domestic making of linen by each family for its own use.
