TEMPIO, a city of the island of Sardinia, the capital of the province Gallura. It stands in an Alpine district, and in a very salubrious situation. It is about twenty-five miles from the sea, is filled with antique buildings, some of the very extensive belonging to the nobility of the island. It is the seat of a bishop, whose cathedral is a large, heavy, uncompleted building, with decorations tawdry and ill executed. The city is well built, has a college, two monasteries, and a nunnery, and 5820 inhabitants. There is some industry employed in making guns and linen cloth, and some trade in preparing cheese, hams, bacon, and other salted meats.
