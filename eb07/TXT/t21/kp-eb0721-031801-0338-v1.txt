TITLE, an appellation of dignity or rank given to princes and persons of distinction. Titles were not so common among the ancient Greeks or Romans as they are in modem times. Till the reign of Constantine, the title of Illustrious was never given except to those who were distinguished in arms or letters; but at length it became hereditary in the families of princes, and every son of a prince was illustrious. The title of Highness was formerly given only to kings. The kings of England before the reign of Henry VIII. were addressed by the title of your Grace. That monarch first assumed the title of Highness, and afterwards that of Majesty. The title of majesty was first given him by Francis I. in their interview in 1520. Charles V. was the first king of Spain who assumed the same title. Princes, nobles, and clergy, generally have one title derived from their territories and estates, and another derived from their rank, or from some other remarkable circumstance. The pope has the title of Holiness. A cardinal is saluted by the name of Eminent, or most Emittent. An archbishop, besides being named from his diocese, is called his Grace and most Reverend. A bishop is also distinguished by the name of his diocese, and has the title of hit Lordship and right Reverend. Inferior clergymen are denominated Reverend.
