TARRAGONA, a city of Spain, in the province of Catalonia. In the period when the Romans governed Spain, this city was very celebrated as the capital of that division of the kingdom which is to the east of the Ebro, then denominated Tarraconia. The streets are narrow, and the [7:21:82] houses lofty. It is the see of an archbishop; but the cathedral, though large, is by no means handsome. It is a place of considerable trade, especially in brandies, great quantities of which, made in the plain near it, are shipped from its port. It has considerable manufactories of silk goods of various kinds; and the whole population displays a degree of industrious activity by no means usual in Spain. The best-tasted brandies are those from the hills belonging to the Carthusian convent, on the borders of the Campo; but those of the Campo are stronger. When first made, they are all as white and transparent as water; but by keeping in casks, and by artificial means, they become darker coloured before they arrive at the markets for sale. The city of Tarragona, as well as the country around it, abounds with Roman antiquities, whose investigation has always been a favourite pursuit with the more studious of the inhabitants. The city within the walls contains a population of only ten thousand; but the far greater number of inhabitants reside in the suburbs. Long. 1.46. 37. E. Lat. 4L 7. 6. N.
