TRICHINOPOLY, a celebrated town and fortress in [7:21:350] the Southern Carnatic, advantageously situated on the south bank of the river Cavery, opposite to the island of Seringham, famous for its magnificent Hindu temples. This city was formerly the capital of a Hindu principality, until 1736, when Chunda Saheb, the prime minister of the nabob of the Carnatic, acquired it by treachery. It was taken possession of by the Mahrattas in 1741, but lost by them to the Mahommedans in 1743. The town is situated on a hill or rock about 350 feet high, and was esteemed impregnable by the natives. In 1749 it devolved by inheritance to the Nabob Mahommed Ali; and it sustained a memorable siege by the French and their allies, which lasted from 1751 until 1755, in the course of which were displayed the great military talents of Laurence, Clive, and other officers, which had the effect of preserving the city, and of establishing a British candidate on the throne of the Carnatic. At present Trichinopoly is the capital of one of the districts into which the territory under the Madras presidency has beep subdivided. The surrounding country is rendered productive by the vicinity of that branch of the Cavery named the Coleroon. It has a strong garrison of both native and European troops, and is the residence of the civil authorities of the district. It contains a palace, a mosque, and two temples. Travelling distance from Madras 268 miles, from Seringapatam 205, and from Calcutta 1238 miles. Long. 78. 50. E.Lat. 10. 50. N.
