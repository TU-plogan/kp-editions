TRIBUNE, among the ancient Romans, a magistrate chosen out of the commons, to protect them against the oppressions of the great, and to defend the liberty of the people against the attempts of the senate and consuls. The tribunes of the people were first established in the year of Rome 259. The design of their creation was to shelter the people from the cruelty of usurers, and to engage them to quit the Aventine Mount, whither they had retired in displeasure. Their number at first was only two; but the next year, under the consulate of A. Posthumius Aruncius and Cassius Viscellinus, three more were added: and this number of five was afterwards increased by L. Trebonius to ten. See R ομaν History. Military Tribune, an officer in the Roman army, commander-in-chief over a body of forces, particularly the division of a legion; much the same with our colonel.
