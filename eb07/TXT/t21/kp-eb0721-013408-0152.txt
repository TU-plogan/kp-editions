TE DEUM, the name of a celebrated hymn, used in the Christian church, and so called because it begins with these words, Te Dium laudamus, We praise thee, God. It is sung in the Romish church with great pomp and solemnity upon the gaining of a victory, or other happy event; and is believed to be the composition of St Ambrose, bishop of Milan.
