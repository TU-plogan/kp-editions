TIVERTON, a town of the hundred of the same name, in the county of Devon, 163 miles from London. It stands on the river Exe, where the Leman joins that stream, and by the two the town is nearly surrounded. They are rapid streams, and well calculated for turning large machinery. The town was much enriched by its woollen trade; and since that has been on the decline, powerful engines have been framed for making lace, a trade that is carried on to a vast extent at present. There is a school founded by Richard Blundell, who was a clothier of this town, of great celebrity. It has four exhibitions or scholarships at Oxford, and the same number at Cambridge. The school-house is a very fine pile of building. Tiverton is a place of great antiquity, has been long incorporated, and now elects two members to the House of Commons. For municipal purposes, the town is divided into three wards, and is governed by a mayor, six aldermen, and seventeen councillors. There are markets on Tuesday and Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 8651, and in 1831 to 9766.
