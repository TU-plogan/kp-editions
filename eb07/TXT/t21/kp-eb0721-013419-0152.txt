TEFF, a kind of grain, sown all over Abyssinia, from which is made the bread commonly used throughout the country. We have no description of this plant but from Mr Bruce, who says that it is herbaceous; and that from a number of weak leaves surrounding the root proceeds a stalk of about twenty-eight inches in length, not perfectly straight, smooth, but jointed or knotted at particular distances. This stalk is not much thicker than that of a carnation or julyflower. About eight inches from the top, a head is formed of a number of small branches, upon which it carries the fruit and flowers; the latter of which is small, of a crimson colour, and scarcely perceptible by the naked eye but from the opposition of that colour. The pistil is divided into two, seemingly attached to the germ of the fruit, and has at each end small capillaments forming a brush. The stamina are three in number; two on the lower side of the pistil, and one on the upper. These are each of them crowned with two oval stigmata, at first green, but afterwards crimson. The first is formed in a capsula, consisting of two conical hollow leaves, which, when closed, seems to compose a small conical pod, pointed at the top. The fruit or seed is oblong, and is not so large as the head of the smallest pin; yet it is very prolific, and produces these seeds in such quantity as to yield a very abundant crop in the quantity of meal. From the similarity of the names, Mr Bruce conjectures it to be the tipha mentioned but not described by Pliny; but this conjecture he acknowledges to be unsupported.
