TAMBOUR de Basque, a well-known kind of small drum, commonly called a tambourine. It is much used among the Biscayans, and consists of one piece of parchment stretched over the top of a broad hoop, which is furnished with little bells. It is sounded by sliding the fingers along the parchment, or by striking it with the back of the hand, or with the fist or the elbow.
