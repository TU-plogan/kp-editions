TWENTY-FOUR Pergunnahs, a small district in the province of Bengal, situated chiefly to the south of Calcutta, on the east side of the Hooghly. This was the first territory of any extent possessed by the British in Bengal. It was ceded to them by the nabob Jaffier Aly Khan, immediately after the revolution of 1757, to which was afterwards added Lord Cliveâ€™s Jaghier. It comprehends about 882 miles of superficial extent, and constitutes one of the Bengal collectorships. Since it was occupied by the British, it has progressively improved in population, cultivation, and commerce. A great quantity of waste land has been brought into cultivation, and a number of temples and other buildings has been constructed. Within its boundaries, 190 seminaries, maintained from the produce of certain charity lands, and from voluntary contributions, have been instituted. The inhabitants may be estimated at 1,625,000, and the Hindus are in the proportion of three to one. Adding the population of Calcutta, 600,000, the total will amount to 2,225,000.

Twenty-four Rajahs, a large district of Northern Hindustan, situated between the 28th and 30th degrees of N. lat., and divided into twenty-four petty principalities, the whole of which are tributary to the government of Nepaul. Respecting these states little is known except their names.
