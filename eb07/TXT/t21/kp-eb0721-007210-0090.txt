Tambour, in the arts, is a species of embroidery. The tambour is an instrument of a spherical form, upon which is stretched, by means of a string and buckle, or other suitable appendage, a piece of linen or thin silken stuff; which is wrought with a needle of a particular form, and by means of silken or gold and silver threads, into leaves, flowers, or other figures.
