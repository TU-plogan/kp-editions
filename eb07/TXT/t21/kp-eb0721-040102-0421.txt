TUAM, a handsome town in the county of Galway, Ireland. It is situate on a rivulet, in a low but healthy situation, and is laid out on a regular plan; the market-house occupying the centre, from which four broad streets diverge. Of late, several useful improvements have been made, in widening the streets, erecting schools and other public institutions; but in the smaller streets and outlets, squalid poverty prevails to a great extent. Tuam boasts of very high antiquity in its ecclesiastical history; but no remains of its religious institutions now attest its former magnificence. It still however retains its importance, being now the seat of the bishop of Tuam, as well as of the titular archbishop of the same see. The cathedral is an ancient but small edifice; while that of the Roman Catholics is by far the finest of the modern buildings belonging to that body in Ireland. Here is also a handsome educational edifice belonging to the Catholics, called St Jarlathâ€™s College. There is a barrack for soldiers, and various other public buildings. Tuam has very much improved within these few years; it carries on a considerable retail trade, and a great deal of agricultural produce is sold at the weekly market. It possesses an extensive brewery, several tanneries and flour-mills, and the manufacture of linen and coarse canvass is carried on very successfully. There arc several free schools, at which some hundreds of children are yearly instructed. Tuam is situated on the great thoroughfare, and is distant from Dublin 126 miles. The corporation consists, by the charter of James I, of a sovereign and twelve free burgesses. the population in 1821 amounted to 4571, and in 1831 to 6883.
