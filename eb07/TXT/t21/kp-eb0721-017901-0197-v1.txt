TENBY, a town of South Walcs, in the county of Pembroke, 250 miles from London. It stands on the sea-shore, on a peninsula formed by the river Severn. It was in ancient times a place of strength and importance, having been protected by fortifications, and flanked with batteries, the remains of which are still standing. It has no other employment for its inhabitants but the fisheries, and the export of coal and culm. It has of late years become a well-frequented bathing place, and has been provided with the appropriate institutions for that purpose. It is a borough, and, jointly with Pembroke, Milford, and Weston, returns one member to parliament. Its municipal government consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors. There is a market on Wednesday and Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 984, in 1811 to 1176, in 1821 to 1554, and in 1831 to 2128.
