TINIAN, one of the Ladrone Islands, in the North Pacific Ocean, about forty-two miles in circumference, first discovered by a Manilla ship, which was cast away here in 1638. The author of Anson’s Voyage gives a most pleasing and romantic description of this island, as found by the crew of the Centurion in the year 1742. Commodore Byron, who visited this island in 1762, gives a description in every respect the reverse of that of Anson. He found it overgrown with weeds, and forests impenetrable, owing to a thick growth of underwood; the climate moist and sultry, and extremely unhealthy, owing to the violent and incessant rains; in addition to which it is infested with musquitoes and other venomous insects, as well as centipedes and scorpions. Tinian was visited in 1767 by Wallis, in 1787 by Captain Portlock, in 1788 by Captain Sever, and afterwards by other navigators, who all confirm the account given of it by Commodore Byron.
