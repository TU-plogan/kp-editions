TEREK, a considerable river of Asiatic Russia, in the government of Caucasus, which has its rise in the deep recesses of the snow-covered mountains in the loftiest part of the Caucasian chain, on the frontier of Circassia and Georgia. It flows with a rapid course northward towards the plains, whence it turns eastward, and flows along the foot of the mountain range, till, after passing Kizlar, it divides into three branches, and falls into the Caspian. It forms the boundary between the Russian territory and the Caucasian tribes; and, for the purpose of overawing them, a number of forts has been built along the river by Russia. It flows through a picturesque country; and its banks are adorned with fine forests of oak, while the lower parts produce vines, mulberries, and other fruit trees.
