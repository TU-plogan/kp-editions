TERNATE, one of the smaller Molucca Isles, on the west coast of Gilolo, about twenty-five miles in circumference, and formerly the seat of sovereignty over all the adjacent Molucca islands, Tidore, Bachian, Motir, and Ma-chian, which are properly the Moluccas, being the islands which originally produced the finer spices; and in the woods of Ternate larger nutmegs are still found than any that are produced in Banda. The king of Ternate was one of the most potent sovereigns in the Asiatic islands, extending his dominion over seventeen or eighteen islands, and maintaining a considerable naval force. When the Portuguese were driven from these islands by the Dutch in 1607, the native princes were forced to submit to their conquerors, who interdicted them from trading with any other European nation. The island contains a lofty peak, which sometimes discharges flamcs. Ternate formerly carried on a considerable trade with China, and with the other Asiatic islands. At present its chief produce is rice. It was taken from the Dutch in the course of the revolutionary war, but was restored at the peace of Amiens. It was again taken in 1810, and was restored to the Dutch with their other possessions in India by the peace of Paris in 1814.
