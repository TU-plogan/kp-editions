TRIPOLI, a country of Africa, in Barbary, bounded on the north by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south by the country of the Beriberies, on the west by the kingdom of Tunis and Biledulgerid, and on the east by Egypt. It is about 925 miles along the sea-coast, but the breadth is various. Some parts of it are pretty fruitful, but that towards Egypt is a sandy desert. It had the title of a kingdom, but is governed by a dey. Early in the last century Tripoli shook off its dependence on the Grand Turk. In other respects the government is not essentially changed; it is still a military despotism of the most ferocious description. Its piracies are now confined to Naples, Sardinia, and other states which have no efficient navy. See Barbary States.

Tn∣Poι.I, the capital of the state of the same name in Barbary, is a considerable town, with a castle and a fort. See Barbary States.
