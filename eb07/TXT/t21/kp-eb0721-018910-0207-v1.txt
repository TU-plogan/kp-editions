THALES, a celebrated Greek philosopher, and the first of the seven wise men of Greece, was born at Miletus about 640 B. c. In order to improve himself in the knowledge of the sciences, he travelled into Egypt, where he discoursed with the priests and other learned men. Some say that he married; but others observe that he eluded the solicitations of his mother on this head, by telling her when he was young that it was too soon, and afterwards that it was too late. Thales acquired great reputation by his wisdom and learning: he was the first among the Greeks who foretold eclipses of the sun, and made extraordinary discoveries in astronomy. He was the founder of the Ionian sect of philosophers, who were so denominated from his being born in Ionia. He maintained that water was the principle of which all the bodies in the universe are composed; that the world was the work of God; and that God sees the most secret thoughts of the heart. Among his wise maxims, the following have been recorded. The most difficult thing in the world is to know ourselves, the most easy to advise others, and the most sweet to accomplish our desires. In order to live well, we ought to abstain from what we find fault with in others. Bodily felicity consists in health, and that of the mind in knowledge. The most ancient of beings is God, because he is uncreated: nothing is more beautiful than the world, because it is the work of God; nothing more extensive than space, quicker than spirit, stronger than necessity, wiser than time. It was also one of his sentences, “that we ought never to say that to any one which may be turned to our prejudice; and that we should live with our friends as with persons that may become our enemies.” He thanked God for three things; that he was born of the human, not of the brute species; a [7:21:190] man, and not a woman; a Greek, and not a barbarian. None of the ancient philosophers ever applied himself more earnestly to the study of astronomy than Thales. Diogenes Laertius reports, that leaving his lodging with an old woman to contemplate the stars, he fell into a ditch; on which the good woman cried, “How canst thou know what is doing in the heavens, when thou canst not perceive what is at thy feet ?” He went to see Croesus, who was marching with a powerful army into Cappadocia, and enabled him to pass the river Halys without making a bridge. Thales died soon afterwards, at the age of about ninety. He composed several treatises in verse, on meteors, the equinoxes, &c. but they are all lost.
