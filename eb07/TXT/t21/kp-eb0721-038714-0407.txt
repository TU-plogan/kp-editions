TRIPOLIZZA, a town of Greece, the capital of a canton of its name, as well as, under the Turkish government, of the province of the Morea. It stands in an undulated valley at the foot of Maenalus, and, according to tradition, was built from the ruins of three neighbouring towns. It is about twenty-two miles south-west from Argos, and thirty north-west from the ruins of Sparta. Before the revolution, it was a tolerably well-built place, surrounded with walls, had a citadel, four large mosques, and six Greek churches, with 12,000 inhabitants. In the contest which led to the abandonment of the Morea by the Turks, this place was the theatre of bloody events. In 1821 it was occupied by the Turks and Mahommedan Albanians, when it was besieged from August to October by the Greek leader Colocotroni. The Albanians entered into a secret treaty with the Greek commander; and on the 5th of October, at an early hour, the besiegers made an assault, favoured as they were by the traitors in the garrison. The battle raged during the whole day, the Turks defending, from house to house, their positions with great firmness, till fires were kindled in several parts; and the Greeks, being fully masters, put to death the Turks, without distinction of age or sex, to the number of more than 6000 individuals. The plunder of this city was one of the means by which the Greeks were enabled to carry on the war, and to make themselves masters of the Peloponnesus. As Ibrahim Pacha with his Egyptian forces was in possession of Navarino in 1825, he also took possession of Tripolizza, and when he abandoned the Morea, he left this town a heap of ruins. The country around it is fertile; and if a good government should be established in the country, Tripolizza may yet revive, and become a flourishing city.
