TAVISTOCK, an English market and borough town in the hundred of the same name, in the county of Devon, 206 miles from London and fourteen from Plymouth. It stands at the foot of the mountains called the Forest of Dartmoor, by which it is well sheltered from northerly and easterly winds, and the situation is remarkably salubrious. The river Tavy passes by the town, but not being navigable, a canal has been constructed from Tavistock to the Tamar at Merwelham quay. A tunnel passes through a solid rock for more than 2500 feet, and not far from it is an aqueduct across a vale of considerable extent. The canal serves for the transport of copper ores and lead from the mines, and slates from the quarries, in the district, and brings coals, stone, timber, and other goods, to the town. This is an ancient town, formerly belonging to the abbey, some remains of which still exist, which was granted by Henry the Eighth, at the Reformation, to the family of the Russells. The refectory of the monks has been converted into a dissenting place of worship. A very handsome gate-house, and two towers, both opening into the vicar’s garden, are still standing. The trade of the town formerly consisted for the most part in the manufacture of serges and coarse woollen cloth, but these have for some years been on the decline. The mining business in the vicinity gives occupation to many of the inhabitants, and the smelting of tin and a great iron foundery afford some employment to others. The church is a large ancient building, and, besides some curious monuments, has a stone coffin, in which are preserved some human bones of gigantic size, attributed by tradition to a Saxon giant named Adulph. The greater part of the town belongs to the duke of Bedford. It returns two members to parliament. There is a well-supplied market on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3420, in 1811 to 4723, in 1821 to 5483, and in 1831 to 5602.
