TINNEVELLŸ, an extensive district of the south of India, in the province of the Carnatic, 150 miles in length by fifty in breadth, situated principally between the 8th and 10th degrees of north latitude, and occupying the south-east extremity of what is called the peninsula. It is bounded on the north by Madura and Marawas; on the south-east it is separated from Ceylon by the Gulf of Manaar; and on the west it is bounded by Travancore. It is, generally speaking, an open and level country, though it contains some woods and several hills, and is tolerably well cultivated thirty miles north of the town of Tinnevelly. It contains no ruins of magnitude; but is watered by many streams flowing from the western mountains, and in favourable seasons yields abundant crops of rice and cotton, the latter of an excellent quality. The chief towns are Tinnevelly, Tutecoria, Vypaur, Callacand, Natradacotta, and Coil-patam. Towards the southern and eastern extremities are many salt marshes. Owing to their low situations, an inundation some years ago broke into them from the sea, and did much mischief, rendering the soil unfit for cultivation. The population consists chiefly of Hindoos, who retain much of their primitive customs and manners. During the first wars in which the British were engaged in this country, it abounded with petty chiefs, called polygars, who were constantly quarrelling with each other, and plundering the country. They resided in fortresses in the midst of woods, where it was extremely difficult to follow them with a regular force. In this disorderly state the country continued till the year 1792, when it was taken possession of by the British, who reduced to obedience a number of their chieftains. When the war commenced in 1799 with Tippoo Sultan, those polygars took advantage of the absence of the army, and broke into rebellion. As soon as a sufficient number of troops could be spared, a large force was sent against them, and before 1803 they were all subdued; and this occasion was taken for disarming them, demolishing their forts and strongholds, and reducing them immediately to the civil authority of the Company. The rents were raised from 70,000 pagodas in 1803, to 569,315 pagodas, or to L.190,000.

Tinnevelly, the capital of the above district, is situated about twenty-five miles east of a range of mountains, and is large and populous. On three sides it is surrounded by extensive rice-fields, and on the west by rocky ground. The situation is not healthy, owing to the exhalations from the fields. Long. 71. 1. E. Lat. 8. 48. N.
