THAMES, a river of England. As this river passes through the metropolis, the reader will find, under the article London , a description of the most important circumstances relating to it in that part of its progress which is under the superintendence of the magistracy of London. Without entering into the disputes as to the origin of the river, which are prolix, and give no definite result, we take it up, where several of the streams meet, at Lechlade, where it first becomes navigable to London, at a distance by water of 138 miles. It passes by Bampton on its left to Oxford, bearing the name of the Isis, which it there loses, and adopts that of a smaller stream coming from Thame, and assumes the name of that place. It receives the water of the Windrush and the Evenlode above Oxford, and that of the Charwell as it leaves the city. It then proceeds to Abingdon and Dorchester, and enters the county of Berks at Wallingford, and in its course is augmented by small streams. From Wallingford it proceeds to Reading, where the Kennet joins its copious stream. It then washes the towns of Henley, Marlow, Maidenhead, Windsor, and Eton, and forms the boundary between the counties of Buckingham and Berks. At Colnbrook it receives the waters of the Coln, and soon becomes the boundary between the counties of Surrey and Middlesex, in which latter county, just above the bridge, is the London stone marking the boundary of the city’s jurisdiction. It afterwards has its body of water augmented by the streams of the Wey, the Wandle, the Lea, the Roding, the Darent, and the Medway, when it is lost in the great estuary at the Nore.

Thames, a river of New Zealand, which, about fourteen miles from its entrance, is as wide as the Thames at Greenwich. The course is from south to north.
