+=====================================================================+


TAMERLANE, or Timur Βεκ, a celebrated prince and conqueror, was bom in 1335, in the village of Kesch, belonging to the ancient Sogdiana. His origin is obscurely known, some writers describing him as of royal blood, others as the son of a shepherd. It is however evident that he chiefly owed his elevation to his talents and bravery. At the age of twenty-five he attained the highest dignities, with surprising courage, and an ambition astonishing to all the world. Endeavouring to perfect the great talents which he had received from nature, he spent nine years in different countries, where his strong sense and elevated genius appeared in councils and assemblies, while his intrepidity and valour, whether in personal combats or pitched battles, drew upon him the admiration of all mankind. He made himself master of the three empires of Jagatay Khan, Tushi Khan, and Hulaku Khan; so that his power, riches, and [7:21:73] magnificence, were immense. Of his grandeur vast monuments remain in the cities, towns, castles, and walls, which he built; in the rivers and canals which he dug, as well as the bridges, gardens, palaces, hospitals, mosques, and monasteries, which he erected in divers parts of Asia, in so great a number, that a king might be accounted very powerful and magnificent who should have employed thirty-six years only in building the great edifices which Timur caused to be founded. He undertook the conquest of India, and haying obtained possession of Delhi, he became master of the immense treasures of the Mogul empire. He afterwards invaded Syria, and took Damascus; and Bagdad having attempted to throw off his yoke, he put many thousands of the inhabitants to the sword, and delivered the city to the rapacity of his soldiers. In Bajazet, emperor of the Turks, he found a formidable antagonist. In 1402 they engaged on the plains of Ancyra; and in a battle which lasted for three days, the emperor was defeated and taken prisoner. According to the common account, the victor confined him in an iron cage. Tamerlane died on the 1st of April 1405, in the seventieth year of his age. When he found death approaching, he sent for his principal officers, declared his grandson his heir, and made them swear to execute his will. Having recommended brotherly love and concord to the princes his children, he ordered one of the doctors to read the Koran at his bed head, and often repeat the unity of God. At night he several times made profession of his belief, “that there is no other God than God,” and then expired.

Timur, according to the historian Arabshâh, was in his person very corpulent and tall. He had a large head, with an ample forehead. His countenance was agreeable, and his complexion fair. He wore a long beard, was very strong and well limbed; had broad shoulders, thick fingers, and long legs. His constitution was amazingly vigorous; but he was maimed in one hand, and lame of the right side. His eyes appeared full of fire; his voice was loud and piercing; he feared nothing; and when far advanced in years, his understanding was sound and perfect, his body vigorous and robust, his mind constant and unshaken like a rock. He was surprisingly happy in his conjectures; vigilant, active, and unshaken in his resolutions. He took great delight in reading history, and was well versed in the state of countries, provinces, and cities. He was penetrating, subtle, close, and dissembling; just by inclination, liberal from disposition; but ambition had in a great measure extinguished his humanity; war had familiarized him to blood; and his religious zeal had inspired him with the most cruel, implacable, and pernicious fanaticism.
