TARN, a department of the south-west of Frarwe, formed out of a part of ancient Languedoc. It is bounded on the north and north-east by the department of Aveiron, on the south-east by Herault, on the south by Aude, on the west by Upper Garonne, and on the north-west by Tarn-Garonne. Its area contains 573,977 hectares, equal to 1,363,942 acres, or 2131 square miles. It comprehends four arrondissements, thirty-five cantons, and 327 communes. The population in 1836 amounted to 346,614 persons, of whom about 40,000 are Protestants, and the remainder adhere to the Roman Catholic church. The face of the country is a mixture of plains, hills, valleys, and some few mountains, mostly covered with wooths. These are branches from the Sevennes and Lozere chain, which in this department has the name of Montagne Noire, and extends on the south side into the departments of the Upper Garonne and the Aude. The chief river gives its name to the department, and receives the waters of the Rance and the Agout, and is navigable from Guillac to its mouth. The northern division is in part watered by the Aveiron and the Viaur. The climate is mild and healthy, with summers of great heat, and with winters of very short duration, unattended by any severe frosts. The soil is generally fertile in corn, and produces more grain, especially wheat, than is consumed within the department. In the higher parts of the department rye is found to succeed better than wheat; but the quantity raised of both is usually about equal. In the lofty districts the pasture is good, but in the lower districts the plains are burnt up in the summer, and the cattle, though good, are small in size. The husbandry work is chiefly performed by asses or mules. There are but few sheep; and no care has hitherto been taken to improve either the flesh or the wool. Swine are very abundant, and geese still more so; and large quantities of both are cured by smoking, and form a valuable article of export. It is said not to be uncommon to see fat geese weighing as much as thirty pounds, the livers of which are considered a great luxury. Fruit is abundant, especially plums, cherries, and chestnuts; and woad, anis and coriander seed, liquorice and saffron, are carefully cultivated. The wine is extensively made, some of good quality; that near Guillac is highly esteemed, and is principally purchased for the Bordeaux market, to be shipped to foreign countries. Silk was once extensively obtained, but that commodity has of late years much declined. Mines of copper and of lead were formerly worked, but have now ceased; and the only mineral produced is iron, and that in very small quantities. The manufacturing industry is confined to the towns of Albi and Castres, and to the more hilly districts. The inhabitants produce woollen stuffs and serges, silk and cotton goods. The tanneries are numerous, and make more than sufficient leather for the domestic consumption. The department sends two deputies to the legislative chamber. Castres is the capital town, and had 17,602 inhabitants in 1836.
