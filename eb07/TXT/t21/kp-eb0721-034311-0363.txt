TRALEE, a borough and the chief town of the county of Kerry, distant from Dublin, by way of Limerick and Castle Island, 144 miles. It is situated upon the river Lee, which here falls into Tralee Bay, after passing through the flat and fertile tract of land which stretches along its shore. The town consists of two streets upwards of a mile in length, broken by a square in the centre, from which diverge several regular and well-planned cross streets. Many of the houses are well built, and inhabited by a respectable class of individuals; but there are many inferior houses and mud-huts interspersed throughout, and extending along the suburbs. It has several public buildings, namely, the court-house, county prison, infirmary, a handsome modern church, two Roman Catholic chapels, and several dissenting meeting-houses, and a barrack capable of containing 600 men. Tralee has of late years been very considerably improved, and the export and import trade has greatly increased. The number of vessels which entered its creek in 1838 amounted to eighty-four, having a tonnage of 6092, and cargoes valued at L.60,920. Those that cleared outwards in the same year amounted to 119, with a tonnage of 9512, and cargoes valued at L.95,120. The town is connected with the sea by means of a ship-canal recently opened; but as yet the principal shipping load and discharge their cargoes at Blennerville, about one mile and a quarter below the town. Tralee is governed by a provost and twelve free burgesses, who, with the qualified inhabitants, return a member to parliament. The population in 1831 amounted to 9568.
