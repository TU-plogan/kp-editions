TORRE del Greco, a city of Italy, in the province of Naples. It stands on the sea-shore, at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, by whose irruptions it suffered very considerably in the years 1637, 1794, and 1801. The second of these irruptions nearly destroyed the whole of the houses and public buildings. The depth of the lava was in some places twenty-five feet, so that the entrance to several houses is now in the second story. These events have not prevented the people from continuing to make it their residence; and it now contains upwards of 15,000 inhabitants, who are employed chiefly in the tunny, anchovy, and oyster fisheries. There is also a coral manufactory, and some good wine is made from the vineyards.
