TIMON the Sceptic, who is not to be confounded with Timon the Misanthrope, was a Phliasian, a disciple of Pyrrho, and lived in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus. He took so little pains to invite disciples to his school, that it has been said of him, that as the Scythians shot flying, Timon gained pupils by running from them. He was fond of rural retirement, and was so much addicted to wine that he had a successful contest with several celebrated champions in drinking. Like Lucian, he wrote with sarcastic humour against the whole body of philosophers. The fragments of his satirical poem Silli, often quoted by the ancients, have been carefully collected by Stephanus in his Poesis Philosophica, and by Brunck in his Analecta. Timon lived to the age of ninety years.

Τιμον, surnamed Misanthropes, or the Man-hater, was a famous Athenian, who lived about 420 b. c. He was one day asked, why he loved the young Alcibiades, while he detested all the rest of the human race; on which he replied, [7:21:311]“It is because I foresee that he will be the ruin of the Athenians.”
