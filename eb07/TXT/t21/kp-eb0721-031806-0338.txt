TIVOLI, a city of the papal dominions, the capital of a district of the same name, on the river Teverone, on the side of a hill. It is the seat of a bishop, has a fine market-place, a cathedral, ten parish and fourteen conventual churches, with 5550 inhabitants, but is an old and ill-built place. It is, however, much visited on account of the cascades of the Teverone, which present most exciting groups of objects. Near to it are the remains of the consular road, the remains of the Villa Adriana, the ruins of the gate of the villa of Maecenas, and those of the house of Quintilius Varus, with the temple of Vesta and the grotto of Neptune. Long. 13. 11. E. Lat. 41. 57. 49. N.
