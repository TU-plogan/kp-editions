THATCHAM, a town of England, in the hundred of Reading and county of Berks. It stands on the great road from London to Bath and Bristol, being fifty-three miles from the former city. It is well built, and was formerly a place of some consequence. It has a parish church and an endowed school. The parish is very extensive, containing 1149 acres of well-cultivated and productive land. The chief trade is attending on the numerous travellers that pass through. Within the parish there are two hamlets, Greenham and Midgham. In 1821 the whole population amounted to 3677, and in 1831 to 3912.
