THEURGY, ϑεουgγια , a name which the ancients gave to that sacred part of magic which we sometimes call white magic, or the white art. The word is formed from Θ εὸς , God, and ἔgγον , work; q. d. the art of doing divine things; or the power of working extraordinary and supernatural things, by invoking the names of God, saints, angels, &c. Accordingly, those who have written of magic in general, divide it into three parts: the first of which is called theurgy, as operating by divine or celestial means; the second natural magic, performed by the powers of nature; and the third, comprehending necromancy, sorcery, and witchcraft or magic, performed by the assistance of demons or departed men.
