TELLER, an officer of the exchequer, in ancient records called tallier. There were four of these officers, whose duty it was to receive all sums due to the king, and to give the clerk of the pells a bill to charge him therewith. They likewise paid all money due from the king, by warrant from the auditor of the receipt; and made weekly and yearly books both of their receipts and payments, which they delivered to the lord-treasurer.
