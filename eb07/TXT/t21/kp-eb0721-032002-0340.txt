TOBOL, a considerable river of Asiatic Russia, which has its rise near the northern extremity of the Oural Mountains. It joins the Irtysch near Tobolsk, after a course of nearly 400 miles. Its shores are generally flat, and liable to inundation. Its upper course is traversed by wandering bands of Tartars, but in its lower course the country is more cultivated.
