TRANSLATION is also used for the version of a book or writing out of one language into another. The principles of translation have been clearly and accurately laid down by Dr Campbell of Aberdeen in his invaluable Preliminary Dissertations to his translation of the Gospels. The fundamental rules which he establishes are three: 1. That the translation should give a complete transcript of the ideas of the original; 2. that the style and manner of the original should be preserved in the translation; 3. that the translation should have all the ease of original composition. The rules deducible from these general laws are explained and illustrated with much judgment and taste, in an Essay on the Principles of Translation, by the late Lord Woodhouselee; of which the third edition was published at Edinburgh in the year 1813.
