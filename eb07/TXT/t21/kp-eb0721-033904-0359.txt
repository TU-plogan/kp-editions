TORONTAL, a palatinate of the Austrian kingdom of Hungary, one of the three divisions which compose the Bannat of Temeswar. It extends over a plain, and is 2700 square miles in compass. Two thirds consist of arable land, and the rest of pasture, vineyards, and woods. It is watered by the Theiss, the Maros, and the Aranka, and their tributary streams. It is a district highly productive of corn, and is cultivated by colonists, who are mostly Germans or Bulgarians, with considerable skill and activity. The population consists of 214,500 persons. The chief town is Micklos, on the river Aranka.
