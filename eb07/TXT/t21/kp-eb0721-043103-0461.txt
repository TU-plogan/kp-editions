TURRIFF, a small but thriving and industrious town in Aberdeenshire. It is pleasantly situated on a gentle ascent on the right bank of a branch of the river Deveron, thirty-four and a half miles from Aberdeen. It was erected into a free borough of barony in the year 1511, by James IV. This town possesses manufactures of linen yarn, thread, and brown linen; and there is also a large bleachfield. In addition to the fine old parish church, which is not now used, there is a new and handsome one. There is also an episcopal chapel; and the earl of Errol has endowed a free school. The population amounted in 1821 to 750, and in 1831 to 1136.
