TITUS VESPASIANUS, the Roman emperor, the son of Vespasian; of whom it is related, that not being able to recollect any good action which he had done on a certain day, he exclaimed, “I have lost a day !” He might truly be called the father of his people; and though Rome laboured under various public calamities during his reign, such was his equitable and mild administration, that he constantly preserved his popularity. He was a great lover of learning, and composed several poems. He reigned but two years; and it is thought Domitian, his brother, poisoned him, a. D. 81, aged forty-one.
