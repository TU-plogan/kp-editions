TESSIN or Τιcινο, a canton of Switzerland, in the most southern part of the confederation, extending in longitude from 8° 5' to 8° 58' east, and in latitude from 45° 46' to 46° 33' north. It is bounded on the north by Uri, on the north-east by the Greybunden, on the south-east and south by Venetian Lombardy, and on the south-west and west by the Sardinian dominions. It is 781 geographical square miles in extent, contains twelve market-towns and 212 villages, thirteen monasteries, and seven nunneries, with 113,923 inhabitants in 1838, who all adhere to the Romish church. They are all of the Italian race, and speak that language, except about a thousand, who use a corrupted German, and live in one of the valleys, unconnected with their fellow-citizens. The contingent to the force of the confederation is fixed at 1804, and the pecuniary contribution at L.1127. 10s. It has lately received a new constitution of the representative kind, with a president changed monthly, and an assembly of 114, with another of eleven members. It is a most delightful and picturesque district, where, especially on the southern side, nature is exhibited in the wildest and most fantastic forms, intermingled with the valleys, which present less rugged beauty, and many of them a high degree of fertility. From St Gothard, 9000 feet high, the southern side displays the lakes scattered on the declivities. Although on the mountains there is little or no cultivation, with scarcely any productions except timber, and in a few summer months some butter, yet, on the declivities towards Italy, agriculture is carried on with great success. In some of the valleys prodigious crops of maize are gathered, in others the mulberry trees abound, and much silk is collected; and in most of them wine is extensively produced, though it is not well managed. Hemp, flax, tobacco, and all kinds of fruit, are likewise abundant. By the construction of roads, this canton has recently become more easily accessible, and the inns are much improved.
