THOMAR, a corregimiento in the province of Estremadura, in Portugal, on the borders of Beira and Alentejo. It comprises twenty-six cities and towns, seventy-nine villages, and 21,748 dwellings, with 108,740 inhabitants. The capital is a city of the same name, on the small river Na-bao, in a delightful country covered with olive and orange trees. It is well and regularly built. It has an ancient castle, four churches, four monasteries, a poor-house, a hospital, and 1100 houses, with 5400 inhabitants. From the oil produced there, they make abundance of soap; and some of them are occupied in making cotton goods. It stands on the site of the ancient city Nahancia, which was destroyed by the Moors.
