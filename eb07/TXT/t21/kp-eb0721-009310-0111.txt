TAURUS, a celebrated range of mountains, so called by the ancients, and which were said to extend from the Grecian Archipelago to the extremities of Asia. By some they were thought to take their rise in Caria and Pamphylia; and by others among the more modern geographers, on the coast of Cilicia, not far from Scanderoon. The range intersects Asia Minor from east to west, and advancing in a north-east direction, interrupts the course of the Euphrates, and spreads itself over the kingdom of Armenia, where it unites itself with Mount Caucasus. It then diverges into Persia with a variety of branches, of which the most conspicuous is that named Mount Zagros by the ancients. This long and lofty range formerly divided Media from Assyria, and now forms the boundary of the Persian and Turkish empires. It runs parallel with the river Tigris and the Persian Gulf, and almost entirely disappears in the vicinity of Gombroon; seems once more to rise in the southern districts of Kerman, and following an easterly course through the centre of Mekran and Beloochistan, is entirely lost in the deserts of Sinde.
