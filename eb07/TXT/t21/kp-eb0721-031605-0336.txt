TIREY, one of the Hebrides Islands, situated in long. 6° 52' W. and lat. 56° 32' N. Its length is twelve miles, and its greatest breadth about four and a half miles; and it contains about 13,000 Scotch acres, of which nearly 4000 are considered as arable. Its nearest distance from Mull, at Kilninian, is fourteen miles, and from Iona eighteen miles. Tirey consists of gneiss, composed of hornblende, quartz., and felspar; but from the inconsiderable elevation of the rocks, the course of the beds cannot be stated. The marble wrought in the island is remarkable for the fineness of its quality. The island in its general surface is flat, and so low that it is scarcely elevated twenty feet above the high-water mark. There are no streams in it except two, which issue from two small lakes, one at its southern, and the other at its western side. Water is however easily procured, by digging within a few feet of the surface. The soil of Tirey is in general light, and consists of calcareous sand mixed with peat-earth, which, together with quartz, contains a large proportion of shells. These, with the constant and regular moisture which it derives from its climate, render the island remarkable for the richness of its natural pasturage. There is not a single tree in the island, and it is entirely destitute of fuel, even of peat-moss, so that the inhabitants have to supply themselves, at much personal risk, expense, and labour, with this necessary article, from the island of Mull. They generally employ their capital in the rearing of black cattle; but the width of the ferries, and the risk and expense of freight, make a serious deduction from the value of their stock. Potatoes are cultivated to a great extent, and this has had a beneficial effect in the cultivation of much peat-land. Sheep have also been introduced with success. The population of the island is too great for its productiveness, and the inhabitants begin to feel the necessity of emigration. In 1831 they amounted to 4453.
