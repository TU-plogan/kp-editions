TALAVERA, usually distinguished by the addition to its name of de la Reyna, is the capital of a partido, which comprises within it almost the whole of the western side of the province of Toledo, in Spain. It is a place of great antiquity, containing many Roman monuments. When Spain was invaded by the Moors, it speedily surrendered, but was successively occupied and plundered by the contending armies as long as the Mahommedan power existed in the Peninsula. It is remarkable as the scene of the first great conflict that occurred between the British army under the command of the duke of Wellington, and the French. On the 27th and 28th July 1809, the British army, of 19,000, with a Spanish force of 40,000 indifferent troops, were repeatedly attacked in their position by a well-appointed French army of 47,000 French troops, under the command of the intrusive king Joseph Bonaparte. The conflict was severe, but the British repelled the attacks, and the enemy retreated. Though the victory was thus gain [7:21:71]ed, it was indecisive, as the duke of Wellington soon afterwards retreated, and his wounded men fell into the hands of the French. The city stands on a beautiful plain watered by the Tagus. It is but indifferently built, has seven churches, one of which, that of the Hieronymites, is very fine, and no less than twelve monasteries. It contains about 5000 inhabitants, but with the suburbs and contiguous villages about 8000. The chief occupation is the fabrication of silk stockings; but there are manufactures of soap, of earthen ware, of hats, and cordage, upon a small scale. Talavera is remarkable as the birth-place of Mariana, the historian of Spain. Long. 5. 1.5. W. Lat. 39. 59. 50. N.
