TAGANROG, a fortified city of South Russia, in Europe, in the circle of Rostow and province of Caterinoslaw, about 1300 miles from St Petersburg. It is built on an elevated tongue of land, on the Sea of Azoph, which forms a small bay, where the small vessels can be secured. From the favourable situation for trade, it has become an emporium for the productions that are conveyed from the interior of the empire by the great rivers the Wolga, the Don, and the Donetz. It is a kind of free port, has quarantine regulations, custom-house, naval and land police, and is furnished with a regular garrison. The chief impediment to the progress of the commerce from this place is the shallowness of the water in the Sea of Azoph, which forbids large vessels from approaching to nearer than two miles from the city. In spite of this obstacle, however, more than 1400 vessels have been loaded in one year, with wheat, iron, tallow, oil, cordage, leather, sail-cloth, and hides. Though the greater part of the ships are Russian, yet many of them are Greek, Austrian, and English. The country around is highly beautiful and fertile, and the fruits of warm climates come to perfection in the summer in the open air, especially the melons and grapes. The city has been rapidly increasing in population ever since 1805, and is now said to contain 20,000 inhabitants. The late emperor Alexander died here in 1825, whilst busily occupied in projects to improve the place, and extend its prosperity. Long. 38. 34. 25. E. Lat. 47. 12. 30. N.
