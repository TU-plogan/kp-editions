TOULON, an arrondissement of the department of the Vur, in France, extending over 504 square miles. It comprehends seven cantons, divided into 128 communes, having 99,012 inhabitants in 1836. The capital, of the same name, is one of the most complete naval arsenals belonging to France in the Mediterranean Sea. It has two good havens, one for the merchants and the other for the navy, with every convenience for the building and equipment of the largest ships. The entrance is good, and the port secure at all times. The entrance is protected by strong batteries, while several fortresses on the hills which surround the city completely command every part of it, as well as the arsenals and harbours. These were found so effectual, that when one of them, the fortress of Malgua, was taken by the French, the British, who were in possession of the harbours, the city, and the arsenals, were under the necessity of abandoning them with the utmost expedition. The place is divided into the old and the new town. It has a fine square, a beautiful town-hall, a Gothic cathedral with a magnificent portico, a theatre, and a palace for the intendant. The plain on which the city stands is fertile, and the hills that surround it are covered with vines, figs, capers, and olive trees, and yield abundance of fruits. The trade, which is not very great, arises from some manufactories of silk, woollen goods, and soap. Toulon has also some fisheries. In the year 1836 it contained 35,322 inhabitants. Long. 5. 50. 21.
