TEST Act is the statute 25 Car. II. cap. 2, which directs all officers, civil and military, to take the oaths, and make the declaration against transubstantiation, in the court of King’s Bench, or Chancery, the next term, or at the next quarter-sessions, or (by subsequent statutes) within six months after their admission; and also within the same time to receive the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper according to the usage of the church of England, in some public church, immediately after divine service or sermon, and to deliver into court a certificate thereof signed by the minister and churchwarden, and also to prove the same by two credible witnesses, upon forfeiture of L.500, and disability to hold the said office. This act, so incompatible with the principles of toleration, and injurious to the rights of dissenters, has happily been repealed by 9 Geo. IV. cap. 17.
