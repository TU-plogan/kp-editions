TALISMANS, magical figures cut or engraved with superstitious observations on the characterisms and configurations of the heavens, to which some astrologers have attributed wonderful virtues, particularly that of calling down celestial influences. The talismans of Samothrace, so famous of old, were pieces of iron formed into certain images, and set in rings: these were esteemed preservatives against all kinds of evils. There were likewise talismans taken from vegetables, and others from minerals.
