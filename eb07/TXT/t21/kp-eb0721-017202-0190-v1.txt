TELL, William, an illustrious Swiss patriot, chief instrument of the revolution which delivered the Swiss cantons from the German yoke in 1307. Grisler, the gover nor of these provinces for the emperor Albert, having ordered him, under pain of death, to shoot at an apple placed on the head of one of his children, he had the dexterity, though the distance was very considerable, to strike it off without hitting the child. The tyrant, perceiving he had another arrow concealed under his cloak, asked him for what purpose? To which he boldly replied, “To have shot you through the heart, if I had bad the misfortune to kill my son.” The enraged governor now ordered him to be hanged; but his fellow-citizens, animated by his fortitude and patriotism, flew to arms, attacked and vanquished Grisler, who was shot to death by Tell; and the association for the independency took place that instant.
