TEXEL, an island on the northern shore of the province of North Holland, separated from the mainland by the channel of Marsdiep, which is an entrance to the Zuyder Sea. It is about twelve miles long and three broad, and contains six villages, with 4950 inhabitants, who have flocks of 30,000 sheep yielding the finest wool. Near to it Admiral Blake, in 1653, gained a victory over Van Tromp; and another battle was fought in 1673 with the combined fleets of England and France against the Dutch, when the victory was doubtful. At this place, too, in 1799, a squadron of Dutch ships of war in a state of insubordination was surrendered to the British. There are fortifications on the island, commanding the anchorage.
