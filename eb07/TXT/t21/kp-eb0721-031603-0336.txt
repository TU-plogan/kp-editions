TIRANAS and Tonadillas (Spanish) are Spanish national melodies in ¾ time, and of a moderate movement, sung with an accompaniment for the guitar only. The Spanish dance-tunes, such as the Fandangos, the Boleros, and the Seguidillas, formerly much in vogue in Spain, were played on the guitar, often accompanied by the voice, and by castanets. The Bolero, a modification of the Seguidilla», is said to have derived its name from a dancing-master of Murcia, named Bolen.
