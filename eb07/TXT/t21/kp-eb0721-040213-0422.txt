TUNIS, a country of Africa, bounded on the north and east by the Mediterranean Sea and the kingdom of Tripoli, on the south by several tribes of the Arabs, and on the west by the kingdom of Algiers and the country of Esab. It is 300 miles in length from east to west, and 250 in breadth from north to south. See Africa.

T unis , a large town of Barbary, and the capital of the kingdom of the same name. It is seated on the point of the Gulf of Goletta, about eight miles from the place where the city of Carthage stood. It is of an oblong form, and is about four miles in circumference, with ten large streets, five gates, and thirty mosques. The houses are all built with stone, though but one story high; but the walls are very lofty, and flanked with several strong towers. It has neither ditches nor bastions, but a good citadel, built on an eminence on the west side of the city. Its population was estimated by Mr Blaquiere at 130,000. The harbour of Tunis has a very narrow entrance, through a small canal. In the city they have no water but what is kept in cisterns. It is a place of great trade, and is ten miles from the sea.
