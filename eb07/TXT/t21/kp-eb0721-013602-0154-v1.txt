TEHAMA, a large belt of sand, which stretches along the eastern shore of the Red Sea, and extends as far as the mountains in the interior. It is entirely barren, presenting an unvarying picture of desolation. It bears every mark of having been anciently a part of the bed of the sea. It is increased by the blowing of the moving sands, which appear in this place to be continually making encroachments on the limit of the Red Sea. It contains large strata of salt, which in some places even rise into hills; and on the shore the banks of coral are perpetually increasing, so as every day more and more to augment the danger of navigating the gulf.
