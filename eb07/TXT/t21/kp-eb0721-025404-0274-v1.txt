THURGAU, or Thurgovia, a canton of Switzerland. It is bounded on the north-west by the Rhine, on the north-east by the lake of Constance, on the south-east by St Gall, and on the south-west by Zurich. It extends over 265 square miles, is divided into eight circles, and in 1838 contained 84,124 inhabitants, of whom 72,191 were of the reformed church, and 18,500 adhered to the Roman Catholic profession. The canton has five cities, six market-towns, and 284 villages. the force required as the contingent to the general confederation is 1520 men, and the pecuniary contribution amounts to L.2280. The capital is the town of Frauenfeld, on the river Murg, with 1600 inhabitants. In the northern part the face of the country is either level or undulating, but in the south is rather hilly than mountainous, none of the elevations exceeding 2500 feet. The Rhine is the main stream, which receives the waters of the Murg, the Thur, the Sitter, and the smaller brooks. The climate is healthy and temperate. The chief pursuit is agriculture, which affords a sufficiency of corn, good crops of hemp and flax, and abundance of fruit and wine. There is some coal near Frauenfeld. The pasturage feeds upwards of 25,000 cows, and supplies large quantities of butter and cheese. The fishing on the lake of Constance is highly productive of salmon and other fine fish.
