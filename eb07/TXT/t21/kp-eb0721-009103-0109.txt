TATIUS, Achilles, a Greek writer, is supposed by Fabricius to have flourished in the third or fourth century. His age seems however to be very uncertain. Suidas, who gives him the name of Achilles Statius, informs us that having originally been a Pagan, he was converted to Christianity, and at length became a bishop. He is best known as the author of a romance, in eight books, “De Leucip-pes et Clitophontis Amoribus.” From the strain of the work, it may perhaps be supposed to have been written before his conversion. It first appeared in a Latin translation, executed by Annibal Crucceius; a portion of which was printed at Lyon in 1544, and a complete edition at Basel in 1554. The Greek text was first committed to the press by Commelin [Heidelbergae], 1601, 8vo. Another edition was published by Salmasius, Lugd. Bat. 1640, 12mo. This most learned individual, who was so eminently qualified for the task, is allowed to have executed it too hastily. After several intervening editions, followed that of Mitscherlich, which occupies the first volume of his Scriptores Erotici Groeci. Biponti, 1792-4,3 tom. 8vo. But the most elaborate and valuable edition that has yet appeared, was published by Jacobs, Lipsiae, 1821, 8vo. This romance has been translated into English, and other modern languages. A composition of a very different nature has likewise been ascribed to Achilles Tatius; but it may perhaps be considered as doubtful whether they were both written by the same individual. This is a fragment of a treatise on the sphere, ∏εgὶ ∑φaίgaς, and comprises an introduction to the Phaenomena of Aratus. It was first published by Victorius, with his edition of Hipparchus, Florent. 1567, fol. The Greek text, accompanied with a Latin version, was inserted by Petavius in his Uranologion, Paris. 1630, fol.
