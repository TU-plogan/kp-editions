TOWYN, a town of North Wales, in the county of Merioneth, on a river of the same name, 217 miles from London and eleven from Barmouth. the country around it is very fertile, and the parish is very extensive. The annual value of the landed property in it was estimated, under the assessment of 1815 to the property-tax, at L. 10,570. The village, though built of coarse stone, is respectable, and of late years has been much frequented by sea-bathers. In the church-yard is a huge pillar, supposed to have been erected to a Saint Cadavan. In 1821 the population amounted to 2369, and in 1831 to 2694.
