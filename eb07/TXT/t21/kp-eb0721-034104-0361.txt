TOULOUSE, an arrondissement of the department of Upper Garonne, in France. It extends over 619 square miles, and is subdivided into twelve cantons and 135 communes, with a population in 1836 amounting to 159,064.

Toulouse, a city of France, the ancient city of Tolosa, latterly the capital of the old province of Languedoc, and now the chief town both of the arrondissement of the same name, and of the department of Upper Garonne. It is situated in a fertile district on the banks of the river Garonne, which divides it into two equal parts, connected by a magnificent bridge, after the plan of Mansard, of seven arches, 810 feet in length and seventy-two in breadth, on which is a triumphal arch. The city is surrounded by walls, which yield an agreeable promenade to the inhabitants, and, with the broad quays which extend along the banks of the river, give to it an imposing appearance. When under the sway of the Romans, and forming one of the principal settlements of the empire, this city was adorned by numerous monuments; but in the course of ages these have been destroyed, and nothing now attests its former state but the remains of a small amphitheatre, and a single tomb in the cloister of the old church of the Augustines. In 1816 most of the buildings were more or less injured by an explosion of a powder magazine. The streets are narrow and crooked; brick buildings are too numerous; and the squares, with the exception of St Cyprian, are deficient in regularity; yet some of the edifices are to be admired, more particularly that of the Hotel de Ville, called the capitote, whose modern front is considered one of the finest in France. the principal institutions in the city are a well-frequented university, a school of medicine and surgery, a botanic garden and observatory, a public library, a school of artillery, an academy of fine arts with a collection of paintings, various charitable institutions and religious edifices, which, with the exception of one Protestant place of worship, belong to the Catholics. This city is the head-quarters of a military division, the seat of the prefect, and of the courts of law for the department. There is less trade than the situation of the city and the population would lead a stranger to expect. It is chiefly confined to the agricultural produce of the neighbourhood, and the manufacture, upon a small scale, of powder, snuff, brandy, starch, leather, pottery ware, cotton, silk, and woollen goods. There is also a royal cannon foundery, and yards for building vessels. In the vicinity there are many country houses and gardens, belonging to the wealthier citizens; and [7:21:342]this circumstance gives Toulouse an air of cheerfulness and prosperity much more resembling an English than a French town. The population in 1836 amounted to 77,372. Long. 1. 21. 16. E. Lat. 43. 35. 36. N.
