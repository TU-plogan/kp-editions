TOBAGO, the most southerly of the Carribbee Islands, lies in 60° 30' west longitude, and 11° 16' north latitude. It is about twenty-two miles long, and from four to nine miles broad. This island was discovered by Columbus in 1496, and received its name from the herb which was smoked by the inhabitants. Sir Robert Dudley visited it in 1580; and in 1608 James I. claimed its sovereignty, though no effectual attempts were then made to colonize it. In 1628 Charles I. made a grant of the isle to the earl of Pembroke; but it continued almost deserted till 1632, when [7:21:320] some merchants of Zealand sent over 200 emigrants, and founded a colony, to which they gave the name of New Walcheren; but before they were able thoroughly to establish themselves, they were attacked by the Spaniards of Trinidad, aided by the Indians, and the colony was utterly destroyed. Tobago remained deserted till 1654, when two opulent merchants of Flushing, named Lampsin, again colonized it, and raised it to be one of the most thriving commercial emporiums in the West Indies. About the same time the duke of Courland, to whom James I. had given a grant of the island, carried about a hundred families from Courland, and settled them on one of the most beautiful parts of the island, which was named after the founder. The island experienced various vicissitudes till it was taken by the British in 1793, in whose possession it has continued ever since.

Tobago consists of a mass of rocks, the highest part of which is towards the north-eastern extremity, where it rises to about 900 feet; it gradually descends towards the south-west, with small and delightful valleys interspersed. It is well cultivated where the rocks are not too steep. It has several good harbours, chiefly on the northern coast. The climate is considered unhealthy, the average mortality of the white troops having been ascertained to be at the rate of fifteen per cent. annually. The principal town is Scarborough, which is situated at the sea-shore, on the south coast.

By the census of 1835, the population consisted of,—

Males. Females. Total. Whites 250 30 280

Free coloured and blacks ... 3,000

Apprenticed labourers 4,515 5,290 9,805

13,085

The experts of Tobago amounted in 1836 to L.196,974, of which L.166,333 were for sugar and molasses, and L.29,960 for rum; thus showing that the sugar-cane produces almost the sole exportable commodities of the island. The imports during the same period amounted to L.73,947, consisting chiefly of wood and lumber, fish, corn, and British manufactures.

In 1836 there were four free schools in the island, with 347 scholars; and four private schools, one of which is connected with the Moravians, and two with the Methodists. The local legislature consists of the lieutenant-governor, a legislative council of nine, and a house of assembly of sixteen members.
