THANN, a city of France, in the department of the Upper Rhine, and the arrondissement of Befort. It is situated at the foot of a mountain, upon which the castle of Engel-burg stands, on the river Thuron, and at the entrance of the valley of St Martin. The church of St Theobald is a curious object, on the model of the cathedral of Strasburg, with a tower 300 feet in height. In 1836, Thann contained 3937 inhabitants, mostly using the German language, and employed in making cotton goods, hosiery, and leather, and in working some mines of coal in the neighbourhood.
