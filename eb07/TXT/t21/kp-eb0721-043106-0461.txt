TURUCHANSK, or Mangasea, a town of Asiatic Russia, on the Yenisei, the smallest and most northerly of all the Siberian towns which bear the name of a city. It derives its name Mangasea from a magazine having been originally built, in 1601, for the collection of the furs paid in tribute to Russia. It was removed from the river Taz, where it was first placed, to the mouth of the Turichan, and received the name of that river. The houses do not amount to more than 100, and are built in the most scattered manner. The principal part of the town consists in a little fort built of wood, and defended by four small pieces of artillery. The trade consists entirely in furs, which are exchanged for all sorts of merchandise. Most of the inhabitants are Cossacs, whose services are required to overawe the wild inhabitants of the neighbouring regions. The ground is barren, but the water-fowl in summer are innumerable. Long. 88. 44. E. Lat. 65. 40. N. The river Turuchan, on which the above town is situated, rises in the district of Turuchansk, and after a course of 200 miles, falls into the Yenisei near Turuchansk.
