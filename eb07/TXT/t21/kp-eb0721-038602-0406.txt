TRIM is the county town of the county of Meath in Ireland. It is situate upon the banks of the river Boyne, in the midst of a level, fertile, and populous district, and is distant thirty-two miles from Dublin. It is a place of great antiquity, and was formerly of such importance that several of the earlier Irish parliaments were held here. In consequence of its being made the residence and seat of government of the De Lacys, the inhabitants received many valuable privileges, which have partly come down to them at the present time. The town is built without regard to regularity, but it possesses many good private houses. The new county prison is a spacious and remarkable building, and the county court-house is also well built; but none of the other public buildings can be praised for their appearance. For several years the town has been declining, and at present it does not possess any trade or manufacture. Here are the ruins of King John’s Castle, which is perhaps the most extensive in Ireland. On the opposite side of the river are the remains of a very ancient and extensive abbey. The value of the commons or landed property, and other burgage property, is between L.700 and L.800 a year. The commons are divided into burgesses and freemen’s lots, and belong for life to the individuals who are either burgesses or freemen. The corporation consists of a portreeve, burgesses, and freemen, without restriction as to the numbers of the two latter. The population in 1821 amounted to 2304, and in 1831 to 3282.
