TROWBRIDGE, a market-town in the hundred of Melksham and county of Wilts, ninety-nine miles from London. It is situated upon an eminence near the river Ware, a branch of the river Avon, and is irregularly built. The principal street is spacious and well built; but the minor streets arc narrow, and contain many ancient houses. The town is paved and lighted with gas. The church is a spacious and well-built edifice, having a large tower at the west end, surmounted by a spire. There are also places of worship for dissenters. The inhabitants are chiefly occupied in the manufacture of woollen cloth, mostly kerseymeres and superfine broad cloth. The population amounted in 1821 to 9545, and in 1831 to 10,863.
