TIDORE, one of the Molucca Isles, in the Eastern Seas, about twenty-one miles in circumference, situated on the west coast of Gilolo, three leagues south of Ternate, from which it is separated by a safe channel, with good anchorage near the town. It is mountainous towards the centre; the mountains are high, and generally covered with clouds; and the lower country is well watered by streams which flow from the elevated ground. It is populous, and formerly contained twenty-five mosques. The Mahommedan faith generally prevails. The island was first visited by the Spaniards under Magellan. Here they formed a settlement in 1521, and in 1527 they were driven out by the Portuguese. In 1607 the Dutch arrived in those seas, and soon after expelled the Portuguese; from which time till its capture by the English, it remained in their hands. The sultan was at one period a very considerable potentate, but was entirely under the power of the Dutch, who elevated or deposed sultans according to their pleasure. The island carries on a considerable trade with New Guinea, Gilolo, the northern islands, and the Chinese. In 1579 Drake arrived at Tidore. Long. 127. 25. E. Lat. 0. 45. N.
