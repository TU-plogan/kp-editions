TALENT signifies both a weight and a coin very common among the ancients, but very different among different nations. The common Attic talent of weight contains 60 Attic minae, or 6000 Attic drachmae; and weighed, according to Dr Arbuthnot, 59 lbs. 11 oz. 17 1 / 7 gr. English Troy weight. There was another Attic talent, by some said to consist of 80, by others of 100 minae. The Egyptian talent was 80 minae, the Antiochian also 80, the Ptolemaic of Cleopatra 86 2 / 3 , that of Alexandria 96, and the Insular talent 120. In the valuation of money, the Grecian talent, according to Dr Arbuthnot, was equal to 60 minae, or, reckoning the mina at L.3. 4s. 7d., equal to L.193. 15s. The Syrian talent, in this valuation, consisted of 15 Attic minae, the Ptolemaic of 20, the Antiochian of 60, the Eubecan of 60, the Babylonic of 70, the Greater Attic of 80, the Tyrian of 80, the Eginaean of 100, the Rhodian of 100, and the Egyptian of 80 minae. There is another talent much more ancient, which Dr Arbuthnot calls the Homeric talent of gold, which seems to have weighed six Attic drachms or three darics, a daric weighing very little more than a guinea. According to this talent, some reckon the treasure of King David, particularly that mentioned 1 Chron. xxii. 14, which, according to the common reckoning, would amount in gold talents to the value of L.547,500,000, and the silver to above L.342,000,000. As David reigned in Judaea after the siege of Troy, it is not improbable but Homer and he might use the same numeral talent of gold. Among the Romans there were two kinds of talents, the little and the great talent. The little was the common talent; and whenever they say simply talentum, they are to be understood of this. The little talent was sixty minae or Roman pounds; the mina or pound being estimated at 100 drachmae or denarii. It was also estimated at twenty-four great sesterces, which amounted to sixty pounds. The great talent exceeded the less by one third part. Budaeus computes that the little talent of silver was worth L.75 sterling, and the greater L.99. 6s. 8d. sterling. The greater of gold was worth L.1125 sterling.
