TATTA, a district of Hindustan, formerly contained within the great soubah of Moultan, but now comprehending nearly the delta of the Indus, which has been already described under the article SINDE. The country is intersected by the overflowing waters of the Indus, and where these do not reach, it is mostly sandy and barren. It is noted for a fine breed of camels, which are pastured on the barren plains. It produces a quantity of rice and salt, and the rivers abound with fish, which articles constitute the chief food of the inhabitants. It is now part of the dominions of the Ameers of Sinde, who have impoverished the country by their extortions.
