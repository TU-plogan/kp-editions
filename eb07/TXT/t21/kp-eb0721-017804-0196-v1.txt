TENBURY, a market-town of the county of Worcester, in the hundred of Doddingtree, 134 miles from London, and fourteen from the city of Worcester. It stands on the river Terne, which here forms the boundary between the counties of Salop and Worcester. The situation is low; and from having a small but rapid stream joining the river Terne at the upper end of the town, Tenbury is sometimes liable to be flooded, from the effects of which the old Gothic church has more than once suffered. It has a good [7:21:179] corn-market, some trade in hops, cider, and perry, and a little in tanning leather and in making gloves. The. population amounted in 1821 to 1668, and in 1831 to 1768.
