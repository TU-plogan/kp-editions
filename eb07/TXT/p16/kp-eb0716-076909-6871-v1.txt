PALLANZA, a province of the principality of Piemont, in the continental part of the kingdom of Sardinia. It is bounded on the north by Domo d’Ossola, on the east by Lago Maggiore, on the south by Novara, and on the west by Val di Sesia. It extends over 506 square miles, contains 135 towns and villages, fifty-six hamlets, and 115,000 inhabitants. It is in the north mountainous, in the south undulating, but very generally picturesque, especially on the eastern side, near the Lake Maggiore, which is adorned with the Borromean Islands. It is productive of fruit, tobacco, chestnuts, and wine; but does not grow quite sufficient corn for the consumption of its dense population, who are frequently compelled to wander to other districts to seek employment and subsistence. The capital is the small city of the same name situated on a point of land running into Lago Maggiore, on which it has a harbour for small craft. It contains two churches, a nunnery, a public school, and 1320 inhabitants.
