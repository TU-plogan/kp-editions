PALERMO, a province or intendancy of the island of Sicily, belonging to the kingdom of Naples. It is formed out of the Val di Mazzara, and some portions of the Val di Demona. It is situated on the sea-shore, which is its western boundary, and is bounded on the east by Messina, on the south by Calataniferra and Girgenti, and on the east by Trapani. It is divided into four districts, viz. Palermo, Cefalu, Corleone, and Termini, and contains 410,000 inhabitants. The capital of the island, as well as of the intendancy, is the city of Palermo. It stands upon a beautiful gulf of the same name near Cape Gallo. It has a fine mole running out nearly a quarter of a mile from the arsenal, with a lighthouse, which forms a convenient harbour. The city is built upon a fertile plain; and the air in general is salubrious, but in some parts malaria is generated in autumn. Most of the houses have fountains, which contribute much to cleanliness. It is a well-built and not inelegant city. The most prominent buildings are the royal palace and the cathedral. There is an university, with a library, and a good observatoιy. Many fine specimens of Moorish architecture are still to be seen. The trade is considerable, and includes many articles produced in the island. It contains about 180,000 inhabitants. Long. 13. 20. 15. E. Lat. 36. 6. 44. N.
