PALLADIUS, bishop of Helenopolis in Bithynia, and next of Aspona. He was a Galatian, and born at Cappadocia. He became an anchorite in the mountain of Nebria in 388, and was consecrated bishop in 401. He was an intimate friend of St John Chrysostom, whom he never forsook during the time of his persecution, nor even in his exile. He went to Rome some time after Chrysostomâ€™s death, and, at the request of Lausus, governor of Cappadocia, composed a history of the anchorites or hermits, which he entitled Lausiaca, after the name of Lausus, to whom it was dedicated. This took place in the year 420, when the book was written; the author being then in the twentieth year of his episcopacy, and fifty-third of his age. Palladius was accused of being an Origenist. It is true, he was an enemy to St Jerome, of whom he does not speak well, and was intimately connected with Ruffinus; but perhaps no good proof can be brought of his Origenism. He had been the disciple of Evagrias of Pontus, and was even suspected of entertaining the sentiments of Pelagius. He died in the fifth century, but in what year is not certain. His history was published in Greek by Meursius, at Amsterdam, in 1619, and in Latin in the Bibliotheca Patrum ; buf he seems not to have been the writer of the Life of St John Chrysostom in Greek and Latin, printed in 1680.
