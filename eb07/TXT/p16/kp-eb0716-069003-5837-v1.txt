PACAJES, a province of Bolivia, in South America, in the department of La Paz. It lies in the vicinity of the great lake of Titicaca, but its dimensions cannot be exactly stated. Being in the neighbourhood of the Andes, its climate is cold, and its soil not very productive. The inhabitants, who are distributed in about fifteen small settlements, consist chiefly of Indians, and are employed for the most part in tending cattle and sheep, with which the province abounds, being well adapted for grazing. Several mines of silver and emeralds were formerly worked here, but this pursuit is now abandoned. There is a mine of talc, however, which supplies the whole of Bolivia and

Peru with plates of that substance, which is used as a substitute for window-glass. Pacajes, the capital of the province, is situated eighty miles south-west of La Paz, in a variable climate. Its chief commerce consists in the sale of cattle to the neighbouring towns.
