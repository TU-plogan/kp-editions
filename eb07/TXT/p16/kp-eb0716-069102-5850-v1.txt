PADANG-GUCHI, a small river of Sumatra, which runs into the sea on the western coast, between the 4th and 5th degrees of south latitude.

Padang, one of the principal Dutch settlements on the west coast of Sumatra, and to which all the other factories, as Pulo Chinco, Priaman, and Adjerhadja, were formerly subordinate. The town, with the fort, which is a square with four bastions of stone, is situated one mile up the river. There are on the opposite side mountains which command the fort at the distance of about 300 yards. Some pepper, camphor, and benzoin, are furnished; but since the establishment of the English at Bencoolen the quantity collected has been small. Padang was first visited by the English East India ships in 1649; it was then in possession of the Dutch, who retained it till 1781, when it was taken by the British, but given up at the peace of 1783. These settlements were again taken in 1794, but were given up to the Dutch at the general peace of 1814.
