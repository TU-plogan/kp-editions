PALUDAMENTUM, in Roman antiquity, was a habit which differed but little from the chlamys, except that the latter belonged chiefly to the lower class of people. It was worn by the officers and principal men amongst the Romans in time of war, who were therefore called Paludati; and this distinguished them from the common soldiers, who, because they wore the sagum, were called the Sagati. The paludamentum came down only to the navel, was open at the sides, had short sleeves resembling angels’ wings, and was generally white or red. It is sometimes used to signify the common soldier’s coat.
