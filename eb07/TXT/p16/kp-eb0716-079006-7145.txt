PANTELLARIA, an island in the Mediterranean Sea, belonging to the kingdom of Naples, between Sicily and Cape Bon in Africa, seventy-two miles south of Maritimo. It is about thirty miles in circumference, and is entirely volcanic, consisting of vestiges of lava, pumice, scoriae, and puzzolana. The interior consists of hills covered with brush-wood, and valleys well cultivated with vines, cotton, and fruit, especially raisins, but not yielding corn sufficient for the inhabitants. The capital is Oppedulun, a large but very poor place. It has a haven, defended towards the sea by a castle and another battery, and is convenient for small vessels, who load with wine, oil, cotton, archil, raisins, and some alum. The population of the island is 4600 persons, tolerably active, but of lax morality, many being fugitives from the law in, other parts of the Neapolitan dominions. Near Sataria Point are some grottos, called stoves, which emit vapours deemed efficacious in the cure of some diseases. Long. 11. 54. 20. E. Lat 36. 51. 15. N.
