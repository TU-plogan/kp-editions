PALES, in Pagan worship, the goddess of the shepherds, to whom they offered milk and honey, in order that she might deliver them and their flocks from wild beasts and infectious diseases. This goddess is represented as an old woman. Her festivals, called Palilia, were celebrated on the 21st of April, the day on which Romulus began to lay the foundation of the city of Rome; the ceremonies consisting in burning heaps of straw, and leaping over them. Some call the festival Parilia {quasi a pÎ±riendo y ), because the sacrifices were offered to the divinity for the fecundity of the flocks.
