PAHANG, or Pulo Pahang, a small island in the Eastern Seas, near the coast of Malacca, five miles east from the town of Pahang.

Pahang, a town of Malacca, on the east coast, situated twelve miles from the sea, on a broad and shallowriver, full of shoals. It is divided at its mouth, which is situated in lat. 3. 45. N., into two channels, which are navigable for small vessels up to the town. It is enclosed by a wall made of the trunks of trees joined close together, and about twenty-four feet in height. The streets are fenced on both sides with hedges of reeds, and planted with cocoa and other trees; so that it has more the appearance of an assemblage of gardens than of a regular city. It formerly carried on a considerable trade, and was visited by vessels from various parts of India, such as Bantam, Batavia, Japan, and China. At present the trade is carried on in vessels belonging to the place, in which are imported articles of European manufacture, such as iron, cutlery, glass; also piece-goods, woollens, tobacco, &c. In return they receive from the eastern islands cloves, elephantsâ€™ teeth, mace, nutmegs, rattans, sago, tortoise-shell. Gold-dust, with which the river abounds, is also a principal article of trade. The mouth of the river is in lat. 3. 45. N.
