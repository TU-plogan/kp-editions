PALICAUDCHERRY, a town of Hindustan, in the province, of Malabar. In the year 1766, Hyder Ali gave orders for building here a strong stone fort, which might serve as a point of communication between his new conquests and his fixed resources in the district of Coimbetoor. It is situated in the middle of the teak forests, on the bank of the Paniany River, by which, during the rainy season, any quantity of wood may be floated down to the seaport of Paniany, and from thence conveyed to Bombay or Ceylon. Around the fort are scattered many villages, estates, and bazaars; but there is little appearance of a town. The surrounding district contains 123,074 inhabitants. It was ceded to the British by Tippoo in 1792. The fort is 110 miles south from Seringapatam. Long. 76. 50. E. Lat. 10. 50. N.
