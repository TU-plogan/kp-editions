PACCALONGAN, a small European town and fort on the northern coast of the island of Java. It is the seat of the resident, and is chiefly peopled by natives and Chinese, though there are a few Dutch families. It is situated on the great road across the island, and near a forest, which is remarkably unhealthy. It is 282 miles east from Batavia.
