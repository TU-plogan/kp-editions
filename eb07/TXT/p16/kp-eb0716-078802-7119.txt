PANCRAS, a large parish formerly detached from the metropolis by wide and open fields, but now a great portion of the northern side of London. Within the last forty years it has been covered with large houses, composing some of the handsomest squares, and the widest and most uniformly built streets. The parish is very extensive, including a third of Highgate, the several hamlets of Battle-Bridge, Kentish Town, Somers Town, Cambden Town, and Tottenham Court Road, as far as Rathbone Place. The houses in the newly-built portion are not generally large, and many of them are small but neat; and as the rent is lower than in many other parts of the western portion of London, they are occupied by people of inferior wealth. Those houses which are of the superior kind are found, from their vicinity to the inns of court and the courts of law, to be appropriately adapted for persons in some way or other connected with the law, though many of them are filled by the families of mercantile men from the city. The old parish church is small, and still retains somewhat of its rural appearance. It is remarkable as the favourite burying-place of the Roman Catholics, and a very large proportion of the grave-stones exhibit a cross and the letters R. I. P., requiescat in pace, or, may he rest in peace. Two new churches have recently been erected, one of which, on the new road, is made the parish church, and is amongst the most magnificent of those new edifices. The growth of the parish may be seen from the population returns, thus: In 1801 the inhabitants amounted to 31,779, in 1811 to 46,333, in 1821 to 71,838, and in 1831 to 103,548.
