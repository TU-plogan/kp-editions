PADUA, a delegation of the Austrian province of Milan, in Italy, bounded on the north by Treviso, on the east by Venice, on the south by Polesina, and on the west by Verona and Vicenza. It extends over 837 square miles, is divided into twelve districts, containing 104 communes, and has a population of 296,000 persons. The land, except on the west side, is an extended plain. It is drained by the rivers Etsch, the Brenta, and the Musone; and it has numerous canals, which serve, many for irrigation, and some for navigation. The agriculture is well conducted, and yields abundantly wheat, maize, rice, and all kinds of horticultural products. Fruit is in superfluity, and much wine is made. Olives, hemp, flax, and silk are copiously grown, and afford employment to manufacturers, who fabricate various kinds of goods.

Padua, a city, the capital of the delegation of the same name, in Italy. It is built on the river Baglioni, which is connected by a canal with the several lagunes. It is surrounded with walls and ditches, and defended by several bastions. It has several fine squares, but the streets are narrow, and in general filthy, though they contain some very magnificent buildings, especially the palace or statehouse, the university, and the theatre. Besides the cathedral, it contains ninety-six churches and chapcls, sixteen hospitals, and 6000 houses, with 46,300 inhabitants. Its university is an establishment of great celebrity, and has at present upwards of forty professors, though only about three hundred pupils. There are depending on it an observatory, an anatomical theatre, a library with 60,000 volumes, and similar institutions. It is a place of some trade in the manufacturing of woollen goods, which, however, are chiefly of the coarser kinds. There are also silk and linen manufactures, a trade in wine, oil, and leather, and a transit commerce by the canal. Long. 11. 46. 38. E. Lat. 45. 23. 40. N.
