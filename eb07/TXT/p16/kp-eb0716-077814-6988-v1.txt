PAMPLONA, a province of Colombia, in the department of Boyaca. It is separated from Socorro on the south by the river Galinazo or Sogamoso; on the west from Mariquita and Rio Hacha by the great Magdalena; on the north it is bounded by Maracaybo, Rio Hacha, and Merida; and on the east by Varinas, at that part of the country where are collected the waters of the valley of Savateca, the sources of the Apure, a tributary of the Orinoco. The eastern branch of the Andes almost fills this province, and forms numerous valleys, by which the inhabitants easily communicate with the Gulf of Mexico by the Zulia, which forms a confluence with the Catatumba, near the Lake of Maracaybo. The towns situated to the west have likewise easy communications by the Sogamoso and the Canaverales, both navigable rivers. There are other streams besides, which are valuable to Pamplona in an agricultural or commercial point of view. The mineral riches of [7:16:779] this province are little known. It is reported that immense quantities of gold were obtained from the mines of Beta and Montuosa; and, in fact, the remains of great works can still be traced. Now, however, comparatively little is obtained, and that is conveyed to Giron by the waters which form the Canaverales. The sand of this river contains gold of twenty-three carats. There are also silver mines, and the metal which they yield is at the rate of eight ounces to one quintal of ore. The copper mines are rich; but from the very awkward manner in which they have been worked, they have proved of little benefit to the country. The soil of the territory upon which the city of Pamplona is built abounds with mica, which is occasionally found in large sheets, and is split into thin plates, which answer as a substitute for window-glass. Fancy articles of various kinds are likewise manufactured from it. Quartz, felspar, and granite are everywhere met with; and the whole geological features of the country attest the metallic and mineralogical wealth of Pamplona ;. but from the works being wretchedly conducted, it might as well be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

The soil of this province is upon the whole fertile, but the country remains comparatively a desert, from the indolence of the inhabitants. The district in which the capital is situated produces wheat, oats, maize, celery, cabbages, beans, French beans, and an infinite variety of other vegetables. Here they also cultivate some indigenous plants which are very useful, such as the common pine, the resin of which is used medicinally; the myrica, which produces the wax called laurel; a galium, the root of which furnishes an excellent yellow dye for cottons; and also several other kinds of dye-stuffs. One of the most remarkable spots of this district is Surata, the climate of which place is temperate. Ten thousand loads of meal are annually prepared here, the greater part of which passes through Ocaña, a place dependent on the province of Maracaybo, on its way to Monpox and Carthagena. The wheat is generally of an excellent quality, and affords two crops in the course of the year. At other places in this district wheat, sugar-cane, and rice are cultivated; but in none of the villages, with the exception of those of Mantanza and Ecce Homo, in the valley of Surata, is sufficient corn gathered to admit of exportation. The olive-tree is very common at Pamplona; but the mode of preparing the oil is either not known or not practised. In the valley of Taupa the nopal is literally laden with the cochineal insects, which are sent into the province of Tunja. Cotton is cultivated in the district of Giron, particularly in the parish of Rio Negro; and great quantities of it are annually sent to Monpox and Carthagena. Near to the parish just named an abundant amber mine has been discovered. The tobacco raised at Giron is of a very superior quality; and the entrepôt established at Piedecuesta contributes to the comfort of the people. Cocoa, of which considerable quantities are disposed of, succeeds very well on the banks of the Sogamoso, Surata, and Canaverales. These countries also furnish large quantities of capaiva balsam, and some building timber. If the road were open from Giron to the Magdalena, this place would enjoy very great commercial advantages. By this means the rocks of the Sogamoso, so destructive to boats, would be avoided; and, besides, a vast extent of unknown lands, situated between the Sogamoso and the Canaverales, would thereby be much frequented. The navigation of this river is far preferable to that of the other, although its waters are too shallow to allow very deeply laden vessels to traverse them. This stream is of great utility to the inhabitants of Rio Negro, who transport their grains by it much more quickly and cheaply than by Ocaña. Great quantities of Brazil wood are found at some places on the Sogamoso; and on the banks of other rivers there are several very fine cocoa plantations. The Cucuta cocoa, call ed Magdalena cocoa, from its being brought down by that river, is very much esteemed. Coffee and indigo are likewise cultivated in the province, but of much inferior quality to the cocoa. The fertility of the soil is not the only cause of the abundance of the cocoa-trees; the care of the cultivators contributes much to it. Experience has taught them to protect this plant by the shade of the ceibas and erytahrinas, and to surround them with flourishing hedges of citrons, fagaras, and acacias, which are highly ornamental as well as useful. The inhabitants also carefully water the cocoa-trees; but great ravages are committed on them by the tinea falsa. This insect is likewise very destructive to the corn and grain of the Surata. A considerable quantity of Cucuta silver passes by San Christoval into the Varinas. It is expended in the purchase of mules and cattle, of which nearly ten thousand head are bought annually; for although the province abounds in pastures which promise sufficient food for immense herds of cattle, yet the climate is very unfavourable to the raising of such stock. However, some horses, mules, sheep, and goats are bred; and a tolerably good morocco leather is prepared from the skins of the last. The dearness of meat causes a scarcity of tallow, for which vegetable wax is used as a substitute. A country which has but few articles to export cannot be accounted very rich; and Pamplona would even be very poor, were it not for the extreme division of property, which is the means of diffusing comfort through a great number of families. The llanos adjoining the valley of Savateca would be an advantageous opening for the grains of the country in exchange for cattle, were there any road to facilitate commercial intercourse. This might, however, be effected by following the direction of the valley watered by the Chitoya, which would appear to be one of the head streams of the Apure. By this means Pamplona would be brought into communication with Guiana. Giron might do so likewise with the distant provinces by the same road; and instead of paying very dearly for the provisions which this town draws from the llanos of Casanare by the salt mine of Chita (that article being chiefly derived from this place or from Zipaquira), it would procure them at a moderate price from those of Varinas. This article carries almost all the specie from Giron.

The most flourishing towns of this province are those of St Joseph and of Rosaria de Cucuta, notwithstanding the disadvantages under which they labour from want of an opening for their productions. Their territory, varied by the valleys watered by the Jachira, the Pamplona, and the Zulia, has some fine cocoa plantations. The appearance of Rosaria de Cucuta is extremely pleasing. Surrounded by rich haciendas in excellent cultivation, it stands as it were in the midst of a delightful garden. The perspective at the extremity of each street terminates in a beautiful vista, with high mountains in the back-ground. The town, which is not large, is neat and well built. The houses have a clean appearance, but are not large. The streets are paved, and have a current of water running through the middle. This town will ever be famed in the annals of Colombia, as the place in which the first general congress was held, and where the constitution was framed. It was also the place understood to have been fixed on as the future capital of Colombia, under the name of the City of Bolivar; but such has not taken place. The town of Salazar de las Palmas has declined in proportion as those of the valley of Cucuta have advanced in prosperity. Some rich parishes, however, particularly St Jago and Cayetano, may be reckoned amongst its dependencies. This town owes its name to the great variety of palms which cover that part of the province where it is situated. The different kinds found here are the royal palm, which affords wine and butter; the negro-head palm, the fruit of which can be worked like ivory; the noli and the murap-po[7:16:780], which latter is used in covering houses, and the twigs of which are eaten. Much of this province, from being traversed by the Andes, is of course very elevated. The town of Pamplona, situated in 8° north latitude, is about eight thousand feet above the level of the sea. This elevation, however, serves to moderate the temperature, which averages about 60° of Fahrenheit. But the climate is by no means agreeable, on account of the vapours which continually darken the heavens. Pamplona is situated in a valley about a league in extent, and is surrounded on all sides by high hills. It possesses a great many churches; and as the houses stand pretty well apart, from each having a portion of garden-ground attached to it, the city at a little distance has a spacious appearance. The surrounding fields are enclosed by stone walls in a very regular manner, imparting to the scene an air of proprietorship which is not often met with. The effect, however, which Pamplona has, as seen from the adjacent eminences, is considerably abated when the town is entered. It exhibits little of its former wealth and importance. Many of the houses are found to be abandoned, the streets are overgrown with grass, and the gardens are neglected. This city was founded by Pedro de Ursua in the year 1549. The gold and copper mines in the vicinity formerly gave it an importance which it does not now possess. The gold mines of Veta, which are within two days’ journey of this place, have not been regularly worked for more than a century; but the Indians occasionally bring grains to sell of a considerable size. Not many years ago a mass of pure gold was found which weighed upwards of six pounds. The parish church of Pamplona is reckoned one of the most handsome in the kingdom. The Jesuits had formerly a college here; and there were also several monasteries, which are now abandoned. The population of this town has been estimated at 3200. It is situated 180 miles west-southwest of Merida, 131 west of Varinas, and 270 north-east of Bogota. There appears to be no other place in this province deserving of particular mention. The whole population of Pamplona, consisting of whites, half-whites, and Indians, has been estimated at 75,000. (r. r. r.)
