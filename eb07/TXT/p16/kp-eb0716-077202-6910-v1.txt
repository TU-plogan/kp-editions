PALLET, amongst painters, a little oval table, or piece of wood or ivory, very thin and smooth, upon which the painters place the several colours they have occasion for, to be ready for the pencil. The middle serves to mix the colours on, and to make the tints required in the work. It has no handle, but, instead thereof, a hole at one end to put the thumb through, and thus hold it.

Pallet, amongst potters, crucible makers, and others, a wooden instrument, indeed almost the only one they use, for forming, beating, and rounding their works. They have several kinds of pallets. The largest are oval, with a handle; but others are round, or hollowed triangularly; and others, again, are like large knives, serving to cut off whatever is superfluous on the moulds of their work.

Pallet, in gilding, an instrument made of a squirrel’s tail, to take up the gold leaves from the pillow, and to apply and extend them on the matter to be gilt.

Pallet, in Heraldry, is nothing but a small pale. Upon one shield there are sometimes several pallets.
