PACHAMAC, a valley of Peru, in South America, ten miles south of Lima. It is celebrated for its pleasantness and fertility, but still more on account of a magnificent temple built by the Incas of Peru, in honour of their gods. When the Spaniards conquered Peru they found immense riches in this temple.
