PANIANY, a seaport town of the south of India, in the province of Malabar. It is situated on the south bank of the Palicaud River. It consists of about 500 houses belonging to traders, and 1000 huts inhabited by the lower classes of people, and forty mosques. It is very irregularly built; many of the houses are two stories high, built of stone, and thatched with cocoa-nut leaves. The houses are scattered over a wide extent of sandy plain; the river, though wide, has a bar at its mouth, which only admits the entrance of boats. The inhabitants are generally of the class of Mahommedans called Moplays. They were formerly very rich, and possessed vessels that sailed to Surat, Mocha, Madras, and Bengal. But they were reduced to great poverty by the oppressions of Tippoo Sultan. The exports from Paniany are teak timber, pepper, rice, corn, and cocoa-nuts. The chief imports are wheat, pulse, sugar, spices, &c. Paniany was taken possession of by the British troops under Colonel Humbertson in 1782. It was afterwards recovered by Tippoo, with whom it remained till the conclusion of peace in 1792, when, with the province of Malabar, it was annexed to the British possessions. It is forty miles south by east from Calicut. Long. 76. E. Lat. 10. 44. N.
