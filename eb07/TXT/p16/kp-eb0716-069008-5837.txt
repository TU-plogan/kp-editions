PACIFIC Ocean, the vast ocean which separates Asia from America. It is called Pacific, from the moderate weather which the first mariners who sailed in it experienced between the tropics; and it was called South Sea, because the Spaniards crossed the isthmus of Darien from north to south when they first discovered it, though it is properly the Western Ocean with regard to America.
