PALM has amongst almost all nations been regarded as an emblem of victory, and assigned as the reward of it. The reason why this tree was adopted and made use of to represent victory, is said to be, because it is so elastic, that if pressed by the greatest weight, it will rise superior to the pressure, and be able to restore itself to its former state, appearing almost invincible.

Palm Islands, a chain of islands near the north-eastern coast of New Holland, extending almost thirty miles in length, at the entrance of Halifax Bay. Long. 213. 25. W. Lat. 18. 53. S.

Palm-Sunday, in the Christian church, the Sunday next before Easter, being so called in memory of our Saviour’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, when the multitude who attended him strewed palm branches on his way.
