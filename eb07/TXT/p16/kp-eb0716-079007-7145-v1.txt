PANTHEA, in Antiquity, were single statues, composed of the figures or symbols of several different divinities. Joubert, who calls them pantheae, and has remarked them sometimes on medals, says that their heads were most commonly adorned with the symbols or attributes belonging to several gods. An instance of this appears in a medal of Antoninus Pius, representing Serapis by the bushel, the Sun by the crown of rays, Jupiter Ammon by the ram’s horns, Pluto by the large beard, and Aesculapius by the serpent twisted in his hand. Baudelot, in his dissertation on the Lares, observes, that the panthea had their origin from the superstition of those who, taking several gods for the protectors of their houses, united them all in the same statue, by adorning it with >the several symbols proper to each of these deities.
