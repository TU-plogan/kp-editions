PALLADIO, Andrea, a celebrated Italian architect, was born at Vicenza in 1518, being descended of a family, originally of Friuli. The celebrated Trissino was his friend and Maecenas. He made exact drawings of the principal works of antiquity in Rome, adding commentaries, which went through several impressions. But this, though a very useful work, was greatly exceeded by his Treatise of Architecture, in four books, which appeared in the year 1570. On this work Inigo Jones wrote some excellent remarks, which were included in an edition of Palladio, published by Leoni in 1741, in two vols, folio. Palladio died at Vicenza, on the 19th of August 1580, in the sixty-second year of his age.
