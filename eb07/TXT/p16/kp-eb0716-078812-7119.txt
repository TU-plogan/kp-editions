PANEGYRIC, an oration in praise of some extraordinary person or virtue. The name is Greek, <ιrαwιγvζ ∣ ς, being composed of παv, all, and αγειξω, I assemble ; because anciently in public and solemn assemblies of the Greeks, either at their games, feasts, fairs, or religious meetings, panegyrics were pronounced. To 'render these the more solemn, the Greeks used to begin with the praises of the deity in whose honour the games were celebrated; next they descended to the praise of the people or country where they were celebrated; then they lauded the princes or magistrates who presided at them; and, lastly, they bestowed eulogies on the champions, especially the conquerors, who had gained the prizes in them.
