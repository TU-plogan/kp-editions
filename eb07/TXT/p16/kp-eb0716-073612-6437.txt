PALAMOW, a district of Bengal, situated on the western frontier, between the 22d and 25th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by Rhotas; on the south and west it touches different wild districts of Gundâˆ™ wanch; and on the east it has Ramgur. It is the least populous and worst cultivated of any district in British India. It contains, however, both iron and coal; but the natives are not sufficiently advanced in civilization to explore the mines. The Burnah or Cayle River, which falls into the Soane, flows through it; and on its stream timber and other heavy articles might be floated down to Patna, if the country were more civilized. The principal towns are Palamow and Jaynagur. The former, the chief town of the district, is situated in a valley on the eastern side of the Cayle River, and is the residence of a rajah or zemindar. Long. 78. 10. E. Lat. 23. 52. N.
