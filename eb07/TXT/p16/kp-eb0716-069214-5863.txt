PAINSWICK, a market-town of the county of Gloucester, in the hundred of Bisley, 101 miles from London, and seven from Gloucester. It is pleasantly situated on the banks of a small stream which empties itself into the Stroud. The town is not large; but the parish is divided into four lythings, and contains 6510 acres of land. It is a place of great antiquity, having a church of various styles of architecture, with a tower, on which is a spire rising to the height of 174 feet. On the summit of a hill called Spire Head, adjoining to the town, are the ruins of an ancient fortification called Kingsbury Castle. It has a good market, which is held on Tuesday. The principal occupation consists in making superfine woollen cloths; and, by the population returns of 1831, the number of the families employed in trade and manufactures was 448, whilst those employed in agriculture were 195, and all others 243. In 1801 the population amounted to 3150, in 1811 to 3201, in 1821 to 4044, and in 1831 to 4099.
