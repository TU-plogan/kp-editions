PALO, a town of Diarbekir, in Asiatic Turkey, situated on the banks of the Euphrates, and near the edge of a mountain, the summit of which is covered with ruins, from which quantities of old coins and metals are occasionally dug up. The inhabitants amount to 8000, consisting of Turks, Armenians, and Koords. Earthquakes are frequent; and the houses are ill built. The river flows here with an extremely rapid current; and, from the weakness of the wooden bridge, whole caravans have sometimes been swept away when the river was swollen from the melting of the snows. It is sixty miles north of Diarbckir.
