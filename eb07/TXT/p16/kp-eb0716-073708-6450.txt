PALCATI Nor, or Balkasii, a lake of Northern Tartary, extending about 200 miles from north to south, and 110 from east to west. It is situated 700 miles east from the Aral. Its waters, though somewhat brackish, are not altogether unfit for drinking. It contains several small lakes near its southern extremity. On the west it has the country of the Kirghisses, and on the east the great plateau of Soongaria.
