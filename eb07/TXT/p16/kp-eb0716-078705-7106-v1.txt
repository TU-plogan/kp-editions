PANATHENAeA, Παναόηναια, in Grecian antiquity, an ancient Athenian festival, in honour of Minerva the protectress of Athens. Harpocration and Suidas refer the institution of this festival to Erichthonius IV. king of Athens, who lived before Theseus. Theodoret alone says that the feast was established by Orpheus. But be this as it may, till the time of Theseus it was never a particular feast of the city of Athens, and was simply called Athenaea ; that prince, however, having united all the people of Attica into one republic, they afterwards assisted at the festival; and hence the name Panathenaea, or the feast of all Attica. In effect, all Attica was present; and each division of the people sent a bullock for the sacrifices, and for the entertainment of the vast multitude of people assembled.

There were two festivals under this denomination; the greater and the lesser. The greater Panathenaea were exhibited every five years; the less, every thrçe years, or, according to some writers, annually. Though the celebration of neither employed at first more than one day, yet in after times they were protracted for the space of many days, and solemnized with greater preparations and magnificence than at their first institution. The ceremonies were the same in the greater and the Jesser Panathenaea; excepting a banner, on which the actions of the goddess were represented in embroidery, executed by maids, with the names of those who had distinguished themselves in the service of the republic· This only was borne at the greater. Prizes were established for three different kinds of combat. The first consisted of foot and horse races; the second, of athletic exercises; and the third, of poetical and musical contests. These last are said to have been instituted by Pericles. Singers of the first class, accompanied by performers on the flute and the cithara, exercised their talents upon subjects prescribed by the directors of these exhibitions.
