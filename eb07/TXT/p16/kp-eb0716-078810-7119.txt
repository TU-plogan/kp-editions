PANDORA, in fabulous history, a woman formed by Prometheus, to whom each of the gods gave some perfection. Venus bestowed upon her beauty; Pallas, wisdom; Juno, riches; Apollo, music; and Mercury, eloquence. But Jupiter being displeased at Prometheus for having stolen fire from heaven to animate the mass he had formed, gave Pandora a box, which she was enjoined not to open; and then sent her to the earth with this box, in which were enclosed age, disease, pestilence, war, famine, envy, discord, and all the evils and vices that could afflict mankind. This fatal box was opened by Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus, when instantly all the diseases and mischiefs with which it was filled spread over the earth, and Hope only remained at the bottom. Hesiod says Pandora was the first woman.

Pandora, a small kind of lute, with fewer strings than the ordinary lute. It is believed to have originated in the Ukraine, where it is used to accompany vocal music, or to play national and Polish dances. Some writers are of opinion that this instrument was known to the ancient Egyptians, and that amongst them it had three strings.
