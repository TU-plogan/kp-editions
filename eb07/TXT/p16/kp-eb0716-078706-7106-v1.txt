PANAULON, an enlarged German-flute, with sixteen finger-keys, and descending as low as G in the treble clef, with two ledger lines under the stave. It was invented a few years ago by Trexler of Vienna. To remedy its inconvenient length, the lower end was curved. The quality of its tone is not so good as that of the common German-flute; but still the panaulon may be effectively used in orchestra music, as a bass to the other flutes.
