PALINURUS, in fabulous history, the pilot of Aeneas, whose fate Virgil very pathetically describes. He fell into [7:16:769]the sea when asleep, and was three days exposed to the tempests, but at last got safe ashore, when the cruel inhabitants of the place murdered him to get his clothes. His body was left unburied on the sea-shore; and since no one could cross the Stygian lake before a hundred years were elapsed, if his remains had not been decently inter-Â· red, we find Aeneas, when he had descended to the regions below, speaking to Palinurus, and assuring him, that though his bones were deprived of sepulture, yet the place where his body was exposed should soon be adorned with a monument, and bear his name; and accordingly a promontory was called Palinurus.
