PANNIPUT, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Delhi. It is about four miles in circumference, and was formerly surrounded with a brick wall, which partly remains. In the centre of the town is the shrine of a Mahommedan saint, who flourished during the fourteenth century. The surrounding district is fertile in sugar, and a considerable trade is carried on by the town in that article, and in salt and grain. It is celebrated as the scene of two of the greatest battles ever recorded in the history of Hindustan. The first was in the year 1525, between the army of Sultan Baber and that of the Delhi Patan Ibrahim* Lodi, in which the latter was defeated and slain. The second, which was still a greater and more decisive action, took place between the combined Mahommedan army, commanded by Ahmed Shah Abdalli, king of the Afghans, consisting of 80,000 cavalry and infantry, and eighty pieces of cannon, and that of the Mahrattas, commanded by Bhow Sedasiva, nephew of the peishwa, who had under him about 70,000 regulars, with 15,000 Pindarries, and nearly 200 pieces of cannon. The Mahrattas were completely overthrown, and the whole host nearly destroyed; so that they were never able again to contend with any hope of success for the dominion of India. It is fifty miles north by west from the city of Delhi. Long. 75. 50. E. Lat. 29. 23. N.
