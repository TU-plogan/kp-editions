PAMPELUNA, or Pamplona, a city of Spain, the capital of the province or kingdom of Navarre. It was the place in which th⅛ ancient kings of that country held their court, and whence they exercised the mild government of that very limited monarchy. As a strongly fortified frontier town, it has many historical events connected with it in ancient times. Of a recent date, when Bonaparte had resolved on the subjugation of Spain, this place was deemed of so much importance to the success of his cause, that it was seized by an act of treachery, and employed as a depot for the supplies brought from France. After the French were driven out of Spain, it surrendered to the allied armies. In the civil war which still distracts Spain, it was held by the queen’s party, when, from want of pay and provisions, a bloody mutiny broke out amongst the troops, who murdered some of their officers, and compelled others to join them. After a time this mutiny was in some measure appeased; and the queen’s general, Espartero, having entered the place, an inquisition was held, when such bloody sacrifices of life were offered as have scarcely ever been known, except in France, in modern times.

In describing this city, a view of it can only be given as it appeared before the recent dreadful events. It is finely situated in the centre of a circular plain, called the Cuença, bordered with hills of no great height, which are projections from the Pyrenean range of mountains. The river Arga runs through and fertilizes the plain, which is highly cultivated, and very productive. It has a castle and fortifications, which are nearly impregnable. The streets are wide and clean, the houses arc well built, and the place is most copiously supplied with good water from several fountains. It is the seat of a bishop, and of the provincial government and courts of law. Besides a fine old cathedral, it has four splendid churches, thirteen monasteries, four hospitals, a college, 1650 dwelling houses, and 14,500 inhabitants. There are, or at least were, manufactures of woollen cloth, of parchment, of leather, of pottery and china ware, and of wax-tapers for churches and chapels. It is in longitude 1. 9. 50. W. and latitude 42. 49. 57. N.
