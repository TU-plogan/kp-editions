COLLUTHIANS, a religious sect who rose about the beginning of the fourth century, on occasion of the indulgence granted to Arius by Alexander, patriarch of Alexandria. Several people being scandalized at so much condescension, and, among the rest, Colluthus, a priest of the same city, he made this a pretence for holding separate assemblies, and by degrees proceeded to the ordination of priests, as if he had been a bishop, pretending a necessity for this authority in order to oppose Arius. To his schism he added heresy, teaching that God did not create the wicked; that he was not author of the evils which befal men; and other doctrines equally heterodox. He was condemned by a council held at Alexandria by Osius, in the year 330.
