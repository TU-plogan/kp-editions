COAT, or Coat of Arms, in Heraldry, a habit worn by the ancient knights over their arms, both in war and tournaments, and still borne by heralds at arms. It was a kind of surcoat, reaching as low as the navel, open at the sides, with short sleeves, sometimes furred with ermine and hair, upon which were applied the armories of the knights embroidered in gold and silver, and enamelled with beaten tin, coloured black, green, red, and blue; and hence the rule never to apply colour on colour, nor metal on metal. The coats of arms were frequently open, and diversified with bands and fillets of several colours, alternately placed, as we still see cloths scarleted, watered, and the like. Hence they were called devices, as being divided and composed of several pieces sewed together; hence the words fess, pale, chevron, bend, cross, saltier, lozenge, and the 'ike, which have since become honourable pieces, or ordinaries of the shield.

Coat of Mail, a kind of armour made in form of a shirt, consisting of iron rings interwoven netwise.
