CONTINGENT, something casual or eventual. Hence a contingent denotes a conditional event, which may or may not happen, according as circumstances fall out.

Contingent is also a term of relation,for the quota that falls to any person upon a general division. Thus each prince of the Germanic confederation is in time of war to furnish so many men, and so much money and munitions, as his contingent.
