CORUS, Omer, Homer, or Chômer, in Jewish antiquities, a measure containing ten baths, or seventy-five gallons and five pints, as a measure of things liquid, and thirty-two pecks and one pint as a measure for things dry. The corns or omer was most commonly a measure for things dry, and the greatest that was used among the Jews. It contained, according to the rabbin, ten ephahs or thirty sata or seahs. Coras is the most usual term in the historical writers, and omer or chômer among the prophets.

Corus is also used in some of our old writers for eight bushels, or a quarter; thus, decem coros tritici, sive decem quarte, ria.
