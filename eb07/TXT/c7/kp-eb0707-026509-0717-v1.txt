CONSECRATION, the act of devoting any thing to the service and worship of God. The Mosaic law ordained, that all the first-born, both of man and beast, should be sanctified or consecrated to God. We find also that Joshua consecrated the Gibconites, as Solomon and David did the Nethinims, to the service of the temple; and that the Hebrews sometimes consecrated their fields and cattle to the Lord, after which they were no longer in their own power.

Among the ancient Christians, the consecration of churches was performed with much pious solemnity. But in what manner it was performed for the first three ages, is uncertain, as the authentic accounts reach no higher than the fourth century, when, in the peaceable reign oťConstan-tine, churches were everywhere built, and dedicated with great solemnity. Some think that the consecration consisted in setting up the sign of the cross, or in placing a communion table in the church; whilst others, again, are of opinion that no more was done than preaching a panegyrical sermon in commemoration of the founder, and that then they proceeded to prayers, one of which was composed on purpose for the church to be consecrated.

In England churches have always been consecrated with particular ceremonies, the form of which is left in a great measure to the discretion of the bishop.

Consecration is particularly used for the benediction of the elements in the eucharist∙

Consecration, among medalists, is the ceremony of the apotheosis of an emperor, or his translation into heaven and reception among the gods. Upon medals the consecration is thus represented: On one side is the emperor’s head, crowned with laurel, sometimes veiled, while the inscription gives him the title of divus; on the reverse is a temple, a bustum, an altar, or an eagle taking its flight towards heaven, either from off the altar, or from a cippus; whilst, at other times, the emperor is seen in the air, borne up by the eagle, the inscription being always consecratio. These are the usual symbols; yet on the reverse of that of Antoninus is the Antonine column. In the apotheosis of empresses, instead of an eagle there is a peacock. The honours rendered to these princes after death were explained by the words consecratio, pater, divus, and deus. Sometimes around the temple or altar are put the words memoria felix, or memorice aeternoe, and for princesses, aeternitas and sideribus recepta ; whilst on the one side of the head is dea, or 3≡α.
