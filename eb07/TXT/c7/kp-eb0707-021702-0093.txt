CONI, a province of the kingdom of Sardinia, on the continent of Italy. It is bounded on the north by Saluzzo, on the north-east and north by Mondovi, on the south by Nice, and on the west by France. Its extent is 726 square miles, or 464,640 English acres. A great part of the southern and western portions of the province consists of the chain of the Appo Mountains, and is consequently unproductive; but the other divisions are watered by the rivers Stura, Grana, Macra, and Gesso, and numerous brooks, and are fruitful in corn, maize, pulse, fruit, hemp, silk, and wine. The mountains are covered with chestnut trees, whose fruit affords some part of the food of the inhabitants. The province contains four cities, fifty-six market-towns and large villages, and forty-one large farming establishments.

Coni, a city of Italy, the capital of the province of the same name. It stands on a tongue of land, formed by the junction of the rivers Gesso and Stura. It is strongly fortified, has several religious and other handsome public buildings, and contains 16,500 inhabitants, who carry on a considerable trade in various manufactures, particularly in woollen cloths.
