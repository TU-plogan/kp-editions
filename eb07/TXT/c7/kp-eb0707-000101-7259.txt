CLODIUS, Publius, a Roman descended of an illustrious family, who rendered himself famous for his licentiousness, avarice, and ambition. He introduced himself in women’s clothes into the house of Julius Caesar, whilst Pompeia, Caesar’s wife, of whom he was enamoured, was celebrating the mysteries of the Bona Dea, where no man was permitted to appear. He was publicly accused of this violation of human and divine laws; but he got himself chosen tribune, and by this means screened himself from justice. He descended from a patrician into a plebeian family in order to become tribune. He was such an enemy to Cato that he got him appointed with praetorian power to command an expedition against Ptolemy, king of Cyprus, that by the difficulty of the campaign he might ruin his reputation, and destroy his interest at Rome during his absence. Cato, however, by his uncommon success, frustrated the designs of Clodius. This man was also an inveterate enemy of Cicero, and by his influence got him banished from Rome, partly on pretence that he had punished with death and without trial the adherents of Catiline. He wreaked his vengeance upon Cicero’s house, which he burnt, and set all his goods to sale; but, to his great mortification, no one offered to buy them. In spite of Clodius, Cicero was recalled, and all his goods were restored to him. Clodius was some time afterwards murdered in an accidental rencontre by Milo, whose defence Cicero undertook, and wrote, but did not pronounce, the celebrated oration pro Milone, which is considered as his masterpiece.

CLOEBURY-Mortimer, a market-town of the hundred of Stoddesden, in Shropshire, 137 miles distant from London. It is situated on the river Cleme, near the Clie Hills. The market is held on Thursday. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 1602, and in 1831 to 1716.
