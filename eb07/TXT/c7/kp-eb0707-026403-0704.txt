CONNOR, Bernard, a learned physician, was born in the county of Kerry, in Ireland, about the year 1666. Having determined to apply himself to the study of physic, he proceeded to France, and resided for some time in the university of Montpellier. He afterwards went to Paris, where he acquired great skill in medicine, anatomy, and chemistry, and thence travelled to Venice, with the two sons of the high-chancellor of Poland; after which, taking a tour through the greater part of Germany, he went to Warsaw, where he was appointed physician to King John Sobieski. In 1695 he visited England, and read a course of lectures in London and Oxford; he then became member of the Royal Society and College of Physicians; and afterwards, being invited to Cambridge, he read public lectures at that place, and made various experiments in chemistry. He was the author of a philosophical and medical treatise in Latin, entitled Evangelium Medici, or the Physicianâ€™s Gospel, the object of which is to explain the miracles performed by Christ as physical events, upon the principles of natural philosophy. He also wrote a history of Poland, and died in 1698 at the age of thirty-two.
