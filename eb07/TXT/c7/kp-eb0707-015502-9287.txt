COMMENSI HABLE, among geometricians, an appellation given to such quantities as are measured by one and the same common measure.

Commensurable Numbers, whether integers or fractions, are such as can be measured or divided by some other number without any remainder; such are 12 and 18, as being measured by 6 and 3.

Commensurable in Power, is said of right lines when their squares are measured by one and the same space or superficies.

Commensurable Surds, those which, being reduced to their least terms, become true figurative quantities of their kind; and are therefore as a rational quantity to a rational one.
