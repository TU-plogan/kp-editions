COLDINGHAM, supposed to be the Colonia of Ptolemy, and called by Bede the city Coldana and of Colud {fJoludum), situated on the borders of Scotland, about two miles from Eyemouth,-was a place famous many agesago for its convent. This was the oldest nunnery in Scotland, for here the virgin-wife Ethełdreda took the veil in 670; but from the ancient name Coludum, ' ∖ t should seem that it had before been inhabited by the religious order called Guidées. In 870 it was destroyed by the Danes; but its name is rendered immortal by the heroism of its nuns, who, to preserve themselves inviolate from those invaders, cut off their lips and noses; and thus rendering themselves objects of horror, were, with their abbess Ebba, burnt in the monastery by the disappointed savages. After this it lay deserted till the year 1098, when King Edgar founded on its site a priory of Benedictines in honour of St Cuthbert, and bestowed it on the monks of Durham.
