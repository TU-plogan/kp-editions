CREMATION is sometimes used for burning, particularly when applied to the ancient custom of burning the dead. This custom is well known to have prevailed among most eastern nations, and it continued with their descendants after they had peopled the different parts of Europe. Hence we find it prevailing in Greece, Italy, Gaul, Britain, Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, until Christianity abolished it.
