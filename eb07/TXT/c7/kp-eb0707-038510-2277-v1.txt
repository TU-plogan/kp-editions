COTIOTE, a small district of Hindustan, in the province of Malabar, which, according to the report given in by surveyors, contains an area of 312 British square miles. The face of the country, like that of the other parts of Malabar, contains low hills separated by narrow valleys, which are fit for the cultivation of riee. Towards the Ghauts these hills rise to a considerable height; the soil is everywhere good, though it has been estimated that not more than one thirtieth part of the two districts is too steep, rocky, or barren for cultivation. This country was never [7:7:386] highly cultivated; and its unsettled state, with the calamities which it has suffered, would account for its lying almost waste. It continued long in a state of disorder, from the obstinate resistance made by the inhabitants to the dominion of the British. To this they were encouraged by the difficult nature of the country, which, wherever it is uncultivated, is covered by stately forests. The produce of these woods is of very little value. The valleys by which the wood-covered hills are intersected are fit for the cultivation of rice, and in some places of sugar, pepper, cotton, cassia, cinnamon, and coffee. In 1800 the number of houses was estimated at 4087, besides the rude tribes inhabiting the forests and hills. The imports of this territory are rice, salt, salt fish, oil, cotton, and cloth; in exchange for which its own produce is exported. This country was overrun by the armies of Hyder Ali in 1766, and again in 1774. The inhabitants rebelled against his son Tippoo, who in 1788 invaded the province of Malabar. When the war began between Tippoo and the British in 1799, the rajah, who had concealed himself in the woods, issued forth, and gave his aid to the British in expelling Tippoo. He was at the conclusion of the war reinstated in his government; but having proved himself inadequate to the task, he was superseded by a European officer, and allowed to retire with a pension.
