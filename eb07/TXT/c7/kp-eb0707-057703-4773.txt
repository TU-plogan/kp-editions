CYRIL, St, bishop of Jerusaler»:, born in that city about the year 315, succeeded Maximus in 350. He was afterwards deposed for the crime of exposing to sale the treasures of the church, and applying the money to the support of the poor during a great famine. Under Julian he was restored to his see, and was firmly established in all his old honours and dignities under Theodosius, in which he continued unmolested till his death, which happened in 386. The remains of this father consist only of twenty-three catecheses, and one letter to the Emperor Constantius.

Cyril, St, patriarch of Alexandria, succeeded Theophilus, his uncle, in 412. Scarcely was he installed when he began to exert his authority with great rigour, and drove the Novatiansand Jews from Alexandria, permitting their wealth and synagogues to be taken from them. This proceeding highly displeased Orestes, then governor of the city, who saw that if the bishop’s authority were not soon suppressed, it might grow too strong for that of the magistrate. Upon this a kind of civil war broke out between Orestes and the bishop; many tumults were raised, and some battles fought in the very streets of Alexandria. Cyril also distinguished himself by his zeal against Nestorius, bishop of Constantinople, who in some of his homilies had, with great propriety, asserted that the Virgin Mary ought not to be called the mother of God. The dispute at first proved unfavourable to Cyril, whose opinion was not only condemned, but he was himself deprived of his bishopric and thrown into prison. Re was soon afterwards released, however, and gained a complete victory over Nestorius, who, in 431, was deposed from his see of Constantinople. Cyril returned to his see at Constantinople, where he died in 444. He also wrote against Theodorus of Mopsuesta, Diodorus of Tarsus, and Julian the Apostate. He composed commentaries on Isaiah and the twelve lesser prophets, and on St John’s gospel, and wrote several other books, consisting of apologies, anathe-matisms, dialogues, canonical letters, homilies, and a treatise on adoration. His works were published in Greek and Latin in 1638, in six volumes folio.
