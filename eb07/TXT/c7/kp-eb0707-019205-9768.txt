COMPOSITE in general denotes something compounded, or made up of several others united together. Thus, Composite Numbers are such as can be measured exactly by a number exceeding unity; as 6 by 2 or 3, or 10 by 5; so that 4 is the lowest composite number. Composite numbers, between themselves, are those which have some common measure besides unity; as 12 and 15, both of which are measured by 3.

Composite Order, in Architecture, the last of the five orders of columns, and so called because its capital is composed of those of the other columns, a quarter round being borrowed from the Tuscan and Doric, a row of leaves from the Corinthian, and volutes from the Ionic. See Architecture.
