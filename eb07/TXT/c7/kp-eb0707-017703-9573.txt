COMMITMENT, in criminal law, is the sending to prison a person whf√¨ has been guilty of any crime, or charged with any offence. This takes place where the offence is not bailable, or the party cannot find bail. It must be done by proper warrant, containing the cause of the commitment; and it continues till put an end to by the course of law, imprisonment being intended only for safe custody, and not for punishment.
