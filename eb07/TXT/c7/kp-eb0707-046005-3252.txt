CREED, a brief summary of the articles of religious belief.

The most ancient form of creed is that which goes under the name of the apostolic creed. Besides this there are several other ancient forms and scattered remains of creeds to be met with in the records of the primitive church. The first is the form of apostolical doctrine, collected by Origen; the second is a fragment of a creed preserved by Tertullian; the third is the remains of a creed in the works of Cyprian; the fourth, a creed composed by Gregory Thaumaturgus, for the use of his own church; the fifth, the creed of Lucian the martyr; the sixth, the creed of the apostolical constitutions. Besides these scattered remains of the ancient creeds, there are extant some perfect forms, as those of Jerusalem, Caesarea, Antioch, &c.

The most universal creeds are, the Apostolical, the Athanasian, and the Nicene. These three creeds are used in the public offices of the church of England; and subscription to them is required of all the established clergy.
