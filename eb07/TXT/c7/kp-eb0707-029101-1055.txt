CONSTELLATION, in Astronomy, a system of stars seen in the heavens near to one another. Astronomers not only mark out the stars, but distinguish them by their situation and position in respect to each other; and therefore they distribute them into asterisms or constellations, allowing several stars to make up one constellation; and, for the better distinguishing them, they reduce the constellations to the forms of animals, or give them the names of those whose memories, in consideration of notable exploits, they desired to transmit to future ages.

The division of the stars by images and figures is of great antiquity, and seems to be as old as astronomy itself; for in the book of Job, which is undoubtedly as old as the time of Moses, Orion, Arcturus, Mazaroth, and the Pleiades, are mentioned; and we meet with the names of many of the constellations in the writings of the first poets, Homerand Hesiod. See Astronomy.
