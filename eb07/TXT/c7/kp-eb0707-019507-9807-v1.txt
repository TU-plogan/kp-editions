CONCAN, an extensive district of Southern India, in the province of Bejapoor, situated between the 16th and 19th degrees of north latitude. On the east it is bounded by the western Ghauts, and on the west by the Indian Ocean. On the north it is separated from Callianee by the small river Sawutry, and on the south it is bounded by the British district of Canara. It may be estimated at about 220 miles in length, and 40 miles in breadth. This country extends in a gradual slope from the mountains to the sea, and is watered by numerous mountain streams, but by no river of any magnitude. From Zyghur on the sea coast to the Ambah Pass, there is a rich hilly country, capable of cultivation, with a considerable number of inhabitants. Beyond this the mountains rise to a stupendous height, and are of difficult ascent. The products of this country are the same as in Malabar; and the hemp raised is said to be of a stronger quality than that raised above the Ghauts; but it is singular that the seed sown never reproduces the same quantity as before. The coast has a very straight general outline, but is much broken into small bays and harbours. This, with the uninterrupted view along the shore, the elevated coast favourable to a distant view, and the land and sea breezes which blow alternately in the twenty-four hours, and which force the vessels steering along the coast to be always within sight of it, have rendered this country from time immemorial the scat of piracy; and so formidable were the piratical depredators in the eighteenth century, that all ships suffered which did not receive a pass from the chiefs of the pirates. The Great Mogul maintained a fleet for the express purpose of checking them, and they were frequently also attacked by the Portuguese; but in the year 1756 they were completely eradicated, their principal port and fortress, called Gheriah, being taken by a British squadron, and their fleet destroyed. According to ancient traditions, this country was inhabited by a tribe of savages, till they were conquered by the Hindus, who gave it to a tribe of Brahmins; and it was held by them until it was taken possession of by the Mahommedan kings of Bejapoor. It was conquered in the seventeenth century by Sevajee, the founder of the Mahratta empire. Towards the close of the same century Conajee Angria established a kingdom on this coast, extending 120 miles from Tamanah to Bancoote, together with the inland country as far back as the mountains. The dominion of this prince and his family continued for nearly seventy years, when it was put an end to in the year 1756 by the allied British and Mahratta forces, the former under Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive; and the country, with the exception of Bancoote, now called Fort Victoria, was restored to the Peshwa. This country was definitively taken possession of by the British in 1818, and, from its maritime position, will prove a useful accession to their territories. (F.
