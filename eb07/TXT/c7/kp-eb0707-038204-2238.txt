CORYVRECKAN, Whirlpool of, a dangerous passage in the sea, about a mile in breadth, which lies between the south end of Scarba and the north point of Jura, on the west coast of Argyllshire. It is so named from a young Danish prince who perished there. Towards the Scarba side the sea is in almost perpetual tumult, arising from the narrowness of the passage through which the tide flows in and out to and from the sound of Jura. The turbulence of the water may also in part be ascribed to the presence of a pyramidal rock which rises with a rapid ae-clivity from the bottom, which is about one hundred fathoms down, to within fifteen feet of the surface. By this interference the current is forced to assume various intricate directions; and, on the other hand, a counter current is produced, chiefly on the Searba side, whose return into the main stream produces those gyrations, resembling the swells of Swinna and Stroma, which have been magnified into a whirlpool capable of engulphing ships. It is only when high tides and violent winds prevail that the place assumes the frightful character so opposed to the security of vessels. The place is generally avoided, however, by boats and small craft.
