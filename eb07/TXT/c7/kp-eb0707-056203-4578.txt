The neighbourhood was formerly infested by robbers, from whose depredations the Brahmins, an industrious class of persons, fled and concealed themselves, with their effects, in the forests during the rainy season. Under the British regime these disorders have been checked, and the tranquillity of the country maintained. Long. 74. 48. E. Lat. 14. 52. N.
