COCKERMOUTH, a borough-town in the ward of Allerdale, in Cumberland, twenty-five miles from Carlisle, and 302 from London. It stands near the confluence of the rivers Derwent and Cocker, and contains the remains of an ancient castle, which must have been of great strength. There are manufactures of leather, hats, shalloons, coarse woollens, and linens. The town is governed by a bailiff and a jury of sixteen burgesses. The principal market is held on Monday, and there is a smaller one on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2865, in 1811 to 29G4, and in 1821 to 3790.
