CODRINGTON, Christopher, abrave English officer, and not less distinguished for learning than benevolence, was born at Barbadoes in the year 1668, and educated at Oxford; after which he betook himself to the army, and by his merit and courage soon recommended himself to the favour of King W illiam, who made him a captain in the first regiment of foot-guards. He was at the siege of Namur in 1695; and, upon the conclusion of the peace of Ryswick, was made captain-general and governor-in-chief of the Leeward and Caribbee Islands. He died at Barbadoes on the 7th April 1710, and was buried there the day after; but his body was subsequently brought over to England, and interred, on the 19th of June 1716, in the chapel of All-Souls College, Oxford. By his last will, he bequeathed his plantations in Barbadoes, and part of the island of Barbuda, to the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts; and left a noble legacy to All-Souls College, of which he had been a fellow. This legacy consisted of his library, which was valued at L∙6000; and of L.10,000 in funds, which was to be laid out, L.6000 in building a library, and L∙4000 in furnishing it with books. He wrote some of the poems in the Musae Anglicanae, printed at London in 1741.
