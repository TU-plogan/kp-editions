COTTON is a soft vegetable down, the produce of the gossypium or cotton tree, of which there are many varieties. It grows naturally in all the tropical climates of Asia, Africa, and America, whence it has been transplanted, and has become an important article of cultivation in the southern parts of the United States, and to some extent also in Europe. Cotton is distinguished by its colour, and by the strength, length, and fineness of its fibre. White is generally considered as characteristic of secondary quality. That which has a yellowish tinge, when not the result of wetting or inclement seasons, is considered as indicating greater fineness. There are in the market many varieties of raw cotton, which principally derive their name from the places whence they arc brought. They are usually classed under the denominations of long and short stapled. The best of the first is that brought from the shores of Georgia, but its qualities differ very considerably. The superior samples of Brazil cotton are reckoned among the long stapled. The upland or bowed Georgia cotton forms the largest and best portion of the short stapled class. All the Indian cottons are short stapled.
