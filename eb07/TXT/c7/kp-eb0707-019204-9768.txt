COMPONITE, in Mineralogy, one of the zeolite family, in delicate transparent or semi-transparent crystals, which occupy the drusy cavities of the anciently ejected masses on Mount Vesuvius. Its form is an oblique four-sided prism, truncated on its lateral edges, and terminated with an extremely dihedral summit. It was first brought to this country by Lord Compton in 1818.
