COSTANZO, Angelo di, a celebrated Italian historian and poet of the sixteenth century, descended of a noble Neapolitan family, and lord of Cantalupo, was born at Naples about the year 1.507. Connected by ties of friendship with Sannazaro, and several other great men who then lived in the capital, he was eneouraged by them in his taste for study, and in the design of writing a history of the kingdom of Naples, which was still a desideratum; the work of Collenuaecio being deemed incomplete, partial, and full of errors. lie employed more than forty years in researches, particularly in the perusal and examination of the old chronicles and ancient titles, and then published at Naples the first part of his work in eight books. This specimen of his labours appeared in the year 1572, in quarto; but the author, being dissatisfied with his performance, set himself to eorrect, augment, and reconstruct it almost from the foundation. At length, in 1582, the work came forth in the shape in which it now appears, under the title of Le Istorie del Regno di Napoli dal 1250 Ji no al 1489, divise in xx. libri,. Aquila, folio, an edition which has now become very scarce even in Italy. The author therein treats of the period from the death of the Emperor Frederick II. to the war of Milan under King Ferdinand I.; and although lie has fallen into some errors, which were perhaps unavoidable in such a work, yet his history of the kingdom of Naples is still regarded as one of the best extant. It was reprinted at Naples, but very incorrectly, in 1710, 4to; and again, but with more care, in 1733, 4to. Lastly, it has been embodied in the great Milan Collection of Classic Authors, 1805, 3 vols. 8vo. Costanzo, who died at Naples about the year 1591, also occupies a distinguished rank among the poets of his age. His master in poetry was Berardino Rota, whom he greatly surpassed; and although he made no change in the form of the sonnet, which he adopted as he found it, yet he gave it a turn which the best poets have since taken as their model. His poetry in general is distinguished for the union of gravity with sensibility, which, in truth, constitutes its peculiar characteristic. His Rime, originally scattered throughout different collections, appeared for the first time together at Bologna, in 1709, 12mo. They have since been several times reprinted; but of all the editions, the best are those of Comino, Padua, 1723, 1728, and 1738, 8vo.
