CORRECTION, in Printing, the act of retrenching the faults of a work; or the reading which the corrector gives the first proofs, in order to point out and amend the faults which are to be rectified by the compositor.

The corrections are placed on the margin of each page, right against the line where the faults are found. There are different characters used to express different corrections, asTĴ or δ, dele, for any thing to be effaced or left out. When any thing is to be inserted, the place is marked in the line with a caret λ, and the insertion added in the margin. When a word, syllable, or the like, is tobe altered, it is erased out of the proof, and that tobe put in its stead is written in the margin; always observing, if there be several mistakes in the same line, that the corrections in the margin be separated by little bars or strokes, thus, ļ. If a space be omitted, its place is marked with a caret, and the margin with ⅝'. If a space be wrong placed, as in the middle of a word, the two parts are connected with a cu rve, and the same character put in the margin. If a letter be inverted, this is expressed on the margin by Ç, If any thing be transposed, it is marked thus: The shortest ∖ are the ∖ follics ∖ best; for the shortestfolliesare the best; andon the margin is added tr. in a circle. If Roman characters are to be changed for Italic, or vice versa, a line is drawn under them thus, and Roman or Italic added to the margin: if lower case letters are to be altered into small capitals, a double line is used. If a sentence is entirely omitted, the place is marked with a caret, and in the margin is inserted the word out, and a reference made to the page of the copy in which the sentence occurs. If the letters of a word stand too far asunder, a line is drawn under them, and in the margin is put a crooked line or hook, thus x ~,.

Correction House, a place of confinement, where vagrants and persons guilty of offences of an inferior degree suffer punishment by being obliged to labour for a certain period of time, as for months or years, according to the nature of the offence committed. The benefits arising to society, and the reformation of offenders, from this mode of punishment, have been variously estimated by different writers, according to the views which they have taken of the effects and consequences which are supposed to follow the confinement and restraint to which the criminal is subjected. See Punishments.
