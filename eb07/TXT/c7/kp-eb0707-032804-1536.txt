CORIOLANUS, Caius Marcius, a celebrated Roman captain, who took Corioli, a town of the Volscians, whence he derived his surname. At last, having disgusted the people, he was banished from Rome by the tribune Decius. He went over to the Volscians, and having persuaded them to take arms against the Romans, encamped within four miles of the city. An attempt was now made to negotiate; but he would not listen to proposals of peace, till he was prevailed upon by his mother Veturia, and his wife Volumnia, who overcame his resolution with their tears, and saved Rome, but ruined Coriolanus. He was put to death by the Volscians as a traitor who had caused them to abandon their conquest; upon which the Roman ladies went into mourning, and in the place where his blood had been spilt a temple was consecrated to female fortune.
