CUTTING, a term used in various senses in various arts; but in general it implies a division or separation.

Cutting is particularly used in heraldry where the shield is divided into two equal parts from right to left, parallel to the horizon, or in the fesse-way.

The word is also applied to the honourable ordinaries, and even to animals and moveables, when they are divided equally the same way, so as that one moiety is colour, and the other metal. The ordinaries are said to be cut, couped, when they do not come full to the extremities of the shield.

Cutting, in the manege, is when the horseâ€™s feet inter- l fere, or when with the shoe of one foot he beats off the skin from the pastern joint of another. This is more frequent in the hind feet than in the fore; and the causes are either weariness, weakness in the reins, not knowing how to go, or ill shoeing.

Cutting, in Painting, the laying one strong lively colour over another, without any shade or softening. The cutting of colours has always a disagreeable effect.

Cuttings, or slips, in Gardening, the branches or sprigs of trees or plants cut or slipped off to set again, which is done in any moist fine earth. (See Horticulture).
