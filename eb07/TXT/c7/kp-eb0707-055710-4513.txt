CUSA, Nicholas de, a learned cardinal, of mean parentage, and so named from Cusa, the place of his birth. He was made a cardinal in 1448; and being appointed governor of Rome by Pope Pius II. during his absence at Mantua, he became the chief author and manager of the war against the Turks. He founded a church, and a noble library of Greek and Latin authors, at Cusa; and left many excellent works, which were collected and published in three volumes at Basil in 1565. In these he made no scruple to expose the fabulous traditions and the sophistries of the Roman church.
