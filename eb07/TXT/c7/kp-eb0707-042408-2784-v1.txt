COULAN, a town of Hindustan, situated on the coast of Travancore. It is a very ancient place, having, according to tradition, been built in 825; and in confirmation of this event, the inhabitants commence their era at the period of its foundation. It was at this place that Alexius Menezes, the first archbishop of Goa, opened his conference with the Christians of St Thomas, when he induced them to renounce the principles of Nestorius, and embrace the doctrines of the Roman Catholic church, of which religion there are three churches in the town. Still the great majority of the people are Hindus; and the Brahmins possess here a very ancient temple dedicated to Mahadeva, or Siva. This place carries on a considerable trade, and is a great depot of goods, such as cotton, pepper, ginger, cardamums, and other articles of merchandise. Provisions are also very cheap, and there is abundance of fine fish. Long. 76. 48. E. Lat. 8. 51. N.
