CORPULENCY, the state of a person too much loaded with flesh or fat. Corpulency was held infamous among the ancient Lacedaemonians. Sennertus mentions a man who weighed six hundred pounds, and a woman thirty-six years of age who weighed four hundred and fifty. Bright of Malden, who died at the age of twenty-nine years in 1750, weighed six hundred and sixteen pounds. Chiapini Vitelli, Marquis of Cerona, a noted Spanish general in his time, was excessively corpulent, but by drinking of vinegar is said to have reduced himself to such a degree of leanness that he could fold his skin several times round him.
