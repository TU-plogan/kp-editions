CLOSE, in Heraldry. When any bird is drawn in a coat of arms with its wings close down about it (that is, not displayed), and in a standing posture, they blazon it by the word close; but if it be flying, they call it volant. Close- Hauled, in Navigation, the general arrangement or trim of a ship’s sails when she endeavours to make progress in the nearest direction possible towards that point of the compass from which the wind blows. In this manner of sailing the keel commonly makes an angle of six points with the line of the wind; but sloops and some other small vessels are said to sail almost a point nearer. All vessels, however, are supposed to make nearly a point of lee-way when close-hauled, even when they' have the advantage of a good sailing breeze and smooth water. The angle of lee-way, however, increases in proportion to the increase of the wind and sea. In this disposition of the sails they are all extended sideways on the ship, so that the wind, as it crosses the ship obliquely towards the stern from forwards, may fill their cavities. But as the current of wind also enters the sails in an oblique direction, the effort of it to make the ship advance is considerably diminished; she will therefore make the least progress when sailing in this manner. The ship is said to be close-hauled, because at this time her tacks, or lower corners of the principal sails, arc drawn close down to her side to windward, the sheets hauled close-aft, and all the bow-lines drawn to their greatest extension, to keep the sails steady.
