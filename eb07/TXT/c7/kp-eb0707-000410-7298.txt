COACH. Few things have been more often or more unsuccessfully defined than this well-known and useful vehicle. Of the descriptions which have been given of it, many might with as much propriety be applied to various other machines of conveyance, which it would be a violation of language to dignify with the name of coach. The nearest approximation to a definition appears to be, that it is a vehicle for commodious travelling, the body of which is covered in, and suspended by means of springs upon the frame-work to which the wheels are attached, the latter being sometimes two, and sometimes four in number. It does not appear that the ancients were acquainted with carriages of this description, although chariots and waggons, both open and covered, were employed in very remote ages.

In Britain, and throughout Europe, coaches are drawn by horses, except in Spain, where mules are used for the purpose. In a part of the East, especially the dominions of the Great Mogul, coaches are commonly drawn by oxen. In Denmark, rein-deer are sometimes harnessed in coaches, though rather for curiosity than use. The coachman is ordinarily placed on a seat raised before the body of the coach; but in Spain policy displaced him from that position by a royal ordinance,, on occasion when the Duke d’Olivares discovered that a very important secret, respecting which he had conferred in his coach, had been overheard and revealed by his coachman. Since that time the place of the Spanish coachman is the same with that of the French stage coachman and our postilion, namely, on the first horse on the left.

According to Professor Beckmann (History of Inventions and Discoveries'), coaches of some kind were known [7:7:5]about the beginning of the sixteenth century; but the use of them was limited to women of the highest rank, it being accounted disgraceful in men to ride in them. It appears, from the history of that period, that the electors and princes of the empire, when they did not choose to attend the meetings of the states, excused themselves to the emperor by informing him that their health would not permit them to travel on horseback; and it was considered as unbecoming to ride in carriages like women. But it seems also pretty certain that, about the end of the fifteenth century, the emperor, kings, and some princes, travelled in covered carriages, and also employed them in public solemnities.

The nuptial carriage of the first wife of Leopold, a Spanish princess, cost, including the harness, 38,000 florins. The coaches used by that emperor are thus described :— In the imperial coaches no great magnificence was to be seen, being covered over with red cloth and black nails. The harness was black, and no gold was to be seen in the whole work. They had glass panneis, for which reason they were called imperial coaches. The harness was ornamented with fringes of red silk on days of festivity. The imperial coaches were only distinguished by having leather traces, whilst the ladies in the emperor’s suite were contented with traces made of ropes. Fifty gilt coaches, having six horses each, were to be seen, in 1681, at the court of Ernest Augustus of Hanover. The first time that plenipotentiaries appeared in coaches was at the imperial commission held at Erfurt in 1613.

We meet with ample proof in the history of France, that in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and even sixteenth centuries, the monarchs rode on horses, the servants on mules, and ladies of distinction occasionally on asses. Yet carriages of some kind seem to have been used in France at an early period, since there is still preserved a statute of Philip the Fair, issued in 1294, for the suppression of luxury, in which the wives of citizens are prohibited the use of carriages.

The oldest coaches used by the ladies of England were denominated whirlicotes, a name which has now sunk into oblivion. About the end of the fourteenth century, when Richard II. was forced to fly before his rebellious subjects, he and all his.attendants travelled on horseback, his mother alone riding in a coach, because she was indisposed. But this became afterwards unfashionable, the daughter of Charles IV. having showed the ladies of England how conveniently she could ride on a side-saddle.

According to Stowe, coaches first came to be used in England about the middle of the sixteenth century, having been introduced from Germany by the Earl of Arundel. The English plenipotentiary travelled to Scotland in a coach in the year 1598, and these vehicles were generally used about the year 1605.

Duties on Carriages. — It is long since duties were imposed on carriages, and these have varied considerably at different periods. The following table exhibits the number of four-wheeled and other carriages, exclusive of hackney coaches, upon which duty was charged in 1828; the rates of duty on each kind of carriage; and the produce of the duties.
[table]

By 1 Will. IV. c. 35, it is enacted, that for every carriage with four wheels, each being of less diameter than thirty inches, drawn by a pony or ponies, mule or mules, above twelve but not exceeding thirteen hands high, an annual duty of L.3. 5s. shall be charged. Carriages with four wheels, drawn by one horse, &c. and no more, are to pay L.4. 10s. Every carriage with four wheels used by any common carrier in the carriage of goods, where such carriage is only occasionally used for the conveyance of passengers for hire, and in such manner that the stamp-office duty, or any composition for the same, is not payable under any license from the commissioners of stamps, is charged [7:7:6]L.2. 1 Os. per annum; and where such carriage has less than four wheels, it is only charged L.l. 5s. per annum. Any carriage with less than four wheels, each of which is of less diameter than thirty inches, and not let for hire, drawn by a pony or mule not exceeding twelve hands high, is exempt from duty.

Hackney Coaches are coaches stationed in the streets or other public places, and bound to carry those who require them at certain fixed rates of hire, according to the distance travelled. Vehicles of this description were first established in London in 1625, and in Edinburgh in 1773. The number of hackney coaches, chariots, and cabriolets licensed in the metropolis on the 1st of January 1830 was 1265. The rates of duty were L.2 per lunar month for each .carriage; and the produce of the duties, including fines, was L.32,908. 18s. 6d. The fares, &c. are regulated conformably to the act 48 Geo. III. c. 87.

Stage Coaches, as defined in the act of parliament, 3 Geo. IV. c∙ 95, sect. 6, are carriages or vehicles used, employed, or let out for the purpose of carrying passengers for hire, and travelling at the rate of three or more miles in the hour, without regard to the number of wheels, horses, or passengers, or whether the same be open or close, provided each passenger be charged a separate and distinct fare. The above definition applies to carriages either drawn by horseè or propelled by steam. The latter species of vehicles are as yet exempt from taxation, but the following duties have been imposed upon the former :—Any carriage or vehicle, with two or more wheels, without springs, and drawn by one horse only, for every mile which it shall be licensed to travel, one penny. Any carriage, &c. without springs, and drawn by two horses only, for every mile, &c. two pence. Any carriage, &c. having springs, and .drawn by one horse only, for every mile three half pence. Any carriage, &c. drawn by two horses only, having springs, not distinguishing between inside and outside passengers, per mile three pence. And any carriage, &c. as last mentioned, drawn by three or more horses, for every mile four pence half-penny. A duty of L.5. 5s. a year is also imposed upon every stage coach. For various statutes and regulations relating both to stage and hackney coaches, and which make provision for the safety and convenience of the passenger, see M‘Culloch’s Commercial Dictionary, p. 264-5.

Mail Coaches are stage-coaches of a particular construction, which, for a certain consideration, carry his majesty’s mails, are protected by a guard, and subject to the regulations of the post-office.

Coach-making is a combination of crafts, such as are very rarely united in one calling or trade. The technical names of those composing the different branches are, body-makers, carriage-makers, wheelers, spring-makers, axle-makers, smiths, trimmers, &c. Painting is an important part of the business; and those professing it are divided into body, carriage, and heraldry or ornamental painters. These classes of workmen have each their own department in the construction of a coach, and none of them can be dispensed with. Under the general head of coachmaking a great variety of different kinds of vehicles are produced, such as close coaches, landaus, landaulets, chariots, phaetons, briskeys, gigs, &c.; of the three kinds last named, there are almost infinite varieties, both with regard to construction and the manner of finishing. The fashion with respect to these is about as fluctuating and mutable as that of dress. One thing is certain, however, that in neatness and general utility the vehicles of the present day are superior to those of any former period.

Within the last ten years or so a great revolution has taken place in regard to coach-making. For a few years before that period, coach-makers could not get their coaches made short enough in the carriage, nor small enough in the body, from the false notion, that being lighter, and easier drawn, they would answer the purpose better. There can be no doubt that they were lighter, and probably easier drawn, but it has been proved that shortness in the carriage not only makes them harder to ride in, but also harder on the axles and springs, thus rendering them more apt to break down.

Noblemen’s and gentlemen’s carriages are now, however, made a great deal larger in the body; the carriages themselves are also longer, and the wheels not so high as those in use formerly. Coaches may be divided into two classes, namely, gentlemen’s carriages, to which the above remarks refer, and road coaches. If a revolution has taken place in regard to the former, much more has it done so in regard to the latter. A few years ago road-coaches were made to weigh at least twenty or twenty-five cwts., and often more, and were then constantly breaking down. They were generally drawn by four horses, and carried, we believe, sixteen passengers, besides driver and guard, the driver changing every stage. Now they are constructed so as not to exceed twelve or fourteen cwts., and are drawn by two horses, carry thirteen passengers, and travel in about one third less time without changing the driver, unless the coach travels more than four or five stages. A broken down road-coach is now a thing rarely heard of; and, except the mail, they in general have no guard. Nay, more; while under the old system, they were not only high set upon their carriages, but the outside passengers and luggage were almost exclusively placed upon the top, and consequently they were easily overset; while on the present system the bodies are placed low, and the luggage deposited in large masses before and behind the vehicle. Above these sit the outside passengers; so that the whole load, instead of top weight as before, acts as ballast to prevent the carriage from oversetting, and hence the few coach accidents of late, in comparison with those which used to occur under the old system. It is proper to observe, however, that the great improvement in road-making has in no small degree contributed to the safety and convenience of travelling.

The principal part of the coach-making business depends chiefly on the selection of the materials for the construction of the work; and the first, and not the least in importance, is the stock of wood. It requires a good deal of experience to apportion this article so as to apply the different kinds of it to that part of the work for which it is the best adapted. Ash is the kind of wood commonly used in the frame-work both of body and carriage; and the quality best suited for body wood is that of a mild and free nature, while for the carriage the wood cannot be too strong or robust. Full-grown wood is best suited for both purposes, because young wood, although of a tough nature, is found from experience to fail sooner, and not to last so long as full-grown timber. But in all cases it must be cut into planks before the log gets into a state of decay after being felled. The planks must also be allowed to lie until they are properly seasoned.

After the frame-work is made, the lower part of the body is pannelled up with bay mahogany of the softest kind. As the panneis have to be bent into peculiar shapes, hard mahogany will not answer the purpose. Close coaches or chariots are covered on the roof and upper quarters with leather dressed without grease, so as to receive the painting; whilst the roof and upper quarters of landaus and landaulets are, in order to afford facilities for opening, covered with leather properly dressed in oil, and blackened by the currier upon the grain side, so as not to require the help of the painter; but to keep it in this pliable state it requires the constant care of the coachman. The kinds [7:7:7]of wood generally applied to coach-wheel making are elm for the naves, oak for the spokes, and ash for the felloes; but beech felloes are often used; and it is the opinion of the writer, formed upon experience, that beech, when cut into felloes from the log shortly after it is felled, and kept until these become dry before being put upon wheels, is decidedly the best. Indeed nothing but properly seasoned wood can be applied to any purpose in the construction of a coach.

A great improvement has of late years been introduced into the making of coach-springs, from the quality of steel used in their construction. Formerly nothing was used but German steel, which from its hardness was more apt to snap than the English steel now employed for that purpose. The latter, with superior elasticity, combines a strength that enables, the spring-maker to fabricate his springs at least one third lighter than formerly, while they stand equal fatigue, with less risk of breaking. Although axles are at present in a high state of perfection, yet no material improvements have been made upon, them for these twenty or twenty-five years. The kinds of axles now chiefly used are the common or plain axle, the mail-coach patent, and the Collinge patent, which last, when properly executed, is found to be the best for retaining the oil, as they are generally found to be in good order in this respect after having performed a journey of 500 or 600 miles. The iron mounting of coach-work requires the skill of most experienced smiths; for, besides the solidity required, a considerable degree of taste to form the shapes and sets of the different parts is necessary. No branch of the coach-making business contributes more to the elegance of the vehicle than that of the painter. His colours must be of the best quality, and unadulterated, as they have to stand exposure in all weathers. The varnish used is made from gum, and is called copal varnish, of which there are two kinds, the finest being used for finishing the body, and the second for finishing the carriage. Heraldry painting is a very fine art, and requires a knowledge of heraldry, combined with considerable practice, before perfection can be attained. The business of the trimmer is to make and put in the linings, mount the coachman’s seat, steps, &c., and put on the leather work, bead-fing, &c. Coaches built in London are reputed the most perfect of their kind of any in the world.

Coach, or Couch, is also a sort of chamber or apart- • ment in a large ship of war near the stern. The floor of it is formed by the aftmost part of the quarter-deck, and the roof of it by the poop. It is generally the habitation of the captain.
