CONGO, a country of considerable extent in the southwest of Africa. It is bounded on the north by the river Congo or Zaire, which separates it from Loango, and on the west by the Atlantic. The interior boundaries are very uncertain, but it is conjectured that the country extends several hundred miles in every direction. To the south are situated the countries of Angola and Benguela; while the eastern frontier is said to be composed of high and rugged mountains, inhabited by the savage tribe of the Giagas, whose predatory inroads into the territory of Congo are frequent and destructive.

Congo was discovered, in 1487, by the Portuguese, who sent over successive bodies of troops and missionaries to subjugate and Christianize the inhabitants. Their writers have transmitted to us exaggerated accounts of the vast numbers of the natives, of the great victories which were obtained over them, and also of their having been finally brought under the yoke. The missionaries, likewise, with equal disregard for truth, extolled the splendour and civilization of the country. One of them states that the king could muster an army of 900,000 men, and that he actually opposed the Portuguese with 80,000, who were completely overthrown by 400 Europeans and 2000 negroes. These accounts go a great way beyond even probability. Of its former population and splendour neither trace nor tradition remains; and of the benefits which resulted to the inhabitants from their intercourse with Christians, the evidences which existed when Captain Tuckey visited the place, were a few' forts and factories for carrying on the slave trade, and some crucifixes, which were not however held in equal veneration with their own Pagan fetiches. Until the expedition sent out by the British government, under the above-named officer, to explore the river Congo to its source, we had no information respecting the country which could at all be depended upon. It is to him, therefore, and to his scientific companions, that we are indebted for the facts contained in the following account of this region of the globe; and it only relates to that portion of Congo which is contiguous to the Zaire.

In the general appearance of its surface, in its natural products, and in the state of society and the condition of the native inhabitants, this country is by no means so interesting as many other parts of Africa. Along the sides of the river the mountains are numerous, but not high; the most elevated probably do not exceed two thousand feet. 3Ιιesc arc destitute of vegetation, with the exception of a few rank grasses; and the lesser ranges of hills are without those gigantic and wide-spreading forests which we might expect to find in such a climate; only a few large trees are scattered upon their sides and summits. Between the bases of these hills, however, and the margins of the river, the alluvial banks, which extend from the mouth to a considerable distance upwards, are clothed with exuberant vegetation, presenting to the eye one continuous forest of majestic trees, covered with ever-green foliage. The river is studded with numerous islands, which are mantled with the thick mangrove, intermingled with the tall and elegant palm, whilst others are covered with the Egyptian papyrus. The alluvial flats are succeeded by naked and precipitous mountains, resting on micaceous slate, which forms the two banks of the river for at least fifty miles; the only interruption to this range of heights being a few narrow ravines, in which the villages of the natives are situated. Many of the hills are also crowned with small villages, and the soil is sufficient for the cultivation of the ordinary articles of food, but it is of an indifferent description. Beyond these masses of micaslate the geological character of the country changes. The granite hills give way to those of limestone, and numerous promontories of marble project into the river, with fertile vales between them. The whole country, according to Captain Tuckey, wore a more inviting aspect as they penetrated into the interior, and towns and villages followed each other in rapid succession far beyond the Congo territory. But the sickly state of the party put a stop to the expedition, just as the improved condition of the country held out a prospect of its complete success.

In none of the journals kept by these enterprising individuals is the climate complained of; on the contrary, they speak of the atmosphere as being cool, dry, and refreshing. A westerly breeze sets in from the Atlantica few hours after sunset, and continues till midnight, thus materially 7 cooling and purifying the air. Of course much depends upon locality, and accordingly at different situations, and these not very far apart, the range of the thermometer in the shade at noon showed a difference sometimes of thirty degrees. The winter in Congo is compared to the mild spring or autumn of Italy; it is not subject to heavy 7 rains, but every morning the earth is fertilized by falls of dew.

The vegetable productions of this country are various, for the most valuable of which the natives are indebted to the Portuguese. The staple products are manioc or cassava, y 7 ams, and maize. To these maybe added, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, millet of two or three species, cala-vanscs, cabbages, spinach, pepper, capsicum, the sugarcane, and tobacco. Of fruits they have the plantain, pa-paw, oranges, limes, and pine apples. The only beverage used by the inhabitants, except when they fall in with European spirits, of which they are extremely fond, is the juice of the palm tree, which goes by the name of palm wine. It is of three different kinds, and was found by the party to be a very refreshing and wholesome liquor.

There is a sufficiency 7 of domestic animals for food, but very little care appears to be bestowed upon them. They consist chiefly 7 of goats, hogs, fowls, the common and Muscovy duck, and pigeons. There are also a few sheep, which have a coat of hair instead of wool. No beasts of burden of any description were found in the country. Of wild animals there is a great variety, but from the indolent habits of the natives they have never been converted to any useful purpose. Elephants, leopards, buffaloes, monkeys, and numerous species of antelopes, abound. There are also various other kinds of quadrupeds in abundance, and a plentiful supply of wild fowl. The country appears to be remarkably 7 free from those noxious insects which swarm almost universally in tropical climates; fleas, bugs, and black ants must, however, be excepted. The lower part of the river abounds in excellent fish, of which bream, mullet, and cat-fish are the most abundant. Numbers of the natives gain a livelihood by fishing for these, and also in dragging for a shell-fish which bears a resemblance to the clam. The river swarms with hippopotami, and alligators, or rather crocodiles: the flesh of the former is excellent food, though but little used.

The principal articles of subsistence, at least in the dry season, appear to be manioc, ground nuts, and palm wines. Yams and Indian corn arc also used; of the latter they have regularly two crops a year. Animal food is not in very general use, although sold in the daily market held at Embamma. The negroes are exceedingly filthy in their preparation and eating of animal food. The fowls are broiled with the feathers unplucked, and pieces of goat, without the skin or even the hair being removed; and they are devoured voraciously when scarcely warm. Cannibalism, however, appears to be totally unknown in Congo.
[7:7:215]

None of the villages seen by the party were of great extent, the largest apparently not exceeding one hundred huts. Embamma, Cooloo, and Juga, are each the residence of a Chenoo, a sort of petty sovereign of a district: the first consisted of about sixty huts, exclusively of the Chenoo’s residence, and about five hundred inhabitants; the second of one hundred huts, and from five to six hundred inhabitants; and the third of seventy huts, and about three hundred inhabitants. Their huts are formed of mats woven from a reedy grass, or the fibres of plants, six pieces of which, being put together, compose the house. That of the Chenoo, however, is formed more skilfully of palm leaves, and encompassed with a fence of reeds. The villages are usually embosomed in the midst of palms and other lofty trees. The household furniture and utensils, in simplicity and rudeness, are on a par with the domestic inclosures. Baskets are made of the fibres of the palm tree; bowls and bottles of gourds and other vegetables, for holding provisions and water; earthen vessels of home manufacture, for boiling their victuals, with wooden spoons to eat them; while a mat of grass thrown on a raised platform constitutes their only bedding. The articles of dress are equally primitive, the common people being satisfied with a small apron tied round their loins, and ornamented caps made of grass. Rings of brass or iron enclasp the arms and ancles, and sometimes bracelets of lions’ teeth are used. The women in general adorn their necks, arms, and legs with strings of beads.

For agricultural purposes, a rude hoe is the principal or only implement in use; but a slight scratch on the surface of the ground is sufficient for securing a good crop in that propitious climate. The natives make no provision for future contingencies, such as a year of scarcity; they only raise what will exactly meet their wants until the usual harvest time comes round. This, it would appear, arises principally from indolence, and not from a distrust in the right and security of property. This is so well understood by them, that almost all their disputes arise from their tenacity in the division of property, whether in land or stock, which is frequently so minute, that it is not uncommon to see a fowl or a pig partitioned amongst three or four proprietors.

The paramount sovereign of Congo resides at a place of the same name, situated at about six days’ journey into the interior. This place is supposed to be the St Salvador of the Portuguese, but it was not visited by Captain Tuckey; and he thinks that the existence of the sovereign is somewhat apocryphal. Keeping out of view this regal personage, society in Congo appears to consist, first, of the Chenoo; secondly, of the members of his family; thirdly, of the Mafooks; fourthly, of the Foomoos; fifthly, of the fishermen, coolies, and labouring people; and, sixthly, of the domestic slaves. The title and authority of the Chenoo are hereditary in the female line; none of his sons can inherit unless the mother be of royal blood. The Chenoo is little distinguished from his subjects by dress or accommodation, and his ensign of office consists of a rod of black wood inlaid with lead or copper. The daughter of the Chenoo chooses her own husband, over whom she has sovereign control, and can sell into slavery if she pleases. The members of the royal family are the Chenoo’s councillors, by whose advice he acts in all matters of consequence. The Mafooks are the collectors of the revenue, who begin their career as interpreters, and having realized what is there considered a competency, are entitled to pass into the higher grade of tax-gatherers. The Foomoos are those who possess houses and lands of their own, with two or three wives, and perhaps a few slaves to work for them. They would appear to be the yeomanry of the country. The fishermen and labourers have no fixed property of their own, and are therefore much at the disposal of the Chenoo. The domestic slaves are not numerous, and arc not considered as transferable property, unless they are found guilty of some serious crime.

The natives of Congo are about the middle size, and they have in a somewhat less degree both the black colour and the characteristic features of the race. ' Their physiognomy is pleasing, and said to bear the stamp of simplicity and innocence. They are lively, good-humoured, and hospitable to strangers. In energy and reflection they appear to be below the other African tribes, and their habits of indolence are inveterate. This forms the chief bar to the progress of improvement throughout the continent. As is generally the case amongst an uncivilized people, the most laborious offices are here performed by the weaker sex. Every man has wives in proportion to his rank; the Chenoo has sometimes fifty. But the most scandalous part of their conduct consists in the traffic made with the virtue of their females, whose moral impressions are also very weak, and they thus offer no resistance, but rather glory in the disgraceful practice. A glass of rum or a few beads is sufficient to secure the favours of the first women in the country. A case of thieving came under the notice of Captain Tuckey, but he is in favour of their general honesty. The atrocious crime of poisoning, however, evidently prevails amongst them.

With respect to religion, the Congoese are Pagans of the lowest description. A fetiche (from the Portuguese fetico signifying a charm, witchcraft, magic) is a sort of tutelary deity, and seems to be the Alpha and Omega of their veneration. Any thing serves for a fetiche; the guardian genius is not fastidious about the symbol which recognises his existence; the beak of a bird, the fin of a fish, or the hoof of a quadruped, answers the purpose perfectly well. The making of these fetiches is carried on as a trade by a certain class of men, who may be styled the priesthood of the country. These ridiculous appendages are considered as absolutely necessary for guaranteeing the safety of the houses and persons of the negroes, and they are looked upon as talismans of infallible efficacy in preventing every evil to which human nature is liable. The fetiche is employed in the discovery of theft. For this purpose it is exposed in some public place, when the people of the village dance round it, and with hideous yells call upon it either to reveal the thief, or to oblige him to deposit in some fixed place the article stolen, under the penalty of destruction to himself and his relations. The restoration of the stolen article seldom fails to ensue after this public exhibition. The Congoese have but a very vague idea of a good and evil principle, or a future state; and the fetiche system seems to constitute the religion of the country. With respect to the number of the inhabitants, it is impossible to form even a conjecture.

Congo, or Zaire, a large river of Africa, which falls into the Atlantic Ocean in about the thirteenth degree of south latitude. From the volume of water which it discharges into the ocean, the length of its course, the greater part of which is still unknown, or the rapidity of its current, it must be ranked amongst the first class of rivers. It was for a length of time surmised that the Niger and the Congo were identically the same river. This opinion, however, has been exploded by the discovery of the termination of the former river by the Messrs Lander. But the source of the latter still remains as a problem to be solved by the enterprise of travellers. The breadth of the Congo at its mquth is about ten or twelve miles; and its depth is extraordinary, no bottom having been found by Captain Tuckey, who sounded it with a line of 113 fathoms. Its breadth at 140 miles from its mouth continues to be from two to three miles. At this point the narrows commence, [7:7:216]when the river contracts to from three to five hundred yards in breadth, and this continues for a very considerable distance upwards. The banks are lined with bristling rocks, which in several places shoot in ledges across the bed of the river, and form rapids or cataracts. It is only, however, during the periodical floods that the lowest and most formidable of these deserves the name of cataract. Beyond these mountainous regions the Congo again expands to the breadth of two, three, or even four miles, and flows with a current of from two to three miles an hour. At the place where Captain Tuckey relinquished his journey, which was about 280 miles from Cape Pedron, on the sea-coast, the banks were clothed with luxuriant vegetation. Beyond this limit nothing certain is known of its course; but the natives stated that there was no obstacle,to its continued navigation, with the exception of a rapid, which, however, was passable by canoes.
