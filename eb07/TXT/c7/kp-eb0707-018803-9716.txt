COMPASSION, or Commiseration, a mixed passion, compounded of love and sorrow, and excited by the sight or recital of distress. Hobbes makes this a merely selfish passion, and defines it as consisting of fear for ourselves. Hutcheson resolves it into instinct; but Dr Butler, much [7:7:189]more properly, considers it as an original, distinct, particular affection in human nature.
