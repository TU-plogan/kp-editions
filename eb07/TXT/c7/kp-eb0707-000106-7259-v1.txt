CLONMELL, the assize town of the county of Tipperary, in Ireland, is situated on the river Suir, which is navigable from this town to Carrick and Waterford. This place is of considerable antiquity, and was originally protected by walls and a castle; but these were destroyed by Cromwell. The town consists at present of several good streets, a market-house, court-house, jail, church, Roman Catholic chapel, and other public buildings; and it has a [7:7:2] handsome bridge of twenty arches over the Snir. The manufacture of woollens is carried on here; and there is a considerable carrying-trade of agricultural produce from this place to the sea-port of Waterford, by means of the river Suir. The celebrated Sterne was born here. It is distant from Dublin 123 miles south-west by south.
