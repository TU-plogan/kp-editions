COTELERIUS, John Baptist, fellow of the Sorbonne, and regius professor of Greek, was born at Nismes, in Lan-¶ guedoc, in 1627. He made a collection of the fathers who lived in the apostolic age, which he published at Paris in two volumes folio in 1672, revised and corrected from several manuscripts, with a Latin translation and notes. He also published Monumenta Ecclesiae Groecae, in three vols. being a collection of Greek tracts from the king’s and Μ. Colbert’s libraries, which had never before been published; and to these he added a Latin translation and notes. He intended to .prosecute the work further; but his intense studies ruined his constitution, and deprived him of life in 1686.
