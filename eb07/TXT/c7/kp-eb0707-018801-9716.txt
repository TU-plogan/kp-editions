COMPASS, or Mariner’s Steering Compass. See Mariner’s Compass. CθMPASS-Dials are small horizontal dials, fitted in brass or silver boxes, for the pocket, to show the hour of the day, by the direction of a needle that indicates how to place them right, by turning the dial about till the cock or style stands directly over the needle; but these can never be very exact, because of the variation of the needle itself. See Dialing.
