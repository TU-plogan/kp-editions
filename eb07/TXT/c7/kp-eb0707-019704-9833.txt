CONCRETION, the uniting several small particles of a natural body into sensible masses or concretes, by which it becomes figured and determined in a certain way, and is endued with certain properties.

Concretion is also the act by which soft bodies are rendered hard; or an insensible motion of the particles of a fluid or soft body, by which they come to a consistence. It is indifferently used for induration, condensation, eon-gelation, and coagulation.
