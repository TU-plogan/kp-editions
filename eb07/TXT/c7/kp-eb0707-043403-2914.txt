COVE, a town of Ireland, in the county of Cork, beautifully situated on Cork harbour, which lies eleven miles from the city. From an obscure fishing village it has risen to be a populous and flourishing town. It consists of one main street and several minor ones, ranking one above the other on the side of a steep hill, and overhanging the grand basin called the Cove of Cork. The harbour is spacious, completely land-locked, and capable of permitting the whole navy of Britain to ride at anchor together in perfect safety and shelter. Vessels of the largest class can ride safely close to the shores; and the advantageous position of the asylum for ships in the West Indian trade is fully appreciated. It is to the advantage of its cove that Cork city owes its greatness and wealth, and to the same cause it is likely to owe a still greater commercial rank.
