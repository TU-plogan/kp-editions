CORACHIE, a seaport town of the province of Sinde, district of Tatta, supposed to be the Sangada of Arrian, or the port of Alexander. It is the only good seaport of Sinde, and is situated seventeen miles east by south of Cape Monze, at the head of a bay which affords good shelter for shipping; and from the beginning of September till the latter end of May, vessels of from three to four hundred tons burden may enter at high tide, the water at any other time not being more than a fathom and a half, or a fathom and a quarter on the bar. The tide rises twelve feet. The harbour is narrow, and is defended on the western point of its entrance by a castle, built in 1801, on which are mounted a few pieces of unserviceable cannon. On the eastern side of the bay are six rocky isles, near to which the water is shallow. The town consists of upwards of 3000 houses; and contains 8000 inhabitants, most of whom are Hindus, engaged in trade. It is encompassed with a mud wall, which has round towers; but it is incapable of making any defence against cannon. Corachie being the principal seaport of the Sinde province[7:7:321], a great proportion of the produce of the country is exported from it. The exports consist chiefly of rice, giue, hides, sharks’ fins, saltpetre, potash, assafoetida, Tatta cloth, indigo, frankincense, and coarse cloths. These articles are conveyed in the fair season in dingees, which are small coasting vessels with one mast and a very high stern, to Bombay, Guzerat, and the coast of Malabar; from which places they bring back pepper and other spices, iron, lead, steel, elephants’ teeth, cochineal, with sandal-wood and other woods. A considerable trade is also carried on with Muscat, but it has been greatly interrupted by the Jowasmie pirates, who range to the mouth of the Indus. Rice, ghee, indigo, frankincense, and coarse cloths, were formerly exported to that quarter; and the returns were made in silk, dates, and other articles from the Persian Gulf. The commerce of the town, however, has greatly declined. The Hindus, who are deeply engrossed with trade, are possessed of the chief wealth. They have no share of political power, but enjoy the most perfect religious toleration. Near the town is a tank containing two tame alligators, highly venerated by the Hindu devotees. The country from Corachie to the coast is low alluvial soil, overflowed by the Indus when it is swelled by the melting of the mountain snows and the fall of distant rains in the elevated country towards the north. The Indus is navigated from Corachie up to Tatta and Hyderabad, in flat-bottomed boats, at all seasons of the year. The passage to Tatta occupies five or six days, and to Hyderabad two or three days more.

The surrounding country is sandy and stony, but it is susceptible of cultivation during the rains. A few date trees are seen in the immediate neighbourhood of the town, but the fruit never comes to perfection. Lemons, oranges, grapes, plan tains, as well as water and musk melons, are produced; but,.with the exception of the pumpkin and brinjal, there are no vegetables at Corachie. The water is brackish; fuel and forage are scarce; sheep are indifferent, but the camels and draught bullocks are excellent. It is fifty-seven miles from the city of Tatta. Long. 67. 16. E.
