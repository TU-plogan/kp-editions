COTHURNUS, Buskin, a very high shoe or patten raised on soles of cork, worn by the ancient actors in tragedy, in order to make them appear taller and more like the heroes they represented, most of whom were supposed to be giants. It covered the greater part of the leg, and was tied beneath the knee. Aeschylus is said to have invented the cothurnus.
