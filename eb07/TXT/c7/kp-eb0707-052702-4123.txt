CUBIT, in the mensuration of the ancients, a measure of length equal to that of a man’s arm from the elbow to the tip of the fingers. Dr Ąrbuthnot makes the English cubit equal to eighteen inches, the Roman cubit equal to one foot 5∙406 inches, and the cubit of the Scripture equal to one foot 9∙888 inches.

CUCKING∙Stool, an engine invented for punishing scolds and turbulent women, by ducking them in water. It was called in ancient times a tumbrel, and sometimes a trebuchet. In Domesday-book it is styled cathedra stercoris ; and it was in use even in the Saxon times, when it was described as cathedra in qua rixosae mulieres sedentes aquis demergebantur. It was anciently also a punishment inflicted upon brewers and bakers for transgressing the laws. In such a stool they were immcrged over head and ears in stercore, that is, in stinking water. Some think it a corruption from ducking-stool ; others from choking-stool, quia hoc modo demersae aqu is fere suffocantur.
