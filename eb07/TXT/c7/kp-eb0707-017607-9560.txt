COMMIRE, John, a modern Latin poet, born at Amboise in 1625, entered into the society of the Jesuits, and taught polite literature and divinity. He died at Paris in 1702. We have a volume of his Latin poems, and a collection of his posthumous works by Sanadon, 1704. His odes are imitations of Horace; and his fables, which have neither the elegant precision nor the moral tendency of those of Phaedrus, are rather ingenious parallels and agreeable descriptions, than fables properly so called. His paraphrases of the Psalms and the Prophets possess but little merit.
