COLONNADE, in Architecture, a range of columns, a peristyle of a circular figure, or a series of columns disposed in a circle, and insulated on the inside.

A Polystyle Colonnade is that the number of whose columns is too great to be taken in by the eye at a single view. Such is the colonnade of the church of St Peterâ€™s at Rome, consisting of 284 columns of the Doric order, each above four feet and a half diameter, all in Tiburtine marble.
