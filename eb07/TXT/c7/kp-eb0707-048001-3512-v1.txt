CROSIER, or Crozier, a shepherd’s crook, and the symbol of pastoral authority, consisting of a gold or silver staff, curved or bent at the top, carried occasionally before bishops and abbots, and held in the hand when they give the solemn benedictions. The custom of bearing a pastoral staff before bishops is very ancient, as appears from the life of St Caesarea of Arles, who lived about the year 500. Among the Greeks none but the patriarchs had a right to the crosier. The crosiers were at first no more than simple wooden staves in form of a T, used to rest upon. By degrees they were made longer, and at length arrived at the form in which they are now to be seen. Regular abbots are allowed to officiate with a mitre and crosier.
