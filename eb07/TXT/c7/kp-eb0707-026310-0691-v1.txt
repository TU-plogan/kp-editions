CONNAUGHT, one of the four provinces into which Ireland was ecclesiastically divided by Pope Eugenius III. in 1152. It is bounded on the south by the province of 1 Munster, on the west by the Atlantic Oeean, on the east by the river Shannon, and on the north by the Atlantic and part of Ulster. It contains five counties, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, and Sligo; forty-two baronies, and 276 parishes, subject to the control of the Archbishop of Tuam, and his suffragans, the Bishops of Clonfert, Elphin, and Kilhιla. The surface is mountainous, and the climate moist but healthy. The Duke of Gloucester, of the blood-royal, takes the title of earl from this, province. As the division of Ireland into provinces is not recognised in any public act, a particular account of Connaught is unnecessary here. That will be found in the articles on the various counties which compose it, as they occur alphabetically.
