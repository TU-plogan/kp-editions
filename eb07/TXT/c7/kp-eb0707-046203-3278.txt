CRESCENT, the new moon, which, as it begins to recede from the sun, shows a little rim of light, terminating in points or horns, which increase till it becomes full and round in the opposition. The word is formed from cresco, I grow. The term is also used for the same figure of the moon in its wane or decrease, but improperly; because the points or horns are then turned towards the west, whereas in the just crescent their direction is towards the east.

Crescent, in Heraldry, is a bearing in the form of a half moon. The Ottomans bear sinople, a crescent montant, argent.

The crescent is frequently used as a difference in coat armour, to distinguish it as that of a second brother or junior family.

The figure of the crescent is the Turkish symbol; or rather it is that of the city of Byzantium, which bore this device from all antiquity, as appears from medals struck in honour of Augustus, Trajan, and others.

The crescent is sometimes montant, that is, its points look towards the top of the chief, which is its most ordinary representation; and hence some contend, that the crescent, absolutely so called, implies that situation; though other authors blazon it montant, when the horns are towards the dexter side of the escutcheon, in which position others call it incroissant.

Crescents are said to be adossed, when their backs or thickest parts are turned towards each other, and their points look towards the sides of the shield. Crescent inverted, is that whose points look towards the bottom; but turned crescents are placed like those adossed, the difference being, that all their points look to the dexter side of the shield; conturned crescents, on the contrary, look to the sinister side; and affronted or appointed crescents are contrary to the adossed, the points looking towards cach other.

Crescent is also the name of a military order, instituted in 1448 by Renatus of Anjou, king of Sicily, &c.; and so called from the badge or symbol thereof, which is a crescent of gold enamelled. What gave occasion to this establishment was, that Renatus took for his device a crescent, with the word loz, praise, which, in the style of rebus, makes loz in crescent, that is, by advancing in virtue, one merits praise. Crescent Island is situated in the Pacific Ocean. It is six or seven miles in circumference, and is situated in long. 225. 30. E. and lat. 23. 22. S.
