CROWLAND, a town of the hundred of Elloe, in the county of Lincoln, in which formerly stood one of the largest abbeys of the kingdom. As the town is intersected with water-courses, there is a curious triangular bridge which connects the several portions, with an inscription bearing the date of 860. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 1713, in 1821 to 2113, and in 1831 to 2716.
