CUPAR, a royal burgh of Scotland, and capital of the county of Fife, is pleasantly situated on the left bank of the Eden, at the distance of ten miles west of St Andrews, and twenty-two miles north-east of Kinghorn. It is a place of considerable antiquity, but in the present day it pos- 1 sesses all the appearance of a modern thriving town, and has less of the usual aspect of a royal burgh than any other town of the same magnitude which bears that appellation. At an early period the Macduff family had a castle here; and under its protection they founded and supported a convent of dominicans or black friars, which was afterwards attached to the religious establishment at StMonans. All vestiges of these edifices are now however gone. The situation of the town is well chosen. It lies on a slight elevation, in a secluded vale, open to the east and west, and overhung on the south by a range of hilly ground. The town is composed of one principal and rather I long street, running from west to east, which communicates with the Kinross road, and another street projected from the south side of this, near its cast end, which communicates with the road to Edinburgh by means of a bridge which crosses the Eden. The centre of the town is at the junction of these thoroughfares, both of which are lined with good houses of from one to three stories in height. East from the junction of the streetsis a short street called St Catherine Street, composed of very elegant modern edifices. On the south side are the county buildings, a large tontine, and some public offices and private buildings. On the opposite side stands an episcopal chapel, and nearly in the centre of the town is situated the parish church, a very plain building. This is relieved, however, by a fine old turret or spire, the only remaining portion of the old Gothic church, which was built in 1415. The best public building in the town is the county jail, which is ∣ built in a neat Grecian style. The chief trade of Cupar consists in the weaving of linens. There are also manufactories of leather, candles, ropes, bricks, and tilcs, with several breweries and corn and fulling mills. There are eight annual fairs, and a weekly market is held every Thursday. Cupar and the adjoining district support a weekly newspaper. As a royal burgh, Cupar is governed by a provost, three bailies, and a dean of guild, with a treasurer and twenty-one councillors. Besides the parish church, there are several dissenting meeting houses. The population of the burgh and parish, in 1821, amounted to 5892, and in 1831 to 6473.

Cupar-Angus, a town of Scotland, lying partly in the county of Perth, and partly in that of Forfar, is pleasantly situated to the south of the Isla, a few miles above its junction with the Tay, at the distance of twelve and a half miles east by north of Perth. A rivulet tributary to the Isla runs through the town, and that part which lies to the south of -this stream is all that belongs to the county of Angus. In ancient times this place was noted for an abbey of Cistertian monks, which was founded by Malcolm IV. in the year 1164. This building was destroyed at the reformation, but a fragment of the ruins overgrown with ivy still remains. Cupar-Angus is a well-built little town. The church, which stands on the Angus side, is a very plain bpilding, and there is a steeple detached from it, which comprises a sort of town-house and jail. The trade of the town consists of the manufacture of linen, and the tanning of leather, and in the vicinity there are several bleachfields· Besides the parish church, there are two dissenting meeting houses and an episcopal chapel. The population of the town and parish amounted, in 1821, to 2622, and in 1831 to 2615.
