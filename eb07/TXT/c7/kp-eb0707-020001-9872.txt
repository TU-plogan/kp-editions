CONDAPILLY, one of the Northern Circars of India, situated between the 16th and 17th degreeaof north latitude. This district, and that of Ellore, may be estimated to contain an area of 3400 miles, exclusive of the mountainous region towards the west, the greater part of which is well cultivated. The two districts occupy the whole space between the rivers Krishna and Godavery, the districts of Masulipatam towards the sea, the inland province of Commim on the west, and the Lake of Colair, chiefly formed by the overflow ing of these two rivers. The diamond rivers in this district are so unproductive that they have not been worked for many years. Besides the Krishna, which is its south-west boundary, it is watered by several other smaller streams; and is on the whole tolerably well cultivated, though it is inferior to Tanjore and the most flourishing districts of Bengal. The principal towns are Condapilly, Reddygoodum, and Tontraveloor.

Condapilly, a town of Hindustan, in the Northern Circars, and capital of the above district. It is situated on a hill; and being fortified in the Indian style, was formerly a place of considerable strength. But the fortifications have of late been much neglected, and are now gone to decay. This place was first conquered from the Hindu princes about the year 1471, by the Bhamence sovereigns[7:7:201] of the Deccan; and it came into the possession of the British in 1765. The travelling distance from Hyderabad is 142 miles, from Madras 306, from Nagpoor 370, and from Seringapatam 444 miles. Long. 80. 23. E. Lat. 16. 39. N.
