CURRENT, or Currant, a term used to express the present time. W τ ith regard to commerce, the price current of any merchandise is the known and ordinary price which is given for it. The term is also used for any thing which has course, or is received in commerce; in which sense we say, current coin, current wages, and the like.

Current, in Navigation, a certain progressive movement of the water of the sea, by which all bodies floating therein are compelled to alter their course or velocity, or both, and submit to the laws imposed on them by the current.

In the sea, currents are either natural and general, arising from the diurnal rotation of the earth about its axis, or accidental and particular, caused by the waters being driven against promontories, or into gulfsand straits, where, wanting room to spread, they are driven back, and thus disturb the ordinary flux of the sea. Currents arc various, and directed towards different parts of the ocean; and some are constant, while others are periodical. The most extraordinary current of the sea is that by which part of the Atlantic or African Ocean moves about Guinea from Cape Verd towards the curvature or Bay of Africa, which is called Fernando Po, namely, from west to east, contrary to the general motion; and such is the force of this current, that when ships approach too near the shore, it carries them violently towards the bay, and deceives the mariners in their reckoning. There are a great variety of shifting currents, which do not last, but return at certain periods; most of these, however, depend upon and follow the anniversary winds or monsoons, which, by blowing in one place, may cause a current in another. Varenius informs us, that at Java, in the Straits of Sunda, when the monsoons blow from the west, that is, in the month of May, the currents set to the eastward, contrary to the general motion. Between the islands of Celebes and Madura, when the western monsoons set in, that is, in December, January, and February, or when the winds blow from the north-west, or between the north and west, the currents set to the south-east, or between the south and east. At Ceylon,from the middle of March till October, the currents set to the southward, and in the other parts of the year to the northward, because at this time the southern monsoons blow, and at the other times the northern. Between Cochin-China and Malacca, when the western monsoons blow, that is, from April to August, the currents set eastward against the general motion; but the rest of the year they set westward, the monsoon conspiring with the general motion. They run so strongly in these seas, that unexperienced sailors mistake them for waves which beat upon the rocks, and are usually known by the name of breakers. In like manner, for some months after the middle of February, the currents set from the Maldives towards India on the east, against the general motion of the sea. On the shore of China and Cambodia, in the months of October, November, and December, the currents set to the north-west, and from January to the south-west, when they run with such rapidity about the shoals of Parcel, that they seem swifter than an arrow. At Pulo Condorc, upon the coast of Cambodia, though the monsoons are shifting, yet the currents set strongly towards the east, even when they blow to a contrary point. Along the coasts of the Bay of Bengal, as far as Cape Romania, at∣ the extreme point of Malacca, the current runs southward in November and December. When the monsoons blow from China to Malacca, the sea runs swiftly from Pulo Cambi to Pulo Condore, on the coast of Cambodia. In the Bay of Sans Bras, not far from the Cape of Good Hope, there is a remarkable current, where the sea runs from east to west to the landward; and the more vehemently that it is opposed by winds from a contrary direction. The cause is undoubtedly owing to some adjacent shore which is higher than this. In the Straits of Gibraltar the currents almost constantly drive to the eastward, and carry ships into the Mediterranean ,∙ they are also found to drive the same way into St George’s Channel.

The setting or progressive motion of the current may be cither quite down to the bottom, or to a certain determinate depth. As the knowledge of the direction and velocity of currents is a very material point in navigation, it is highly necessary to discover both, in order to ascertain the ship’s situation and course with as much accuracy as possible. The most successful method which has been hitherto practised by mariners for this purpose, is the following:—A common iron pot, containing four or five gallons, is suspended by a small rope, fastened to its ear or handles, so as to hang directly upright, as when placed upon the fire. This rope, which may be from seventy to a hundred fathoms in length, being prepared for the experiment, is coiled in the boat, which is hoisted out of the ship at a proper opportunity, when there is little or no wind to ruffle the surface of the sea. The pot being then thrown overboard into the water, and immediately sinking, the line is slackened till about seventy or eighty fathoms are run out; after which it is fastened to the boat’s stem, by which she is accordingly restrained and rides at an anchor. The velocity of the current is then easily tried by the log and half-minute glass, the usual method of discovering the rate of a ship’s sailing at sea. The course of the stream is next obtained by the compass provided for this operation. And having thus found the setting and drift of the current, it next remains to apply this experiment to nautical purposes; for which sec the article Navigation. Under-Cυr i RF.Nτs are distinct from the upper or apparent currents, and in different places set or drive a contrary way.
