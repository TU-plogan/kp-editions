CUSCO, a large and handsome town of South America, in Peru, formerly the residence of the Incas. It is situated at the foot of a mountain, and is built in a square form, in the middle of which there is the best market in all America. Four large streets, which are all as straight as a line, terminate in this square. The Spaniards relate wonderful things of the richness of the Inca’s palace, and of the temple of the sun; but more sober travellers, judging from what remains, think most of these stories fabulous. From this town there is a very long road, which runs along the Cordilleras; and, at certain distances, there are small houses for resting places, some parts of which are so artificially wrought that it is surprising how a people who had no iron tools could execute such workmanship. There are streams of water running through the town, which are a great convenience in so hot a country, where it never rains. It is 375 miles east of Lima. Long. 71. 47. W. Lat. 13. 40. S.
