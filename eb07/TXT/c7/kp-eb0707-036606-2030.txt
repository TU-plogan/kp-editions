CORNUCOPIA, among the ancient poets, a horn out of which proceeded plenty of all things; and, by a particular privilege which Jupiter granted his nurse, supposed to be the goat Amalthaea. The interpretation of the fable is, that in Libya there is a little territory, shaped not unlike a bullock’s horn, and exceedingly fertile, which was given by King Ammon to his daughter Amalthaea, whom the poets feign to have been Jupiter’s nurse.

In Architecture and Sculpture, the cornucopia, or horn of plenty, is represented under the figure of a large horn, out of which issue fruits, flowers, and the like. On medals, Joubert observes, the cornucopia is given to all deities.
