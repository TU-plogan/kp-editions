CUMANA, a province of Colombia, bounded on the north and east by the Carribbean Sea, and on the south by the Orinoco. In the western part, towards the coast, the soil is tolerably fertile. The eastern part is dry and sandy, affording nothing but an inexhaustible mine of marine and mineral salt. On the Orinoco the country is fit only for pasturage; other parts are exceedingly fertile. In the interior is a range of mountains, of which Tumeriquisi, the most elevated, is 5900 feet in height.

Cumana, or New Cordova, a town of Colombia, and capital of the above province. It is situated near the mouth [7:7:536] of the Cariaco, about a mile from the sea, on ah arid sandy plain. The climate is hot, earthquakes are frequent, and the houses are low and lightly built. On the 14th of December 1797, more than three fourths of them were destroyed by an earthquake. The inhabitants carry on a considerable trade in cacao, and other productions of the country. The road is commodious for its depth, and of a semicircular form, which defends it from the violence of the winds. The population amounts to about 20,000. Long. 64. 10. W. Lat. 10. 28. N.
