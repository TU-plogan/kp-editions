CRONSTADT, a city of Russia, in Europe, in the province of Petersburg. It is built on the island of Kodlin or Codlin, which is about six miles in length and one in breadth, and on both sides of which is a fair channel to Petersburg; but the southern one is preferable. The city is on the eastern end of the island, and is well fortified. It is the great naval arsenal of the Russian empire on the Baltic, and contains the appropriate docks for the construction and repairs of ships, and the necessary storehouses for their equipment, arming, and victuallings, and the proper schools for the instruction of the officers of the fleet. It is also a kind of commercial port to Petersburg, as .the, larger class of merchant vessels take in here their lading, which is brought from the capital in craft of various kinds. The city contains 2000 houses, mostly of stone, and in summer 40,000 inhabitants; but as the winter[7:7:480] is severe, and the bay covered with thick ice, which suspends all marine operations, the inhabitants who can afford it remove during the frost to the capital to enjoy its pleasures, and leave less than 30,000 inhabitants at Cronstadt. Long. 29. 35. 10. E. Lat. 59. 58. 26. N. *
