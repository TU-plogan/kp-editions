COMPOSTELLA, a large and well-built town of Spain, the capital of Galicia, with an archbishopâ€™s see and an university. It is situated on an eminence on the small river Soria. The public squares, and the churches, particularly the metropolitan church,.are very magnificent. It is pretended that the body of St James was buried here; a circumstance which draws a great number of pilgrims from most parts of Christendom. The poor pilgrims are received into an hospital, built for that purpose, which stands near the church; and round it are galleries of freestone, supported by large pillars. From this town the military order of St Jago, or St James, had its origin. A traffic is carried on in wine, fruit, and fish; and there are also manufactures of silk stockings, hats, paper, and leather. The population amounts to about 12,000. It is distant about 270 miles N.W. of Madrid. Long. 8. 30. W. Lat. 42. 52. N.

Compostella, a town of Mexico in the western part of the intendancy of Guadalaxara. Formerly tobacco was cultivated in the adjacent country, though this has been abandoned. The soil is barren, but there are several silver mines in the neighbourhood. Long. 104. 40. W. Lat. 21. 10. N.
