COMO, a lake in the Austrian kingdom of Venetian Lombardy. It is formed by the water of the river, and of more than one hundred and ninety small brooks and rivulets that empty themselves into it. Its whole length is about thirty-five miles, but its breadth scarcely in any part exceeds three miles. Its elevation above the sea is about 700 feet. The southern portion of the lake is divided into two branches, the shorter of which, running south-west, extends to the town of Como, and the longer south-east to Vapres, near Bergamo. The surrounding country is picturesque and beautiful. The banks exhibit vineyards, olives, and mulberry trees in great abundance, and the lake abounds in fish.

Como, a delegation of the government of Milan, in the Austrian kingdom of Venetian Lombardy, bounded on the north by Switzerland and Sandrio, on the east by Brescia, on the south by Milan, and on the west by the kingdom of Sardinia. Being towards the foot of the Alps, the northern part is mountainous, and the southern undulating. Between the spurs of the mountains are some beautiful and fertile valleys. It extends over 1260 square miles, or 806,400 English acres, and comprehends two cities, sixteen market-towns, and 510 villages, with 43,117 houses, and, in 1817, 315,634 inhabitants. The chief productions are, corn, wine, fruit, and fish. The manufactures are silk and linen articles; but many of the districts subsist by making optical glasses, and by preparing mathematical, surgical, and physical instruments. The purity of the atmosphere attracts many of the richer families of Italy to the district, where they have built numerous rural villas.

Como, a city, the capital of the delegation of the same name, in Italy, on the southern extremity of the celebrated lake of the same name. It is the seat of a bishop, and of the courts of law and revenue, and contains a cathedral and nine other churches, with 604 houses and 7500 inhabitants. It is in long. 9. 0. 21. E. and lat. 45. 48. 22. N.
