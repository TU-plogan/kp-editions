COVENTRY, an ancient city in the county of Warwick, ninety-two miles from London. The streets are narrow and ill built, and the whole has a very gloomy appearance. There are some handsome churches, especially St Michaelâ€™s, the spire of which is an object of great admiration. The inhabitants are occupied in manufactories, of which that of ribbons is the most extensive. Other silk goods are also made, and several thousand watches of gold and silver are annually produced. It has several charitable institutions, which are under the management and patronage of the corporation. It was strongly fortified in ancient times, but the defences have been destroyed. The market is held on Friday. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 17,923, in 1821 to 21,242, and in 1831 to 27,070.
