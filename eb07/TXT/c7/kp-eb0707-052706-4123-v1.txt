CUDDALORE, a town of Hindustan, in the south of India, and province of the Carnatic. It is situated on the western shore of the Bay of Bengal; and its position, naturally strong, would have afforded a more commodious place for the chief British settlement on the coast of Coromandel than Madras. The English East India Company obtained a grant of it from the rajah of Gingee in the year 1681. Here they constructed a factory, which, in consequence of the increasing trade, they wholly rebuilt and fortified in 1702. The town was taken by the French in 1758; but in two years afterwards it was recaptured by

Sir Eyre Coote. In 1782, after the destruction of Colonel Braithwaite’s detachment by Tippoo, it was forced to surrender to the combined forces of the French and Hyder; and the works were greatly strengthened, and a strong garrison sent to defend them. In 1783 it was besieged by the British, who were repulsed with the loss of 942 killed and wounded, in a desperate attempt to storm the works. At the conclusion of the peace of 1783, it was ceded to the British. The adjacent country was fearfully ravaged during the wars with Hyder Ali, and most of the inhabitants were forced to fly. It is now comprehended in the British collcctorship of Arcot, and is rapidly recovering from the devastations of war. It is 102 miles S. S. W. from Madras, and fifteen S. S. W. from Pondicherry. Long. 79. 52. E. Lat. 11. 44. N.
