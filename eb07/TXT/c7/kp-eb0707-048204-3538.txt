CROUSAZ, Jean Pierre de, was born at Lausanne on the 13th of April 1663. He was one of the most prolific writers of the eighteenth century; but his works seldom rise above mediocrity, and are now but little read. He was a Protestant of noble extraction, and his father destined him for the profession of arms, but he preferred the more tranquil pursuit of letters. He applied himself particularly to the study of the mathematics, and became a warm partizan of the Cartesian philosophy. After some time spent in travelling, he returned to his native place, where he was successively appointed pastor, professor of philosophy, and rector of the academy. In 1724, he was called to Groningen to teach the mathematics, and appointed governor to the young prince Frederick of Hesse-Cassel. The king of Sweden also conferred upon him the title of counsellor of embassies. Crousaz died on the 22d of March 1750, at which time he was a member of the Academy of Bordeaux, and foreign associate of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. His principal works are, 1. Systeme des Reflexions qui peuvent contribuer a la netteté et à létude de nos Connaissances, ou nouvel Essai de Logique, Amsterdam, 1712, 2 vols. 8vo; 2. Traite de Peau, où l’on montre cri quoi consiste ce qui l’on nomme ainsi, Amsterdam, 1715, 8vo, and 1724, 2 vols. 12mo; 3. Pe l’Ediicatum des Εηfαηs, Hague, 1722, 2 vols. 12mo; 4. Examen du Traite de la Liberté de Penser d’Antoine Collins, Brussels, 1715, Amsterdam, 1718, 8vo; 5. Geometrie des Lignes et des Surfaces rectilignes et circulaires, Amsterdam, 1718, 2 vols. 8vo; 6. Examen du Pyrrhonisme ancien et moderne, Hague, 1733, fol.; 7. Oeuvres diverses, 1737, 2 vols. 8vo; 8. Traité de l' Esprit Humain, against Wolff and Leibnitz, 1741; 9. Peflexions sur la belle Wolfienne, Lausanne, 1743, 8vo. In bis Traite de Peau Crousaz maintains that, to constitute beauty, there must be a concurrence of five qualities or conditions, namely, unity, variety, order, proportion, and regularity. But this definition, it must be obvious, is far from having that character of simplicity which is suited to the nature of beauty; and a more refined analysis has since demonstrated that the only condition necessary to constitute beauty is association with certain feelings and emotions of an agreeable or a pleasurable kind. The most important of all his works, however, is the Examination of ancient and modern Pyrrhonism, which displays sound thinking, and no inconsiderable degree of philosophical learning. Besides the works above enumerated, Crousaz was the author of some sermons, an essay on metaphysics, reflections on gambling, remarks on the utility of physics and mathematics, an essay on rhetoric, another on motion, a treatise on algebra, observations on the logic of Horace, an examination of Pope’s Essay on Man, a commentary on the analysis of quantities infinitely small, several dissertations crowned by the academy of Bordeaux, and other pieces. (See his Eloge by Fouchy in l' Histoire de l' Academie des Sciences, 1750, p. 779.)
