COLUMBANUS, a saint and poet, was born in Ireland, and brought up to a religious life among the disciples of St Columba. He made uncommon progress in learning, and very early in life distinguished himself for poetical abilities by the composition of a book of psalms, and a number of moral poems, intended also to be set to music. Jonas, a writer of ecclesiastical history, mentions that Columbanus belonged originally to a monastery of the name of Benchor. The same monastery is mentioned by St Bernard in his life of his friend St Malachi; and he relates that it sent out a great number of monks, who spread themselves all over Europe. Columbanus passed from Britain into France in the year 589, and founded the monastery of Luxevillc, near Besan√ßon. He had been kindly received and patronized by King Childebert; but he was afterwards expelled from France by the wicked queen Brunichild. He retired to Lombardy in Italy, where he founded the monastery of Bobbio.
