It subsequently fell into the hands of the Nizam of the Deccan, by whom, in the year 1800, it was ceded to the British. It is now subdivided into two collectorships under the Madras government, Cuddapah and Bellary, the former comprehending the eastern and the latter the western portion of the Balaghaut ceded districts. The principal towns arc Cuddapah, Wandicotta, and Combam.
