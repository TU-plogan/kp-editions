COIMBRA, a city of Portugal, in the province of Beyra, containing 1500 inhabitants. The river Mondego passes through it, and has a well-built bridge across it. After traversing the province, it enters the sea at the port of Buarcos. Coimbra is the see of a bishop, but is principally celebrated for the university which is established there. This institution, the only one of the kind in the kingdom, is richly endowed, having an annual rental of two millions of reals. Besides professors of divinity and other studies connected with theology, it has teachers of law, mathematics, and the classics. It has a botanic garden, a chemical laboratory, cabinets of physics and natural history, an astronomical observatory, a printing office, and a copious library, open for the improvement of the students. Whatever may be the mode of communicating knowledge, few institutions in Europe excel this in the liberal application of wealth to that purpose. It is the capital of the province in which it stands, and is in longitude 7. 53. 37. W. and latitude 40. 12. 30. N.
