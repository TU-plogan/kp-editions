COLCHESTER, a borough-town in the hundred of Lexden, of the county of Essex, fifty-one miles from London, and situated on the banks of the navigable river Colne. It was formerly a larger place than at present, containing sixteen parishes. It had an extensive trade in baizes, which is now removed to the northern counties. It is remarkable for its excellent oysters. It is a well-built town, on the declivity of a hill. It is governed by a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, and thirty-six common-councilmen. Markets are held on Wednesday and Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 12,544, in 1821 to 14,106, and in 1831 to 16,167.
