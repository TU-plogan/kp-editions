COLIGNI, Gaspard de, admiral of France, was born at Châtillon-sur-Loin in 1517. He signalized himself in his youth, during the reigns of Francis I. and Henry IL, and was made colonel of infantry and admiral of France in 1552. Henry II. employed him in the most important affairs; but after the death of that prince lie embraced the reformed religion, and became the chief of the Hu-gonot or Protestant party. He strongly opposed the house of Guise, and rendered this opposition so formidable that it was thought he would have overturned the French government. On the peace concluded after the battles of Jernac and Montcontour, Charles XI. deluded Coligni into security by his deceitful favours; and though he recovered from one attempt on his life, when he attended the nuptials of the prince of Navarre, yet he fell in the dreadful massacre of the Protestants perpetrated on St Bartholomew’s day, 24th August 1572, and his body was treated with wanton brutality by a fanatical and excited populace. History has preserved the name of the wretch who assassinated the admiral. He was a Bohemian or Gipsy, called Bêine, whom Guise had employed for the purpose, and who, even in that day of blood, distinguished himself for more wanton barbarities than his fellow murderers.
