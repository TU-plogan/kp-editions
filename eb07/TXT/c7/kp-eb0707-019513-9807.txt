CONCEPTION, in the philosophy of the mind. See Metaphysics.
[7:7:196]

Conception, in Physiology, denotes the first formation of the embryo or foetus in the womb.

Conception, Immaculate, of the Holy Virgin, is a feast established in honour of the holy virgin, particularly with regard to her having been conceived and born immaculate, or without original sin, and is held in the Roman Catholic church on the 8th of December. The immaculate conception is the great head of controversy between the Scotists and Thomists, the former maintaining and the latter impugning it.

Conception, a province, city, and bay of Chili, in South America. The province is exceedingly fertile, and clothed with luxuriant foliage. The best wine of the country is made there; and a considerable trade is carried on in the produce of the province. The city is situated near the sea coast, and in its vicinity is one of the finest harbours in Chili. This place, and also the surrounding country, were formerly opulent and prosperous; but, from the evils which usually follow in the train of civil commotion, they have very much declined since the commencement of the revolution. From the eligibility of the place, however, as a commercial mart, and the fertility of the adjacent soil, a few yearsâ€™ repose will greatly enhance its wealth and population. The principal exports are timber, wheat, flour, and the fruits of the country. Coal has been found near the bay, but it is not calculated to answer all purposes; and the expense of transmitting it to Coquimbo, and other important places in the republic, is greater than even that of bringing the article from England. A large and flourishing flour-mill has been erected near the city, and promises to be of great advantage to it. It is distant 480 miles from Santiago. Conception is the name of various other places in South America, but they are all of minor importance.
