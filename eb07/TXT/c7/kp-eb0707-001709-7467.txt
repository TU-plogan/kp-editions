COELOSYRIA, in the larger sense of the word, was the name of the whole country to the southward of Seleucia, and extending as far as Egypt and Arabia; but this word is principally applied to the valley situated between Libanus and Anti-Libanus. This word occurs only in the apocryphal writings of the Old Testament.
