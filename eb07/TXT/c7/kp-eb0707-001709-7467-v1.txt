COeLUS (Heaven), in Pagan Mythology, the son of Aether and Dies, or Air and Day. According to Hesiod, he married Terra or the Earth, on whom he begat Aurea or the Mountains, the Ocean, &c. But having at length imprisoned the Cyclops, who were also his children, his wife, offended at this proceeding, incited her son Saturn to revenge the injury done to his brothers; and by her assistance the latter bound and castrated Coelus, when the blood which flowed from the wound produced the three furies, the giants, and the wood-nymphs; while the genital parts being thrown into the sea, impregnated the waters, and formed the goddess Venus. This deity was called by the Greeks Uranus.
