COSMOLOGY (from κοσμο;, world, and aoyoς, discourse), the science of the world in general. This AVolfius calls general or transcendental cosmology, and has written a treatise on the subject, in which he endeavours to explain how the world arose from simple substances, and treats of the general principles, of the modifications of material things, of the elements of bodies, of the laws of motion, of the perfection of the world, and of the order and course of nature.
