CRESCIMBENI, John Maria, an Italian poet, was born at Macerata, in the march of Ancona, in 1663. His talents for poetry and eloquence early developed themselves' His verses at first had too much pomp and point; but by residing in Rome, and by reading the best Italian poets, he brought himself back to nature. And he not only reformed himself, but undertook to reform taste in general. With this view he projected the establishment of a new academy, under the name of Arcadia ; the members of which at first did not exceed fourteen, but afterwards increased considerably. They called themselves the shepherds of Arcadia, and each took the name of some shepherd and some place in that ancient kingdom. The found er of this society was appointed chief director in 1690, and held this honourable post thirty-eight years, that is, until his death, which happened in the year 1728.
