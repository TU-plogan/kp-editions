CYCEON (from κu%αi∕v, to mix or mingle), a name given by the ancient poets and physicians to a mixture of meal and water, and sometimes of other ingredients. These constituted the two kinds of cyceon; the coarser consisting of water and meal alone, but the richer and more delicate being composed of wine, honey, flour, water, and cheese. Homer, in the eleventh book of the Iliad, talks of cyceon made of cheese and the meal of barley mixed with wine, but without any mention either of honey or water; and Ovid, describing the draught of cyceon given by the old woman of Athens to Ceres, mentions only flour and water. Dioscorides understood the word in both these senses; but extolled it most when of the coarse and simple kind, declaring, that when prepared with water alone, it ∣ refrigerates and nourishes greatly.
