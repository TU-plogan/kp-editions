COLLAR, in Roman antiquity, a sort of chain put generally round the neck of runaway slaves after they were re-taken, with an inscription round it, intimating that they were deserters, and requiring that they should be restored to their proper owners, in the event of their again running away.

Collar, in a more modern sense, an ornament consisting of a chain of gold, enamelled, and frequently set with ciphers or other devices, with the badge of the order hanging at the bottom, worn by the knights of several military orders over their shoulders, on the mantle, while its figure is drawn round their armories. Thus the collar of the order of the garter consists of S. S., with roses enamelled red, within a garter enamelled blue, and the George at the bottom.

Knights of the Collar, a military order in the republic of Venice, called also the order of St Mark, or the Medal. The doge and the senate conferred this order; but the knights wore no particular habit, only the collar, which the [7:7:68] doge put around their neck, with a medal, in which was represented the winged lion of the republic.
