CROW, in Mechanics, a kind of iron lever, with a claw at one end and a sharp point at the other, used for heaving or purchasing great weights.

Crow's Pill, among surgeons, a kind of forceps for extracting bullets and other foreign bodies out of wounds.

Crow's Feet, in the military art, machines of iron, having four points, each about three or four inches long, and so made that, whichever way they fall, there is still a point up. They are thrown upon breaches, or in passes where the enemy’s cavalry are to march, and prove a formidable obstruction, by running into the horses’ feet and laming them.
