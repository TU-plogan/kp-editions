COMBOOCONAM, a town of Southern India, in the province of Tanjore. This was the ancient capital of the Chola race, one of the oldest Hindu dynastics of which any traces remain, and from whom the whole coast of Coromandel, properly Cholamundel, derives its name. It still retains many visible indications of its ancient splendour. Its inhabitants are now chiefly Brahmins, whose habitations are neat, and the district is thriving. Some of the tanks and pagodas are represented by travellers as very fine, and as indicating the former splendour of the town. The surrounding country is in a high state of cultivation.
