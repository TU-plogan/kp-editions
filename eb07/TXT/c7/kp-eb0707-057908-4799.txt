CZERNOWITZ, a circle in the Austrian kingdom of Gallicia, formerly known by the name of Bucowina. It was anciently a part of Moldavia, but transferred to Austria in 1777. It extends over 3400 square miles, or 2,180,000 English acres. In 1817 the population amounted to 201,319, in 41,864 families, of which 915 were Jews. It comprehends three cities, three market-towns, and 274 villages. The inhabitants are principally of the Wallachian or Moldavian race, and mostly adhere to the Greek church; but there are also Armenian, Hungarian, and German settlers, besides the Jews. The face of the country, being a continuation of the Carpathian range, is mountainous, and much of it is covered with woods. Many of the valleys are highly fertile, and yield excellent corn, potatoes, flax, hemp, and garden fruits. The principal tree is the beech, from which the province received its ancient name. The district is rich in mineral products, affording gold from the sands of the river Bistritza, and from various mines silver, lead, copper, iron, and rock salt. The chief manufactures are of the several minerals, and of potash, corn, spirits, and leather. Under the house of Austria the district has much improved, owing to good roads having been opened through it, connecting Gallicia with Hungary.

Czernowitz, a city, the capital of the circle of the same name, in the Austrian province of Gallicia. It is situated on the river Pruth, and has a Greek cathedral, and several other churches, both for Catholics and Greeks. It is the seat of the courts of law, and of several establishments of education. It contains about 500 houses, and in 1817 the population amounted to 5460 persons. It has manufactories of gold and silver wares, watchmaking, and some others, and carries on a trade between Hungary and Gallicia, which is chiefly in the hands of the Jews. Long. 48. 25. 10. E.
