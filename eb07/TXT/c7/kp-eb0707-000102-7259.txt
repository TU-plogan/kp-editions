CLOGHER, an episcopal town of Ireland, in the coun-, ty of Tyrone, and province of Ulster. In a very early age an abbey of regular canons, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was founded here. This was once a place of some consequence, but there is nothing about it now which entitles it to its former appellation of city. It is distant about 105 miles north-west of Dublin.
