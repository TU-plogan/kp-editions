COTOPAXI, the most remarkable volcanic mountain of the Andes, in Quito, thirty-five miles south-south-east of Quito. It rises 18,898 feet above the level of the sea, and is considered as the most beautiful of the colossal summits of the Andes. Its eruptions have been numerous and very destructive; those which took place in 1698, 1738, 1742, 1744,1766,1768, and 1803, are the most remarkable. With respect to the explosion of 1803, Humboldt observes, “At the port of Guayaquil, fifty-two leagues distant in a straight line from the crater, we heard day and night the noise of this volcano, like continued discharges of a battery; and we distinguished these tremendous sounds even on the Pacific Ocean.” The eruption of 1698 destroyed the city , of Tacunga, together with three fourths of its inhabitants. The appearance of this volcano is in the highest degree majestic and sublime. It is a perfect cone, and, being covered with a thick layer of snow, shines at sunset with dazzling splendour, standing forth in bold relief upon the azure heavens. Humboldt found it difficult to ascend the mountain as far as the line of perpetual snow, and he pronounces it impossible ever to reach the summit.
