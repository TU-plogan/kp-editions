CRACOW, a small republic bordering on the Prussian, Austrian, and Russian dominions, at the point where they meet. It stretches along the left bank of the Vistula, where the Rudowa falls into that stream. The territory is about thirty-three miles in length, and its extent is about 500 square miles, or 323,840 English acres. The land is fertile and well cultivated; and there are mines of iron, zinc, and coal. The whole number of the inhabitants is about 70,000, including the city. The form of government is democratic, with a president elected by the inhabitants. The president must be thirty-five years of age, must have been educated at a Polish university, and must possess land which pays a tax amounting to seventy-five shillings a ' year. It is also necessary that he should have previously filled some public office. The power he exercises is in common with a senate of twelve members, eight of whom are chosen by the chamber of representatives, two by the clergy of the cathedral, and two by the university.

The capital is fortified, and contains 26,000 inhabitants, among whom are many Jews. The cathedral is an ancient and still magnificent building, containing many antiquities of an historical nature belonging to the kingdom of Poland, the monarchs of which were crowned in it. In the same apartment under it are the coffins of John Sobieski, of Poniatowski, and of Kosciusko. Near the city an enormous conical mound has been raised in honour of the latter. It is a place of some trade by tlxe Vistula, as well as by land. Long. 19. 50. 39. E. Lat. 50. 3. 22. N.
