COQUIMBO, a province of Chili, in South America, is bounded on the north by Copiapo, on the east by the Andes, on the south-east by Aconcagua, on the southwest by Quillota, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. This province suffers for want of rain, and is by no means so fertile as many other parts of Chili. It presents frequent contrasts of sterility and luxuriance, but the latter predominates where rivers and streams traverse the country. Like the neighbouring province of Copiapo, Coquimbo contains gold mines; but those of silver and copper are the most valuable. A few years ago a vein of silver in a -metallic state was discovered, but it proved to be of very limited extent. Mines of quicksilver are also said to exist in this province. Coquimbo, the capital, is situated upon a river of the same name, about a quarter of a league from the sea. It is the seaport of the province; and the harbour is considered as one of the best in Chili, and is much frequented. The streets of the city are built in a line from north to south and from east to west, and the number of houses is estimated at between three and four hundred. It has been calculated that of late from one to two billions of dollars have been annually exported from Coquimbo. TjÎ¹e province is 13,300 square miles in extent, and contains 20,000 inhabitants.
