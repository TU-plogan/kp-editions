CUCURBIT, the name of a chemical vessel employed in distillation. It derives its name from its elongated form in shape of a gourd. Some cucurbits, however, are shallow and wide mouthed. They are made of copper, tin, glass, and stoneware, according to the nature of the substances to be distilled. A cucurbit, provided with its capital, constitutes the vessel for distillation called an αkmbic.
