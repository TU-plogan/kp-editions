COORG, a mountainous and woody district of Southern India, among the western Ghauts, situated between the province of Mysore and the British province of Malabar. This country is considered as extending from the Tambacherry Pass on the south, to the confines of the Beđ-nore country on the north. The mountains produce sandal wood of the very best species, teak timber, rice, pepper, and some other spices. The woods also abound with elephants and ferocious animals, especially tigers. It contains scarcely any towns, and of late years the rajah and his family have resided in the fortress of Mercara. The rajahs of Coorg are of the Nair caste of Hindus. They are mentioned in history as early as the year 1583, and the present family have reigned since 1632. They retained their independence till the year 1773, when Hyder Λli, who had in vain attempted to subdue them, found an opportunity for interfering in a dispute about the succession, and, by the destruction of one of the parties, and the captivity of the other, took possession of the country. Upon Tippoo’s accession to the sovereignty he ordered the royal family to be removed from Bednore to the fort of Periapatam, whence having made his escape in the year 1778, his faithful subjects crowded to his standard, and drove the armies of Tippoo from his dominions. In the war which the British declared against Tippoo in the year 1791 they found the rajah of Coorg a useful auxiliary, and it was insisted by Lord Cornwallis as one of the primary articles of peace, that he should be rendered independent of Tippoo’s authority, and that Coorg shoμld be one of the ceded territories. In the year 1799, on the downfal ol Tippoo, the rajah of Coorg was rewarded by the free and uncontrolled management of his own territories. The country has recently enjoyed a state of tranquillity; it is fast recovering from the calamities of war, and now exports considerable quantities of grain to Mysore. The river Cavery has its source in Coorg, but does not attair to any magnitude until it enters the province of Mysore.
