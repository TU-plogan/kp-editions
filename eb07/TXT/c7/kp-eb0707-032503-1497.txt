CORFU, the chief of those islands which form the Ionian republic. It is situated at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea, between the latitudes 39. 22. and 39.26. N. and the longitudes 19. 55. and 20. 27. E.; and in extent it is 235 square miles, or about 150,000 English acres, and is divided into seven cantons. It is opposite the eastern shore of Greece, in no part more than five miles, and to the north scarcely more than one mile, distant. The island is generally rocky and mountainous, but none of the heights exceed 1400 feet. The hills are mostly naked, and they stand so close to each other as to leave space for only very narrow valleys. There are some exceptions, where the low ground has a good depth of calcareous, clayey, or loamy soil. It is better supplied with water than the other Ionian Islands, having several brooks, which are full in the winter and spring, and some which are not wholly dried up in the summer. There are many copious springs, and in the south-west there is the fresh-water lake Corissia. The climate is mild but variable, and changes from great cold to intense heat within a few hours. The wind from the north, but particularly from the east, by passing over [7:7:326]the snowy mountains on the continent, brings severe cold; whilst the wind from the south conveys either sultry heat or rain and thick fogs. There are few years in which shocks of earthquakes are not felt, but their effects are less disastrous than are experienced in Cephaloniaâˆ™

The land in Corfu is cultivated on the metayer system, as practised in Italy, by which the produce is divided betwixt the proprietor and the occupier. The product of greatest value is that of the olive trees, said to be in number upwards of three millions. Although the olives are harsh in taste, and the management of the oil, both in expressing and in preserving, is far from being skilful, yet it is said that upwards of 80,000 quintals are made, much of which is consumed within the island, and the surplus is sufficient to pay for what foreign goods the inhabitants want. Corn and wine are produced, but neither in sufficient quantity for the consumption. There is an abundant supply of vegetables and fruit, as well as of nuts and acorns, all of which furnish part of the means of subsistence; and some addition is made to them by the fishing, which might be rendered more productive, but for the indolence of the natives.

There is little trade, and that is in the hands of the Venetians, and of some English houses established since the republic has been placed under British protection. The oil has been already noticed; next to which salt must be added, of which about 200,000 quintals are yearly obtained. The exports amount to less than the imports; and the gradual improvement of the natives would proceed, if many of them did not repair to the continent to work during harvest, and return home with their gains.

The population amounts to about 75,000 persons, inhabiting one city, eleven market towns, and one hundred and eighteen villages and handets. They are mostly of the Greek race, and adhere to the ritual of the Greek church; but among them are many Roman Catholics of Italian origin. Although the Greeks compose six-sevenths of the whole population, they have no bishop; but the ecclesiastical affairs are regulated by a protopapa, under the direction of the patriarch of Constantinople. The number of their churches is very great, besides which they have several monasteries and nunneries. The Catholics have an archbishop and cathedral, with five churches and three monasteries. There arc on the island about four thousand Jews, who for the most part live in the capital. This, with the other islands, was mastered by the Venetian republic at the end of the fourteenth century, and, though frequently assailed by the Turks, continued under their dominion till 1797, when it was taken possession of by the French. In 1799 it was conquered by the united forces of Russia and Turkey, and, with the other islands, erected into a republic. It was again subdued by France, but at the peace of 1815 was placed under the exclusive protection of Great Britain. The republic is now governed by a senate and house of representatives, under an English lord high commissioner, who, besides the garrisons of regular troops in the several islands, has the command of a numerous militia of natives. Each of the islands has its separate courts of civil and criminal law, as well as its revenue department, but the whole revenue is brought into one general treasury.

Corfu, the capital of the island, and of the canton of that name, in the Mediterranean; the Corcyra of the ancient Greeks. It is situated on the eastern coast of the island, on a promontory, to the north of which is the bay of Corfu. It is strongly fortified both towards the sea and the land. The houses are not lofty; only the principal streets are paved; and, as a whole, it is by no means a well built city. It contains a cathedral and four churches for Catholics, and thirty-six churches and chapels for those of the Greek communion. The inhabitants amount to 15,G00, besides the garrison. The harbour is safe for shipping, and has from twelve to fourteen fathoms of depth. A naval arsenal has been established, and the fortifications much strengthened by the English. Long. 19. 6. E.
