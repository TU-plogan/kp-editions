CRATIPPUS, a celebrated Peripatetic philosopher, was a native of Mitylene, where he taught philosophy, but at length he went to Athens, where Brutus and the son of Cicero were his disciples. Pompey went to see him after the battle of Pharsalia, and proposed to him his difficulties in relation to the belief of a Providence, when Cratippus comforted him, and by forcible arguments answered his objections. He wrote some pieces on divination, and is supposed to be the person whom Tertullian, in his book De Anima, has ranked among the writers upon dreams.
