CURACAO, an island in the Carribbean Sea, about seventy-five miles from the continent of South America. This island is about thirty miles long and ten broad. It is not generally fertile, but sugar and tobacco are produced, and large and small cattle are reared. It has several good ports, particularly one on the southern coast, called St Barbara, where a great trade was formerly carried on by the Dutch in African slaves. The principal towns are Cura√ßao and Williamstadt. The former is well situated, and elegantly built. It is full of storehouses, and provided with every species of merchandise. Williamstadt is considered as the capital.
