COREA, a large peninsula of Asia, formed on one side by the Yellow Sea, and on the other by the Sea of Japan. It is situated immediately to the east of China; and its le.ngth may be estimated at 400 miles, by 150 in average breadth. A great part of what was formerly supposed to be its western coast has been found, from the voyages of Captains Hall and Maxwell to those shores, to consist of an immense archipelago of small islands, the number of which can scarcely be calculated. The interior, which is known only by accounts received from China, or by those of Humel, a Dutchman, who was shipwrecked there in the middle of the seventeenth century, is said to be traversed by an extensive chain of mountains from north to south. The northern districts are cold, and produce only barley and ginseng; but the southern plains yield rice, millet, silk, and other products of China. The king of Corea is a tributary of the emperor of China, to whom he sendsan annual embassy, which is treated by the emperor of China with great haughtiness. It does not appear, however, that the emperor of China interferes in the interior regime of the kingdom. The Coreans resemble the Chinese in their manners. They follow the religion of Fo or B-uddha; and, like the Chinese, they have their men of letters, who form a class by themselves. They are of tolerable stature; but reserved and distant in their manners, and repel the advances of strangers. ∙ Captain Hall, by whom they were visited, describes them as differing from the Chinese in dress, language, and appearance, and having none of that courtesy which they experienced everywhere in China. They are, according to his account, a ruder people, of a dark copper colour, and forbidding in their countenance. Their dress is mostly a loose white frock, barely reaching to the knees, made of an extremely coarse material. They had wide trowsers of the same stuff, and sandals on their feet made of rice-straw. They appeared quite unsocial in their habits, and were extremely anxious to prevent the British from landing on their shores, or from entering any of their towns and houses. Their wretched abodes consist of walls ill constructed of canes plastered over with mud, and are built in the most confused manner. They arc destitute of neatness, order, or cleanliness, the spaces between them being choked up with piles of dirt and puddles of dirty water. They would exchange nothing with the English, despising their gold and their money; and nothing else appeared to them of any value but the looking-glasses. The capital of the country is King-ki-tao, situated nearly in the centre of the country.
