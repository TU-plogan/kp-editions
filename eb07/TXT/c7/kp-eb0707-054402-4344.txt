CUMLY, a small district of Hindustan, in the province of Malabar, South Canara. It is situated on the sea coast, between the twelfth and thirteenth degrees of north latitude. It was formerly governed by a rajah of the Khetni tribe, a military caste from the north of India, who, however, adopted the custom of the Nairs, by perpetuating the succession in the eldest of the female line. The present rajah still resides in the country, but he has neither lands nor authority. By far the greater part of the coast is occupied by a chain of salt-water lakes; but the necks of land interspersed render them of little use for inland navigation.

Cumly, the capital of the above district, twenty-five miles south by east from Mangalore. It is situated on a high peninsula, in a salt-water lake, which is separated from the sea by a spit of sand. Two rivers fall into this lake, and nearly inclose the ground on which the town stands. It consists of a hundred and fifty houses, and is inhabited both by Hindus and Mahommedans. Long. 75. 2. E. Lat. 12. 25. N.
