CONSEQUENCE, in Logic, the conclusion, or that which results from the premises. The consequence is the proposition by which the extremes or premises of a syllogism are joined or separated, and is deduced from what was asserted in the premises. This word, in a more restricted sense, is used for the relation or connection between two propositions, one of which is inferred from the other.
