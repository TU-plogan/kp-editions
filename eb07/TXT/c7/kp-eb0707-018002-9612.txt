COMNENA, Anna, daughter of Alexius Comnenus, emperor of the East, celebrated for her great learning and virtue, and for her history of the life and actions of her father, which is highly esteemed. She flourished about the year 1117. Her history, which is in fifteen books, was first published very imperfectly by Heschelius in 1610, and afterwards printed in the collection of the Byzantine historians, with a diffuse and incorrect Latin version by the Jesuit Possimus, but with excellent notes by the learned Du Fresne.
