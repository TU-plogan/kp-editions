CONVENTICLE, a diminutive of convent, denoting, properly, a cabal, or secret assembly, of a part of the monks of a convent, to form a brigue or party in the election of an abbot. From the bad use of these assemblies, the word has come into disrepute; and now stands for any mischievous, seditious, or irregular assembly. The term conventicle is said by some to have been first applied in England to the schools of Wickliffe; and it has since been used to signify the religious assemblies of all in that country who do not conform to the established doctrines and worship of the church of England.
