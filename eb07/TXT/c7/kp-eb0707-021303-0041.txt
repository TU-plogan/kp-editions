CONGE d’Elire, in ecclesiastical policy, the king’s permission-royal to a dean and chapter in the time of a vacancy, to choose a bishop; or to an abbey or priory, of his own foundation, to choose an abbot or prior.

The king of England, as sovereign patron of all archbishoprics, bishoprics, and other ecclesiastical benefices, had of ancient time free appointment of all ecclesiastical dignities, whenever they chanced to become vacant; investing them first per bacculum et annulum, and afterwards by his letters patent: and in course of time he made over the election to others, under certain forms and limitations, as that they should at every vacation, before they choose, demand the king’s congé d’élire, and after the election crave his royal assent.
