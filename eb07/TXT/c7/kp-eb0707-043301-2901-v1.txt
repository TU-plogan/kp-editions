COURLAND, a province of Russia, on the Baltic Sea. It was a Dutch dependent on Poland till 1795, when it fell under the power of Russia, but still retained its old name, and most of its laws, manners, and religion. It extends from north to south from the latitude 55° 37' to that of 57° 33', and from east to west from longitude 20° 48' to 26° 5', covering about 9950 square miles. It contains eleven cities, seven market-towns, and 756 villages. The last calculation makes the number of inhabitants amount to 568,690; but as that was made twenty-two years ago, they have probably since increased. The greater part of the inhabitants are of the German race, and adhere to the Lutheran church, but about one third are of the Roman Catholic persuasion. The old nobility, who are chiefly Germans or Poles, retain the exclusive privileges they enjoyed under their former government.

The greater part of the province is sandy, and for the most part level, and far from fertile; but some spots are highly productive of rye, barley, and oats, with small portions of wheat, peas, and tobacco. The cultivation is easy, as most of the land is ploughed with a single horse. A considerable quantity of flax and hemp is grown, and these articles form the chief exports. There are few manufactures, except such as are carried on by the proprietors on their own lands, for their own use, and by their own workmen, who furnish the nobles with clothing, furniture, and instruments of industry. The chief city is Mittau, where the few colonial goods that are consumed are imported.
