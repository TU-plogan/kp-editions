CREMONA, a delegation of the government of Milan, in the Austrian kingdom of Venetian Lombardy, bounded on the north by Brescia, on the east by Mantua, on the south by Parma, and on the west by Lodi. It extends over 500 square miles, or 320,000 English acres, and was inhabited in 1817 by 170,960 individuals. The delegation is subdivided into nine districts, containing two cities, seven market-towns, anxl one hundred and eighty villages, in all of which are 19,300 houses. It is a level district, producing heavy crops of wheat, rice, and maize, yielding abundance of silk and flax, and possessing appropriate stocks of black cattle, but very few sheep. The greatest scarcity experienced is that of wood for fuel and for building. There are not any manufactures worthy of notice, except that of spinning silk.
