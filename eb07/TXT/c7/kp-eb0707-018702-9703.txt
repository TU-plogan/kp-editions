COMPARTMENT, in general, is a design composed of several different figures, disposed with symmetry, to adorn a parterre, a ceiling, or the like.
[7:7:188]

A compartment of tiles or bricks is an arrangement of them, of different colours, and varnished, for the decora- 'tion of a building. Compartments in gardening are an assemblage of beds, plots, borders, walks, and the like, disposed in the most advantageous manner which the ground will admit of. Compartments in heraldry are otherwise called partitions.
