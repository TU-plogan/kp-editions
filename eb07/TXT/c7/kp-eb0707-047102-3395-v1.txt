CRIM Tartars, a people of Asia, so called because they originally came from Crimea. They rove from place to place in search of pastures. There are a great number of them about Astracan, to which place they flock in the winter time; but they are not permitted to enter the city. For this reason they erect in the open fields huts, which are made either of bulrushes or reeds, being about twelve feet in diameter, of a round form, and with a hole at the top to let out the smoke. Their fuel consists of turf or cow-dung; and when the weather is very cold, they cover their huts with coarse cloths, and sometimes pass several days without stirring out. They are generally of small stature, with large faces, little eyes, and an olive complexion. The [men are commonly so wrinkled in their faces that they look like old women. Their ordinary food is fish dried in the sun, which serves them instead of bread, and they eat the flesh of horses as well as that of camels. Their drink is water and milk, especially mare’s milk, which they carry about in filthy leathern bags. Their garments are of coarse grey cloth, with a loose mantle made of black sheep’s skin, and a cap of the same material. The women are clothed in white linen, with which they likewise dress their heads; and there is also a hole left in which to stick feathers. As for their religion, they are a sort of Mahommedans, but do not seclude their women like the Turks. See Crimea.
