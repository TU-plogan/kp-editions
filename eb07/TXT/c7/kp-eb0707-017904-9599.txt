COMMOTE, an ancient term in Wales, denoting half a cantred, or hundred, containing fifty villages. See Hundred. Wales was anciently divided into three provinces, each of them subdivided into cantreds, and every cantred into two commotes or hundreds. Silvester Girald, however, tells us in his Itinerary, that a commote is but a quarter of a hundred.
