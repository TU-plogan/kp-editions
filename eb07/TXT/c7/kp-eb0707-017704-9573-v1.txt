COMMITTEE, one or more persons to whom the consideration or ordering of a matter is referred, either by some court, or by the consent of parties whom it concerns, and who are interested therein.

Committee of Parliament, a certain number of members appointed by the house for the examination of a bill, or for inquiring into and making a report upon some particular subject. Sometimes the whole house is resolved into a committee; on which occasion each person has a right to speak and reply as much and as often as he pleases; an expedient which is usually had recourse to where any thing is to be thoroughly canvassed. When the house is not in committee, each gives his opinion regularly, and is only allowed to speak once, unless to explain himself. The standing committees, appointed by every new parliament, are those of privileges and elections, of religion, of grievances, of courts of justice, of trade, &c.
