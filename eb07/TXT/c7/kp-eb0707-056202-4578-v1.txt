CUSTOS Brevium, the principal clerk belonging to the court of common pleas, whose business it is to receive and keep all the writs made returnable in that court, filing every return by itself; and, at the end of each term, to receive of the prothonotaries all the records of the nisi prius, called the posteas. Custos Rotulorum, an officer who has the custody of the rolls and records of the session of peace, and also of the commission of the peace itself. He is usually some person of quality, and always a justice of the peace, of the quorum, in the county where he is appointed.

Custos Spiritualium, he who exercises the spiritual jurisdiction of a diocese, during the vacancy of any see, which by the canon law belongs to the dean and chapter, but at present, in England, to the archbishop of the province by prescription.

Custos Temporalium was the person to whom a vacant see or abbey was given by the king, as supreme lord. His office, as steward of the goods and profits, was to give an account to the escheator, who did the same to the exchequer.
