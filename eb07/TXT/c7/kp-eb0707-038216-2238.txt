COSMICAL, a term in Astronomy, expressing one of the poetical risings of a star. Thus a star is said to rise cosmically when it rises with the sun, or with that point of the elliptic in which the sun is at that time; and the cosm√≠cal setting is when a star sets in the west at the same time that the sun rises in the east.
