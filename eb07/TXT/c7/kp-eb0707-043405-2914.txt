COVENANT, in ecclesiastical history, denotes the contract or convention agreed to by the Scotch in the year 1638, for maintaining their religion against innovation. In 1581 the General Assembly of Scotland drew up a confession of faith, or national covenant, condemning episcopal government, under the name of hierarchy, which was signed by James I. and enjoined upon all his subjects. It was again subscribed in 1590 and 1596. The subscrip-tion was renewed in 1638, and the subscribers engaged by oath to maintain religion in the same state in which it existed in 1580, and to reject all innovations introduced since that time. This oath annexed to the confession of faith received the name of the Covenant; as those who subscribed it were called Covenanters.

Covenant, in Theology, is much used in connection with other terms. The Covenant of Grace is that which is made between God and those who believe the gospel, by which they declare their subjection to him, and he declares his acceptance of and favour for them. The gospel is sometimes denominated a covenant of grace, in opposition to the Mosaic law. Covenant of Redemption denotes a mutual stipulation, tacit or express, between Christ and the Father, relating to the redemption of sinners by him previously to any act on Christâ€™s part in the character of Mediator. Covenant of Works signifies, in the language of some divines, any covenant by which God requires of his creatures perfect obedience, in such a manner as to make no express provision for the pardon of offences to be committed against the precepts of it on the repentance of such supposed offenders, but pronounces a sentence of death upon them. Such, they say, was the covenant made with Adam in a state of innocence, and also that made with Israel at Mount Sinai.

Solemn League and Covenant was established in the year 1643, and formed a bond of union betwixt Scotland and England. It was sworn and subscribed by many in both nations, who thereby solemnly abjured popery and prelacy, and combined together for their mutual defence. It was approved by the parliament and assembly at Westminster, and ratified by the general assembly of Scotland in 1645. King Charles I. disapproved of it when he surrendered himself to the Scottish army in 1646; but in 1650 Charles II. by a solemn oath declared his approbation both of this and of the national covenant; and in August the same year he made a further declaration at Dunfermline to the same purpose, which was also renewed on the occasion of his coronation at Scone in 1651. The covenant was ratified by the parliament this year, and the subscription of it required by every member; it being declared that without such subscription the constitution of the parliament was null and void. This is not the place to enter into any details respecting the troubles and distractions which subsequently arose, and were ascribed by the ruling party to the Covenant, which was accordingly declared illegal, and prohibited by 14 Car. II. c. 4.
