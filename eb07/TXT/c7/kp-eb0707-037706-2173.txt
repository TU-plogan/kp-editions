CORSEE, a small town of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapoor, and district of Raybaugh, situated on the banks of the Kistnah river, which here runs in an easterly direction, and is about five hundred yards from bank to bank. It was formerly, while under the Mahommedan government, a place of considerable note; but it has been so much oppressed by the Mahratta Brahmins, that many of the Mahommedan persuasion have emigrated. Some, however, still remain, and are subsisted by a revenue from charitable lands. In the vicinity is a Mahommedan burying ground, where many persons of great eminence are interred. Among these the tomb of Shaikh Surajiadden is held in the highest reverence. This is one of the towns within the Mahratta territory which enjoys the extraordinary privilege of killing beef for sale. Long. 74. 56. EÂ» Lat. 16. 40. N.
