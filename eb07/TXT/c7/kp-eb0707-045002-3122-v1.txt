CRATINUS, an ancient comic poet, of whom we should scarcely have known any thing, had not Quintilian, Horace, and Persius mentioned him, along with Eupolis and Aristophanes, as the great masters of what is called the ancient comedy. He seems to have died in the eightyseventh Olympiad. Suidas tells us that he wrote twenty-one plays, and that his characters were extremely splendid.
