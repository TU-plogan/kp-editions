COHAHUILA, a province of Mexico in the intendancy of San Luis Potosi. Its greatest length is 500 miles, and its greatest breadth 200 miles. The climate is described as pure and healthy, exÏ‚ept about the middle of May, when the heat is intense; and sometimes a scorching wind is felt, which blisters the face. This province receives all its merchandise from Mexicoby land, and in return furnishes horses, mules, wines, and the precious metals. The vine is the chief article of cultivation, together with grain and corn sufficient for home consumption, and for the supply of the greater part of the neighbouring province of Texas. It possesses several towns, but none of any great magnitude. The population amounts to about 70,000. This province lies between long. 101. and 105. W. and lat. 23. 31. 30. N.
