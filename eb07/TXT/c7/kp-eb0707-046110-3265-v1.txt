+=====================================================================+


CREON, king of Corinth, was son of Sisyphus. He promised his daughter Glauce to Jason, who had repudiated Medea; but to revenge the success of her rival, Medea sent her as a present a gown covered with poison. Glauce put it on, and was seized with sudden pains; her body took fire, and she expired in the greatest torments. The house also was consumed by the fire, and Creon and his family shared Glauce’s fate.

CiiEON, son of Menoetius, was father of Jocasta, the wife and mother of Oedipus. At the death of Laius, who had married Jocasta, Creon ascended the vacant throne of Thebes. But as the ravages of the Sphynx were intolerable, Creon offered his crown and his~daughtcr in marriage to him who could explain the enigmas which the monster proposed. Oedipus was happy in his explanations, and having ascended the throne of Thebes, he married Jocasta without knowing that she was his mother, and by her had two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, who mutually agreed, after their father’s death, to reign alternately a year each. Eteocles first ascended the throne by right of seniority; but when he was once in power he refused to resign at the appointed time, and his brother led against him an army of Argives to support his right. The war was decided by a single combat between the two brothers, who killed each other, and Creon ascended the throne until Leodamus, tlĩe son of Eteocles, should be of sufficient age to assume the reins of government. In his regal capacity, he ordained that the Argives, and more particularly Polynices, who was the cause of all the bloodshed, should remain unburied; and if this was in any manner disobeyed, that the offenders should be buried alive. Antigone, the sister of Polynices, transgressed, and was punished accordingly. Haemon, the son of Creon, who was passionately fond of Antigone, killed himself on her grave when his father refused to grant her pardon. Creon was afterwards killed by Theseus, who had made war against him because he refused burial to the Argives.
