COLLEGIANS, Collegiani, Collegiants, a religious sect formed among the Arminians and Anabaptists in Holland, about the beginning of the seventeenth century, and so called because of their colleges or meetings twice a week, where every one, females excepted, had the liberty of expounding the Scripture, praying, &c. They are said to have been all either Arians or Socinians; they never communicated in the college, but met twice a year from all parts of Holland at Rhinsberg, a village two miles from Leyden, where they communicated together; and they admitted every one who presented himself, without regard to his sect or opinion, provided he professed his [7:7:70]faith in the divinity of the Holy Scriptures, and his resolution to live suitably to their precepts and doctrines. They have no particular ministers, but each officiates as he is disposed. They never baptize without dipping.
