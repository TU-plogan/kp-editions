CURRAN, John Philpot, a celebrated Irish advocate and orator, was born at Newmarket, near Cork, in the year 1750. He received his education at Trinity College, Dublin, after which he went to London, and studied at one of the inns of court. In due time he was called to the bar; and shortly afterwards he married Miss O’Dell, an Irish lady of a very respectable family. His talents soon rendered him conspicuous, and during the Duke of Portland’s administration he received a silk gown. In 1784 he was chosen a member of the Irish House of Commons, where his abilities were advantageously employed; and he gradually rose to be the most popular advocate of his age and country. The distracted state of Ireland towards the close of the last century gave frequent opportunities for the display of Curran’s forensic powers; and he was often called upon to defend persons accused of political offences. Mr Fitzgibbon, afterwards Lord Clare, but at that period attorney-general, was bis opponent; and from being brought so frequently into collision with each other, their professional rivalry at last degenerated into personal animosity, which was finally consummated in a bloodless duel. On a change of ministry, during the vice-royalty of the Duke of Bedford, the patriotism of Curran was rewarded with the situation of master of the rolls. This situation he held till 1814, when he resigned it, and obtained a compensation of L.3000 a year. With this he retired to England, and resided chiefly in the neighbourhood of London till his death, which took place at Brompton, on the 13th November 1817. Curran’s talents were of a very high order. His wit, drollery, and pathos were alike remarkable. If the expression may be used, the character of his eloquence was peculiarly Irish. It was replete with bold and striking metaphor, and went moreto interest the feelings by its irresistible appeals, than to convince the judgment by its closely reasoned deductions. It was the language of fearless and impassioned genius. And this was just the kind of eloquence that was wanted in the cases upon which he was employed, and among the people before whom he pleaded. If it be the test of supreme genius to produce strong emotions, some of Curran’s speeches maybe placed amongst the noblest efforts of forensic skill which modern times can boast of. Even after the lapse of half a century, when the circumstances which called them forth have begun to fade into dimness and distance, they cannot be perused without rousing the feelings to the highest pitch.

As a companion, he could be exceedingly agreeable; and his conversation was often highly fascinating. In his domestic relations he was very unfortunate; and it seems that he laid himself open to censure. Curran does not [7:7:552] appear to have committed any thing to the press; but some poetical effusions published in his memoirs possess considerable merit. In 1805 there appeared an unauthorized collection of his forensic speeches, in one volume 8vo. Memoirs of his life have been published by his son, Mr Charles Phillips, and Mr O’Regan.
