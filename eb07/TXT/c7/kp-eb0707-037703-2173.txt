CORRUPTICOLAE, a sect which arose out of the Monophysites, in Egypt, about the year 519, under their chief Severus, the pretended patriarch of Alexandria.

The distinguishing doctrine, from which they derived their name, was, that the body of Jesus Christ was corruptible.·, that the fathers had owned it; and that to deny it was to deny the truth of our Saviour’s passion. On the other hand, Julian of Halicarnassus, another Eutychian and refugee, maintained that the body of Jesus Christ had always been incorruptible; that to say it was corruptible, was to make a distinction between Jesus Christ and the Word, and by consequence to acknowledge two natures in Jesus Christ.

The people of Alexandria were divided between the two opinions; and the partizans of Severus were called cor-rupticooe, or worshippers of something corruptible, and also corruptibiles ; while the adherents of Julian were denominated incorruptibiles or phantasiastoe. The clergy and secular powers favoured the former, the monks and the people the latter.
