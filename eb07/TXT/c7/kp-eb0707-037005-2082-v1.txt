COROMANDEL, or Cholamandalu. This coast extends in a long line on the western side of the bay of Bengal, from Point Calymere to the mouths of the Krishna river, being about 350 miles in length. Along the whole extent of this coast there is not a good harbour, though there are several flourishing towns; and, with the exception[7:7:371] of the bay of Coringa, there is an extreme difficulty in landing, on account of the surf, except where proper boats are provided. The northerly winds generally begin to blow on the coast of Coromandel and in the bay of Bengal about the middle of October; and for the first three months with such violence, that it is very unsafe to approach. This is the north-east monsoon. About the· middle of April the southerly winds commence, and continue till October, during which period vessels may approach the coast in perfect security. The monsoons are accompanied at their commencement with violent thunder and tempests; and these storms continue from October to December, and sometimes even to January. During summer, from April to October, when the south-east monsoon commences, a hot wind blows during the day over the land, and parches up every thing; so that the country resembles a barren wilderness, nothing appearing green except the trees. At night the heat is relieved by refreshing breezes from the sea. These hot winds, however oppressive and adverse to vegetation, are supposed to purify the air; and it is accordingly observed by all Europeans, that the longer they continue, the ensuing months are more healthy. During the season of the periodical rains vegetation is hastened, the plants revive, and a beautiful verdure is spread over the country.
