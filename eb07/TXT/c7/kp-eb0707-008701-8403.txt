COLLINSON, Peter, an eminent naturalist and antiquary, descended of an ancient family, was born on the paternal estate called Hugal Hall, or Height of Hagai, near Windermere lake, in the parish of Stavely, about ten miles from Kendal, in Westmoreland. Whilst a youth, he discovered an attachment to natural history. He began early to make a collection of dried specimens of plants, and had access to the best gardens at that time in the neighbourhood of London. He became early acquainted with the most eminent naturalists of his time, and Drs Derham, Woodward, Hale, Lloyd, and Sloane, were amongst his friends. Amongst the great variety of articles which form that superb collection, now, by the wise disposition of Sir Hans and the munificence of parliament, the British Museum, small was the number of those with whose history Mr Collinson was not well acquainted; he being one of the few who visited Sir Hans at all times familiarly. Their inclinations and pursuits in respect of natural history being the same, a firm friendship had early been established between them. Peter Collinson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on the 12th of December 1728, and perhaps was one of the most diligent and useful members, not only in supplying them with many curious observations himself, but in promoting and preserving a most extensive correspondence with learned and ingenious foreigners in all countries, and on every useful subject. Besides his attention to natural history, he minuted every striking hint that occurred either in reading or conversation; and from this source he derived much information, as there were very few men of learning and ingenuity who were not of his acquaintance at home; and most foreigners of eminence in natural history, or in arts and sciences, were recommended to his notice and friendship. His diligence and economy of time were such, that though he never appeared to be in a hurry, he maintained an extensive correspondence with great punctuality; acquainting the learned and ingenious in dis t ant parts of the globe with the discoveries and improvements in natural history in this country, and receiving the like information from the most eminent persons in almost every other. His correspondence with the ingenious Cadwallader Golden, Esq. of New York, and the celebrated Dr Franklin of Philadelphia, furnish instances of the benefit resulting from his attention to all improvements. The latter of these gentlemen communicated his first essays on electricity to Mr Collinson, in a series of letters, which were then published, and have since been reprinted in an edition of the doctor’s discoveries and improvements. Perhaps, at some future period, the account of the management of sheep in Spain, published in the Gentleman’s Magazine for May and June 1764, may not be considered as among the least of the benefits accruing from his extensive and inquisitive correspondence. His conversation, which was cheerful and entertaining, rendered his acquaintance much desired by those who had a relish for natural history, or w erc studious in cultivating rural improvements; and it secured him the intimate friendship of some of the most eminent personages in this kingdom, distinguished for their taste in planting and horticulture, as well as for their rank and dignity. He was the first who introduced the great variety of seeds and shrubs which are now the principal ornaments of every garden; and it was owing to his indefatigable industry that groves transplanted from the western continent may be seen flourishing as luxuriantly in their several domains as if they had already become indigenous to Britain. He had correspondents in almost every nation in Europe, and some in Asia, nay even at Pekin; who all transmitted to him the most valuable seeds they could collect, in return for the treasures of America. The great Lin-nεeus, during his residence in England, contracted an intimate[7:7:88] friendship with Mr Collinson, which was strength-ed by a multitude of reciprocal good offices, and continued to the last. Besides his attachment to natural history, he was very conversant with the antiquities of our own country, on account of which he was elected a member of the Society of Antiquaries in April 1737; and he supplied them often with many curious articles of intelligence and observation respecting both our own and other countries. He died in 1768, leaving behind him many materials for the improvement of natural history.
