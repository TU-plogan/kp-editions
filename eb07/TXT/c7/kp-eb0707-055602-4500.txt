CURRODREPANUS, compounded of currus, ŭ. chariot, and ¾žwatot’, a scythe or sickle, in antiquity, a kind of chariot armed with scythes. The driver of a chariot of this kind was obliged to ride on one of the horses, as there was no other seat for him; the usual place for the charioteer being armed with knives, as was likewise the hinder part of the chariot. There were no scythes pointing down to the earth, either from the beam or axle-tree; but these were fixed at the head of the axle-tree, in such a manner as to be moveable by means of a rope, and thereby could be raised or let down, drawn forward or let fall backward, at pleasure.
