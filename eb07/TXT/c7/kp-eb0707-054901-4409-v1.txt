CUNOCEPHALI, or Cynocephali, in Mythology,from xυωv, dog, and %e<pαλ>1, head, a kind of baboons, or animals with heads like those of dogs, which were wonderfully endowed, and preserved with great veneration by the Egyptians in many of thcir temples. It is related, that by their assistance the Egyptians found out the particular periods of the sun and moon; that one half of the animal was often buried, whilst the other half survived; and that they could both read and write. This strange story, or fable, Mr Bryant imagines, relates to the priests of Egypt, to the novices in their temples, and to the examinations which they were obliged to undergo before they could be admitted to the priesthood. The death of one part, whilst the other survived, is understood to have denoted the regular succession of the Egyptian priesthood. The cynocephali are also found in India and other parts of the world.
