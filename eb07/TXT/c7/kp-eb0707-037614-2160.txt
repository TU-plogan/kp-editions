CORREZE, a department of France, formed out of the ancient division Limousin. It is bounded on the north by the departments of the Upper Vienne and the Creuse, on the east by the Puy de Dome and Cantal, on the south by the Lot, and on the west by Dordogne and Upper Vienne. The extent is 2190 square miles, or, according to the Almanac Royale, 585,750 hectares. The face of the country is in general mountainous; but in the southern and western parts are some districts of low land. The soil is for the most part poor and thin; the high lands being covered with heath, and the low lands but moderately fertile. The climate is raw and cold, and in the mountains snow is to be seen during eight months of [7:7:377] the year; but in the valleys the heat in summer is excessive. As the population is thin, though much of the land is unproductive, sufficient of corn is raised for the consumption; but it for the most part consists of maize and rye; and the place of corn is in a great measure supplied by chestnuts, which, as well as walnuts and filberts, are very abundant. A practice prevails of boiling and drying the chestnuts, so as to preserve them through the whole year. There are a few small mines of iron and copper; and some coal is extracted, as well as marble, alabaster, and porphyry. The manufactures are insignificant. The chief trade is in cattle, wine, nut-oil, wood, and bees-wax. The inhabitants amount to 252,612 persons, who have scarcely any education; and few of them speak French, but make use of a kind of patois, more resembling Spanish or Italian. The department is divided into three arrondissements, twenty-nine cantons, and 294 communes. The capital is the city of Tulle.
