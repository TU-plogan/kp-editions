CRASSUS, Μ. Licinius, a celebrated Roman, surnamed the Rich on account of his opulence. At first he was very circumscribed in his circumstances, but by educating slaves and selling them at a high price he soon enriched himself. The cruelties of Cinna obliged him to leave Rome, and retire to Spain, where he remained concealed for eight months. After Cinna’s death he passed into Africa, and thence to Italy, where he served Sylla, and ingratiated himself with the dictator. When the gladiators, with Spartacus at their head, had spread universal alarm in Italy and defeated some of the Roman generals, Crassus was sent against them. A battle was fought, in which Crassus slaughtered twelve thousand of the slaves, and by this decisive blow soon put an end to the war: he was honoured with an ovation at his return. Soon afterwards he was made consul with Pompey in the year of Rome 682, and in this high office he displayed his opulence by entertaining the populace at ten thousand tables. He was afterwards censor, and with Pompey and Caesar formed the first triumvirate. As his love of riches was greater than his love of glory, Crassus never imitated the ambitious conduct of his colleagues, but was satisfied with the province of Syria, which seemed to promise an inexhaustible source of wealth. In hopes of enlarging his possessions he set off from Rome, although the omens proved unfavourable, and every thing seemed to prognosticate his ruin. He crossed the Euphrates, and, forgetful of the rich cities of Babylon and Seleucia, he hastened to make himself master of Parthia. But having been betrayed in his march by the delay of Artavasdes, king of Armenia, and the perfidy of Ariamnes, he was met in a large plain by Surena, the general of the forces of Orodes, king of Parthia, and a battle was fought in which twenty thousand Romans were killed, and ten thousand taken prisoners. The darkness of the night favoured the escape of the rest; but Crassus, forced by the mutiny and turbulence of his soldiers, and the treachery of his guides, trusted himself to the general of the enemy on pretence of proposing terms of accommodation, and was put to death! His head was cut off and sent to Orodes, who poured molten gold down his throat, and insulted his misfortunes. Though he has been called avaricious, yet he showed himself always ready to lend money to his friends without interest. He was fond of philosophy, and his knowledge of history was extensive.
