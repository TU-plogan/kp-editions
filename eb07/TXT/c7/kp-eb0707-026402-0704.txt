CONNOISSEUR, a French term, much used in English. It literally denotes a person well versed in any thing, being formed from the verb connoitre, to know or understand. Hence it has come to be used in our language for a critic, or person who is a thorough judge or master in any way, particularly in matters of painting, sculpture, or virt√π.
