CRANTOR, a Greek philosopher and poet, who was born at Solos in Cilicia. He left his native country where he was admired, went to Athens, and there studied with Polemon under Xenocrates. He was considered as one of the chief supporters of the Platonic sect; and he was the first who wrote commentaries upon Platoâ€™s works. He flourished 270 years before Christ.
