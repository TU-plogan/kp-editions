COOK, Sir Anthony, descended from Sir Thomas Cook, lord mayor of London, was born in 1506, and is supposed to have been educated at Cambridge. He was so eminent for his learning, piety, and prudence, that the guardians of King Edward VÌ. appointed him chief instructor in learning to that prince, whose manners it was also his business to form. He had four daughters; and being resolved to have sons by education, in case he should have none by birth, he taught his daughters those lessons by night whieh he had instilled into the prince by day; nor were his endeavours fruitless, as they proved learned in Greek and Latin, and were equally distinguished for virtue, piety, and good fortune. Mildred was married to the great Lord Burghley; Anna to Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper of the great seal; Elizabeth to Sir John Russell, son and heir of Franeis earl of Bedford; and Catharine to Sir Henry Killigrew. Sir Anthony lived in exile during the persecution under Mary; but having returned on the accession of Queen Elizabeth, he spent the rest of his days in peace and honour, dying in 1576.

Cook, Captain James, one of the ablest and most celebrated of navigators, was the son of James Cook, a labourer or servant in husbandry, and supposed to have been a native of the county of Northumberland, was born on the 27th of Oetober 1728, at the village of Marton, in the north riding of Yorkshire. He was one of nine children, and he received the rudiments of his education from the schoolmistress of the village; but afterwards, on his father’s removal to Great Ayton, he was, at the expense of Mr Skottow, his father’s employer, put to a day-sehool. where he was instructèd in writing and in a few of the elementary rules of arithmetic. Before the age of thirteen he was bound as apprentice to Mr W. Sanderson, haberdasher or shopkeeper at Straiths, about ten miles from Whitby; but some disagreement having taken plaee between him and his master, he indulged his own inclination in binding himself as apprentice to Messrs Walkers of Whitby, who had several vessels in the coal trade; and after serving a few years in the situation of a common sailor, he was at length appointed mate of one of Mr Walker’s ships. During this period it is not reeollected that he exhibited any thing peculiar either in ability or in eonduct.

Early in the year 1755, when hostilities broke out between France and England, Cook entered on board the Eagle of sixty guns, to which vessel Sir Hugh Palliser was soon afterwards appointed, and distinguished himself as an active and diligent seaman; and his promotion was forwarded by a letter of recommendation, whieh, at the request of several neighbours, was written by Mr Osbaldeston, member for Scarborough, in Mr Cook’s favour. On the 15th of May 1759 he was appointed master of the Mercury, whieh soon afterwards sailed for Ameriea, and joined the fleet under Sir Charles Saunders at the memorable siege of Quebce. His interest with the admiralty appears even then to have been strong; for, on Mr Osbaldeston’s letter, he was appointed master of the Grampus sloop; but the proper master having unexpectedly returned to her, the appointment did not take place. Four days afterwards he was appointed master of the Garland; but upon inquiry it was found that he could not join her, as the vessel had already sailed; and the next day, 15th May 1759, he was appointed master of the Mereury. On this occasion he was recommended by Captain Palliser to a difficult and dangerous serviee, namely, to take the soundings of the river St Lawrence, between the island of Orleans and the north shore, whieh he performed in the most complete manner; and soon afterwards he was employed to survey the most dangerous parts of the river below Quebec. These were his first efforts with the peneil. After this expedition he was, on the 22d of September, appointed master of the Northumberland, stationed at Halifax, where he first read Euclid, and applied himself to astronomy and other branches of science. In the year 1762, he was on board the Northumberland, assisting at the.recapture of Newfoundland; and towards the latter end of the same year he returned to England, and married, at Barking in Essex, Miss Elizabeth Batts. Early in 1763, when Admiral, then Captain, Greaves was appointed governor of Newfoundland, Cook [7:7:296] went out with him to survey the coasts of that’island. At the end of the season he returned to England; but, in the beginning of 1764, Sir Hugh Palliser being appointed governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, Cook accompanied him in the capacity of surveyor, and had the Granville sehooner to attend him »while employed on that station. In this situation he continued till 1767.

While Cook remained on this station, he had an opportunity of exhibiting publicly a specimen of his progress in the study of astronomy, in a short paper printed in the 57th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, entitled “An Observation of an Eelipse of the Sun at the Island of Newfoundland, 5th August 1766, with the longitude of the place of observation deduced from it.” His observation was made at one of the Burgeo islands, near Cape llay, in north latitude 47° 56' 19"; and by comparing it with an observation of Dr Hornsby at Oxford, it appeared to have been accurately done; so that Cook obtained the eharaeter of an able astronomer.

In the mean time, a spirit for geographical discovery, which had gradually declined since the beginning of the seventeenth century, began to revive. Two voyages of this kind had been performed in the reign of George IL, the one under Captain Middleton, the other by Captains Moore and Smyth, with a view to discover a north-west passage through Hudson’s Bay to the East Indies. Two others, under Captains Byron, Wallis, and Carteret, bad been undertaken by order of his majesty George III., soon after the conclusion of the peaee in 1763; but before the return of these navigators, who were ordered to sail round the world, another voyage was resolved upon for astronomical purposes. As it had been calculated that a transit of Venus over the sun’s disk would happen in 1767, a long memorial to his majesty was presented by the Royal Soeiety, in whieh they set forth the great importance of making proper observations on this phenomenon, and the regard which had been paid to it by the different courts of Europe; and entreated, among other things, that a vessel might be fitted out at the expense of government, for conveying proper persons to some of the Friendly Islands, in order to make the necessary observations. This request being complied with on the part of his majesty, Alexander Dalrymple, Esq. an eminent member of the Royal Society, was appointed to take the eommand of the bark appropriated for the purpose. In the execution of the projeet, however, an unexpected difficulty occurred. Mr Dalrymple, sensible of the impossibility of guiding a vessel through unknown and dangerous seas without any proper command over the crew, demanded a brevet commission as captain of the vessel, in the same manner as had formerly been granted to Dr Halley in a voyage of discovery made by him. But this commission Sir Edward Hawke absolutely refused to sign, declaring, when pressed upon the subject, that he would rather suffer his right hand to be cut off, than trust any of his majesty’s ships to a person who had not been properly bred to the serviee; and in this proceeding lie was justified by the mutinous and disorderly behaviour of Dr Halley’s crew, who, denying the legality of his authority over them, had involved him in a very disagreeable dispute, whieh was attended with pernicious consequences. Mr Dalrymple, on the other hand, being equally determined in his refusal to proceed without the authority in question, there was a necessity for finding some person of science who might also be free from the objection urged by Sir Edward Hawke. Mr Cook, therefore, was proposed by Mr Stephens, and this recommendation being seconded by Sir Hugh Palliscr, he was immediately appointed to direct the expedition; and on this occasion lie was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in his majesty’s service.

Mr Cook’s commission as lieutenant was dated the 25th of May 1768, and a vessel of 370 tons, named the Endeavour, was provided for him; but whilst the necessary preparations were making for the voyage, Captain Wallis returned. As it had been reeommended to this gentleman to fix upon a proper place for making the astronomical observations, he accordingly fixed upon the island named by him George’s Island, and since known by the name of Otaheite or Tahiti; judging also that Port Royal harbour would afford an eligible situation. This proposal being accepted, directions were accordingly given to Cook, with whom Mr Charles Green was joined in the astronomical part; the latter having been assistant to Dr Bradley in the royal observatory at Grcenwieh, and thus considered as every way qualified for the office. The lieutenant was likewise accompanied by Mr (afterwards Sir Joseph) Banks, Dr Solander, and others. The principal design of the voyage, as has already been hinted, was to make observations on the transit of Venus; but this being executed, Mr Cook was directed to make further discoveries in the Pacific Ocean. On the 30th of July 1768 he set sail on this expedition; and it is sufficient to observe here, that throughout the whole Mr Cook approved himself an able seaman, and, from his behaviour both to his own people and to the savage nations whom he occasionally visited, he showed a strict regard to the rules of justice and humanity. On his first arrival at Otaheite, regulations were drawn up for the guidance of his people, which he took eare to cause to be punctually obeyed. On creeting the observatory in order to perform the astronomical operations, an accident happened which had nearly disconcerted the whole scheme. This was the loss of the quadrant, which had been stolen by some of the natives; but it was recovered, ehiefly through the exertions of Mr Banks, and the observations were accordingly made. Seareely had this been accomplished, however, when another theft of the natives demanded the most serious consideration of the eommanđ-cr. Some of them taking advantage of the attention of the officers being otherwise engaged, seized the opportunity of breaking into one of the store-rooms, and stole therefrom a bag of spike-nails of no less than a hundredweight. This was a most important affair; for as these nails were of great estimation among the natives, the possession of such a quantity must undoubtedly have greatly lessened their value, and thus rendered provisions of every kind mueh dearer on the island than before. One of the thieves therefore being discovered, was punished with two hundred lashes; notwithstanding whieh he obstinatelyre-fused to discover any of his aeeompliees. Repeated thefts were committed afterwards, and it required all the wisdom and resolution of Mr Cook to eonduet himself in a proper manner. At last, after a stay of three months, when preparing to take his leave, the most disagreeable occurrence which he had hitherto met with took place. This was the desertion of two of his people, who, having married young women of the country, determined to take up their residence therein. Mr Cook was now obliged to seize some of the chiefs, and to inform them that they could not obtain their liberty unless the deserters were recovered. This at last produced the desired effect; the deserters were given up, and Cook set sail, along with Tupia, who had formerly been prime minister to Oberea, a princess of the island, and a boy of thirteen years of age, both of whom were desirous of accompanying him to England.

Whilst Cook proceeded to visit some other of the South Sea islands, Tuρia occasionally served as an interpreter. On his arrival in New Zealand, Mr Cook found the people extremely hostile and insolent. On the first meeting, one of the natives having threatened to dart his lance into the boat, was shot dead; another having carried off Mr [7:7:297] Green’s hanger, was fired at with small shot; and upon his still refusing to restore it, was fired at with ball and killed. This, however, produced very little effect upon the rest, who attempted to make an attack upon them, till several muskets were fired with small shot, which wounded three or four more. Next day the commander having determined to force some of the natives on board, in order to conciliate their affections by kind treatment, directed his men to follow two canoes which he perceived under way before him. One made her escape, but the other not observing the boats in pursuit, was overtaken, upon which the savages plied their oars so briskly, that the ship’s boats were not able to keep up with them. Tupia, whose language the New Zealanders understood, called to them to return, with assurances that no harm should be done them; but they continued their flight without regarding him. A musket was then fired over their heads with a view to intimidate them; but upon this they prepared to fight, and on the approach of the' boats began the attack with so much vigour, that the lieutenant’s people were obliged to fire upon them with ball, by which four out of seven who were in the boat were killed, and the other three jumped into tlιe water, and were taken on board.

Notwithstanding the disaster just mentioned, to which the three New Zealanders who were taken on board had been witnesses, they were toon conciliated, and began to sing with a degree of taste that surprised the English gentlemen. They were boys, the oldest about nineteen and the youngest about eleven; but no kindness which could be shown them proved in any degree effectual in bringing about a reconciliation with the rest. On the contrary, having perceived the ship in some distress, they instantly showed a disposition to make an attack; and from this they were only prevented by the firing of a four-pounder charged with grape-shot. But even this did not produce any permanent effect; another attack was determined upon, and would undoubtedly have been made, had not Tupia informed them, that if they persisted in their attempt, the arms of their adversaries, like thunder, would destroy every one of them. This was enforced by the fire of another four-pounder with grape-shot, which, spreading wide in the water, terrified them to such a degree that they began to paddle away as fast as possible. Notwithstanding this, however, some intercourse began to take place; but in every instance the New Zealanders manifested their hostility and treachery in such a manner as showed that they were not to be gained by fair means. At last an attempt to carry off Tayeto, Tupia’s boy, rendered it absolutely necessary to fire upon them, in order to rescue him from certain destruction, some of the savages having got him into a canoe, where they held him down by violence. In consequence of this one of the savages was killed on the spot, and several more wounded, by the discharge of muskets from the boats; but Tayeto recovered his liberty, jumped into the water, and swam to the ship. Some partial intercourse again took place; but still it appeared that the innate rancour of these savages was not to be subdued by any fair means; and it was only by the powerful arguments of cannon and musketry that they could be kept from attempting to do mischief.

From the account of this voyage published by Dr Hawkesworth, it appears that a considerable number of savages perished in a similar manner; and they seem to have manifested a more hostile behaviour than afterwards. On these melancholy occasions, however, it must be observed to the honour of Cook, that his humanity was eminently conspicuous beyond that of the common people, who all along showed as much inclination to destroy the natives as a sportsman docs to kill the game he pursues.

Whilst Mr Cook coasted the islands of New Zealand, he was sometimes in the most imminent danger of being shipwrecked. In the latitude of 35° south, and in the midst of summer in that climate, he met with such a gale of wind as he scarcely ever experienced before; so that he was no less than three weeks in getting ten leagues to the westward, and two more before he could get thirty leagues farther. Fortunately, however, they were all this time, a considerable way from land, otherwise it is probable that the storm must have proved fatal.

Having spent six months in circumnavigating and fully exploring the islands of New Zealand, he sailed thence on the 31st of March 1770. It must be observed, however, that the extreme hostility manifested by the inhabitants in that part of the island where he first arrived was not universally diffused; on the contrary, a frieņdly intercourse was for a long time maintained with those abput Queen Charlotte’s Sound. From New Zealand he proceeded to New Holland, and on ţhe 2tìth of April came in sight of Botany Bay. Here all their endeavours to induce the natives to have any intercourse with the ship’s company proved ineffectual, though happily there was no blood spilt in any quarrel.

During their navigation round New Holland, the coasts of which are full of dangerous rocks and shoals, our navigators were brought into a more perilous situation than ever. This happened on the 10th of June 1770, as they pursued their eourse from Trinity Bay, and nearly in the latitude assigned to the islands discovered by Quiros. At that time they had the advantage of a fine breeze and a clear moonlight; and in standing off from six till near nine o'clock, the ship had deepened her water from fourteen to twenty-one fathoms; but whilst the navigators were at supper, it shoaled to twelve, ten, and eight fathoms in the space of a few minutes. Every thing was then ready for putting the ship about, when they suddenly got into deep water again, and continued in twenty and twenty-one fathoms for some time, so that the gentlemen went to bed in perfect security. A little before eleven, however, the water shoaled at once from twenty to seventeen fathoms; and before the lead could be heaved again, the ship struek, and remained immoveable, excepting in as far as she was heaved up and down, and dashed against the rocks, by the surge. The alarm was now universal, and not indeed without the greatest reason. It appeared that the vessel had been lifted over the ledge of a rock, and lay in a hollow within it, where there were in some places from three to four fathoms water, and in others scarcely as many feet. The sheathing boards were disjoined, and floating round the ship in great numbers; and at last the false keel was also destroyed, while the rock kept grating her bottom with such force as to be heard in the fore store-room. It was now necessary to lighten the ship as much as possible, and this was done with all expedition to the amount of more than fifty tons. In the morning of the 11th of June they discovered the land at about eight leagues distance, without any island between on which they could have been sent ashore in the event of the ship going to pieces. To add to their distress, the ship drew so much water that it was with difficulty kept under with three pumps. Lastly, it appeared that even the rising of the tide, on which they had ultimately depended for relief, was insufficient to answer the purpose, as the day-tidefell considerably short of that in the night-time. Having therefore lightened the ship still further, by throwing out every thing that could possibly be spared, they waited with patience for the next tide; when, after incredible exertion, the ship righted, and they got her over the ledge of the rock into deep water. By continual labour, however, the men were at last so much exhausted that they could not stand to the pumps [7:7:298] more than five or six minutes at a time; after which they threw themselves flat on the deck, though a stream of water between three and four inches deep ran over it; and in this situation they lay till others, exhausted as well as themselves, took their plaees, on which they started, up again, and renewed their exertions. In this dreadful extremity Mr Monkhouse, a midshipman, proposed the expedient of“sotliering” the ship, as it is called, by whieh means he said that he had seen a merchant vessel brought from Virginia to London after she had sprung a leak which admitted more than four feet water in an hour. The expedient being approved of, it was put in execution in the following manner. He took a lower studding-sail, and having mixed a large quantity of oakum and wool together, stitched them down by handfuls as lightly as possible, the whole being afterwards spread over with the dung of the sheep and other filth. The sail was then hauled under the ship’s bottom by means of ropes, which kept it extended. When it came under the leak, the wool and oakum, with part of the sail, were forced inwards by the pressure of the water, whieh thus prevented its own ingress in so effectual a manner, that one pump instead of three was now sufficient to keep it under. Thus they got the ship into a convenient port on the coast of New Holland, where they had an opportunity of repairing the injury. But here they discovered that their preservation had not been owing entirely to the expedient above mentioned; for one of the holes was in a great measure filled up by a pieee of rock which had broken off and stuek in it; and this hole was so large,’ that had it not been filled up in the manner just mentioned, they must undoubtedly have perished notwithstanding all the assistance that could have been derived from the pumps.

The dangers they sustained in navigating this coast were innumerable, insomueh that for nearly three months they were obliged to have a man constantly in the chains heaving the lead. They were always entangled among rocks and shoals, which could not have failed to destroy a less experienced navigator; and even Mr Cook, with all his sagacity, could not sometimes have extricated himself, had it not been for the favourable interposition of natural events, whieh no human penetration could foresee, nor have the least dependence upon.

From the time they quitted the coast of New Holland till their arrival at Batavia, in the island of Java, our navigators met with no other danger than what is common in sea voyages. They were obliged to stay for some time at this plaee to repair their damages; and, on viewing the condition of the ship, they found they had more reason than ever to admire the manner in whieh they had been preserved. Both the false keel and main keel were greatly injured; great part of the sheathing was torn off; several of the planks were much damaged, and among these there were two, and half of a third, whieh, for six feet in length, were not above the eighth part of an inch in thickness, besides being penetrated with worms quite to the timbers. Here the crew were excessively annoyed by siekness, which obliged them to remain mueh longer than they would otherwise have done; and it is worthy of notice that every one of the crew was ill excepting the sail-maker, an old man between seventy and eighty years of age, who contrived to get drunk every night. Poor Tupia, with his boy Tayeto, fell sacrifiées to the unhealthiness of the climate, as well as the surgeon, three seamen, and Mr Green’s servant. Nor did the evil stop here; for on their setting out from Batavia, the seeds of disease which had been received there broke out in the most violent and fatal manner, insomueh that in the course of about six weeks there died one of Mr Banks’s assistants, Mr Sporing, Air Parkinson, natural history painter, Mr Green the astronomer, the boatswain, carpenter, and mate, Mr Monkhouse the midshipman, the corporal of the marines, two of the carpenter’s erew, and nine seamen. Even the jolly old sail-maker eould now hold out no longer; but whether his death might not in some measure be attributed to his being less plentifully supplied with liquors than formerly, would have deserved inquiry. These unfortunate events made a considerable impression upon Mr Cook’s mind, and perhaps indueed him to direet his attention to those methods of preserving the health of seamen, which he afterwards put into execution with so mueh suecess. After touching at St Helena, they continued their voyage for England, where they arrived on the 11th of June 1771; and on the 29th of August the same year his majesty testified his approbation of Mr Cook’s conduet, by appointing him a captain in the navy. On this occasion Mr Cook wished to have been advanced to the rank of post-captain, whieh, though not more profitable than the other, is more honourable; but this being inconsistent with the rules of preferment in the navy, the Earl of Sandwich, at that time at the head of the admiralty, could not agree to it.

Captain Cook was not allowed to remain long inactive. The idea of a southern continent had long been entertained, and Mr Dalrymple had re-directed the attention of the public towards the question, by his historical collection of voyages to the Paeifie Ocean, published in two quarto volumes, one in 1770, and the other in 1771. To determine the matter finally, Captain Cook was again sent out; the object of this voyage being not merely to settle the question just mentioned, but to extend the geography of the globe to its utmost limits. That the undertaking might be carried on with the greater advantage, it was determined to employ two ships, upon the choiee and equipment of which the utmost attention was bestowed. The successful voyage which had already been made in the Endeavour suggested the idea of that ship being a proper model for the two whieh were to be sent out; and the opinion of Lord Sandwich concurring with the general idea, two vessels, constructed by the same person who had built the Endeavour, were purchased for the voyage. These were about fourteen or sixteen months old at the time they were purchased; and, in the opinion of Captain Cook, they were as fit for the purpose as if they had been but newly built. The larger of the two, of 462 tons burden, was named the Resolution, and the smaller, of 336 tons, had the name of the Adventure; the complement of men on board the former, of whieh Captain Cook was commander, being a hundred and twelve, and on board the latter, commanded by Mr Tobias Furneaux, eighty-one. In their equipment, every article which could be supposed necessary was procured, and every cireumstanee likely to contribute to the suceess of the voyage was attended to in the most scrupulous manner. Mr Hodges, an excellent landscape painter, was engaged to make drawingsand paintings of such objeets as required them; Mr John Reinhold Forster, with his son, were both engaged, in order to explore and collect the natural history of the countries through which they passed; and, lastly, Air William Wales and Mr William Bayley were engaged by the board of longitude to make celestial observations. The latter were furnished with the best instruments of every kind, and among these with four time-pieces, three constructed by Air Arnold, and one by Air Kendal upon Mr Harrison’s principles.

At Plymouth Captain Cook received his instructions, which were not only to sail round the globe, but to sail round it in high southern latitudes, and to make such traverses as might finally resolve the question concerning the southern continent. In pursuance of these instructions he set sail on the 13th of July 1772, and on the 29th of the same month arrived at Madeira. He reached the [7:7:299] Cape of Good Hope without having a single man sick; but having left it and kept on his course to the southward, he soon began to meet with cold and stormy weather, by which he lost almost the whole of his live stock of sheep, hogs, and geese. The bad effects of this stormy weather upon the men were guarded against by an addition to their clothing, and by giving them a dram on particular occasions. On the 6th of December, being in the latitude of 50° 40', he fell in with islands of ice, and continued among them in various latitudes till the 17th of January 1773, when he set sail for New Zealand, which he reached on the 27th.

The reception of our navigator by the New Zealanders was now much more friendly than in the former voyage, and there were no contests with the natives; nor did Captain Cook observe any of those whom he had seen before, neither was there the smallest remembrance of former hostilities. Having remained here until the 7th of June, the navigators set sail for Otaheite; but during the voyage the crews of both ships were attacked by the scurvy. Those of the Adventure were in a very sickly state; the cook died, and twenty-eight of her best men were rendered incapable of duty. On board the Resolution matters were much better; and the only reason that could be conjectured for the difference was, that the people of the Adventure had been in a habit of body more inclined to the scurvy than those of the Resolution, and had eaten fewer vegetables. Whilst he remained at New Zealand the captain had discovered a tree which greatly resembled the American black spruce; and being persuaded that it would be attended with effects equally salutary on the health of the people, he employed them in brewing beer from it. This was done whilst they continued at Dusky Bay, in order to supply the want of vegetables, which were not to be procured there; but on removing to Queen Charlotte’s Sound they were more fortunate. Captain Cook himself went to look out for antiscorbutic vegetables, and in a very short time returned with a boat-load of scurvy-grass, celery, &c. These were boiled with the peas and wheat; and though some of the people disliked them at first, they soon became so sensible of their good effects that they cheerfully followed the example of the rest; and the freedom of the crew from the scurvy and other distempers was by every one attributed to the New Zealand spruce beer and vegetables.

During this voyage Captain Cook had another narrow escape from shipwreck. Having been becalmed at the distance of half a league from a reef of rocks near Osnaburg island, it was found necessary to send out the boats in order to tow off’the ships; but this was found impossible. The calm continuing, and the situation of the navigators becoming every moment more dangerous, the captain attempted to get through an opening in the reef which he had judged practicable; but on approaching it, he found that there was not sufficient depth of water, at the same time that the draught of the tide through it forced the ship thither in a manner scarcely to be resisted. One of the warping machines, with about four hundred fathoms of rope, was then ordered out, but did not produce any effect. They were within two cables length of the breakers, and yet no bottom could be found for casting anchor. Having no other resource, however, they did drop an anchor; but before it took hold, the Resolution was in less than three fathoms water, and struck at every fall of the sea, which broke with violence close under her stern, threatening destruction to every one on board. At last the tide ceasing to act in the same direction, the boats were ordered to try to tow off the vessel; and in this, being assisted by the land breeze, which fortunately sprung up at that instant, they with much labour succeeded.

Having employed a considerable time in the South Sea islands, Captain Cook returned to New Zealand, and thence set sail-for the southern part of the continent of America; and having explored all the islands in the neighbourhood, he returned to England, where he arrived in safety on the 30th of July 1774, having been absent three years and eighteen days, and in all that time lost only one man, who died of a consumption, probably begun before he set out on the voyage.

The reception which our navigator now met with was in all respects suited to his merit. He was immediately raised to the rank of post captain, and soon afterwards unanimously elected a member of the Royal Society; from which he received the prize of the gold medal for the best experimental paper which had appeared throughout the year.

The third voyage of this celebrated navigator was not undertaken by any express command of his majesty. Captain Cook had already done so much, that it was thought reasonable he should now spend the remainder of his life in tranquillity; and in order to enable him to do so in a comfortable manner, besides his rank of post-captain in the navy, he was also, made a captain in Greenwich. Still, however, there were some points in the science of geography which had very much engaged the attention of the public, and which were indeed of such importance as to become a national concern. These were to discover the connection between Asia and America, and to determine whether there was not a possibility of shortening the passage to the East Indies by sailing round the northern parts of the continents of Europe and Asia. Many attempts, indeed, had already been made to explore a passage, by various navigators of different nations; but all of them had failed, and had left the point still undetermined. An act of parliament had been passed in 1745, by which a reward of L.20,000 was held out to the ships of any of his majesty’s subjects which should accomplish this important voyage, but without mentioning any thing of those belonging to his majesty; and this reward was further confined to the discovery of a north-west passage to the East Indies through Hudson’s Bay. In the year 1776, however, both the errors just mentioned were corrected. It was now enacted, “That if any ship belonging to any of his majesty’s subjects, or to his majesty, shall find out, and sail through, any passage by sea between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, in any direction or parallel of the northern hemisphere, to the northward of the 52d degree of northern latitude, the owners of such ships if belonging to any of his majesty’s subjects, or the commanders, officers, and seamen, of such ships belonging to his majesty, shall receive, as a reward for such discovery, the sum of L.20,000.”

It was not, as has already been hinted, deemed proper to solicit Captain Cook to undergo fresh dangers by undertaking a voyage of this kind; nevertheless, as he was universally looked upon as the fittest person in the kingdom for the purpose, the eyes of all were tacitly fixed upon him; he was consulted on every thing relating to it, and solicited to name the person whom he judged most proper to conduct it. To determine this point, Captain Cook, Sir Hugh Palliser, and Mr Stephens, were invited to dinner at the house of Lord Sandwich; where, besides the consideration of the proper officer for conducting the expedition, many things were said concerning the nature of the design. They enlarged upon its grandeur and dignity, its consequences to navigation and science, and the completeness it would give to the whole system of discoveries; until at last Captain Cook became so much inflamed by the representations of the importance of the voyage, that he started up, and declared that he would [7:7:300] conduct it himself. This was what tĩìe parties present had desired, and probably expected; his offer was therefore instantly laid before the king, and Captain Cook was appointed commander of the expedition on the 10th of February 1776. At the same time it was agreed, that upon his return from the voyage, he should be rest.ored to his place at Greenwich; and if no vacancy occurred during the interval, that the officer who succeeded him should resign in his favour. The instructions lie now received were, that he should attempt the high latitudes between the continents of Asia and America, and if possible return to England along the northern coasts of Asia and Europe. This was most probably the result of the captain’s own deliberations, and what had been suggested by him to Lord Sandwich and other people in power. He was particularly desired to sail first into the Pacific Ocean through the chain of newly-discovered islands which lie had lately visited. After having crossed the equator, and passed into the northern parts of the ocean just mentioned, he was then to hold such a course as might tend to settle many interesting points of geography, and produce some intermediate discoveries, before he arrived at the main scene of operations. With regard to this principal object, lie was ordered, immediately on his arrival on the coast of New Albion, to proceed northward as far as the latitude of sixty-five degrees, without losing any time in exploring creeks or rivers previously to his arrival in that latitude; and for his further encouragement, the act of 1745, offering a premium for the discovery of the passage in question, was amended in the manner above mentioned. That nothing might be wanting which could promote the success of the expedition, Lieutenant Pickersgill was sent out, in 1776, with directions to explore the coasts of Baffin’s Bay; and the next year Lieutenant Young was commissioned not only to examine the western parts of that bay, but to endeavour to find a passage on that side from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Nothing, however, was performed by either of these gentlemen which could in the least promote Captain Cook’s success. Two vessels were provided, as in the former voyage, namely, the Resolution and the Discovery; the command of the former being given to Captain Cook, and of the latter to Captain Charles Clerke. The only thing in which the appointment of the Discovery differed from that of the Resolution was, that the former had no marine officer on board. Every degree of attention was bestowed, as in the former voyage, upon the proper victualling and other necessaries for the two ships; and that the inhabitants of those countries which our navigator intended to visit might derive some permanent benefit from intercourse with the navigators, it was determined to send abroad a breed of domestic animals, and likewise a quantity of useful seeds, to be left in proper places. With this view, a bull, two cows with their calves, and several sheep, together with hay and corn for their subsistence, were put on board; and it was likewise proposed to take in others at the Cape of Good Hope. A large assortment of iron tools and trinkets was also sent out; and, in short, every thing that was judged proper either to conciliate the good will of the natives, or to prove ser- -viceable to them, was provided for the voyage, as well as every convenience for the ships’ companies. In the former voyage Captain Cook had brought along with him a native of one of the South Sea islands, named Ornai, who resided in England during the interval between the second and third voyages, and was now happy at getting an opportunity of returning to his own country. Though he could by no means complain of the entertainment he had received in England, the idea of returning home loaded with treasure, which might enable him to make a figure among his countrymen, soon overcame all uneasy sensations which the leaving of his English friends was calculated to excite. His majesty had taken care to furnish him with every thing that could possibly be of use when he returned to his native country; and he had besides received several valuable presents from Lord Sandwich, Sir Joseph Banks, as well as from ladies and gentlemen of bis acquaintance; so that nothing was omitted which could possibly be done to convey, by his means, to the inhabitants of the South Sea islands, an idea of the British power and greatness.

Every thing being prepared for the voyage, our navigator set sail from the Nore on the 25th of June 1776; but by reason of some delay in receiving his instructions, they did not leave Plymouth till the 12th of July. He had not been long at sea before he began his operations for preserving the health of his people, operations which were found equally efficacious in this as in the former voyage. Finding his stock of provender for the animals on board likely to run short, he touched at Teneriffc in order to procure a supply, having judged that to be a more proper place for the purpose than Madeira, which was usually resorted to. On sailing thence he ran a great risk of running upon some sunken rocks on the island of Bonavista; but on this, as well as on other occasions of danger, he behaved with the same judgment, coolness, and presence of mind, which distinguished him throughout the whole course of his life. On the 12th of August he arrived before Port Praya, in one of the Cape de Verd islands named St Jago; but not finding it necessary to run in there, he continued his voyage to the southward. The weather now becoming gloomy and rainy, it required a continuance of the methods he had already practised for preserving the health of his people; but, as formerly, they were attended with the greatest success. On the 1st of September our navigators crossed the equator, and on the 18th of October anchored in Table Bay at the Cape of Good Hope. Here they met with a violent tempest, the effects of which were felt both on sea and land. It lasted three days, and the Resolution was the only ship in the bay that·rode out the storm without dragging her anchors. On shore the tents and observatory were destroyed, and the astronomical quadrant narrowly escaped irreparable damage. The Discovery, which had been some time later in sailing from England, was driven off the coast, and did not arrive till the 10th of November.

V⅛ hilst they remained in this place, a disaster happened which threatened the loss of most of their live stock. The bull and two cows had been put ashore to graze among other cattle; but Captain Cook had been advised to keep the sheep, sixteen in number, near the tents, where they were penned in every night. But some dogs having got in amongst them in the night-time, killed four, and dispersed the rest. Six of them were recovered the next day, but the two rams and two of the finest ewes in the flock were missing. The captain applied to Baron Plettenberg, the governor; but all his endeavours were unsuccessful, until lie employed some of the meanest and lowest of the people; fellows who for a ducatoon would have cut their master’s throat, burned the house over his head, and buried him and his whole family in ashes. After all, two of the finest ewes in the flock were missing, and never could be recovered. The captain, therefore, in order to repair this loss, and to make an addition to his original stock, purchased two young bulls, two entire horses, two mares, two heifers, two rams, several ewes and goats, with some rabbits and poultry; when, having finished all hfs business, he set sail on the 30th of November, though it was not ’ till the third of December that he got clear of land.

Having explored some desolate islands in the southern seas, Captain Cook set sail for New Zealand. During this [7:7:301] part of the voyage, our navigators were involved in so thick a fog, that, according to the authors of Captain Cook’s life, “they sailed three hundred leagues in the] dark.” The first land they afterwards reached was New 1 Holland, where they remained till the 30th of January 1 1777, when they set sail for New Zealand, and on the 12th of February anchored in Queen Charlotte’s Sound. Here; the people w ere shy and timorous, on account of their having formerly destroyed ten of Captain Furneaux’s people, 1 who had been sent ashore to gather vegetables. The cause ∣ of the quarrel could not be known, as none of the party were left alive to tell the news. Lieutenant Burney, who went ashore in quest of them, found only some fragments of their bodies; from which it appeared that they had been killed and devoured by the savages. It was not the intention of Captain Cook, at this distance of time, to resent the injury; he even refused to put to death a chief named Kahoora, who, as he was informed by the natives themselves, had killed Mr Rowe, the commander of the party. He w as, however, particularly careful that no opportunity should now be given the savages of committing such an action with impunity; and with this view a boat was never sent on shore without being well armed, and the men under the command of such officers as could be depended upon. The New Zealanders were no sooner assured of Captain Cook’s pacific disposition, than they threw aside their fears and suspicions, and entered into a commercial intercourse with the people. It would have been the less excusable in Captain Cook to have revenged at this time the massacre of Mr Rowe’s party, as he was assured that the quarrel originated from some petty thefts of the savages, which were too hastily resented on the part of the British; and that, had it not been for this, no mischief would have happened.

On the 25th of February our navigator left New Zealand, taking with him, at the request of Ornai, two boys, the eldest about eighteen, and the youngest about ten. So much time had now been spent in sailing up and dow n in the Pacific Ocean, where several new islands were discovered, that Captain Cook judged it impossible to accomplish any thing this year in the high northern latitudes; for which reason he determined to bear away for the Friendly Islands, in order to supply himself with those necessaries which he had found it impossible to procure at any of the islands which he had just discovered. In his run thither, several new islands were visited; and in prosecuting these discoveries our navigator once more narrowly escaped being shipwrecked. The danger at this time arose from a low sandy island, which the Resolution w as very near running upon, and from which she was only saved by the circumstance of all the men having been accidentally called upon deck to put the vessel about. Soon after this both ships struck upon some sunk coral rocks, but happily got off without material damage.

After a stay of between two and three months, Captain Cook took leave of the Friendly Islands on the 13th of July 1777, and on the 12th of August reached Otaheite, where he introduced Oιnai to his countrymen. Here the captain found the people of Otaheite ready to engage in a war with those of Eimeo; but though strongly solicited by the former to assist them in an expedition against their enemies, he refused to take any concern in the affair, alleging, by way of excuse, that the people of Eimeo had never offended him. This seemed to satisfy most of the chiefs; but one, named Towha, was so much displeased .that Captain Cook could never regain his favour.

From Otaheite Captain Cook next proceeded to Eimeo, where, on account of some thefts committed by the natives, he was obliged to commence hostilities, by burning a number of their war canoes, and even some houses.

These transactions gave him much concern; and the more that he had been so much solicited to make war on these people by his friends at Otaheite, to whose entreaties he had refused to listen. From Eimeo he proceeded to Hua-heine, where he saw 0mai finally settled, and left with him the two New Zealand youths already mentioned. The youngest of these was so much attached to the English that it was necessary to carry him out of the ship and put him ashore by force. During his stay on this island, the captain was obliged to punish a thief with greater severity than he had ever done before, by causing his head and beard to be shaved, and his ears cut off. Some other disagreeable transactions took place, particularly the desertion of two of his people, who were not recovered without the greatest difficulty. In the course of his exertions for their recovery, he found it necessary to detain the son, daughter, and son-in-law of the chief of an island named Otaha. This had almost produced very serious consequences, the natives having formed a plot for carrying off Captain Cook himself, as well as Captain Clerke and Mr Gore. As to the commander, they were disappointed, by his own caution and vigilance; but Messrs Clerke and Gore were in particular danger; and it was only owing to the circumstance of one of them having a pistol in his hand as they walked together on shore, that they were not seized.

Having left the Society Islands, and discovered a new group, which, in honour of his patron the Earl of Sandwich, our commander named the Sandwich Isles, he set out on the 2d of January 1778 on his voyage northward. In this he was very successful, ascertaining the vicinity of the continents of Asia and America, which had never been done, or but very imperfectly, before. From these desolate regions he returned to the island of Oonalashka, whence, having refitted and taken in provisions, he returned to the southward, and on the 26th of November reached the Sandwich Islands, where he discovered a new one named Mowee, and on the 30th of the same month another of much larger extent, named Owhyhee. Seven weeks were spent in exploring the coasts of this island; and during all this time he continued to have the most friendly intercourse with the people; who, however, appeared to be much more numerous and powerful than those of any island our navigators had yet touched at. Several of the chiefs and principal persons had attached themselves greatly to the commander, and in general the people appeared to be much more honest in their dispositions than any whom he had ever visited. But by the time he had finished his circumnavigation of the island, and cast anchor in a bay called Karakakooa, matters were greatly altered. An universal disposition to theft and plunder had now evinced itself; and in this it was evident, that the common people were encouraged and abetted by their chiefs, who shared the booty with them. Still, however, no hostilities were commenced; the greatest honours were paid to .the commander; and on his going ashore he was received with ceremonies little short of adoration. A vast quantity of hogs and other provisions w ere procured for the ships; and on the 4th of February 1779 they left the island, not without most magnificent presents from the chiefs, such as they had never before received in any part of the world. Unluckily they met with a storm on the sixth and seventh of the same month, during which the Resolution sprung the head of her foremast in such a manner that they were obliged to return to Karakakooa bay to get it repaired.

The same friendly intercourse which had formerly subsisted with the natives now commenced, and Captain Cook was treated with the usual honours; but on the.13th of this month it was unhappily broken off. One of the natives[7:7:302] being detected in stealing the tongs from the armourer’s forge in the Discovery, was dismissed with a pretty severe flogging; but this example was so far from being attended with any good effect, that in the afternoon another, having snatched up the tongs and a chisel, jumped overboard with them and swam for the shore. The master and midshipman were instantly dispatched in pursuit of him; but he escaped on board a canoe, which paddled away so quickly that the cutter could not overtake it. A chief named Pareah, who was at this time on board the Resolution, understanding what had happened, promised to go ashore and recover the stolen goods; but before this could be effected the thief had made his escape into the country. Captain Cook, who was at that time ashore, had endeavoured to intercept the canoe when it landed, but was led out of the way by some of the natives who pretended to be his guides. The tongs and chisel, however, were brought back to the master as he advanced to the landing place; but he being now joined by some of the rest of the people in the pinnace, and not satisfied with the recovery of the stolen goods, insisted upon having the thief, or the canoe which carried him, by way of reprisal. On his preparing to launch this last into the water he was interrupted by Pareah, who insisted that it was his property, and that he should not take it away. As the officer paid no regard to his remonstrances, Pareah, who appears to have been a very strong man, seized him, pinioned his arms behind, and held him fast by the hair of the head. Upon this one of the sailors struck the chief with an oar, on which, quitting the officer, he instantly snatched the oar out of the man’s hand, and broke it in two across his knee. The natives then attacked the sailors with stones, and soon drove them to their boats, to which they were forced to swim, as they lay at some distance from the shore. The officers who could not swim retired to a small rock, where they were closely pursued by the Indians; and here the master narrowly escaped with his life, till Pareah returned and obliged the natives to give over their attacks. The gentlemen, sensible that Pareah’s presence alone could protect them, entreated him to remain with them till they could be brought off in boats. On his refusal, the master set out to the place where the observatories had been erected, for further assistance; but Pareah, who met him, and suspected his errand, obliged him to return. In the mean time the multitude had begun to break in pieces the pinnace, after having taken every thing out of her that was loose. On the return of Pareah, however, they were again dispersed, and some of the oars restored, after which the gentlemen were glad to get off in safety. But before they reached the ship, Pareah overtook them in a canoe, and delivered the midshipman’s cap, which had been taken from him in the scuffle; he also joined noses with them in token of friendship, and desired to know whether Captain Cook would kill him on account of what had happened. They assured him that he would not, and made signs of reconciliation on their part. On this he left them and paddled over to the town of Kavaroah; and this was the last time that he was seen by the English. In the night-time the sentinels were much alarmed by shrill and melancholy sounds from the adjacent villages, which they took to be the lamentations of the women. Next day it was found that the large cutter of the Discovery had been carried off in the night-time; on which Captain Cook ordered the launch and small cutter to go under the command of the second lieutenant, and to lie off the east point of the bay, in order to intercept all the canoes that might attempt to get out, and if necessary to fire upon them. The third lieutenant of the Resolution was dispatched to the western part of the bay on the same service, whilst the master was sent in pursuit of a large double canoe already under sail, and making the best of her way out of the harbour. He soon came up with her, and by firing a few shots, obliged her to run on shore, and the Indians to leave her. This was the canoe belonging to a chief named Omea, whose person was reckoned equally sacred with that of the king; and to the neglect of securing him may.be attributed the succeeding disaster. Captain Cook now formed the resolution of going in person to seize the king himself in his capital of Kavaroah; and as there was reason to suppose that he had fled, he intended to secure the large canoes, which on that account he had caused to be hauled up on the beach. With this view he left the ship about seven o’clock in the morning of Sunday the 14th of February, attended by the lieutenant of marines, a serjeant, corporal, and seven private men. The crew of the pinnace, under the command of Mr Roberts, were also armed; and as they rowed towards the shore, the captain ordered the launch to leave her station at the opposite point of the bay, in order to assist his own boat. Having landed with the marines at the upper end of the town, the natives flocked round him, and prostrated themselves before him. No sign of hostility, nor even alarm, appeared; the king’s sons waited upon the commander as soon as he sent for them, and by their means he was introduced to the king, who readily consented to go on board; but in a little time the natives began to arm themselves with long spears, clubs, and daggers, and to put on thick mats, which they use as defensive armour. This hostile appearance was greatly augmented by an unlucky piece of news which was just now brought by a canoe, that one of the Indian chiefs had been killed by the people in the Discovery’s boats. On this the women, who had hitherto sat on the beach conversing familiarly and taking their breakfasts, removed, and a confused murmur ran through the crowd. An old priest now appeared with a cocoa-nut in his hand, which lie held out as a present to Captain Cook, singing all the while, and studiously making a noise, as if he meant to divert the attention of the captain and his people from observing the motions of the Indians, who were everywhere putting on their armour. Captain Cook, thinking his situation dangerous, ordered the lieutenant of the marines to march towards the shore, as he himself did, having all the while hold of the king’s hand, who very readily accompanied him, attended by his wife, two sons, and several chiefs. The natives made a lane for them to pass; and as the distance they had to proceed was only about fifty or sixty yards, and the boats lay at no more than five or six yards distance from land, there was not the least apprehension of the catastrophe which ensued. The king’s youngest son Keowa went on board the pinnace without the least hesitation, and the king was about to follow, when his wife threw her arms about his neck, and, with the assistance of two chiefs, forced him to sit down. The captain might now have safely got aboard, but did not immediately relinquish the design of taking the king along with him. Finding at last, however, that this could not be accomplished without a great deal of bloodshed, he was on the point of giving orders for the people to re-embark, when one of the Indians threw a stone at him. This insult was returned by the captain, who had a double barrelled piece, by a discharge of small shot from one of the barrels. This had little effect, as the man had a thick mat before him; and as he now brandished his spear, the captain knocked him down with his musket. The king’s son, Keowa, still remaining in the pinnace, the detaining him would have been a great check upon the natives; but unluckily Mr Roberts, who commanded the pinnace, set him ashore at his own request soon after the first fire. In the mean time another native was observed in the act of brandishing his spear at the commander, who was obliged to [7:7:303] fire upon him in his own defence. Missing his aim, how- ’ ever, he killed one close by his side, upon which the Serjeant, observing that he had missed the man he aimed at, received orders to fire also, which he did, and killed him on the spot. This repressed the foremost of the Indians, and made them fall back in a body; but they were urged on again by those behind, and discharged a volley of stones among the marines, who immediately returned it by a general discharge of their muskets; and this was instantly followed by a fire from the boats. Captain Cook expressed his astonishment at their firing, waved his hand to them to cease, and called to the people in the boats to come nearer to receive the marines. This order was obeyed by Mr Roberts; but the lieutenant who commanded the launch, instead of coming nearer, put off to a greater distance; and by this preposterous conduct deprived the unfortunate commander of the only chance which he had for his life; for the natives, exasperated by the fire of the marines, now rushed in upon and drove them into the water, leaving the captain alone upon the rock. A fire, indeed, was kept up from both boats; but the one was too far off, and the other was crowded with the marines, so that they could not direct their fire with proper effect. Captain Cook was then observed making for the pinnace, carrying his musket under his arm, and holding his other hand on the back part of his head to guard it from the stones. A native was seen following him, but with marks of fear, as he stopped once or twice, seemingly undetermined to proceed. At last he struck the captain on the back of the head with a club, and then precipitately retreated. The latter staggered a few paces, and then fell on his hand and one knee, and dropped his musket. Before he could recover himself, another native stabbed him with a dagger in the neck, though still without putting an end to his life. He then fell into a pool of water knee-deep, where others crowded upon him; but still he struggled violently with them, got up his head, and looked towards the pinnace as if soliciting assistance. The boat was not above five or six yards distant; but such was the confused and crowded state of the crew, that no assistance could be given him. The natives then got him under again, but in deeper water, though he still continued to struggle, and once more got his head up; but being quite spent, he turned towards the rock as if to support himself by it, when a savage struck him with a club, which probably put an end to his life, as he was never seen to struggle more. The savages hauled his lifeless body upon the rocks, and used it in the most barbarous manner, snatching the daggers out of one another’s hands, in order to have the pleasure of mangling it. If any thing could add to the misfortune of this celebrated ļ navigator’s death, it was, that even his mangled remains were not rescued from the hands of the barbarians. The lieutenant already mentioned, who, by his removing to a distance when he ought to have come on shore, seemed to have been the occasion of his death, returned on board without making any attempt to recover his body; although it appeared from the testimonies of four or five midshipmen who arrived soon afterwards at the fatal spot, that the beach was almost deserted by the natives, who had at last yielded to the continual fire from the boats. The officer alleged in excuse for removing at first from the shore, that he mistook the signals; but be this as it will, the complaints against him were so many and so great, that Captain Clerke was obliged publicly to take notice of them, and to take the depositions of his accusers in writing. These papers, however, were not found, and it is supposed that the captain’s bad state of health had induced him to destroy them. After all, we are informed that, in the opinion of Captain Philips, who commanded the marines, it is very doubtful whether any effectual relief could have been given to the commander, even if no mistake had been committed on the part of the lieutenant. The author of all the mischief was Pareah, the chief already mentioned, who had employed people to steal the boat in the night-time. The king was entirely innocent both of the theft and the murder of Captain Cook; but the latter was perpetrated by some chiefs who were his near relations. The chief who first struck him with a club was named Karimans Raha, and he who stabbed him with the dagger was called Nooah.

By reason of the barbarous disposition of the natives it was found impossible to recover Captain Cook’s body after the first opportunity had been lost. By dint of threats and negotiations, however, some of the principal parts were proćured with great difficulty; by which means the navigators were enabled to perform the last offices to their much respected commander. These remains being put into a coffin, and the service read over them, were committed to the deep with the usual honours, on the 21st of February 1779.

Captain Cook was a man of plain address and appearance, but looked well, and was upwards of six feet in height. His head was small, and he wore his hair, which was brown, tied behind. His face was full of expression; his nose exceedingly well shaped; his eyes, which were small and of a brown cast, quick and piercing; and his eyebrows prominent, which gave his countenance altogether an air of austerity. But notwithstanding his appearance, it was impossible for any one to excel him in humanity; as is evident from the whole tenor of his behaviour, both to his own people and the many savage nations with whom he had occasion to interfere. This amiable quality discovered itself even in the fatal catastrophe above described; for his utmost care was directed to the preservation of his people, and the procuring them a safe retreat to their boats. And it cannot be sufficiently lamented, that he who was so careful of others, should himself have perished in such a miserable manner for want of proper support. The constancy with which he pursued every object was unequalled. Nothing could divert him from what lie had once undertaken; and he persevered in the midst of dangers and difficulties which would have disheartened persons of inferior strength and firmness of mind. For this he was adapted by nature, having a strong constitution, inured to labour, and capable of undergoing the greatest hardships; to which he united an invincible fortitude of mind. Fie was master of himself on every trying occasion; and the greater the emergency, the greater appeared his calmness and self-possession. That he possessed genius in an eminent degree cannot possibly be questioned: his invention was ready, and capable not only of suggesting the most proper objects of pursuit, but the best methods of attaining them. His knowledge of his own profession was unequalled; and to this he added very considerable proficiency in other sciences. In astronomy he became so eminent, that he was at length enabled to take the lead in making the astronomical observations during the course of his voyages. In general learning he likewise attained to such a proficiency as to be able to express himself with clearness and propriety. He was an excellent husband and father, sincere and steady in his friendships, and possessed of general sobriety and virtue of character. In conversation he was unaffected and unassuming; rather backward in pushing discourse, but obliging and communicative to those who wished for information: and he was distinguished by a simplicity of manners almost universally the accompaniment of great merit. With all these amiable qualities, however, he was subject to a hastiness of temper, which sometimes degenerated into harshness and severity; but still, when taking a general view of his character, we must [7:7:304] acknowledge that he was undoubtedly one of the most remarkable men of his time. »

Captain Cook is distinguished as an author by an account of his second voyage written by himself. His first voyage, as well as that of several other navigators, had been recorded by Dr Hawkesworth; but on this occasion it was not judged necessary to have recourse to any other pen than that of the navigator himself; and his journal, with a few occasional alterations, was sufficient for the purpose. The style is clear, natural, and manly; and it is not improbable, that even a pen of more studied elegance could not have made it appear to so much advantage.

Distinguished honours were paid to Captain Cook after his death, both by his own countrymen and by other nations. Michael Angelo Gianetti read, in the Florentine Academy, on the 9th of June 1785, an eulogy on our celebrated navigator, which was published at Florence during the same year. One of the French literary academies also proposed a prize for the best eulogiuιn on Captain Cook; and many poetical testimonies to his merit appeared in our own language. The Royal Society of London resolved to testify their respect to him by a medal, for which purpose a voluntary subscription was opened. One of the gold medals struck on this occasion was presented to the king, another to the queen, a third to the prince of Wales; a fourth was sent to the French king, on account of the protection he had granted to the ships; and a fifth to the empress of Russia, in whose dominions they had been treated with every expression of friendship and kindness. Both thę king of France and the czarina of Russia condescended to accept of the gifts with marks of satisfaction. The French king wrote a handsome letter to the society, signed by himself, and undersigned by the Marquis de Vergennes; and the empress of Russia commissioned Count Osterman to signify to Mr Fitzherbcrt the sense she entertained of the value of the present, which she had caused to be deposited in the museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. After the general assignment of the medals, which took place in 1781, a surplus of money still remained; upon which it was resolved by the president and council that an additional number of medals should be struck off, to be disposed of in presents to Mrs Cook, the Earl of Sandwich, Dr Benjamin Franklin, Dr Cook, provost of King’s College, Cambridge, and Mr Planta.

During the two, visits of the ships at Kamtschatka, Major Behm, the commandant of that province, had in the most liberal manner afforded every kind of assistance which it was in his power to bestow; and such was the sense entertained by the lords of the admiralty of the kindness he had evinced, that they determined to make him a present of a magnificent piece of plate, with an inscription expressive of his humane and generous conduct. Sir Hugh Palliser, who had all along showed an uncommon respect and kindness for Captain Cook, likewise evinced his regard for his memory in a conspicuous manner. On his estate in Buckinghamshire, he constructed a small building, with a pillar, containing inscribed on it the character of Captain Cook which is given at the end of the introduction to the account of the last voyage.

Amidst all these expressions of unavailing praise, the widow and family of our celebrated navigator were not forgotten. A memorial for a pension of L.200 per annum having been presented to the king by the commissioners of the admiralty, and signed by the Earl of Sandwich, Mr Butler, the Earl of Lisburne, Mr Penton, Lord Mulgrave, and Mr Mann, his majesty complied with the request, and the grant was passed through the usual forms with all possible speed. By this grant L.200 per annum was settled on the widow during life, and L.25 a year on each of her three sons; and after her death the L.200 was to be divided among her children. The last honour paid to the memory of Captain Cook was granting a coat of arms to the family, which was done by patent on the 3d of Sep- 1 tember 1785.
