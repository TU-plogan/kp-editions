CONSTANTINA, a province of Algiers, in the eastern or Levantine government. It is bounded on the cast by Tunis, on the west by Tittery or Algiers Proper, on the south by the desert, and on the north by the Mediterranean. It is upwards of 230 miles in length and 100 in breadth. It is the most fertile, and every way the most improved, portion of Algiers. Its coast is the portion of Barbary with which Europeans have chiefly maintained a commercial intercourse.

Constantina, a large city of Algiers, the capital of the above province. It occupies the site of Cirta, celebrated as the ancient bulwark of Numidia. It is built upon an elevated rock, formed into a species of peninsula by the Rummel, which surrounds it on all sides, except a narrow neck of land to the south-west. The ancient city extended tö a considerable distance along a valley beyond the rocky promontory, and many beautiful specimens of its former grandeur and strength remain, among which are aqueducts, gates, arches, pillars, and other architectural fragments of antiquity. The modern city is of less extent, and exhibits nothing remarkable. It is defended by strong [7:7:270] walls, which add to the natural strength of its situation. The surrounding country is very beautiful and fertile. Constantina contains about 30,000 inhabitants. Long. 6. 24. E. Lat. 36. 25. N.

Constantina, a town of Andalusia, in Spain, in the province of Seville, on the borders of Cordova. It is situated in the southern part of the Sierra Morena, in the mining district, where silver mines are now worked, though to little profit. The vicinity is well covered with cork trees and large oaks.
