COROLISTAE, a name by which Linnaeus distinguishes those systematic botanists who have arranged vegetables according to the regularity, figure, number, and other circumstances, of the petals, or beautifully-coloured leaves of the flowers. The best systems of this kind are those of Rivinus and Tourneront. The former proceeds upon the regularity and number of the petals, the latter on their regularity and figure.
