COLUMELLA, Lucius Junius Moderatus, a celebrated Roman writer on agriculture,,was a native of Cadiz, and lived under the emperor Claudius. He composed his works about the year 42 of our era. These consist of a treatise on agriculture, entitled De Re Rustica, and another De Arboribus. The treatise De Re Rustica is divided into twelve books, of which the tenth is in verse; that De Arboribus is ordinarily printed along with the former, in which case it forms a thirteenth or supplemental book. The first edition is that of Jenson, Venice, 1472, folio, very rare, under the title Rei Rustιcce Authores variι, Cato, Varro, Columella, Palladius Rutilius; the second, that published at the same place in 1492, folio; the third, that of Bologna, with explanations and commentaries by Be-roaldus, 1494, folio. But the most complete and accurate edition is that of Gesner, entitled Rei Rusticoe Scriptores veteres Latini, cum notis variorum, et ex nova Matth. Ges-neri recensione, Leipsic, 1735, two vols, in 4to. The two works of Columella were printed separately, at Strasburg in 1543, 8vo; at Lyons in 1548, 8vo; and at Bologna, with interpretations by Bio, in 1520, folio. They have been translated into the German, the Italian, and the French.
