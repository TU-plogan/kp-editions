CRUTH, or Crowtn, a kind of musical instrument formerly in use among the common people in Wales. It is of the fidicinal kind, and somewhat resembles a violin, being twelve inches in length, and an inch and a half in thickness. It has six strings supported by a bridge, and is played on with a bow. The bridge differs from that of a violin, in being flat, and not convex on the top; a circumstance from which it is to be inferred that the strings are to be struck at the same time, so as to afford a succession of concords. The bridge is not placed at right angles with the sides of the instrument, but in an oblique direction; and, which is further to be remarked, one of the feet of the bridge goes through one of the sound-holes, which are circular, and rests on the inside of the back, while the other foot, which is proportionably shorter, rests on the belly before the other sound-hole. The instrument is now disused. Sir John Hawkins tells us, that in his time there was but one person in the whole principality of North Wales who could play upon it.
