CONNECTICUT, one of the United States of North America, is bounded on the north by Massachusetts, on the east by Rhode Island, on the south by Long Island Sound, and on the west by New York. The length of this state from east to west is eighty-five miles; the mean width sixty miles, and the area 5050 square miles. Connecticut is in general hilly, sometimes mountainous, but in no part rises to a great elevation above the level of the sea. The greatest heights are a continuation of the Green Mountains, on the western side of Connecticut river, and even these are of moderate size. The country is healthy, notwithstanding its being exposed to the extremes of heat and cold, and also to sudden changes of temperature. In winter keen north-west winds prevail; but the serenity of the sky during the same season compensates in some degree the severity of the weather. Upon the coast, in particular, the wind is exceedingly variable, but the inland country is less subject to this vicissitude. The soil for the most part is fertile, though at intervals intermixed with patches comparatively thin and barren; the whole, however, is well watered, and in general in a state of good cultivation. The chief productions are Indian corn, rye, wheat, oats, barley, buck-wheat, flax in considerable quantities, some hemp, potatoes, pumpkins, turnips, peas, beans, &c. There are numerous orchards, and cider is made for exportation. Great quantities of cattle, horses, and sheep, are reared upon its fine meadows and pastures, and the country in general is considered as better adapted for grazing than tillage. A great quantity of very excellent cheese is made annually, and beef and pork of a superior quality are also abundant. The farms are for the most part small, consisting of from fifty to three hundred and four hundred acres. This state is intersected by numerous roads, which are generally kept in good condition. The exports consist of beef, pork, cattle, horses, mules, butter, cheese, maize, rye, flax-seed, fish, candles, and soap. Almost all the produce of the western part of the state is conveyed to New York.

The manufacturing industry of Connecticut is considerable, and greater than that of any other state in the union, with the exception of Rhode Island. The manufactures consist of cotton and woollen goods, tinware, iron, gin, glass, paper, snuff’, leather, powder, clocks, shoes, buttons, fire-arms, carriages, &c. Several mines have been opened in this state, but none of them wrought to any considerable extent, except those of iron ore, abundance of which, of an excellent quality, is found in Kent, Salisbury, and in other places. Copper mines have also been wrought, but the speculation proved unprofitable, and was abandoned. Marble, porcelain clay, cobalt, black lead, and an excellent freestone, are found in various parts of the state.

Amongst the literary institutions of Connecticut may be mentioned Yale College of New Haven, which is one of the oldest and most respectable colleges in the United [7:7:264]States. It is furnished with an excellent library, and complete philosophical and chemical apparatus; and the mineralogical museum is probably the finest in the United States. The American asylum for the education of the deaf and dumb was established at Hartford in 1817. It was the first institution of the kind which appeared in America. It received a grant from the congress of the United States of 23,000 acres of land; and the legislatures of several individual states have made appropriations for the support of the pupils. A foreign mission school was established at Cornwall in 1817, for the purpose of educating heathen youth from various parts of the world. A law school was established at Litchfield in 1784, and has long had a great reputation. The Bacon Academy of Colehester, the Episcopal Aeademy of Cheshire, and the Washington College at Hertford, are all flourishing institutions. There are also academies in almost all the principal towns of the state, and common schools are universally established. There is a large school fund, which in 1824 amounted to 1,756,233 dollars. The yearly income, together with 12,000 dollars from the public taxes, goes to the support of common schoolmasters in every town of the state.

The religious bodies are numerous, consisting of Con-gregationalists (who are the most numerous), Baptists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Universalists, Unitarians, Catholics, Quakers, Shakers, and others. The inhabitants are distinguished for their habits of industry and sobriety.

There are five incorporated cities in Connecticut, namely, Hartford. New Haven, Middletown, New London, and Norwich. Hartford and New Haven are the seats of the state government, and the sessions are held at each alternately. The principal rivers are the Connecticut, Housatonic, Thames, Farmington, and Naugatuch.

The present constitution was framed in 1818. The legislature, styled the general assembly, is composed of a senate of twelve members, and a house of representatives, eighty towns sending each two representatives. The other towns founded since the charter of Charles II. in 1662 send one each. The governor, lieutenant-governor, senators, and representatives, are all chosen annually in April. The general assembly has one stated session in each year, on the first Wednesday of May, and such others as they deem necessary. Judges of the supreme and superior courts hold their offices during good behaviour, but are disqualified when they reach seventy years of age. The inhabitants are perfectly free from constraint in matters of religious belief.

A few Dutch traders∙appear to have been the first who established themselves in Connecticut, and the remains of the settlement are still visible at Hartford. In 1634, Lords Say and Seal, who had obtained a grant of Connecticut, sent over a small number of men, who concluded a treaty with the natives for the lands on the river. In 1644 the adventurers purchased the right of the colony for L.1600. Connecticut and New Haven continued two distinct governments for many years; but the royal charter, which was obtained from Charles II., amongst other provisions, constituted the two colonies one body corporate and politic, which they have ever since remained. This charter was framed in the most liberal spirit, and the civil rights granted are nearly the same as those which the state enjoys at present. The revolution, which so sensibly affected the government of most of the other colonies, produced no great alteration in that of Connecticut. This state presents perhaps the most perfect specimen of a republic to be found in the world.

The population in 1800 amounted to 251,002, in 1810 to 261,942, in 1820 to 275,248, and in 1830 to 297,711. Accordingto a recent account, Connecticut contains41,416 houses, 2,607,869 acres of land, 1597 mills, 1827 stores and shops, 402 distilleries, 1211 manufactories, 46 fisheries, 33,358 horses, asses, &c., 219,733 neat cattle, 331,054 sheep, and 5048 carriages.

Connecticut, an important river of the United States. It rises on the northern border of New Hampshire, which state it separates from Vermont, passes through Massachusetts and Connecticut, and discharges itself into Long Island Sound, between Saybrook and Lime. Its course for the most part is south-west until it reaches Middletown in Connecticut, after which it has a south-south-east course to its mouth. Its whole length is 410 miles. For thirty-six miles from its mouth it is navigable for vessels drawing ten feet of water; for those drawing eight, fourteen miles farther; and, by means of locks and canals, it has been rendered navigable to Bath, in New Flampshire, a distance of 300 miles from its confluence with the sea. The falls which have been rendered passable by artificial means are those at Enfield in Connecticut, the Willemantic Falls, those at South Hadley, Montague, Walpole, Plain-field, and Lebanon. Of these, Bellow Falls, at Walpole, are the most remarkable. The Connecticut flows through a fine country. The land which borders upon it is for the most part of excellent quality, and there are upon its banks many beautiful and flourishing towns. Amongst others are Haverhill, Hanover, Charlestown, and Walpole, in New Hampshire; Newbury, Windsor, and Brattleborough, in Vermont; Greenfield, Hadley, Northampton, and Springfield, in Massachusetts; and Hartford, Middletown, &c. in Connecticut.
