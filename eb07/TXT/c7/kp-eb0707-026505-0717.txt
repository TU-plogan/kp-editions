CONSANGUINITY, or Kindred, is defined by the writers on this subject to be vinculum personarum ab eodem stipite descendentium, that is, the connection or relation of persons descended from the same stock or common ancestor. This consanguinity is either lineal or collateral.

Lineal consanguinity is that which subsists between persons of whom one is descended in a direct line from the other. It falls strictly within the definition of vinculum personarum ab eodem stipite descendentium; since lineal relations are such as descend one from the other, and both of course from the same Common ancestors.

Collateral kindred answers to the same description; collateral relations agreeing with the lineal in this, that they descend from the same stock or ancestor, but differing in this, that they do not descend the one from the other. Collateral kinsmen, then, are such as lineally spring from one and the same ancestor, who is the stirps, or root, as well as the stipes, trunk, or common stock whence these relations branch out.
