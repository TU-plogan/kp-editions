Upon the death of his master in 1741, he undertook to complete his Roman History, and published the last eight volumes of the work. He also published other works, and proved greatly serviceable to the cause of virtue and religion, as well as to that of letters. His death happened in 1765, at a very advanced age.

An edition of Livius, cum notis, in six vols. 4to, 1748, and afterwards another edition, better adapted to the use of his pupils, in six vols. small 8vo; 2.
