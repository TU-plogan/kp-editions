COSMOGRAPHY, the description of the world, or the art which teaches the construction, figure, disposition, and relation of all the parts of the world, with the manner of representing them on a plane surface. The word conies from κoσ∕tog, world, and ygapω, I describe. Cosmography consists chiefly of two parts; Astronomy, which shows the structure of the heavens and the disposition of the stars; and Geography, which shows those of the earth.
