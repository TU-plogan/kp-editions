CONTINUED, or Continual, in a general sense, means incessant, or proceeding without interruption.

Continued Bass, in Music, so called, says Rousseau, because it is continued throughout the whole piece. Its principal use, besides that of regulating the harmony, is to support the voice and preserve the tone. It is believed by some that it was one LudovicoViana, author of a treatise still extant, who, towards the end of the last century, first put the continued bass in practice.

Continued Proportion, in Arithmetic, is that where the consequent of the first ratio is the same with the antect-dent[7:7:293] of the second; as 4: 8 :: 8: 1G; in contradistinction to discrete proportion.
