CODRUS, the seventeenth and last king of Athens, son of Melanthus. When the Heraclidae made war against Athens, the oracle said that the victory would be granted to the nation whose king was killed in battle. Upon this the Heraclidae gave strict orders to spare the life of Codrus; but the patriotic king disguised himself, and attacked one of the enemy, by whom he was killed. The Athenians then obtained the victory, and Codrus was deservedly called the father of his country. He reigned twenty-one years; but the era of this traditional monarch is uncertain. In order to honour his memory the more, the Athenians passed a resolution that no man after Codrus should reign in Athens under the title of king.
