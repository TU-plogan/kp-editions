CYNICS, a sect of ancient philosophers, who valued themselves upon their contempt of riches and state, arts and sciences, and every thing, in short, except virtue or morality.

The cynical philosophers owe their origin and institution to Antisthenes of Athens, a disciple of Socrates, who being asked of what use his philosophy had been to him, replied, “It enables me to live with myself.” Diogenes was the most famous of his disciples, and in the life of this remarkable person the system of this philosophy appears in its greatest perfection. He led a most wretched life, a tub having served him for a lodging, which he rolled before him wherever he went. Yet he was nevertheless not the more humble on account of his ragged cloak, bag, and tub; for one day having entered Plato’s house, at a time when a splendid entertainment was given there to several persons of distinction, he jumped upon a rich couch in all his dirt, saying, “I trample on the pride of Plato.” “Yes,” replied Plato, “but with great pride, Diogenes.” He had the utmost contempt for all the human race; for he walked the streets of Athens at noonday with a lighted lanthorn in his hand, telling the people [7:7:575] that he was in search of a man. Among many excellent maxims of morality, he held some most pernicious opinions; for he used to say that the uninterrupted good fortune of Harpalus, who generally passed for a thief and a robber, was a testimony against the gods. He regarded chastity and modesty as weaknesses. Hence Laertius observes of him, that he did every thing openly, whether it belonged to Ceres or Venus; but he adds, by way of palliation, that Diogenes only indulged in an excess of impudence in order to put others out of conceit of it. But impudence was the characteristic of the cynical philosophers, who all argued, that what was right to bc done, might be done at all times, and in all places. The leading principle held by this sect in common with the Stoics was, that we should follow nature. But they differed from the Stoics in their explanation of the maxim; the Cynics being of opinion that a man followed nature who gratified his natural inclinations and appetites, whilst the Stoics understood right reason by the word nature.
