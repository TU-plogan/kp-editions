COMENIUS, John Amos, a grammarian and protestant divine, born in Moravia in 1592. He entertained a design to introduce a new method of teaching languages; for which purpose he published some essays in 1616, and had prepared some others, when the Spaniards pillaged his library, after having taken the city of Fulnce, where he was minister and master of the school. Comenius fled to Lesna, a city of Poland, and taught Latin there. The book he published in 1631, under the title of Janua Linguarum Reserata, gained him a prodigious reputation, insomuch that he was offered a commission for regulating all the schools in Poland. The parliament of England also desired his assistance to regulate the schools in that kingdom. He arrived at London in 1641, and would have been received by a committee to hear his plan, had not the parliament been occupied with other matters. He therefore went to Sweden, being invited by a generous patron, who settled upon him a stipend which delivered him from the fatigues of teaching; and now he employed himself wholly in discovering general methods for those who instructed youth. In 1657 he published the different parts of his new method of teaching. He was not only occupied with the reformation of schools; but he also filled his brain with prophecies, as the fall of Antichrist, the Millennium, and such like. At last Comenius took it into his head to address Louis XIV. of France, and to send him a copy of the prophecies of Drabicius; insinuating, that it was to this monarch God had promised the empire of the world. He became sensible at last of the vanity of his labours, and died in 1671.
