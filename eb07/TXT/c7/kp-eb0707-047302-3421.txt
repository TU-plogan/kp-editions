CRITHOMANCY, a kind of divination, performed by considering the doilgh or matter of the cakes offered in sacrifice, and the meal strewed over the victims which were to be slain. Hence, as barley-meal was commonly used in these ceremonies, this kind of divination was called crithomancy, from %g.'d97, barley, and Î¼awua, divination.
