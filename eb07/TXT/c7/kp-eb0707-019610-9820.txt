CONCINNOUS Intervals, in Music, are such as are fit for music, next to and in combination with concords; being neither very agreeable nor disagreeable in themselves, but having a good effect, as by their opposition they heighten the more essential principles of pleasure, or by their mixture and combination with them, produce a variety necessary to our being better pleased.

Concinnous System, in Music. A system is said to be concinnous, or divided concinnously, when its parts, considered as simple intervals, are concinnous, and, besides, placed in such an order between the extremes, that the succession of sounds, from one extreme to the other, may have an agreeable effect.
