CORNICULARIUS, in an officer in the Ro man army, whose business was to assist the military tribune in quality of lieutenant.

The cornicularii went the rounds instead of the tribune, visited the watch, and were nearly what adjutants are in modern armies.

The denomination cornicularius was given them from a little horn, called corniculum, which was used in giving orders to the soldiers; but Salmasius â€™derives it from corniculum, the crest of a head-piece, as they wore iron or brass horns on their helmets, which were called cornicula.

In the Notitia Imperii we find mention made of a kind of secretary or register of the same name. His business was to attend the judge, and to enter down his sentiments and decisions. The critics derive the word in this sense from corniculum, a little horn to contain ink.
