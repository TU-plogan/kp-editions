CREOLES, a name originally given to the families descended from the Spaniards who first settled at Mexico in America. These are much more numerous than .the Spaniards properly so called, and the Mulattoes, from which species of inhabitants they are distinguished; and formerly they were excluded from all considerable employments. The name is now used in a more extensive sense, and applied to all natives of the West Indies.
