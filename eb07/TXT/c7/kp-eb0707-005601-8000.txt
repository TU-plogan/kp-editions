COLARBASIANS, or Colorbasians, a sect of Christians in the second century, so called from their leader Colarbasus, a disciple of Valentinus, who, with Marcus, another disciple of the same master, maintained that the plenitude and perfection of truth and religion were contained in the Greek alphabet, and that it was upon this account that Jesus Christ was called the α⅞>Aaand omega. This sect was a branch of the Valentinians.
