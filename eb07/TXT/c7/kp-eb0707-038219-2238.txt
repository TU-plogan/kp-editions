COSMOLABE (from ×o<sμoς, world, and λα i α,Cαιw, Italie), an ancient mathematical instrument, serving to measure distances both in the heavens and on the earth. The cosmolabe is in a great measure the same with the astrolabe. It is also called pantacosm, or the universal instrument, by Morgard, in a treatise written expressly on this instrument, and printed in 1612.
