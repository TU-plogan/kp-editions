COLOGNE, one Ã´f the governments into which the [7:7:89] Prussian dominions on the Rhine are divided. It is bounded on the north by Dusseldorf, on the east by Arensburg, on the south by Coblentz, and on the west by Aix-la-Chapelle. It extends over 1350 square miles, or 864,000 acres; and in 1827 it contained 367,580 inhabitants, of whom 296,400 were Catholics, 48,600 Protestants of the Lutheran confession, and the rest Calvinists, Menonites, and Jews. It comprehends fifteen cities, seven market-towns, and 583 villages. .

Cologne, a city, the capital of the government of that name. It stands on the left bank of the Rhine, along which it extends in the form of a semicircle. Its appearance is magnificent, from the extent of the walls, and eighty-three towers that rise above the other buildings. The streets are narrow, the houses large and lofty, and, from being on a low situation, the place is far from being cleanly. The cathedral is a most magnificent pile, though yet unfinished. It is venerated on account of its sanctity, derived from the monkish stories of the kings, and the reliques of the eleven thousand virgins; and it contains the master-piece of Rubens, who was a native of this city. It has given birth to other men of celebrity, Cornelius Agrippa the astrologist, and Barthold Schwartz, who in 1330 discovered gunpowder. It is a place of great trade on the Rhine, and the seat of various manufactures, especially the distilled water which bears the name of the city. These give occupation to the inhabitants, who amounted in 1817 to 54,938.
