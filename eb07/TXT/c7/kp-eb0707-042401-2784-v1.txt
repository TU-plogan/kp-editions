COTULA, or Cotyla, a liquid measure in use among the ancients. Fannius says the cotyla was the same thing with the hemina, which was half a sextary.

At cotylas, quas si placeat, dixisse licebit Heminas recepit geminas sextarius unus.

Chorier observes, that the cotyla was used as a dry measure as well as a liquid one; and this is confirmed by the authority of Thucydides, who in one place mentions two cotylae of wine, and in another two cotylae of bread.
