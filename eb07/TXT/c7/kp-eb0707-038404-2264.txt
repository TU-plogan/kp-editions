COTA, Rodríguez, a Spanish poet, born at Toledo in the fifteenth century, was surnamed El Tio, or the Uncle. No details of his life are found in any of the biographies. He is believed to have flourished under the reign of Don Juan IL, king of Castille; and the celebrated tragi-comedy of Calista y Melibea, as well as a satire against Juan and his court, entitled Mingo Rebulgo, are attributed to him. The tragi-comedia, which is also known under the name of Celestina> had been several times printed before the dates of the Seville and Madrid editions, which appeared respectively in 1539 and 1601. Celestina has been ascribed by some to Juan de Mena; but the slightest attention to the style of this poet, which is altogether different from that of Cota, show’s that there is not the least foundation for such an opinion. The tragĩ-comedy, which was originally written in prose, was rendered into Castih han verse by Juan de Sedeno, Salamanca, 1540, 4to. It has also been translated into Frcnch, Paris, 1527, 1542, and Lyons, 1529, 8vo; Italian, Venice, 1519, 1533, 8vo; and English, under the title of The Spanish Rogue, but without a date.
