CORUNNA, a city of Spain, in the kingdom or province of Galicia. It is a sea-port of considerable importance, with an excellent harbour, secure against all winds except those which blow from the points between the south and the east. It is well fortified towards the sea, but a hill which commands it renders it but an imperfect fortification against a superior force on the land side. The ramparts of this city create a lively interest in every British bosom, from having been the place in which was interred [7:7:381] that gallant officer Sir John Moore, who received his deathwound in the moment of victory before the walls of this city. The inhabitants of Corunna have since erected a monument on the spot where this distinguished officer was interred.

The name Corunna is a corruption of the Latin word Columia, given to this place on account of a pillar called the tower of Hercules, erected by the Romans in the most northern part of the peninsula. This tower has been recently repaired, and, at an expense of 40,000 dollars, converted into a light-house. Corunna is situated upon an irregular peninsula, the neck of which is occupied by the city, and defended by a chain of bastions. On one of this chain is the citadel, and on the other the fortress of St Diego. The strength of these works induced the inhabitants, after the evacuation of the British army, to resolve on defence; and though, from the heights which command the work, the defence was unsuccessful, it enabled them to obtain better terms of capitulation.

Corunna is a place of considerable trade; it has extensive manufactories of linen and baizes, and carried on commerce in these articles with the Spanish settlements in America. Though it is not the capital of Galicia, yet it is the head-quarters of the military and naval force, and a considerable portion of the navy was formerly stationed there. It carries on considerable fisheries, especially for sardinias, which are salted for the consumption of the interior. It contains between 11,000 and 12,000 inhabitants, and is considered as one of the healthiest cities in Spain. It is in long. 7. 43. 3. W. and lat. 43. 28. N.
