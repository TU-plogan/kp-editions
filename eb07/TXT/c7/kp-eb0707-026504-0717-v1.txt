CONRADIN, or Conrad, junior, son of Conrad the fourth of that name, was acknowledged as emperor by the Ghibbelincs, who received him in triumph at Rome; but Pope Alexander IV. had published a crusade against this orphan; and Urban VII. his successor, gave the empire to Charles of Anjou, brother of Louis IX. king of France. The unfortunate youth, though powerfully supported even by the Turks, lost a battle, in which he was taken prisoner, and in 1229 he was publicly beheaded at Naples, by order of his base opponent, in the eighteenth year of his age. In him ended the race of the dukes of Suabia, which had produced several kings and emperors.
