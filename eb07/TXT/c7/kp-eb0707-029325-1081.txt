CONVENTION, a treaty, contract, or agreement between two or more parties.

Convention is also a name given to an extraordinary assembly of parliament, or the estates of the realm, held without the kingâ€™s writ, as the convention parliament which restored Charles II. This parliament met about a month before his return, sat fully seven months after his restoration, and enacted several laws still in force, which were confirmed by stat. 13 Car. II. c. 7 and c. 14. Such also was the convention of estates in 1688, which, upon the retreat of King James II. came to a conclusion that he had abdicated the throne, and that the right of succession had devolved to King William and Queen Mary; upon which the assembly expired as a convention, and.was converted into a parliament.

Convention of Estates, in Scotland, was partly of the nature of a parliament, but differed in this, that the former could only lay on taxes, while parliament could both impose taxes and make laws.
