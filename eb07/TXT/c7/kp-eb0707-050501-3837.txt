CRYPTA, a subterraneous cell or vault, especially under a church, for the interment of particular families or persons. Ciampini, describing the outside of the Vatican, speaks of the cryptae of St Andrew, St Paul, and others. The word is formed of κcυ∙τrω, abscondo, to hide, cover, or conceal.

Vitruvius uses the word crypta for a part of a building answering nearly to our cellar, and Juvenal for a cloaca. Hence crypto-porticus is a subterraneous place arched or vaulted, and used as an under-work or passage in old walls. The same term is also employed to signify the decoration at the entry of a grotto.

Crypta is likewise used by some of our ancient writers for a chapel or oratory under ground.
