CONDOR, Pulo Isles, a cluster of small islands in the Eastern Seas, situated off the southern coast of Cambodia. The principal island is about twelve miles in length, and two in breadth; it is in the form of a crescent, and consists chiefly of a range of high and rugged mountains. On the east side of the island is a spacious bay with good anchorage, at the bottom of which is a village situated on a fine sandy beach. The island is destitute of spring water; and the soil is barren, producing only a few sweet potatoes, beans, gourds, and water melons. The inhabitants, who are mostly refugees from Cambodia and Cochin China, are poor and indolent, and incapable of supplying ships with refreshments. Their physiognomy denotes a Chinese origin, though they do not understand the Chinese tongue. The English, in 1702, at the instigation of Dampier, endeavoured to form a settlement here; but the settlers were mostly cut off by the treachery of the natives. Long. 106. 42. E. Lat. 8. 4Ò. N.
