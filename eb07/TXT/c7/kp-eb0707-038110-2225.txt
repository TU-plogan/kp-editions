CORYCOMACHIA, among the ancients, was a sort of exercise in which they pushed forwards a ball suspended from the ceiling, and at its return either caught it with their hands or suffered it to meet their body. Oribasius informs us that it was recommended for the purpose of extenuating too gross bodies.
