CYAXARES, son of Phraortes, was king of Media and Persia. He bravely defended his kingdom, which the Scythians had invaded. Hc made war against Alyattes, king of Lydia, and subjected to his power all Asia beyond the river Halys. After a reign of forty years, he died in the year of Rome 160.

Cyaxares II. is supposed by some to be the same as Darius the Mede. He was the son of Astyages, king of Media. He added seven provinces to his father’s dominions, and made war against the Assyrians, whom Cyrus favoured.
