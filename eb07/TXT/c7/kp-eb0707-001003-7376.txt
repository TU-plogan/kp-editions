COBLENTZ, a city, the capital of a circle of the same name, in the Prussian province of the Lower Rhine. The circle js on both sides of the Rhine, and extends over 135 square miles, or 86,400 acres, and contains four cities, three towns, and 136 villages, and 40,134 inhabitants.

The city is situated on the left bank of the Rhine, over which is a flying bridge, connecting it with Ehrenbreitstein. The situation is beautiful, on an extended plain between mountains, at the junction of the Moselle with the Rhine. The soil is highly fertile in the valley, and the sides of the hills around are covered with vineyards. The city is walled, but its chief defences are two strong forts, and the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, on the opposite side of the river, which completely command it. The town is well built, the squares are fine, and some of the public edifices are magnificent. It contains one Protestant and fourteen Catholic churches, 1050 houses, with (in 1817) 13,314 inhabitants, including the garrison.

Owing to the two navigable rivers, it carries on a considerable trade,' especially in Rhine and Moselle wine. There are some few manufacturers, but none considerable, as the city depends principally on being the seat of government and of the courts of law, and occupying a position on the great road to the interior of Germany.
