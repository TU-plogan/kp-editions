CYRENAICS, a sect of ancient philosophers, so called from their founder Aristippus of Cyrene, a disciple of Socrates.

The great principle of their doctrine was, that the supreme good of man in this life is pleasure; by which they not only meant privation of pain, and tranquillity of mind, but an assemblage of all mental and sensual pleasures, particularly the latter.

Cicero makes frequent mention of Aristippusâ€™ school, and speaks of it as producing debauchees. Three disciples of Aristippus, after his death, divided the sect into three branches, under which division it languished and sunk; the first called the Hegesiac school, the second the Annicerian, and the third the Theodoran, from the names of their authors.
