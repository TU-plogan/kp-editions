CUTTS, John Lord, a soldier of approved bravery in King William’s wars, was son of Richard Cutts, Esq. of Matching, in Essex, where the family were settled about the time of Henry VL, and had a great estate. He entered early into the service of the Duke of Monmouth, was aide-de-camp to the Duke of Lorrain in Hungary, and signalized himself in a remarkable manner at the taking of Buda by the imperialists in 1686, which important place had been for near a century and a half in the hands of the Turks. Mr Addison, in a Latin poem worthy of the Augustan age, alludes to MrCutts’ distinguished bravery at that siege. Returning to England at the Revolution, he received a regiment of foot, was created Baron of Gowran in Ireland on the 6th of December 1690, appointed governor of the Isle of Wight on the 14th of April 1693, and made a major-general. When the assassination project was discovered in 1695-6, he was captain of the king’s guard. In 1698 he was complimented by Mr John Hopkins, as one to whom a double crown was due, as a hero and a poet. He was colonel of the Coldstream or second regiment ofguards in 1701, when Mr Steele, who was indebted to his interest for a military commission, inscribed to him his first work, The Christian Hero. On the accession of Queen Anne, he was made a lieutenant-general of the forces in Holland, commander in chief of the forces in Ireland under the Duke of Ormond, and afterwards one of the lords justices of that kingdom, to keep him out of the way of action. He died at Dublin on the 26th January 1707, and was buried in the cathedral of Christ-Church. He wrote a poem on the death of Queen Mary, and published, in 1687, Poetical Exercises, written upon several occasions, and dedicated to her Royal Highness Mary princess of Orange. This collection contains, besides the dedication, Veι⅛es addressed to that princess, a poem on Wisdom, another to Mr Waller on his commending it; seven more copies of verses (one of them called La Muse Cavalier, which had been ascribed to Lord Peterborough, and as such mentioned by Mr Walpole in the list of that nobleman’s writings), and eleven songs, the whole composing but a very thin volume.
