CURIOSUS, an officer of the Roman empire during the lower age, appointed to take care that no frauds or irregularities were committed, particularly in what related to the posts, the roads, &c. and to give intelligence to the court of what passed in the provinces. This rendered the Curiosi people of importance, and putthem in a condition to do more harm than they prevented; for which reason Honorius cashiered them, in the year 415.

The Curiosi nearly resembled what we call controllers. They had their name from cura, care, quod curis agendis et evectionibus cursus publici inspiciendis operam darent.
