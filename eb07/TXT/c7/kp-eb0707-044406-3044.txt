CRANGANORE, a town and sea-port of India, on the coast of Malabar, the capital of a small district of the same name. It stands about three miles up a river, five leagues to the north of Cochin, and is only accessible for small vessels. It is an ancient place, and the Jews assert that they were in possession of it as early as the year 490. It was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1505, and retained by them till the year 1663, when it was taken by the Dutch, who fortified it. But as they were unable to defend it against Tippoo, they sold it to the rajah of Travancore, which occasioned a war between these two potentates; and, on the 8tb May 1790, the troops of the sultan took possession of Cranganore. The English, in favour of their ally the rajah, now took part in the war, and retook the place in 1791. Long. 76. 5. E. Lat. 10. 15. N.
