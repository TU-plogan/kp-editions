COLOSTRUM, the first milk of any animal after bringing forth it,s young, called in some places beestings. It is remarkable that this milk is generally cathartic, and purges the meconium; thus serving both as aliment and as medicine. An emulsion prepared with turpentine dissolved with the yolk of an egg, is sometimes called by this name.
