CROATIA, a part of the ancient Illyricum, is bounded on the east by Sclavonia and Bosnia, on the south and south-west by Morlachia, and on the north by the Drave, which separates it from part of Sclavonia. It is about 160 miles in length, and 100 in breadth, and was once divided between the Hungarians and Turks; but now the greater part of it is subject to the house of Austria. The Croats derive their origin from the Sclavi, and their language is [7:7:474] a dialect of the Sclavonian, approaching very near to that of the Poles. The country is divided into two parts, namely, that under and that beyond the Save. The soil, where cultivated, is fruitful in wine, oil, and other products, but being a frontier country, and much exposed to inroads, it is not well cultivated. In 1809 the part of Croatia lying south of the Åžave was ceded to France, and united with the Illyrian provinces; but in 1815 it was restored to Austria.
