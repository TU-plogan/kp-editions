COMPREHENSION, in English church history, denotes a scheme proposed by Sir Orlando Bridgman in 1667-8, for relaxing the terms of conformity in behalf of Protestant dissenters, and admitting them into the communion of the church. A bill for this purpose was drawn up by Lord Chief Baron Hale, but disallowed. The attempt was renewed by Tillotson and Stillingfleet in 1674, and the terms were settled to the satisfaction of the nonconformists; but the bishops refused their assent. This scheme was likewise revived again immediately after the Revolution, the king and queen expressing their desire of an union; but the design failed after two attempts, and the act of toleration was passed.

Comprehension, in the philosophy of the mind, is that act of the mind by which it apprehends or knows any object that is presented to it. To comprehend a thing is defined by the schoolmen rem aliquam totam et totaliter cognoscere. Comprehension, in Rhetoric, a trope or figure by which the name of a whole is put for a part, or that of a part for a whole, or a definite number of any thing for an indefinite.
