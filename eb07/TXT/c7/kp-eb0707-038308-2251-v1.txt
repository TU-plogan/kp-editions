COSTA RICA, a province of Guatemala, extending from Nicaragua to the district of Chiriqui, in the jurisdiction of Veraguas, a distance of one hundred and sixty leagues from west to east; and from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, a distance of sixty leagues from north to south. Its limit on the Atlantic is from the mouth of the river San Juan to the little island called the Escudo de Veraguas; and on the Pacific, from the river Alvarado, the boundary of the province of Nicaragua, to the river Boruca, which terminates the kingdom of Terra Firma to the westward. For the most part the climate is warm, but in some places very temperate. The soil, which is not fertile, yields cocoa, tobacco, and other productions of warm climates. Wheat, and such other articles as are peculiar to colder regions, are raised in the mountainous parts, but all in scanty proportions. There are mines of gold, silver, and copper, but these are scarcely more productive than the surface of the soil. Within the government of Costa Rica there are one city, three towns, and ten villages; and the whole number of inhabitants in the province is estimated at about 38,600; a small proportion compared with the extent of territory, and a great diminution of its ancient numbers. The chief city, which is said [7:7:384] to be the most ancient in the kingdom, is Cartago. It stands in a healthy situation in the heart of the province, in long. 82.46. W. and lat. 9. 10. N. It contains a ehurch, a Franciscan convent, a sanctuary, and two oratorios, and has a population of upwards of 8000. Next to the capital, the most populous town is Villa Nueva de San José, which stands in a valley at a short distance from Cartago. This province has two ports, one on the Atlantic, and one on the Pacific.
