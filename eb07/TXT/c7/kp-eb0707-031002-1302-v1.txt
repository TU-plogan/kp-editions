COPHTIC, or Coptic, the language of the Cophts, being the language of the ancient Egyptians, mixed with a little Greek, and written in letters which are chiefly Greek, though fashioned on the model of the enchorial, demotie, or civil characters of the country. It has a form and construction peculiar to itself, having no inflections of the nouns or verbs, but expressing number, ease, gender, person, mood, and tense, and forming the possessive pronouns by means of letters and particles prefixed.

Kireher is the first who published a grammar and vocabulary of the Cophtic. The only books extant in the Cophtie are translations of the Seriptures, or of ecelesiastieal offices, and others that relate thereto, as grammars and dictionaries.

Copthic Liturgies. Of these there are three; one attributed to Basil, another to St Gregory, and a third to Cyril. They have been translated into Arabic, for the use of the priests and people.
