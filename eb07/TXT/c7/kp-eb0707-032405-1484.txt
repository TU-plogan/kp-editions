CORELLA, a town of Spain, in the province of Navarre. It is situated on the river Alhama. It has a considerable trade in the manufacture of shoes, with the upper parts of straw and the bottoms of wood, which are very commonly worn by the poorer classes of the inhabitants. Near this place are mines of antimony, which is reduced to a state fit for consumption by means of coal, which, though not commonly extracted in Spain, owing to the prejudices of the natives against it, is here raised and used as fuel. This town contains 4000 inhabitants.
