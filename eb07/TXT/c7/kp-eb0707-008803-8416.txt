COLLUMPTON, a market-town in the hundred of Hayridge, in Devonshire, 1G5 miles distant from London, and situated on the river Culm, which runs into the Exe. It had considerable trade in making serges, which is now much diminished. The market, which is held on Saturday, is well attended. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 2917, in 1821 to 3410, and in 1831 to 3813.
