CORNARIUS, or Haguenbot, John, a celebrated German physician, born at Zwickow, in Saxony. His preceptor made him change his name of Haguenbot to that of Cornarius, under which he is best known. At twenty years of age he taught grammar, and explained the Greek and Latin poets and orators to his scholars; and at twentythree he became licentiate in medicine. He found fault with most of the remedies provided by the apothecaries; and observing that the greater part of the physicians taught their pupils only what is to be found in Avicenna, Rhasis, and other Arabian physicians, he carefully sought for the writings of the best physicians of Greece, and employed about fifteen years in translating them into Latin, especially the works of Hippocrates, Aetius, Eginetes, and part of those of Galen. Meanwhile he practised physic with reputation at Zwickow, Frankfort, Marpurg, Nord-hausen, and Jena, where he died of apoplexy in 1558, aged fifty-eight. He also wrote some medical treatises; published editions cf some poems of the ancients on medicine and botany; and translated some of the works of the fathers, particularly those of Basil, and part of those of Epiphanius.
