CZASLAU, a circle of the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia, bounded by the circles of Chrudim .and Tabor. It extends over 1300 square miles, and comprehends nine cities, thirty-three market-towns, and 834 villages. In 1817 the number of houses was 30,390, and of inhabitants 187,120. It is in part watered by the Upper Elbe, and by the Dobrawa, which falls into that river. Towards Moravia the country is mountainous, but in the other parts only undulating; and the soil is fruitful, yielding good crops of corn and flax. In the hills are found silver and iron, and the woods afford great abundance of game.

Czaslau, a city of Bohemia, the chief place of the circle of the same name, about twenty-five miles east of Prague. It contains 2560 inhabitants, and 283 houses. In the cathedral is a monument to the memory of Zisca, the leader of the Hussite reformers, who was buried there.
