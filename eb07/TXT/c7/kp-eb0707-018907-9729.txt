COMPLEX, in a more general sense, is a term synonymous with compound; though in strictness of speech there is considerable difference.

Complex is properly applied where a thing contains many others, or consists of different parts which are not really distinct from each other, but only imagined or conceived to be so. In this sense the soul may be said to be complex, in respect of the understanding and will, which are two things that our reason alone distinguishes in it.

Compl£X Term, or Idea, is a term compounded of several simple or incomplex ones. Thus, in the proposition, a just God cannot leave crimes unpunished, the subject of this proposition, a just God, is a complex term, or stands for a complex idea composed of two simple or incomplex ones, God anåjust.
