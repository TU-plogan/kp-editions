COMMODORE, a general officer in the British marine, invested with the command of a detachment of ships of war, destined on any particular enterprise, during which time he bears the rank of brigadier-general in the army, and his ship is distinguished from the rest of his squadron by a broad red pendant tapering towards the outer end, and sometimes forked. The word is corrupted from the Spanish comendador. Commodore is also a name given to some select ship in a fleet of merchantmen, which leads the van in time of war, and carries a light in its top, to conduct the rest and keep them together. It is always the oldest captain in the fleet who commands.
