CONANT, Dr John, a learned English divine, born in 1608. He took his degrees at Exeter College, Oxford; was by the parliament constituted one of the assembly of divines, though he seldom or never sat with them; and in 1657 was admitted vice-chancellor of the university. On the restoration he was one of the commissioners, and assisted at the conferences in the Savoy, but was deprived by the act of uniformity; but after eight years he was confirmed, and made archdeacon of Norwich, and prebendary of Worcester. In 16S6 he lost his sight, and died in 1693, leaving a number of sermons, afterwards published in six volumes.
