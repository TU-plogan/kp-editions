CORONER (coronator), an ancient officer in England, so called because he has principally to do with pleas of the crown, or those in which the king is more immediately concerned. And in this light the lord chief justiee of the king’s beneh is the principal coroner in the kingdom, and may, if he pleases, exercise the jurisdiction of coroner in any part of the realm. But there are also particular coroners for every county in England; usually four, but sometimes six, and sometimes fewer. This officer is of equal authority with the sheriff, and was ordained, together with him, to keep the peace, when the earls gave up the wardship of the county.

He is chosen by the freeholders of the county court; and by the statute of Westminster it was enacted, that none but lawful and discreet knights should be chosen; but now it seems sufficient if a man have land enough to be made a knight, whether he be really knighted or not; for the coroner ought to have an estate sufficient to maintain the dignity of his office, and answer any fines that may be imposed upon him for his misbehaviour; and if he has not enough to answer, his fine should be levied on the county, as a punishment for electing an insufficient officer. Now, indeed, through the culpable neglect of gentlemen of property, this office has been suffered to fall into disrepute, and get into low and indigent hands; so that although formerly no coroners were paid for serving their country, and by the aforesaid statute of Westminster they were expressly forbidden to take a reward, under pain of forfeiture to the king, yet for many years past they have only desired to be chosen for the sake of the perquisites or fees allowed for attendance by the statute 3 Henry VII. c. 1. This Sir Edward Coke complains of heavily, but since his time those fees have been mueh enlarged.

The coroner is chosen for life, but may be removed either by being made sheriff or chosen verderor, which are offices incompatible with the other; and by the statute 25 Geo. II. c. 29, extortion, neglect, or misbehaviour, are also made causes of removal.

The office and power of a coroner arc also, like those of the sheriff, either judicial or ministerial, but principallyju-dieial. This is in a great measure ascertained by statute 4. Edw. I. De officio Coronatoris ; and his duty consists principally in inquiring, when any person is slain or dies suddenly, or in prison, concerning the manner of his death. And this must be super visum corporis ; for if the body is not found, the coroner cannot sit. He must also sit at the very place where the death happened; and his inquiry is made by a jury from four, five, or six of the neighbouring towns over whom he is to preside. If any be found guilty by this inquest of murder, he is to commit the accused to prison for further trial, and is also to inquire concerning their lands, goods, and chattels, which are thereby forfeited; but whether it be murder or not, he must inquire whether any deodand has accrued to the king or the lord of the franchise by the death, and must certify the whole of this inquisition to the court of king’s beneh or the next assizes. Another branch of his office is to inquire concerning Shipwrecks, and certify whether wreck or not, and who is in possession of the goods. In the matter of treasure-trove, he is also to inquire concerning the finders, and where it is, and whether any one be suspected of having found and concealed a treasure; whereupon he may be attached and held to bail on this suspicion only.

The ministerial office of the coroner is only as the sheriff’s substitute; for when just exception can be taken to the sheriff for suspicion of partiality, as that he is interested in the suit, or of kindred to either plaintiff or defendant, the process must then be awarded to the eoroner instead of the sheriff, for execution of the king’s writs.

The office of coroner was formerly known in Scotland. (Hume’s Comment, ii. 24.)
