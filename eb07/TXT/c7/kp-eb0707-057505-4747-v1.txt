CYNOSURA, in Astronomy, a denomination given by the Greeks to ursa minor, the little bear, by which sailors steer their course. The word is formed of κuvo<rou^α, the dog’s tail. This is the constellation next our pole, and consists of seven stars; of which four are disposed like the four wheels of a chariot, and three lengthwise representing the beam; whence some give it the name of a chariot, or Charles's warn. Cynosura, in Mythology, a nymph of Ida, in Crete. She nursed Jupiter, who changed her into a star bearing the same name, and which is the same as the ursa minor.
