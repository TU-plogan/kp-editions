CONON, a renowned Athenian general and admiral, flourished 394 years before Christ. (See the article Attica.) After his defeat by Lysander, he fled to Evagoras, king of Cyprus, and then put himself under the protection of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, with whose army [7:7:265]he delivered Athens from the oppression of strangers, and rebuilt it walls. In the 360th year of Rome, he defeated the Lacedaemonians in a naval encounter near Cnidus, upon the coast of Asia; deprived theni of the empire which they had exercised over sea, ever since the taking of Athens; and gained other considerable advantages over them; but having fallen into the hands of Teribazus, a Persian, who envied his glory and dreaded his prowess, he was cruelly put to death.
