COMBUST, in Astronomy. When a planet is in conjunction with the sun, or not distant from it above half its disk, it is said to be combust, or in combustion.

According to Argol, a planet is combust, or in combustion, when not above eight degrees and thirty minutes distant from the sun, either before or after him.
