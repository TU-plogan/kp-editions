CONCA, Sebastian, called Cavalier, a celebrated historical and portrait painter, was born at Gaeta in 1679. The churches and chapels of every part of Italy are enriched with some of his compositions, of which he painted an incredible number, as he lived to a very advanced age, and never discontinued his labours. He was earnestly invited by Philip V. of Spain to visit his court; but he could not be prevailed on to leave Rome. He was at last so strongly pressed to go to Naples, that he undertook the journey, and was received in that kingdom with all the respect and honour due to his merit; and there he finished several very noble designs, as also at Gaeta, his native city. While he continued at Naples he received in the royal presence a snuff-box of very great value, which was presented to him in the king’s name by the Marquis of Tanucci, at that time prime minister; and in the year 1757 the king was pleased to ennoble him and all his descendants. At that time he was seventy-eight years of age, and it is confidently said that he died in 1761, aged eighty-two, which is very probable, though not positively certain. He understood perspective and architecture thoroughly, and added to this a fine understanding of the chiaroscuro. His style of composition is grand and elegant; his design very correct; his disposition ingenious; his attitudes and expression full of truth, nature, and variety; and his colouring excellent.
