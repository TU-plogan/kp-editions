CURIATII, three brothers of Alba, who maintained the interest of their country against the Romans, when the latter had declared war against those of Alba. The two armies being equal, three brothers on each side were chosen to decide the contest, the Curiatii by the people of Alba, and the Horatii by the Romans. The first three were wounded, and two of the latter killed; but the third joining policy to valour, feigned to run away; and having thus separated the Curiatii, he took them one after another, and killed all three.
