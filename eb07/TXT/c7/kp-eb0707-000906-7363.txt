COBADONGA, a small town of Spain, in the province of Asturias. Its fame has been spread through the peninsula, on account of the antiquity and sanctity of its Gothic cathedral, in which was consecrated Pelagius, the first of those zealous Christians that took arms against the Arabian invaders of Spain. In the retreats in this vicinity, the first assemblages of the remnant of the Goths were collected, and from thence they spread with growing strength, till at length, after more than seven hundred years of unceasing hostilities, the whole of the Moorish race was driven from the soil of Spain.
