COMMENDATUS, one who lives under the protection of a great man. Commendati homines were persons who, by voluntary homage, put themselves under the protection of any superior lord. Ancient homage was either predial, due for some tenure; or personal, which was by compulsion, as a sign of necessary subjection; or voluntary, with a desire of protection; and those who, by voluntary homage, put themselves under the protection of any man in power, were sometimes called homines ejus commendati, as often occurs in Doomsday-book. Commendati dimidii were those who depended on two several lords, and paid one half of their homage to each; and sub-commendati were like under-tenants under the command of persons who were themselves under the command of some superior lord. There were also dimidii sub-commendati, who bore a double relation to such depending lords. This phrase seems to be still in use in the usual compliment, “Com-* mend me to such a friend,”,which is to let him know’ ii I am his humble servant.”
