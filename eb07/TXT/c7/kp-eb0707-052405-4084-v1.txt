CUBA, the largest and most westerly of the Antilles. Its configuration, extent, geographical position, great number of ports, fertility, and climate, contribute to render it one of the most interesting countries of America. Its length, from Cape St Antonio to Point Maisi, in a direction from west-south-west to east-north-east, and then from west-north-west to east-south-east, is 257 leagues; and its greatest width, in the direction from north to south, is thirty-eight leagues.

The learned geographer Don Felipe Bausa calculated that the surface of Cuba contained 3615 square maritime leagues, twenty to a degree. Cuba is situated between longitude 73° 56' and 85° west, and between latitude 19° 48' 30" and 23° 12 ’ 45" north. It lies fourteen leagues west from Cape Nicolas, in the island of St Domingo; thirty-four south from Point Morant, in Jamaica; twentyseven east from Cape Catoehe; and thirty-seven south from Cape Florida. The Gulf of Mexico, which is very nearly of a circular form, of more than 250 leagues in circumference, is closed by the island of Cuba, with the exception of two narrow passages, the one to the south, between Cape Catoche and Cape St Antonio, and the other to the north, between Bahia, Honda, and the Florida shoals. Along the coast of Cuba are many keys and small islands, which are included in the same government with the large island.
[7:7:525]

The navigation of the coast is very unsafe, on account of the rocks and shoals which encompass it almost without interruption, and often extend from two to three miles into the sea. The broken outline of this vast extent of coast, however, affords more than fifty ports and anchoring places, which are equally safe and easy of access. The most remarkable, in a commercial point of view, are those of Havanna, Mantanzas, Nuevitas, Jibara, and Baracoa, on the north, and St Jago, Manzanillo, Trinidad, Jagua, and Batabano, on the south side of the island. There is another port between Manzanillo and Trinidad, called Santa Cruz, which in February 1829 was declared a free port, and which, undoubtedly, will be much frequented, as it furnishes great facilities for trading with Puerto Principe, the second city in Cuba in point of population, is the only good harbour in its vicinity on the south side of the island, and is distant from it not more than twenty leagues. The harbours of Bahia, Honda, Nipe, Naranjo, and Guantanamo, also deserve to be mentioned, as they are very spacious, and have plenty of water for such large vessels as may be in want of a safe port. A ridge of mountains traverses the whole of the island, from the east to the west, dividing it into two parts. At the foot of these the country opens into extensive savannas. A considerable number of small streams from these heights water the island on both sides. These streams abound in fish of different kinds, and are said to bring down considerable quantities of gold. There are likewise many salt ponds, which furnish abundance of fish and game; and several springs of mineral water, which have proved very useful for the cure of many diseases. The most remarkable are those of St Diego, forty leagues west of Havanna; those of Madruga, fourteen leagues south-west of the said city; those of the town of Guanabacoa; and those of Camugiro, one and a half league from Puerto Principe. Those of St Diego are the only springs which have been analysed. They consist of two wells, Tigre and Templado; and, according to the analysis of Señor Esteves, a pound of the water contains 0 , 46 grains of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, 10∙5 of sulphate of lime, 1∙0 of hydrochlorate of magnesia. They are particularly useful in cases of scrofula, cutaneous diseases, and some other complaints. The island is very rich in minerals, particularly in copper, iron, and loadstone. In 1813, some persons endeavoured to work a mine which they found near the city of Trinidad, and from which they obtained good gold and silver. They were however obliged, from want of funds, to desist, though it was highly probable that, with sufficient capital, it might have been rendered profitable. For the same reason, together with the want of protection from the government, a very rich mine of coal was opened in 1816 near Bacuranao. A silver mine was discovered in 1827, which yielded 7∙5 of pure silver to a quintal of ore. Iron seems to be abundant, as the ore shows itself in some parts. Loadstone is found in the mountains of Paragua, and on the northern coast. Marbles of various kinds, and several important minerals, are also met with on the island. The thickness of the forests, and the rugged nature of the mountains, particularly on the eastern side, have prevented travellers and others from fully ascertaining the geological and mineralogical structure of Cuba. Most of what is known upon this subject is due to the indefatigable Humboldt. So productive is the soil of Cuba, that it yields two, and even three crops of corn in the year. During the whole year the fields are covered with aromatic plants and trees in blossom. The climate is dry and warm. In the months of July and August the thermometer ranges from 95° to 97° Fahrenheit; and in the coldest months, which are December and January, between 70° and 79° of Fahrenheit. It never freezes, even upon the highest mountains. The coasts of the island are unhealthy, but the mountains are the reverse. Among the indigenous animals of the island or the surrounding sea are the cayman or alligator, the manita or sea cow, the iguana, a species of lizard, the turtle, &c. Many of the domestic animals of Europe have been introduced. A great number of swine, and also of bees, are raised. The breeding of mules has recently been carried on to a considerable extent. Birds are numerous in the forests, among which are the canary bird, the linnet, the cardinal gross-beak, the bunting, also a bird resembling the nightingale. The rivers, though deficient in water, and having but a short course, abound with excellent fish at certain seasons. Reptiles and insects, among which are mosquitoes, abound to a great extent. The vegetable kingdom of Cuba is extremely rich. There are to be found the mahogany tree, the cedar, lignum vitae, and various kinds of ebony, besides numerous woods suitable for building houses, ships, &c.; palm trees, among which the palma real is remarkable for its utility to man and animals; sarsaparilla, and many other plants useful in medicine; also the chestnut, the pine-apple, the anana or custard apple, the medlar, plantain, orange, and various kinds of melons. Among the agricultural plants,maize is the most important; rice, beans, and peas, are also cultivated; but the rearing of wheat has been abandoned.

The riches of the country consist in its great articles of export, sugar, coffee, tobacco, wax, cacao, molasses, rum, maize, &c. According to a recent official document, the export of sugar in 1827 was 5,878,9241 arrobas (an arroba being equal to 25 pounds), or, including tare, &c. 6,300,000 arrobas. The whole amount produced was 8,091,837 arrobas, of which there were consumed on the island 1,791,837 arrobas. Of coffee, the export in the same year was 2,001,5831 arrobas, and the amount consumed in the island 881,944^ arrobas. With respect to tobacco, the amount has not been so well ascertained. This article pays a duty of six per cent, to the king, by an ordinance of the 8th October 1827. In that year there were exported about 500,000 arrobas, of which 79,106įwere in the leaf. The whole wax produced in 1827 was 63,160, and the amount exported 22,402∣ arrobas. In the same year the quantity of cotton raised amounted to 38,142, and the export to 23,414 arrobas. Of cacao, the export was only 1953 arrobas, while the whole quantity raised was 23,806 arrobas. Although indigo began to be cultivated as far back as the year 1795, little has as yet been produced. In 1827 only 56 arrobas were exported, and of wheat only 120 arrobas. The export of molasses was 74,083 hogsheads, and of rum 2457 pipes. Rice is raised in great abundance, but not to an extent sufficient to supply the home consumption. In 1827, 520,897 arrobas were produced in the island, and 590,820^ arrobas imported. Of maize, 161,780,600 pounds were raised; and yet there were imported 70,497 arrobas of the corn, and 4952 barrels of meal. Of beans there were produced 134,185 arrobas, and imported 58,418∣. Notwithstanding this great production, it is believed that only a seventh part of the land suitable for cultivation is brought into tillage. The commerce of the country has of late very much increased. In comparison with the other countries under the Spanish yoke, this island enjoys great privileges. The trade is principally carried on through the capital, Havanna. There have been times when the exports of the capital amounted to 12,000,000 dollars, and its imports were above 15,000,000 dollars. In 1827, 17,352,854 dollars’ worth of merchandise was imported, and 3,565,887 dollars’ worth exported; making the consumption amount to 13,791,267 dollars, which, after the subtraction of articles of food imported for the slaves, leaves 12,291,267 dollars for the value of imported articles consumed by the [7:7:526] 337,126 white and 106,494 coloured free persons; thus giving twenty-eight dollars as the average consumption of each individual during the year. The total value of the produce of the island was lately estimated at 44,634,343 dollars. In 1827 the commerce of Havanna contributed to the royal treasury 4,383,262 dollars, whilst in 1815 it only paid 1,726,963∣ dollars. The whole revenue of the island has been estimated at 7,500,000, and the expenses of the government at 6,500,000 dollars.

The following is an account of the trade between Cuba and other countries in 1828, as ascertained by the customhouse returns.

The island is subject to the King of Spain, and for the purposes of government is divided into two political divisions. That on the west is under the immediate control of the captain-general residing at Havanna. The other is under a governor appointed by the king, but subject in many respects to the captain-general.. It is also divided into two ecclesiastical jurisdictions, the one governed by an archbishop, who resides at St Jago, and the other by a bishop, who resides at Havanna. These jurisdictions have their limits twenty leagues east of the town of Espiritu Santo. Since the beginning of 1826, the island has been divided, for the purpose of defence, into three military departments; these again are subdivided into districts, and the districts into sections. The departments are under a general officer. The eastern department embraces the districts of St Jago, Baracoa, Holguin, Jibara, Jiguani, Cobre, Tiguabos, Manzanillo, and Bayamo; the central, those of Puerto Principe, Nuevitas, Trinidad, Espiritu Santo, Villa de Santa Clara, and St Juan de los Remedios; the western, those of Havanna, St Antonio de Compostella, St Felipe, St Jago del Bejucal, St Antonio Abad de los Banos, Guanajay, Guanabacoa, Filipina, Jaruco, Guines, Ma-tanzas, and Guamutas. These divisions serve as limits for the jurisdictions of the three intendancies which are established for the collection and administration of the public revenue, and the heads of which reside at Havanna, Puerto Principe, and St Iago, the capital cities of the three departments. Education is at a very low ebb in Cuba, but according to Abbot’s Letters^ published at Boston in 1829, it is improving. The morals of the people are loose, the police is weak or inactive, and murders are frequent. The laws are numerous and contradictory; and much bribery and corruption prevail in the administration of justice. In 1821 the importation of slaves was prohibited by law; and although it is yet carried on and tolerated by the authorities of Cuba, in spite of the laws against it, there is no doubt that it has diminished considerably in consequence of the efforts and vigilance of the English cruisers. The emancipation of Colombia, Mexico, and the Spanish part of St Domingo, has brought to Cuba almost all the Spaniards who were settled in those countries, together with many of the Creoles. The number of the aboriginal population cannot now be ascertained. The European and African population in 1511 did not include more than 300 persons. Within the last fifty-two years, the population has more than quadrupled. The coloured population has increased faster than the white. The following is a classification of the population of Cuba, according to the census of 1775 and that of 1827 :—

It is generally believed that the inhabitants are not desirous of separating themselves from the Spanish government; partly because Spain treats them tolerably well, and partly because of the distracted condition in which they behold those parts of Spanish America which have thrown off the Spanish yoke. A conspiracy was, however, discovered in 1830, which had for its object the independence of the island. A ridiculous expedition was sent from Cuba in 1829 against Mexico, under General Barradas, who was forced to capitulate at Tampico on the 11th of September of the same year. The principal cities of the island are the capital, Havanna, with 237,828 inhabitants, St Iago de Cuba, St Salvador, St Carlos de Mantanzas, St Maria de Puerto, Principe, &c.

Cuba was discovered in 1492 by Christopher Columbus. In 1511 Don Diego Velasquez sailed from St Domingo, with four vessels, for the conquest of the island. He landed on the 25th of July, near the Bay of St Iago, to which he gave its name. The natives, commanded by the∣ cacique Hatney, who had fled from St Domingo, his native country, on account of the cruelties of the Spaniards,! in vain endeavoured to oppose the progress of the invaders. The noise of the fire-arms was sufficient to disperse the∣ poor Indians. Hatney was taken prisoner, and burned alive. This diabolical act filled the rest of the caciques with terror; and they hastened to pay homage to the conqueror, who encountered no more opposition. The subjugation of the island was effected without the loss of a single man to the Spaniards. The latter, not finding! the mines sufficiently rich to repay their being wrought, gradually exterminated the natives who could not be employed. After the conquest of Cuba, more than two centuries elapsed without the occurrence of any memorable event. In 1741, the English admiral Vernon entered the Bay of Guantanamo, which he named Cumberland. He landed his troops twenty miles up the river, where theyj [7:7:527] remained in perfect inaction until November, and then returned to Jamaica, whence they had set out. Notwithstanding the bad success of this expedition, the idea of conquering Cuba was not relinquished by the British. In 1762 a formidable expedition was sent from England, which joined that in the West Indies, and entered Havanna on the 6th of June. They were also joined by troops from America; and notwithstanding a stout resistance on the part of the Spaniards, the latter were compelled to surrender on the 13th of August. In the year following, however, the island was restored to Spain, in exchange for the Floridas. Since that period, Cuba has remained a Spanish island, and has been so well fortified that it is not now in much danger from any attack that can be made upon it. The forces of the island consist of 9886 regular troops, and 14,560 militia. The navy contains two seventy-fours, three frigates of fifty guns, one of forty, one sloop of war, and two brigs of twcnty-two guns each, one brig of twenty, one of sixteen, and six schooners mounting thirteen guns.
