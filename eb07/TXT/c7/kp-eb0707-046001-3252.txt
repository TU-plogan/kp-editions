CREDITON, a market-town of the hundred of that name, in Devonshire, 180 miles from London, and seven from Exeter. It is situated on the river Creedy, which turns some manufacturing and mealing mills. It is in a fertile district, and was formerly a place of great trade in making serges for Spain; but that trade has declined or removed to the northern counties. The church, formerly a cathedral, is a noble structure. There is a well-supplied market, which is held on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 5028, in 1821 to 5515, and in 1831 to 5922.
