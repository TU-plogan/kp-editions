CORBET, Richard, bishop of Norwich, and a poet of some note, was born at Ewell, in Surrey, towards the latter end of the sixteenth century, and educated at Oxford, where he was esteemed one of the most celebrated wits of the university. Having entered into holy orders, he became a popular preacher, and was made chaplain to King James I. Alter receiving several preferments in the church, he was in 1629 appointed Bishop of Oxford, and in 1632 translated to the see of Norwich. He was very hospitable, [7:7:322]and a generous encourager of public designs. He died in 1635. His poems were not printed till after his death, namely, in 1648, 8vo, and in 1672, 12mo, under the title ' of Poemata Stromata. His versification is easy, but generally prosaic, and he displays more levity than exactly comports with the episcopal character; but his poems were written long before his promotion, and probably never intended for publication.
