CLOYNE, a town of Ireland, in the county of Cork, and province of Munster. It is but a small place, though an episcopal residence. A church was built, and a bishopric erected here, by St Colman, who died on the 4th of November 604; and an abbey was also founded in 707. In 1430 the bishopric was united to that of Cork; but since the year 1678 this see has been governed by its own prelates, one of whom was the celebrated Berkeley. The population of the town amounts to 1847.
