CULROSS, a royal burgh of Scotland, in the county of Fife, is situated on the northern shore of the Frith of Forth, about twenty-two miles from Edinburgh. This place is of considerable antiquity, and in ancient times possessed a good deal of shipping, and enjoyed a respectable share of maritime commerce, but this traffic has now almost entirely vanished. The antiquities in the vicinity .of Culross are .worthy of notice. At the east end are the ruins of St Mungoâ€™s chapel; near these, on a rising ground, are the remains of a monastery built in 1217 by Malcolm earl of Fife. The chancel and tower of this monastery form a part of the present church; and farther west are the ruins of the old church, which, with the ground around it, is still used as a burying place. In 1821 the population of the town and parish was 1434, and in 1831, 1488.
