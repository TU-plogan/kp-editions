CONFESSION, among divines, the verbal acknowledgment which a Christian makes of his sins.

Among the Jews it was the custom, on the annual feast of expiation, for the high priest to make confession of sins to God in the name of the whole people. And besides this general confession, the Jews were enjoined, if their sins were a breach of the first table of the law, to make confession of them to God; but violations of the second table were to be acknowledged to their brethren. The confessions of the primitive Christians were all voluntary, and not imposed on them by any laws of the church; yet private confession was not only allowed, but encouraged.

The Roman Catholic church not only requires confession as a duty, but has advanced it to the dignity of a sacrament. This confession, which is made to the priest, is private and auricular; and he is bound not to reveal it under pain of the highest punishment.
