COLAR, a small district in the eastern extremity of the Mysore rajah’s territories, situated between the 13th and 14th degrees of north latitude, and intersected by the 78th degree of east longitude. This country is bounded on the cast by the British district of Chittor. It is in general level, but it contains many bare rocky hills at considerable distances, with level ground between them. The hills occupy three fourths of the land, and towards Colar are very extensive. The road approaching to this place from the east is between two immense piles of bare granite, crumbling into fragments that roll down into the plain. The country is poorly watered, and suffers from the want of rain. Rice forms a large proportion of its produce. It produces also various other grains, which are cultivated on the dry field, besides sugar, cotton, tobacco, and betel leaf. The tamarind, pipal, mango, &c. thrive well. In the country round the town of Colar the land is irrigated entirely by means of reservoirs. There is a good deal of garden cultivation; at Colar the gardens are in bad order, but at some other places they are very neat. The soil is a black rich mould, and it is watered by machines. Nine miles east of Boodicotta, gold dust is found, and also in some other parts. Salt is also made by scraping off the surface of the earth during the dry season, and afterwards boiling and filtering it. The inhabitants are poor, and their houses have a miserable appearance, being hidden entirely by the surrounding walls, which present nothing to the view but a brown dusky mud. The trade and manufactures were entirely ruined by Tippoo, who prohibited all intercourse with his enemies’ dominions; but they are now on the increase, and are in a much better state than they were in the reign of Hyder.

Colar, a town and fortress, the capital of the above district. The town is defended by a strong mud fort, which was repairing when it was visited by Dr Buchanan; it has two very lofty walls, and in the town a cavalier of stone, which commands all the works. It is also defended by a deep ditch. The town contains 7Ö0 houses, many of which are inhabited by weavers. It was the birth-place of Hyder Ali, whose father lived and died in it. A handsome mausoleum was erected to his memory by his son; and near it a mosque, and a college of Mussulman priests, with a proper establishment of musicians, were endowed to pray for the repose of his soul, and are still supported by the British government. On the hill north from the town was formerly a hill fort, in which resided for some time Cossim Khan, the general of Aurungzebe, who first carried the Mussulman authority to the south of the river Krishna. Colar was the capital of one of the seven districts into which that general divided his conquests. It is forty miles east-north-east from Bangalore. Long. 78. 19. E. Lat. 13. 8. N.
