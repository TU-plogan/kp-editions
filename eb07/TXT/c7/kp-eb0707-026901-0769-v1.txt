CONSTANCE, a city of the grand duchy of Baden, on the north-west end of the lake of that name or the Bodensee, near to where the Rhine issues forth. It is a walled town, the chief place of the district, but with very little commerce of any kind. It contains 778 houses and 4503 inhabitants. This place is celebrated on account of the ecclesiastical council held here in 1417, at which John Huss and Jerome of Prague were condemned to death. The lake from which this city takes its name, and which divides the Wirtemburg and Baden dominions from the Swiss cantons, is thirty-six miles in length and twelve in breadth. The depth varies from 100 to 350 fathoms. » It was formerly more abundantly stocked with fish than it is at present; but the trouts caught in it are prized above all others. The city is in long. 9.2. 55. E. and lat. 47.36.10. N.
