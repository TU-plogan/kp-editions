COLAPOOR, a small independent Mahratta state, on the western coast of India, between the 15th and 17th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the south by the Portuguese territory of Goa, on the east and north by the dominions of the Pcshwa, and on the w est by the sea. The country is well watered by many rivers, and is favourable to the production of rice, of which great quantities are cultivated. Its principal towns are Vingorla and Rarec, both sea-ports. About the year 1670 this country was overrun by the celebrated Sevajee, and in 1684 by the armies of Aurungzebe, who ravaged the country, and burned the town of Víngorla. In 1804 the maritime trade of India was greatly annoyed by pirates, who issued from the ports of the rajah: they were in consequence blockaded by the Company’s cruizers, and payment was demanded for all the damage which had been occasioned by these piracies. At the same time two of the most daring depredators took refuge with the rajah, after their predatory bands had been dispersed by General Wellesley. It was in consequence intimated to him that he would be held responsible for the good behaviour of those persons to whom he had granted an asylum, and that unless he restrained their depredations his own territory would be invaded. This intimation had the desired effect, and the adjacent territories have in consequence enjoyed a degree of tranquillity to which they had long been unaccustomed.
