COSSIMBAZAR, a large manufacturing town of Hindustan, in the province of Bengal, nearly adjoining the southern suburbs of Moorshedabad, of which it may be considered as the port. It is situated on the south-east bank of the Bhagarutty river, and is one of the largest trading towns in Bengal. âˆ™ It has long been celebrated for its silk manufactures, and for the manufacture of stockings, which are all knit by the women and children in the vicinity, and are in the highest repute. The neighbourhood abounds with mulberry trees, on which silk worms are fed; and the quantity of silk produced not only supplies all that is consumed in the manufacture of carpets, satins, and other stuffs, but also leaves a surplus for exportation. The island of Cossimbazar, or the tract encompassed by the Bhagarutty, Jellingy, and Ganges rivers, is a perfectly flat bed of sand; but the annual overflow of the river leaves a rich deposit, and fertilizes this otherwise unproductive tract. This island abounds with all descriptions of game, from the tiger and the boar to the inferior sorts, such as hare, deer, partridge, &c. and all sorts of aquatic birds. The Cossimbazar river is named the Bhagarutty or Bhagirathi, and is reckoned a sacred branch of the Ganges. During the rainy season Cossimbazar has a most extensive water communication, which affords great facilities for its trade. The East India Company had stationed agents here at a very early period for the purchase of goods, but their factory was not built till 1706. In 1756 it was taken and plundered. Long. S8. 15. E.
