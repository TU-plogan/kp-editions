COPHIT, Copti, or Copiits, a name given to the Christians of Egypt, who are of the sect of Jacobites, or rather Cobites, and descended from the ancient native population of the country.

The critics are much divided as to the origin and orthography of the word. Some write it Cophti or Copti, others Cophtites, Cophtitae, Copts, and so on. Scaliger derives the name from Coptos, anciently the metropolis of the Thebaid. Kireher, however, maintains that the word originally signifies “cut” or “circumserįþed,” and that it was given to these people because of their practice of eir-cumeising; which is evidently absurd, as circumcision could neither be a distinction nor a reproach in a country where the rite was generally practised. Scaliger afterwards changed his opinion, and derived the word from A/yucrro¢ (quasi dicas Aι-l’OΠ-τoς) Egypt, by retrenching the first syllable; and this is the true etymology, GOP or KOP being manifestly the basis or root of the word which the Greeks wrote A∕yυττos, and probably at .first A/yoffro¢. For an account of the state of the Coptic population of Egypt, see the article Egypt.
