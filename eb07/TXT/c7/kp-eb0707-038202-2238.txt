CORYMBUS properly signifies a eluster of ivy berries. Among botanists it is a mode of flowering, in which the lesser or partial flower-stalks are produced along the common stalk on both sides; and, though of unequal lengths, rise to the same height, so as to form a flat and even surface at the top.
