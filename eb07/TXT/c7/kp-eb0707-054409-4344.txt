CUNITZ, or Cunitia, Maria, the eldest daughter of Hendric Cunitz, doctor of medicine in Silesia, was born about the beginning of the seventeenth century. She learned languages with amazing facility, and understood Polish, German, French, Italian, Latin, Greek,and Hebrew. She attained a knowledge of the sciences with equal ease, and was skilled in history, physic, poetry, painting, and music: and yet these were only her amusements; for she applied herself to the mathematics, and to astronomy, which she made her principal study,and wasranked amongst the ablest astronomers of her time. Her astronomical tables, which acquired her a prodigious reputation, were printed in Latin and German, and dedicated to the Emperor Ferdinand III. She married Elias de Lewin, M.D. and died at Pistehen in the year 1664.
