CORINGA, a sea-port of Hindustan, in the Northern Circars, and district of Rajamundry, situated on the western side of the bay of Bengal. It is the best port on the coast of Coromandel, and affords the only smooth water on that coast in the south-west monsoon, Point Godavery projecting out to the southward, and breaking the swell from the sea. A wet dock has lately been constructed, capable of admitting a frigate. It carries on a considerable trade with Bengal and Pegu; and the principal exports are teak wood and salt to the former, and piece goods to the latter. In 1787 a dreadful storm and inundation of the sea occurred at this place, which swept away the greater part of the town, and almost the whole inhabitants; and from this calamity it has scarcely yet recovered. The French had an establishment here before any other Europeans; and some part of their factory still remains. The English took possession of the place in 1759, and established their factory five miles to the south of Coringa. Long. 82. 29. Eâˆ™ Lat. 16. 49. N.
