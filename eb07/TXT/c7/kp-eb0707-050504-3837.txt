CRYSTAL, in its original import, signifies ice. It was afterwards applied to rock-crystal, or crystallized siliceous earth; for the ancients, according to Pliny, regarded that body as water which had been congealed by the action of cold.

Crystal, a species of stone belonging to the quartz or siliceous genus. See Mineralogy.
