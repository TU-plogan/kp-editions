CUENCA, a province of New Castille, in Spain, of which division it occupies the most eastern part. It is a very mountainous country in general, though between the ridges of the hills several rivers run, within the influence of which some degree of fertility exists. It lies between 38° 55' and 41° 22' north latitude; its extent is 945 square leagues; and its population is 294,290 souls,· or 311 to the square league. It is the most thinly peopled of any part of the peninsula, the average population of which is 690 to the league.

The rivers Xucar, Cabriel, Guađiela, and Gallo, run through the province, and discharge their waters into the Tagus. The hills abound with timber well calculated for the construction of ships, but the expense of conveyance forbids its being extensively applied to that use. Considerable flocks of Merino sheep are depastured in the spring and summer in this province, and the wool produced in it is considered as the finest in all Spain. The capital city, Cucnça, is situated in a very barren country, and a cold dry climate; it is near the river Xucar, and is extensive, containing 12,000 inhabitants. It is the see of a bishop, and has a most sumptuous cathedral, and several other rich churches and convents. The inhabitants are said to have more of the unmixed ancient Castilian character than the people of any other large town in Spain. The city is situated in long. 2. 16. W. and lat. 40. 7. N.

Branches of the Sierras Molina, Cuença, and Campillos, run through the province. It contains 4350 horses, 26,000 mules, 26,035 asses, 22,780 oxen and cows, 922,000 sheep, 94,000 goats, and 18,000 swine. Besides, the wool, the flax, and esparto of this province are good; it possesses also some soap, glass, iron, porcelain, and esparto manufactories. It contains two cities, 240 towns, and thirtyseven villages. This province enjoys the privileges and laws of Castille, and is under the captain-general of Madrid. In the capital there is a tribunal of the inquisition established. There are several woollen and linen manufactories, and paper mills.
