CORNARO, Luigi, a Venetian of noble extraction, memorable for having lived in a healthful and active condition till above a hundred years of age, in consequence of observing a rigid course of temperance. By the ill conduct of some of his relations he was deprived of the dignity of nobility in Venice; and seeing himself excluded from all employments under the republic, he settled at Padua. In his youth he was of a weak constitution, and by irregular indulgence had reduced himself, at about forty years of age, to the brink of the grave, under a complication of disorders. When at this extremity, he was told that he had no other chance for his life but by becoming sober and temperate. Being wise enough to adopt the wholesome counsel given him,he reduced himself to a regimen of which there are very few examples. Heallowed hirnselfnomore than twelve ounces of food and fourteen ounces of liquor each day; which became so habitual to him, that when he was above seventy years of age, the experiment of adding two ounces to each by the advice of his friends, had like to have proved fatal to him. At eighty-three he wrote a treatise which has been translated into English, and often printed, entitled Sure and certain Methods of attaining a Long and Healthful Life ; in which he relates his own story, and extols temperance with becoming enthusiasm. At length the yolk of an egg became sufficient for a meal, and sometimes for two, until he died, with much composure, at Padua, in 1566. A writer in the Spectator (No. 195) confirms the fact from the authority of the Venetian ambassador at that time, who was a descendant of the Cornaro family.
