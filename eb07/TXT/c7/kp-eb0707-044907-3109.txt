CRASIS (from ×ioavvυμι, to mix or temper), the temper of the blood peculiar to every constitution.

Crasis, in Grammar, is a figure by which two different letters are either contracted into one long letter or a diphthong. Such, for instance, is οφ ∣ ς for οφ ∣ ες ; αλτιΰη for aλrιDsa ; τsrχρυς for τειχεος, &c.; where ∣ and s are contracted into ι ; and ĩ and α into r ∣ ; and e and o into oυ.
