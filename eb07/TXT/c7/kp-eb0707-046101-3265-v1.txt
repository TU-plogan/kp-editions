CREFELD, a circle in the Prussian province of Juliers-Cleeve-Berg, extending over 109 square miles, and comprising five cities, one market-town, twenty-two villages, and 36,094 inhabitants, who are among the most industrious of any of the subjects of Prussia.

Crefeld, a city, the capital of the circle of the same name. It is a walled town, well built, though in a marshy situation, and contains churches of the different religious confessions. The inhabitants in 1817 were 14,791; but since that time they are calculated to have increased to upwards of 20,000. Various manufactures are carried on in cotton, linen, woollen, and silk; but the latter has more especially been extended of late years, and the produce of their looms rivals that of Lyons, of Spittalfields, and of Coventry, in the London shops. The city and its inhabitants, in their cleanliness, industry, and economy, bear a stronger resemblance to the Hollanders than to the Germans. Like the former, they cultivate all culinary vegetables extensively, and around the city there are more than 2000 market gardeners.
