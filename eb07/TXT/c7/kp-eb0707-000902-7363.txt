It was first settled in 1610 by the Portuguese; but they were dislodged a few years afterwards by the Dutch, who were in their turn ejected in 1661 by the British, in whose hands the place has remained ever since. It is irregularly built, and dirty; the houses are of clay, and generally of a square shape. The town is walled, and possesses a fort. The population amounts to about 8000. Long. 22. W. Lat. 5. 18.
