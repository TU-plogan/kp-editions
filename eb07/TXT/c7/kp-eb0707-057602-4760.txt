CYRANO, Bergerac, a French author, born in Gascony about the year 1620. He first entered into the army, where his natural courage engaged him frequently in duels, which, together with other rash actions, procured him the derisive title of the Intrepid ; but the little prospect he saw of preferment made him renounce the trade of war for the exercise of wit. His comic histories of the states and empires in the sun and moon, prove him to have been well acquainted with the Cartesian philosophy, and to have had a lively imagination. Lord Orrery classes him with Swift for his turn of humour, which, he says, the latter adopted and pursued.
