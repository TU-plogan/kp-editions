CLOISTER, a habitation surrounded with walls, and inhabited by canons or religious persons. In a more general sense, cloister is used for a monastery of religious persons of either sex. In a more restricted sense, cloister is used for the principal part of a regular monastery, consisting of a square built around, which is ordinarily between the church, the chapter-house, and the refectory, and over which is the dormitory. The cloisters served for several purposes in the ancient monasteries. Petrus Blesensis observes that it was there the monks held their lectures. The lecture of morality was at the north side, next the church; the school was on the west, and the chapter-house on the east; while spiritual meditation, and the like, were reserved for the church. Lanfranc observes that the proper use of the cloister was for the monks to meet in and converse together, at certain hours of the day. The form of the cloister was square; and it had its name claustrum, from claudo, “I shut or close as being inclosed on its four sides with buildings. Hence, in architecture, a building is still said to be in the form of a cloister when there are buildings on each of the four sides of the court.
