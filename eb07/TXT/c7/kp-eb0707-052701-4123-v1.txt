CUBE, in Geometry, a solid body consisting of six equal sides.

CuBE∙Iioot of any number or quantity is a number or quantity which, if multiplied into itself, and then again the product thence arising by the same number or quantity, being the cube-root, the last product shall be equal to the number or quantity of which it is the cube-root. Thus 2 is the cube-root of 8; because two times two is 4, and two times four is 8; and a + b is the cube-root of α 3 + 3 ααb + 3 abb + 6 3 .
