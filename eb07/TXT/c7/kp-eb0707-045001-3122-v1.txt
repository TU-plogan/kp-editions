CRATES, of Thebes, an ancient philosopher, was the disciple of Diogenes the Cynic. It is said by some that he threw all his money into the sea, that he might the more freely apply himself to the study of philosophy; but others assert that he placed it in another person’s hands, with orders to give it to his children if they should happen to be fools. For, said Crates, if they should be philosophers, they will have no need of it; in which case it was to be given to the people. He flourished about 328 years before Christ.

He must not be confounded with Crates, an Academic philosopher, the disciple and friend of Polemon. The latter had Arcesilaus and other celebrated philosophers for his disciples, and flourished about 300 years before Christ.
