CONRAD, the second of that name, was elected Emperor of Germany in 1004. He was obliged to take the field against the German dukes who had revolted against him; and he put Ernest, duke of Suabia, under the ban of the empire. As this is one of the earliest instances of such a proscription, the formula is inserted here on account of its singularity. “We declare thy wife a widow, thy children orphans; and we send thee, in the name of the devil, to the four corners of the world.” It was during the reign of this prince that the German fiefs became hereditary. He died in 1039.

Conrad, the third of the name, was Emperor of Germany in 1138. The Duke of Bavaria having opposed his election, was put under the ban of the empire, and deprived of his duchy, a disgrace which he could not survive. The Margrave of Austria was ordered by the emperor to take possession of Bavaria; but Weist, uncle of the deceased duke, attacked him, and was defeated near the castle of Winsburg. The battle fought upon this occasion is famous in history, as having given rise to the party names of Gueįfs and Ghibbelines, afterwards assumed in Italy. The parole of the day with the Bavarians was Wdsti, from the name of their general; that of the Imperialists Werblingen, from a small village where Frederick, duke of Suabia, their commander, had been nursed: and by degrees these names served to distinguish the two parties; the Italians, who could not accustom themselves to such rough words, having formed from them their Guelfs and Ghibbelines. Conrad died in 1152.

Conrad of Lichtenau, or Abbas Uspergensis, was author of a chronology from the creation till 1229, continued by an anonymous writer till the reign of Charles V. He collected a fine library, and died about the year 1240.
