COPENHAGEN, the capital of the Danish dominions. It is situated on the Baltic Sea, on both sides of the narrow strait which separates the island of Arnack from Zealand. It contains a population of 103,166 individuals, including 2442 Jews, and the military, amounting to 4000. It is probably an ancient city, but there arc no notices of it earlier than 1043, when it came into the hands of a bishop, whose successors, in 1168, formed the haven and fortified it.

Copenhagen is chiefly built upon land which has been recovered from the sea, and is consequently a flat place, and has canals navigable for large vessels, which extend to the centre of the city. The trade is considerable with most .parts of the world; and it is the naval arsenal where ships of war are built and repaired, and where the national military and marine stores are kept. It is a beautiful city, [7:7:308] with large squares, broad streets, and respectable buildings, both public and private. Being situated in a fertile and highly cultivated district, the markets are well and cheaply supplied with every necessary of domestic produce. It is well supplied with fresh water, which is conveyed by pipes from two reservoirs near the city, and another about two miles distant. The institutions for the poor, for education, for medical instruction, and for quarantine, are well planned; and the police is well regulated. The university of Copenhagen numbers upwards of thirty professors, and from seven to eight hundred students. It is well endowed with estates, as well as with funded property, from which stipends are paid, and money issued to pay the expenses of travellers in distant countries.

It has a botanical garden, an astronomical observatory, a surgical and veterinary school, an academy for the fine arts, and a large and valuable library. There are, too, different societies for the promotion of different branches of knowledge. The collections of various kinds are very respectable; and the royal library consists of nearly 400,000 volumes. The museums of natural history, of anatomy, of geography, of mineralogy, of antiquities, and of ancient coins, are rich in their respective kinds of treasures. There are several collections of paintings, among which those in the palace are by the first foreign, and some excellent ones by Danish artists. The collection of copperplates in the royal library consists of 2G7 volumes, containing more than 81,000 impressions.

The royal palace in the centre of the city, begun after the fire in 1794, is not yet quite completed. It is a magnificent pile, being a square of 370 feet, 114 feet in height, built on a foundation of 10,000 piles. The church within it is a most beautiful place of worship. Many of the churches, and most of the official buildings, display much taste and knowledge of architecture. If it were not for the climate, which is variable in an uncommon degree, few of the capital cities of Europe would form a more desirable place of residence. The winter is sometimes ‘excessively cold.
