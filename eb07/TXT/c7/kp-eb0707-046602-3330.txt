CREUX, a term in sculpture, used by the French, though not yet naturalized amongst us; but the want of a word of equal import in English pleads strongly for its admission into our language.

, Creux originally signifies a hollow, cavity, or pit, out of which something has been sçooped; and hence it is used to denote that kind of sculpture and engraving where the lines and figures are cut and formed within the face or [7:7:467]plane of the plate or matter engraven on; in which sense it stands opposed to relievo, where the lines and figures ’are embossed, and appear prominent above the surface of the matter.
