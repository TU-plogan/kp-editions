CORPORAL, a rank and file man, with superior pay to that of the common soldiers, and nominal rank under a Serjeant, who has charge over one of the divisions or squads of the company, places and relieves sentinels, and keeps good order in the corps-de-garde. He also receives the word from the inferior rounds which pass by his corps-de-garde.
[7:7:374]

Corporal of a Ship of War, an officer under the master at arms, employed to teach the officers the exercise of small arms, or of musketry; to attend at the gangway on entering ports; and to observe that no spirituous liquors are brought into the ship, unless by express leave from the officers. He is also to extinguish the fire and candles at eight oâ€™clock in winter, and nine in summer, when the evening gun is fired; and to walk frequently down in the lower decks in his watch, to see that there are no lights but such as are under the charge of proper sentinels.
