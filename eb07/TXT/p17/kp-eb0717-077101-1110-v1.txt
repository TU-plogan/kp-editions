PITTENWEEM, a royal burgh and seaport town on the Frith of Forth, in the parish of the same name, and on the east coast of Fifeshire. It is situated on gently-elevated ground, which overhangs the harbour, and consists of an irregular main street, having the form of an oblong square, from which a number of by-streets stretch out along the public roads. The houses are chiefly of old date, with the exception of a neat range of respectable cottages on the north side of the town.- In the main street are situated the town-house, the parish church (an old ungainly structure, with a turreted spire), and all that remains of the ancient priory of PittenWeem. In addition to the ruins of the priory, there is a quadrangular range of most antique houses, which are stated to have been the residences of the prior and other superior officers of the establishment. This ancient edifice is now included within the private property of a gentleman, who resides in a part of it. The town derives its name from a spacious cave, called a weem, hollowed out, partly by the action of the waves, and partly by art, from the rock on which stands the residence alluded to. There is also a communication between the prior’s house and the cave, by means of a spiral stair, the orifice of which has, however, been lately built up. Besides the established church, there is an Episcopalian chapel, and one or two dissenting places of worship. Pittenweem was erected into a royal burgh in the year 1542, and, like all the other Fifeshire burghs, had a thriving and extensive trade, which was carried on with success till the time of the union, from which date its importance and its trade have alike declined. It was also a great fishing station, and much coal was once wrought here; but both are now considerably decreased. The harbour is very much exposed to easterly winds but it has been improved so far as the means of the town will allow, and is now rather an extensive work. The revenue of the burgh amounts to above L.550, and its expenditure to nearly the same amount. In the year 1833, the town was in debt to the amount of L.1621 sterling. The burgh is governed by a council, consisting of four bailies,· a treasurer, and nineteen councillors; and, with St Andrews, the two Anstruth- 6rs, Crail, Cupar, and Kilrenny, it returns a member to parliament. The population in 1821 amounted to 1200, and in 1831 to 1317.
