PIPLEY, a small town of Hindustan, in the province of Orissa and district of Mohurbunge. It is situated on the eastern bank of the Subanreeka River, about ten miles from the sea. It was with this port, which was considered one of the best in Bengal, that the English were permitted to trade by Shah Jehan; but the trade was afterwards transferred to the Hooghly River. The floods have now washed away part of the town, and formed a dangerous bar ,in the river, in consequence of which the merchants have removed to Ballasore. Pipley is twenty-two miles northeast from Ballasore. Long. 87. 25. E. Lat. 21. 42. N.

Pipley, a town in the province of Orissa and district of Cuttack, thirty miles south from Cuttack. Long. 86. 8. E. Lat. 20. 8. N.
