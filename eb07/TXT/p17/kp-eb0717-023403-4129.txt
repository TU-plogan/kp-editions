PERIPATETICS, philosophers, followers of Aristotle, and supporters of the peripatetic philosophy, called also Aristotelians. Cicero says that Plato left two excellent disciples, Xenocrates and Aristotle, who founded two sects, which only differed in name; the former took the appellation of Academics, being those who continued to hold their conferences in the Academy, as Plato had done before; the latter, who followed Aristotle, were called Peripatetics, from πεg∕πατεω, I walk, because they disputed walking in the Lyceum. (See Aristotle and Aristotelian Philosophy.)
