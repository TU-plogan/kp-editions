PAROLE, in a military sense, the promise made by a prisoner of war, when he has leave to go anywhere, of returning at a time appointed, if not exchanged.

Parole means also a word given out every day in orders by the commanding officer, both in camp and in garrison, for the purpose of distinguishing friends from enemies.
