PHILIPPINES. This archipelago, in the Eastern Seas, extends from the fifth to the twentieth degree of north latitude, and consists of a great number of islands of various sizes, and many of which are but little known. The largest of the group is Luzon or Luconia; and to the south lie the other principal islands, namely, Mindoro, Panay, Marindique, Negros, Masbate, Zebu, Bohol, Leyte, Samar, and Magindanao. There are, besides, several smaller ones, and they are all, nominally at least, subordinate to the Spanish government at Manilla; but its power does not extend over all parts of the islands. There are many remote· places to which the Spaniards have never been able to penetrate. Amongst their fastnesses and mountains, the natives roam in a state of barbarous independence, and wage an inveterate war against their Spanish oppressors. These islands, which are partially colonized, pay tribute, which is collected by the Spanish magistrates in the provinces or districts into which the country is subdivided. The appellation of Philippines was given to them in compliment to Philip II. of Spain, who at the time of their subjugation was prince of the Asturias. ’

The Philippines, from their situation, possess a tropical climate, and are subject to the periodical rains, though the [7:17:348]heats are moderated by the breeze from the sea. The rains generally commence in May, and last till September, but sometimes they are protracted to the beginning of December; from which latter period till the succeeding May the weather is delightful, being a perpetual spring. The vegetation is luxuriant, owing to the copious rains; the trees are constantly covered with leaves, and the soil with verdure, so that it is difficult to keep the land clear of weeds and insects. The winds which most commonly prevail are the north, the east, and the south-west, each of which continues for four months; the change of wind being attended with violent storms of thunder and lightning, and at times by whirlwinds. These storms rage occasionally with frightful violence, and blow from every point of the compass in the course of twenty-four hours, ravaging and destroying the country, and tearing up trees by the roots.

These islands, from their extent, their climate, and the fertility of their soil, would produce all sorts of colonial products, if there were adequate industry on the part of the inhabitants. Their chief production, however, is rice, which is the principal subsistence of the natives. They cultivate, besides the bread-fruit, beans, the cacavata, &c.; and the palm-tree is much attended to, as it yields a spirit and an oil, besides a sweetmeat named chanaca. The pith of the palm, the young shoots of the sugar-cane, green withes, and other succulents, serve as substitutes for rice to those who cannot procure anything better. The other products are different sorts of pulse, such as mangos, patani, kidney beans, and millet. They have not many fruit-trees, and they are, besides, of an indifferent quality, excepting the plantain, to which may be added the orange and the mango. The areca or betel-nut is also cultivated, and used in great quantities, both by Spaniards and by natives. The domestic animals are buffaloes, goats, pigs, ducks, and fowls. Horses and horned cattle, having been imported in great numbers by the Spaniards, have multiplied to such a degree that they now run wild in the mountains, without being claimed by any owner. Deer abound in the mountains, and all sorts of pigeons swarm in the fields, with other small birds, such as quails, a species of partridge, woodcocks, &c. The swallow which builds the edible bird-nests so much esteemed by the Chinese is found here. The surrounding seas yield abundant “up-plies of fish, which afford a wholesome nourishment to the inhabitants. The natives take a great delight in fishing, as it flatters their natural indolence, and gives them a supply of fish, which they prefer to flesh. Shells in great variety are found upon the shores; amongst these are the cowries, and the enormous kima cockle, so large as to hold a gallon, and used in the churches as vessels for containing holy water. They have also introduced sheep, as well as geese; and amongst vegetables, grapes, figs, wheat, pepper, cocoa, coffee, sugar, tobacco, and various sorts of plants, which have thriven remarkably well.

These islands contain many valuable mineral productions. In the interior there are mines of gold and of iron, but they are not worked, either from a deficiency of produce, or from the want of skill and industry amongst the inhabitants. Gold is also procured by washing the sand which is found in the mountain streams. At one place the gold mines are so indolently worked as scarcely to defray the expense. The mountains abound in excellent timber, both for ship and house building; and the bamboos are large and long. Some of them are of the thickness of a man’s thigh; and of these the native houses are constructed, after which they are covered with palm-leaves. The inhabitants also raise a little cotton for clothing, which is dyed with indigo, logwood, &c. The other productions of the Philippines which are articles of export, consist of wax, wild honey, amber, marble, tar, brimstone, and other lesser articles.

These islands, notwithstanding their natural fertility, continue in a very desolate state, which is owing partly to physical disadvantages, namely, the hurricanes, which sweep across the country with wide-wasting desolation, and to the destruction caused by rats, insects, and other vermin, which swarm in all parts, and are a great annoyance; partly also to the indolence of the natives, and to the intolerant and illiberal policy of the Spaniards. If the Chinese were encouraged by an enlightened government, they would settle in great numbers in these islands, and by their enterprise and industry would soon change the face of the country. These islands import a variety of piece-goods, especially ordinary long cloth, white, blue, and red; handkerchiefs of all kinds; chintz, principally dark grounds; Surat goods of most sorts, and all kinds of European cutlery and iron. The exports are the edible bird-nests, cassia, gold-dust, pepper, rattans, sago, tortoise-shell, wax, wild honey, amber, marble, tar, brimstone, and other articles of inferior note. The native Indians trade with each other for the different productions of their country, and employ gold as the medium of exchange. They likewise carry on a trade, though inconsiderable, with the Chinese and the Malays of Borneo, for flag-stones, copper, and articles of furniture. They are rude in their manners, and go about almost naked. These islands are visited by junks which come from several parts of the Chinese empire, bringing various articles for the consumption of the numerous resident Chinese, and silk-goods, lackeredjvare, china-ware, and teas, for the Acapulco ships. Cochineal, black wood, and dollars, constitute the returns. A trade is also carried on with the British settlements, though not to any great extent.

The Spaniards who first visited these islands spread the most extraordinary and incredible tales of their inhabitants, whom they described as divided into three classes, satyrs, men with tails, and sea-monsters. There were only in these islands two races, the Bisayan Indians, and that strange race of oriental negroes who still occupy the Papuan Isles. The latter roamed the mountains almost in a state of nature, merely covering the fore-part of the body with the bark of a tree, and living on roots, or on such animals as they could kill with their bows and arrows, and the flesh of which they devoured raw. In short, they were nearly on a level in their habits and manners with the beasts of the forest. The Spaniards have succeeded in domesticating them, and introducing amongst them an imperfect civilization. But their barbarous aversion to labour they have never been able to conquer. They are of opinion that the negroes were the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, and that the Bisayans were intruders. At present the Papuans are few in number, and consequently feeble; yet they retain all their original hatred to the Bisayans, whom they lie in wait for and murder without remorse. There are, besides, several other races who inhabit the Philippines, and differ in features, language, and manners. The Pampangos reside to the north of Manilla, as also the painted races termed by the Spaniards Pintados, from whom these islands were originally named Islas de Pintados. The Indians found by the Spaniards in these islands were of regular stature, and an olive complexion, with flat noses, large eyes, and long hair. They were all governed by their chiefs, and their different villages waged an everlasting war with each other. The prisoners on each side were condemned to slavery. In some places a race of Indians was discovered whiter than the others, the descendants, as is supposed, of Chinese who had been wrecked on the coasts, and who had intermarried with Indians. The tribes of Igorrates or Ilocas, in particular, have eyes resembling the Chinese. Their customs and usages mark a barbarous people. They have no fixed laws. Certain traditions are the only rules which they have for deciding civil suits; and criminal cases are [7:17:349]generally compounded for a sum of money, unless in cases of murder, where one tribe retaliates upon another, and a scene of bloody contention ensues. They are permitted to have only one wife. But the principal persons have several concubines, who are slaves. No great reformation of manners has been effected by the Spaniards, nor have they made any great progress in the conversion of the natives. The Tagala or Gala language is in general use throughout the Philippine Islands. The dialects are so many and various, that the inhabitants of one province are not intelligible in those of another; yet their language is all derived from one common stock. Their religion is a rude species of idolatry, and consists in frantic ceremonies and sacrifices to idols, of which the details would be of little interest.

These islands were discovered in 1521, by Magelhaens, who named them the Archipelago of St Lazarus. In 1565 they were taken possession of by a fleet which was despatched from Mexico in consequence of orders from Philip II. of Spain, and first stopped at the island of Zebu, which was soon wholly subdued. In 1570 a fleet sailed from the island of Panay for Luzon, and, after several engagements with the princes of the country, effected a settlement at the mouth of the Manilla River. In 1571 the Spanish admiral took possession of the town of Manilla, which he constituted the capital of the Spanish possessions in the Philippines, and proceeded in his reduction of the island under the Spanish authority. In 1574 the existence of the Spanish settlement was threatened by a Chinese pirate, who arrived with sixty-two junks; but, after many bloody engagements, he was expelled, and great part of his army destroyed. Towards the conclusion of the sixteenth century a considerable trade was openly carried on with Japan; and many rich cargoes were brought from that country to Manilla, which had now become an emporium of the trade with China, Java, the coast of Coromandel, and Mexico In 1590 the island of Sooloo was attacked by the Spaniards, but they were repulsed with great slaughter by the natives; nor could the Spanish maritime force make any impression on the Sooloo pirates, who have continued for nearly three centuries the scourge of these seas. The number of industrious Chinese had been daily increasing in the Philippines, and about the year 1639 they amounted to 30,000, most of whom were settled as cultivators. The Spaniards were always jealous of them, though they enriched the country by their industry; and that year, in consequence of suspected disaffection, they commenced a war against them, and made so dreadful a havoc amongst them, that in a short time their numbers were diminished to 7000, who surrendered at discretion. In 1757, the Chinese, who had again increased in the island, were all banished to their own country; and, to prevent their future establishment in the archipelago, the quarter of St Fernando was appropriated for the reception of such Chinese as should come to the island for the purposes of commerce, and regulations were made for their re-embarkation in good time, unless they should be in the mean time converted to the Christian religion, in which case they were permitted to settle as cultivators. In 1762, Manilla was attacked by a British fleet under Admiral Cornish and General Draper, and the place was stormed on the 5th of October. A capitulation was agreed upon next day, when, in order to redeem the city from general plunder, a ransom was agreed upon of four millions of dollars. Manilla was restored to the Spaniards at the peace of 1763, and has ever since remained in their possession. Besides Manilla and the larger establishments in Luzon, the Spaniards have many smaller settlements scattered over the islands to the southward; but such is the weakness of their government, that they have never been able to protect them against the attacks of the pirates who infest these seas. And so jealous of the natives are the Spanish rulers of these islands, that, though unable to defend them, they do not allow the natives’to possess arms, or any sort of iron, which is a royal monopoly. In the year 1809 they published a declaration of their adherence to Ferdinand VII. and opened their ports to the British; and since that period a free trade has been carried on to a considerable extent.
