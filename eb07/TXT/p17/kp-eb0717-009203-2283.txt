PARO, more properly Beni, a great river of South America, and one of the three principal streams which form the famous Madera. Of these, the Paro is the first or most western branch. It is formed of an infinite number of smaller streams, which, falling into it within a short distance of each other, soon constitute a very considerable body of water. They have their sources in the mountains of Pelechuco, Suches, Sorata, Challana, Songa, La Paz, Suri, and Cochabamba, which ranges form part of the snowy cordillera visible from the city of La Paz. The farthest to the west is the Tuche; then follow the Aten, the Ma-piri or Sorata, and the rivers which, descending from the celebrated mines of Tipuani, from Challana and from Co-roico, afterwards unite; then the Chulumani and its tributary streams, the Taniampaya, the Solacama, the Rio de la Paz, the Suri, and the Canamena; and, last of all, there is the Cotacajes. Owing to the rapidity with which these currents descend from the cordillera, their navigation is difficult and dangerous; but the Indians display such dexterity in the management of their balsas or rafts, that the traveller has nothing to fear. Below Reyes, in about 12½° of south latitude, the Paro receives various other streams from the west, as the Tequeje, the Masisi or Cavinas, and others. From its junction with the Marmore, in about 10° south latitude, both rivers lose their names in that of the Madera. The course of the Paro lies between 10° and 17° 30' of south latitude. It waters the whole of the district of Mosetenes, skirts the province of Moxos, and pursues its north-easterly course to the Marmore, through a fine level country. It would be extremely easy to unite the Beni with the Marmore, by means of the river Yacu-ma, which rises near Rcyes, situated on the eastern bank of the Beni, and running eastward through the flat country between them, falls into the Marmore close to the town of Santa Anna. The fall of the land is so imperceptible, and so nearly on a level with the horizon, that it does not exceed twenty feet in a distance of more than sixty leagues. In the range of country traversed by the Paro, there is every variety of hill and dale, and plains with abundant smaller streams of running water. The vast and extensive levels along the banks offer the finest situations for agricultural establishments, and for the maintenance of a numerous population. The great fertility of the country is evinced by the extraordinary growth of the trees, and the innumerable plants which are spontaneously produced, affording sustenance and shelter to a prodigious variety of the animal creation. The best lands are principally occupied by the Mosetencs Indians, who give their name to the country where they chiefly reside. About Reyes are the Maropas tribe of Indians; lower down are the Paca-quaras, and there are a number of others which do not require to be particularly mentioned. (r. r. r.)
