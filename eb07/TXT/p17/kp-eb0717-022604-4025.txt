PENTAPOLIS, a name given to the five cities, Sodom, Gomorrah, Adamah, Zeboim, and Zoar. They were all five condemned to utter destruction; but Lot interceded for the preservation of Zoar, otherwise called Bela. Sodom, Gomorrah, Adamah, and Zeboim, were consumed by fire from heaven; and in the place where they stood was formed the Lake Asphaltites, or the Dead Sea.
