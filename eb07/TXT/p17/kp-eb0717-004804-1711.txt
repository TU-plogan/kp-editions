PAPIAS, bishop of Hierapolis, a city of Phrygia, was the disciple of St John the Evangelist, and the companion of Polycarp. He composed a work in five books, entitled Expositions of the Discourses of our Lord, of which there are only some fragments now remaining. It was Papias who introduced the opinion of the Millenarians.
