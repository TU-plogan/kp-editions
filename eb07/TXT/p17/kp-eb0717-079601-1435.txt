PLANUDES, Maximus, a Greek monk of Constantinople, who, towards the end of the fourteenth century, published a collection of epigrams entitled Anthologia ; a Greek translation of Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses; a Life of Aesop, which is rather a romance than a history; and some other works. We know nothing more of him, than that he suffered some persecution on account of his attachment to the Latin church.
