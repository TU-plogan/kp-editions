+====================================================================+


PEYROUSE, or Perouse, John Francis Galoup de la, the celebrated but unfortunate French navigator, was born at Albi in the year 1741. His father intended to train him up to a maritime life, for which purpose he sent him, when very young, to the marine school, where he became enthusiastically attached to his profession, and ambitious to emulate the fame of the most celebrated navigators. He was appointed midshipman on the 19th of November 1756, and behaved with great bravery in that station, having been severely wounded in the engagement between Hawke and Conflans on the 20th of November 1759. The Formidable, in which he served, was taken, after a vigorous resistance; and it is probable that Perouse reaped some advantage from his acquaintance with British officers. He was promoted, on the 1st of October 1764, to the rank of lieutenant; and as he abhorred a life of ease and idleness, he contrived to be employed in six different ships of war during the peace between Great Britain and France. In 1776 he was promoted to the rank of master and commander. In 1779 he commanded the Amazone, belonging to the squadron of Vice-admiral Count d’Estaing; and when that officer engaged Admiral Byron, the duty assigned to La Pérouse was to carry the orders of the admiral to the whole of the line. He afterwards took the sloop Ariel, and contributed to the capture of the Experiment. In the year 1782, La Pérouse was sent with the Sceptre of seventy-four guns, and two frigates of thirty-six guns each, having some troops and field-pieces on board, to destroy the English settlements in Hudson’s Bay; a task which he easily accomplished, as there was nothing on shore to oppose the smallest force. When he had destroyed the settlements, having learned that some of the English had fled at his approach into the woods, he generously left them provisions, and arms to defend themselves against the savages. In the year 1785, he was appointed to the command of some ships commissioned for a voyage round the world, which unfortunately proved his last. Of this voyage, as far as it was accomplished, full accounts have already been published, from which it is manifest that Pérouse was admirably qualified to discharge such a trust. He was an experienced and skilful seaman; skilled in mathematical and physical science; uncorrupted by that false philosophy which disgraced many of his attendants; and capable of the utmost perseverance in every commendable pursuit. To these valuable qualities he added caution and courage, with a disposition truly benevolent towards the savages whom he visited. Most of the calamities attendant on the voyage, with the exception of the last, were occasioned by the disobedience of his officers, or their neglecting to follow his advice. The last despatches received from this excellent man were dated from Botany Bay, the 7th of February 1788; but since that period no authentic account of him has ever been obtained.
