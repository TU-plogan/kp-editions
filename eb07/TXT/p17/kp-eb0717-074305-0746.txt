PILGRIMAGE, a kind of religious discipline, which consists in taking a journey to some holy place in order to pray before the relics of some saint. Pilgrimages began to be made about the middle ages of the church; but they were most in vogue after the end of the eleventh century, when every one was smitten with a desire of visiting places of devotion, not excepting kings and princes themselves; and even bishops made no difficulty of being absent from their churches on the same account.^[1. It deserves to be remarked here that in the year 1428, under the reignf Henry VI. abundance of licenses were granted by the crown of England to captains of English ships, for carrying numbers of devout persons to the shrine of St James of Compostelŭ, in Spain; provided, however, that those pilgrims should first take an oath nbt to carry with them any thing prejudicial to England, nor to reveal any of its secrets, nor to take out with them any more gold or silver than what should be sufficient for their reasonable expenses. In this year there went out from England, on the same pilgrimage, from London 280, Bristol 200, Wevmouth l ζ >2, Dartmouth 90, Yarmouth 60, Jersey 60, Plymouth 40, Exeter 30, Poole 24, Ipswich 20; in all 926 persons. ]

Dr Johnson, in his Rasselas, gives us some observations on pilgrimage, which are so much to the purpose that we think we cannot do better than lay them before our readers. “Pilgrimage, like many other acts of piety, may be reasonable or superstitious according to the principles upon which it is performed. Long journeys in search of truth are not commanded. Truth, such as is necessary to the regulation of life, is always found where it is honestly sought: change of place is no natural cause of the increase of piety, for it inevitably produces dissipation of mind. Yet since men go every day to view the fields where great actions have been performed, and return with stronger impressions of the event, curiosity of the same kind may naturally dispose us to view that country where our religion had its beginning; and I believe no man surveys those awful scenes∙without some confirmation of holy resolutions. That the Supreme Being may be more easily propitiated in one place than in another, is the dream of idle superstition; but that some places may operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner, is an opinion which hourly experience will justify. He who supposes that his vices may be more successfully combated in Palestine, will perhaps find himself mistaken; yet he may go thither without folly: he who thinks they will be more freely pardoned, dishonours at once his reason and religion.”
