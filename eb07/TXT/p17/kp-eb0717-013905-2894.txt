PATRAS, a city of Greece, known to the ancients by the name of Patrae, and to the Turks by that of Botra. It is situated in the gulf of the same name, in a plain which is green, and to appearance well cultivated, and, especially to the northward, has extensive fruitful vineyards. The currants grow most abundantly,and areas fine as thoscofZante. Vast quantities of theni are annually exported. They are spread in bunches along the ground, and in eight days are sufficiently dried, when the stalks are picked off, and they are laid on the ground in heaps, in the field, ready for the purchasers. The city once contained 12,000 inhabitants, but they suffered much during the hostilities which terminated in their independence. It was the residence of the British consul-general of the Morea, and of agents from most of the European nations. It was formerly celebrated for [7:17:140]its fabrics of silk goods, but these have nearly disappeared, and there is scarcely any other manufacture except that of making leather saddle-bags. It has good anchorage, well sheltered, with from three to ten fathoms depth of water. Long. 21. 47. E. Lat. 38. 14. N.
