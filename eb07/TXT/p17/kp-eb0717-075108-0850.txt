PISTACIA, TuRPENTiNE-TREE,-Pzstoi⅛α-wwiand Mastich tree, a genus of plants belonging to the dioecia class. Pistachia-nuts are moderately large, containing a kernel of a pale greenish colour, covered with a reddish skin. They have a pleasant, sweet, unctuous taste, resembling that of almonds; and they abound with a sweet and well-tasted oil, which they yield in great abundance on being pressed after bruising them. They are reckoned amongst the analeptics, are wholesome and nutritive, and are by some esteemed very proper to be prescribed by way of restoratives, eaten in small quantity, to people emaciated by long illness.
