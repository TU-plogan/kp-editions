PHLEGON, a Greek historian, was a native of Tralles, in Lydia, and the freedman of the Emperor Hadrian (a. d. 117-138); and he is said to have published under his own name some works which were really the production of the emperor. He was the author of a history or chronicle, in sixteen books, which ended a. d. 141; and the loss of this work is the more to be regretted, as it would have probably furnished us with some curious information respecting the early times of the Christian church. A small fragment, entitled De Olympiis, on the origin and institution of the Olympic games, still remains; and in this work he notices the eclipse or wonderful darkness which occurred at the death of our Saviour. We have also two other works; De Longaevis libellus, in which he mentions a certain Faustus, aged 136, who was presented to the emperor; and De Rebus Mirabilibus liber, a collection of popular stories, and prodigies performed at Delphi, which are narrated by those who had been eye-witnesses. These fragments have been frequently published, but the edition of Bast (Halle, 1822, 8vo) includes all the valuable annotations of his predecessors.
