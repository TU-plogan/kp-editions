PINACIA, amongst the Athenians, were tablets of brass inscribed with the names of all those citizens in each tribe who were duly qualified and willing to become judges of the court of Areopagus. These tablets were cast into a vessel provided for the purpose, and the same number of beans, a hundred being white and all the rest black, were thrown into another. Then the names of the candidates and the beans were drawn out one by one, and they whose names were drawn out together with the white beans were elected judges or senators. In Solonâ€™s time there were only four tribes, each of which chose a hundred senators; but the number of tribes being afterwards increased, that of senators and judges was also increased to so many hundreds more.
