PISA, a portion of Italy, once an independent state, but now one of the provinces of the grand duchy of Tuscany. It forms the north-west portion of that duchy, except a small part of Arovalle, and the whole sea-coast to the cape of the Apennines, which divides it from Maremma. In it is included also the Isle of Elba with its dependencies, and [7:17:751]the ancient duchy of Piombino. It extends over 2614 square miles, is divided into three districts, and contains 345,000 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, situated near the mouth of the river Arno, in a marshy and unhealthy district, arising from its being enclosed on all sides by the moisture of Paduli del Lupo, Paduli di Stagno, and of the water of the Serchio. It is surrounded with thick walls, now converted into promenades, for which purpose they are better adapted than for defence. It is the see of an archbishop, whose cathedral and palace are magnificent structures; the tower of the former has attracted much attention, and been called the hanging tower, because it considerably declines from the perpendicular. There is a university, founded in 1309, which at present is resorted to by about 300 students, and has a library of 60,000 volumes. It is frequented by invalids, on account of some warm baths on Monte Giuliano, near the city. Pisa contains 2000 houses, and about 18,000 inhabitants, who make some linen and woollen cloths, some silk goods, with glass, paper, white lead, vitriol, and alabaster articles, but depend mostly on the invalid visitors.
