PLACE, in Astronomy. The place of the sun, a planet, or a star, denotes the sign and degree of the zodiac which the luminary is in; or the degree of the ecliptic, reckoning from the beginning of Aries, which the planet’s or star’s circle of longitude cuts; and therefore coincides with the longitude of the sun, planet, or star. As the sine of the sun’s greatest declination, 23° 30', is to the sine of any present declination given or observed, for instance, 23° 15 ’; so is the radius 10 to the sine of its longitude, 81° 52'; which, if the declination were north, would give 20° 52' of Gemini, or, if south, 20° 52' of Capricon, for the sun’s place.
