PAVILION, in Architecture, signifies a kind of turret or building, usually insulated, and contained under a single roof, sometimes square, and sometimes in form of a dome; [7:17:164]and it is so called from the resemblance of its roof to a tent. Pavilions are sometimes projecting pieces in the front of a building, marking the middle of it; but sometimes the pavilion flanks a corner, in which case it is called an angular pavilion. The Louvre is flanked with four pavilions. These are usually higher than the rest of the building. Pavilions built ip gardens are commonly called summer-houses, pleasure-houses, and the like. Some castles or forts consist only of a single pavilion.

Pavilion, in military affairs, signifies a tent raised upon posts to lodge in during the summer time.

Pavilion is also sometimes applied to flags, colours, ensigns, standards, banners, and the like.

Pavilion, in Heraldry, denotes a covering in the form of a tent, which invests or wraps up the armories of different kings and sovereigns, depending only upon God and their sword. The pavilion consists of two parts; the top, which is the chapeau or coronet, and the curtain, which forms the mantle. According to the French heralds, none but sovereign princes may bear the pavilion entire and in all its parts. Those who are elective, or have any dependence, say the heralds, must take off the head, and retain nothing but the curtains.

Pavilions, amongst jewellers, are the under-sides and corners of the brilliants, lying between the girdle and the collet.
