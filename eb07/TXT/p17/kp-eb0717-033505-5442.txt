PEWTER, a factitious metal, used in the making of domestic utensils. The basis of this metal is tin, united to small portions of lead, zinc, bismuth, and antimony. There are three sorts of pewter in common use, distinguished by the names of plate, trifle, and ley. The plate-pewter is used for plates and dishes; the trifle, chiefly for pints and quarts; [7:17:336]and the ley-metal for wine measures, and the like. Our very best pewter is said to consist of a hundred parts of tin and seventeen of antimony, though others allow only ten parts of the latter metal. Besides this composition, there are other kinds, compounded of tin, antimony, bismuth, and copper, in several proportions.
