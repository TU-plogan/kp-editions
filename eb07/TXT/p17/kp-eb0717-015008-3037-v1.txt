PAUCARTAMBO, a province of Peru, in the depart ment of Cuzco, and situated to the east of the province and city of that name. It is traversed by a considerable stream of the same name, which flows into the Urubamba, one of the southern affluents of the Amazons. Considerable quantities of cocoa-leaf are annually exported from this province, and the land also produces rice, cacao, yucas, camotes, Indian corn, pine-apples, plantains, and other fruits, all in great abundance, and of most excellent quality. A large return, however, is only to be expected when the ground has been carefully cultivated; and this is seldom the case, owing to the indolent habits of the Indians, who are content to live for the most part on chuno or blanched potato, sesina or sun-dried meat, and aji or capsicum. Vegetables are scarcely ever seen, although the soil and climate admit of the production of most sorts for the table. Orange trees flourish remarkably well, and yield delicious fruit; but only a very few have been planted, so lazy and indifferent to the natural fertility of their country are the Indians. The Chunchos, as they are called, are, besides, a filthy, immoral people, and live so wretchedly that they suffer dreadfiιlly from ague and fever, which carries them off in great numbers, there being no one exercising medical skill amongst them. Their favourite occupation is travelling with bow and arrow in hand through the forests in pursuit of game, monkeys, wild boars, and other animals. Paucartambo, the capital of the province, and situated fifteen leagues east-north-east from Cuzco, is thus described by General Miller, who traversed this hitherto unknown region in the year 1835. “This town, situated in a deep ravine, and on the banks of a mountain stream, was once of considerable importance, owing to its connection with the valleys twenty leagues distant, at the easternmost foot of the Andes, which formerly contained three curatos, and upwards of one hundred estates, principally cocoa-leaf plantations. Of the latter, owing to sickness, hostile inroads of the Indians, &c. only six now remain. Besides other causes of decay, one third of the houses of the town of Paucartambo have been carried away by its river within these few years, and it now contains only about some hundred inhabitants, mostly of Spanish blood, and distinguished for their superior intellect, good countenances, and urbane bearing, as compared with the rest of the population in the department of Cuzco.”
