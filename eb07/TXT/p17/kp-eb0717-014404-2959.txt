PATRON, amongst the Romans, was an appellation given to a master who had freed his slave. As soon as the relation of master expired, that of patron began. For the Romans, in giving their slaves their freedom, did not despoil themselves of all rights and privileges in them; the law still subjected them to considerable services and duties towards their patrons, the neglect of which was very severely punished.

Patron was also a name which the people of Rome gave to some great man, under whose protection they usually placed themselves, paying him all kinds of honour and respect, and denominating themselves his clients; whilst the patron, on his side, granted them his credit and protection. They were therefore mutually attached and mutually obliged to each other; and by this means, in consequence of reciprocal ties, all those seditions, jealousies, and animosities, which are sometimes the effect of a difference of rank, were prudently avoided. For it was the duty of the patron to advise his clients in points of law, to manage their suits, to take care of them as of his own children, and secure their peace and happiness. The clients were to assist their patrons with money on several occasions; to ransom them or their children when taken in war; to contribute to the portions of their daughters; and to defray, in part, the charges of their public employments. They were never to accuse each other, or take contrary sides; and if either of them was convicted of having violated this law, the crime was equal to that of treason, and any one was allowed to kill the offender with impunity. This patronage was a tie as effectual as any consanguinity or alliance, and had a wonderful effect towards maintaining union and concord amongst the people for the space of six hundred years, during which time we find no dissensions or jealousies between the patrons and their clients, even in the times of the republic, when the populace frequently mutinied against those who were most powerful in the city.

Patron, in the Church of Rome, a saint whose name a person bears, or under whose protection he is placed, and whom he takes particular care to invoke; or a saint in whose name a church or order is founded.
