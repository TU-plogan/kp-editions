PERRON, Jaques Davy du, a cardinal, distinguished by his abilities and learning, was born in the canton of Berne in the year 1556. He was educated by Julian Davy, his father, a learned Calvinist, who taught him Latin and the mathematics; after which, by his own exertions, he became acquainted with the Greek and Hebrew, philosophy, and the poets. Philip Desportes, abbot of Tyron, made him known to Henry III. king of France, who conceived a great esteem for him. Some time afterwards Duperron abjured Calvinism, and embraced the ecclesiastical function in the Catholic Church; and having given great proofs of his wit and learning, he was chosen to pronounce the funeral oration of Mary Queen of Scots. After the murder of Henry III. he retired to the house of Cardinal de Bourbon, and took great pains in bringing back the Protestants to the Church of Rome. Amongst others he gained over Spondanus, who was afterwards bishop of Pamiers. He also contributed to engage Henry IV. to change his religion; and that prince sent him to negociate his reconciliation with the holy see, in which he succeeded. Duperron was consecrated bishop of Evreux whilst he resided at Rome. On his return to France, he wrote, preached, and disputed against the reformed, particularly against Duplessis-Mornay, with whom he had a public conference in the presence of the king at Fontainebleau. In 1604, he was made cardinal by Pope Clement VIII. at the solicitation of Henry IV. who afterwards nominated him to the archbishopric of Sens. The king at length sent him to Rome with Cardinal Joyeuse, in order to terminate the disputes which had arisen between Paul V. and the Venetians. It is said that the sovereign pontiff had such a high opinion of the address of the Cardinal Duperron, that he used to say, “Let us pray to God to inspire the Cardinal Duperron, for he will persuade ns to do whatever he pleases.” After the death of Henry IV. he retired into the country, where he put the last hand to his work; and, having set up a printing-house, corrected every sheet himself. He died at Paris in 1618; and, after his death, his works were collected and published at Paris in three volumes folio.
