PIP, or Pep, a disease amongst poultry, consisting of a white thin skin or film, which grows under the tip of the tongue, and hinders their feeding. It usually arises from want of water, or from drinking puddle-water, and eating filthy meat. It is cured by pulling off the film with the fingers, and rubbing the tongue with salt. Hawks are particularly liable to this disease, from their feeding on stinking flesh.
