PELLISSON, or Pellisson Fontanier, Paul, was the son of James Pellisson, counsellor at Castres. He was born at Beziers in 1624, and educated in the Protestant religion. He studied with success the Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian tongues, and applied himself to the perusal of the best authors in these languages; after which he studied with reputation the law at Castres. In 1652 he purchased the post of secretary to the king, and five years afterwards became first deputy to Îœ. Fouquet. He suffered by the disgrace of that minister; and in 1661 was confined in the Bastille, whence he was not discharged till four years afterwards. During his confinement he applied himself to the study of controversy; and in 1670 he abjured the Protestant religion. Louis XIV. bestowed upon him an annual pension of two thousand crowns, and he likewise enjoyed several posts. In 1676 he received the abbey of Giment, and some years afterwards the priory of St Orens at Auch. He died in 1693. His principal works are, 1. The History of the French Academy; 2. Reflections on religious Disputes, in four vols. 12mo; 3. The History of Louis XIV.; and, 4. Historical Letters and Miscellanies, in three vols. 12mo.
