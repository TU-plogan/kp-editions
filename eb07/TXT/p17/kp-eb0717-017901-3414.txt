PELATAE were those free-born citizens amongst the Athenians, who by poverty were reduced to the necessity of serving for wages. During their servitude they had no vote in the management of public affairs, from having no estate to qualify them; but this restriction was removed whenever they had released themselves from their servile situation, which they were allowed to do when able to support themselves. Whilst they continued servants, they had also a right to change their masters. We find them sometimes distinguished by the name of Thetae.
