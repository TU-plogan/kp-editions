PINOS, an island of the Atlantic, situated near the south coast of Cuba, from which it is separated by a channel sixteen leagues in length by six in breadth. It abounds in pastures, which are covered with herds of goats and other animals; and it is likewise noted for the size of its trees. Although Pinos possesses several very secure and well-sheltered roads, and is of tolerable size, being forty- â€™ ^ two miles in length and thirty-four in breadth, yet it is only inhabited by a few fishermen.
