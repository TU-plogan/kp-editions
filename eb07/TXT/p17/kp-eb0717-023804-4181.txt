PERORATION, in Fhetoric, the concluding portion of an oration, in which all that the orator had insisted on throughout his discourse is urged afresh with greater vehemence and passion. The peroration consists of two parts; recapitulation, in which the substance of what was diffused throughout the speech is briefly collected, and summed up with new force and weight; and the appeal to the passions, which is so peculiar to the peroration, that the masters of the art call this portion sedes affectuum.
