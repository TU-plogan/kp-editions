PILKINGTON, Laetitia, a sprightly and once noted writer, was the daughter of Dr Van Lewin, a physician of Dublin, where she was born in the year 1712. She was married when very young to the Rev. Matthew Pilkington, a poet of no inconsiderable merit; and the two wits, as is often the case, lived very unhappily together, and were at length totally separated. The story is told at large in her Memoirs. After this separation, Mrs Pilkington came to London, and lived for some time on the productions of her pen. She was, however, thrown into the Marshalsea for debt; and being set at liberty, opened a pamphlet shop. She at length raised a handsome subscription for her Memoirs, which are written with great sprightliness and wit; containing several anecdotes of Dean Swift, with whom she was intimate, as well as many pretty little pieces of her own poetry. This ingenious person died at Dublin in 1750.

Pilkington, a township in the parish of Prestwick, of the hundred of Salford, in Lancashire, 180 miles from London and four from Manchester. It is chiefly inhabited by cotton manufacturers. The population amounted in 1801 to 5786, in 1811 to 7353, in 1821 to 8976, and in 1831 to 11,006.
