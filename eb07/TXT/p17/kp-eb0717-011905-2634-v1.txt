PATAVINITY (Patavinitas), amongst critics, denotes [7:17:120] a peculiarity of Livy’s diction, derived from Patavium or Padua, the place of his nativity; but they are by no means agreed in what this alleged patavinity consists. According to Quintilian, Asinius Pollio taxed Livy with patavinity, though what he meant by this censure no one can now say with any certainty. Morhof believes it to consist in a singular turn of expression, and in certain phrases peculiar to the Paduese. All we certainly know about it, however, is, that it was a fault in the language of Livy, not in the sentiments or the manners. In all probability it is one of those delicacies which are no longer perceived or understood ∣in a dead language. In 1685, D. G. Morhof published at Kiel a treatise De Patavinitate Liviana, in λvhich he explains, very learnedly, both the urbanity and peregrinity of the Latin language.
