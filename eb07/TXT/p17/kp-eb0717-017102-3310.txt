PEEL, a town on the western side of the Isle of Man, in the Irish Channel, formerly called Holm. It is a scattered place, containing nothing remarkable excepting an old cathedral in a dilapidated â€˜state, and a castle on a small island, or rather rock, at the mouth of the river of the same name as the town. It has but little trade, and about 1300 inhabitants.
