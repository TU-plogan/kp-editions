PAULEE, or Pauleegur, a celebrated fortress and town of Hindustan, province of Aurungabad, and district of Concan. It is erected on the top of an insulated mountain, about 1500 feet in height, and is inaccessible on the north side, which is well defended. It contains several reservoirs of water, and the store-rooms and other places are hewn out of the solid rock. This extraordinary fortress was taken in 1818 by the British troops. There is another town of the same name in the province of Ajmeer, and one of the greatest commercial marts in Rajpootana, where the commodities of Europe, Persia, and the Deccan are exchanged for those of Cashmere and the northern and eastern parts of Hindustan[7:17:158]. Paulee is also the name of a town and fortress in the south of India, province of Malabar.
