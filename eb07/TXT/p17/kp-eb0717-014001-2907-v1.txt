PATREE, a large and populous town of Hindustan, in the province of Gujerat, and capital of a small district. It is defended by three walls, the inner one being surrounded by a good wet ditch, which, even in the dry season, contains a considerable quantity of water. It was formerly considered as a place of great strength, and is often mentioned in the annals of the country. But the fortifications are now in a state of decay, and are in many places falling to pieces. The north face is protected by a beautiful tank, which renders an attack on that quarter entirely impracticable; and the town, on the whole, is still one of the strongest places in India. This place formerly belonged to the rajah of Drangdra, an independent chief of Cottewar; and is now governed by a Hindu chief, who is tributary to the Poonah Mahrattas. Long. 71. 35. E. Lat. 22. 50. N.
