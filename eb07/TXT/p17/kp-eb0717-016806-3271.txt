PEDATURA, a term used in Roman antiquities to indicate a space or proportion of a certain number of feet set apart. This word often occurs in writers on military affairs. In Hyginus De Castrametatione we meet with the following passage, viz. “Meminerimus itaque ad computationem cohortis equitatae milliariae pedaturam ad mille trecentos sexaginta dari debere ;” the meaning of which is, that pedatura, or space allowed for a cohors equitata or provincial cohort, consisting of both horse and foot, could not be the same as the pedatura of an uniform body of infantry, of the same number, but must exceed‘it by 360 feet; for the proportion of the room occupied by one horseman to that occupied by one foot soldier was estimated as two and a half to one.
