PENITENTIARY, in the ancient Christian church, a name given to certain presbyters or priests, appointed in every church to receive the private confessions of the people, in order to facilitate public discipline, by informing them what sins were to be expiated by public penance, and to appoint private penance for such occult crimes as were not proper to be publicly censured.
[7:17:219]
