PASQUIN, a mutilated statue at Rome, in a corner of the palace of the Ursini. It takes its name from a cobbler of that city, called Pasquin, famous for his sneers and gibes, and who diverted himself by cracking his jokes upon all who passed through that street. After the death of the cobbler, as some persons were digging up the pavement before his door, they found in the earth the statue of an ancient gladiator, well cut, but maimed and half spoiled; and having set up this in the place where it was found, they by com mon consent named it Pasquin. Since that time all satires are attributed to the figure in question, and are either put into its mouth, or pasted upon it, as if they were written by Pasquin himself. They are addressed by Pasquin to Marforio, another statue at Rome. When Marforio is attacked, [7:17:110] Pasquin comes to his assistance; and when Pasquin is attacked, Marforio defends him in his turn; in other words, the people make the statues say just what they please.
