PIRNA, a city of the kingdom of Saxony, in the circle of Meissen, and the capital of a bailiwick of its own name, which comprehends eleven cities and towns, and 170 villages, with 36,250 inhabitants. The city is situated upon the banks of the Elbe, is surrounded with walls, and contains three churches, an orphan-house, an hospital, and 500 houses, with about 6000 inhabitants. It suffered much in the campaign of 1813, when it was the centre of the operations between the French and the allied armies; but it rapidly recovered, and is now the seat of considerable manufactures of cotton goods, and has a good trade on the river Elbe, both in building vessels and in conveying goods. A little above the city is the fine castle of Sonnenstein, now occupied as a lunatic asylum.
