PHYLACTERY, in general, was a name given by the ancients to all kinds of charms, spells, or characters, which [7:17:476]they wore as amulets, to preserve them from danger or disease.

Phylactery particularly denoted a slip of parchment, on which was written some text of Scripture, generally of the decalogue, which the more devout people amongst the Jews wore on the forehead, the breast, or the neck, as a mark of their religion. The primitive Christians also gave the name of phylacteries to the cases in which they enclosed the relics of their dead. Phylacteries are often mentioned in the New Testament, and appear to have been very common amongst the Pharisees in our Lordâ€™s time.
