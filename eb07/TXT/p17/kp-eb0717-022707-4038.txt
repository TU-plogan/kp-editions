PEPLUS was a long robe worn by the women in ancient times. It had no sleeves, reached down to the feet, and was so very fine, that the shape of the body might be seen through it. The Athenians used much ceremony in making the peplus, and in dressing with it the statue of Minerva. Homer makes frequent mention of the peplus of that goddess.
