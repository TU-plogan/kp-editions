PIAZENZA, Placentia, or Plaisance, one of the four districts composing the duchy of Parma, in Italy, and which contains ten cantons. The capital is the city of the same name. It stands on the right bank of the Po, about a furlong from the stream. It is the see of a bishop, is situated in a rich and beautiful district, is surrounded by walls, which are rather adapted for promenades than for defence, and has a citadel, garrisoned by Austrian troops. The streets are straight and long, especially the one called the Stradone, which is very magnificent. The cathedral is a fine specimen of Gothic architecture, and has a gilded cupola. The city contains 2000 houses, two hundred of which are called palaces, and 16,500 inhabitants, whose chief occupation consists in preparing silk and weaving it, and trading in wine, oil, and cheese. Long. 9. 37. 12. Eâˆ™ Lat. 45. 2. 4. N.
