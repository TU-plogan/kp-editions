PATRINGTON, a town of the east riding of Yorkshire, in the wapentake of Holderness, 109 miles from London. It is situated on the river Humber, which is navigable beyond it, but does not now admit such large vessels as formerly. There is a good market, which is held on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 894, in 1811 to 1016, in 1821 to 1244, and in 1831 to 1298.
