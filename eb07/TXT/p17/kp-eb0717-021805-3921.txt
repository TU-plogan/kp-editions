PENICHE, a city of Portugal, in the province of Estremadura, and corregimiento of Leiria. It stands upon a peninsula, which is divided from the continent by a narrow channel, at times nearly dry. It is fortified and protected by a citadel called Amparo, and also by a fort on Cape Ca-rooeiro. It contains three churches, a monastery, a hospital, a poor-house, 920 dwelling-houses, and 4800 inhabitants. In the harbour, which is small, there is depth of water sufficient for large ships. The fishery affords occupation to the greater portion of the population.
