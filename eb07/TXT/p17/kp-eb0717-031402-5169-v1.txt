PETERHEAD, a parish of Scotland, situated on the east coast, in latitude 57. 34. N. and longitude 1. 35. W. in the district of Buchan, and county of Aberdeen. It extends along the coast in a straight line about four miles, bending along the sea-shore about five miles; and from east to west it extends from three to four miles. The surface is nearly level along the coast. The Stirlinghill and Blackhill, containing extensive quarries of granite, are on the southern and,western boundaries. The surface of the parish extends to upwards of 9000 imperial acres, of which about 8300 are under cultivation, 72 are planted, 500 are capable of cultivation, and the remainder is chiefly rocky. Extensive improvements in the cultivation of the soil have been made within the last thirty years. The rental of the landward part of the parish is about L.10,000. The population amounts to 7867.

Peterhead, a burgh in the parish of the same name, in the county of Aberdeen, is situated upon the most easterly point of the mainland of Scotland. Previously to 1593 it was a small fishing village. In that year it was erected into a burgh of barony by George, earl marischal. It was forfeited in 1715, and purchased by the York Building Company, from whom the present proprietors, the governors of the Maiden Hospital founded by the company of merchants of the city of Edinburgh, and Mary Erskine, acquired it by purchase in 1728. The superiors had the nomination of the magistrates until the passing of the burgh reform act in 1832, by which the municipal government has been vested in twelve councillors, who from their own number choose a provost, three bailies, and a treasurer. The town contains about 1000 inhabited houses, besides warehouses, and the rental is about L.7500. The boundaries of the town have been considerably enlarged under the burgh reform act, and now embrace the village of Buchanhaven, and part of the lands of Invernettie.

The harbours of Peterhead are extensive; and, from their peculiar position at the termination of the most easterly promontory of land in Scotland, having an entranee both from the south and north, and being about equally distant from the Friths of Forth and Moray, much resorted to by vessels frequenting the east coast of Scotland, and affording, as they do, shelter and protection, not only to the trade of the port, but also to shipping in general frequenting the east coast of Scotland, they deserve attention in a national point of view. About L.47,000 have been expended in building these harbours. They are managed by commissioners incorporated by act of parliament, and yield an annual revenue of about L.2800. The south harbour etn∙

braces an area of 6∙16 imperial acres, having from twelve to fourteen feet water at medium springs, and from eight to ten feet at neap-tides. The north harbour, which has an area of 10∙86 imperial acres, has at spring-tides eighteen feet water, and never under fourteen feet on any tide. The quays extend to about 3350 feet in length. Connected with the harbours there is an excellent graving-dock. The shipping belonging to the port amount to about 13,000 tons. The number of vessels which annually take shelter in the harbours may be stated on an average at 240. The leading articles of export are grain, meal, eggs, butter, cattle, fish, and the produce of the fisheries. The imports are groceries, clothiery, flour, salt, iron, timber, coal, lime, bone manure, &c. An extensive trade to Greenland and Davis’ Straits has been carried on from Peterhead with various success since the year 1788. During that time 3020 whales have been caught, which have yielded 30,296 tons of oil. The herring fishery has of late been carried on with great success. In 1837, 262 boats were employed in this fishery, and upwards of 40,000 barrels of herrings were caught. It is supposed that Peterhead, being situated farther east than any other land in Scotland, must at all times be one of the best stations for carrying on the herring fishery, as, if the herrings pass along the coast, they must pass near to this headland, and as the tides are strong, only the best fish can make head against them; and, in fact, it has been found that those caught at Peterhead are of superior quality. The lighthouse, which stands on the Buchan-ness, at the extremity of the south bay, is of the utmost importance, both as regards the interests of the general trade of the port, and the prosecution of the herring-fishery. A considerable trade is occasionally carried on in granite from the quarries in the neighbourhood. The stone, which is generally of the red granite, and of excellent quality, may be raised in large blocks. The pillars in the British Museum, the docks at Sheerness, the pillar erected in London to the memory of the late Duke of York, and many other public works, have been built of granite from Peterhead.

In former times Peterhead was much resorted to as a watering-place; and as it certainly possesses many advantages to the invalid who requires sea-bathing and the tonic effects of the mineral waters, it held a high rank amongst the places of summer retreatfor upwards of two centuries. Perhaps no place in the island is more suitable for those whose cases require the bracing effects of sea-bathing or sea-air; the former, from the rapidity of the tides and the absence of rivers, being to be enjoyed in the greatest possible perfection; and the latter, from the almost insular situation of the place, and the total absence of all muddy or marshy exhalations, or other sources of contamination, affording all the advantages without the inconvenience of a sea-voyage. In many cases much benefit may also be derived from the use of the chalybeate waters with which the neighbourhood abounds. But perhaps the renovated health and spirits which are in most cases the result of a season at Peterhead are mainly to be attributed to the air and bathing, together with the regular hours and habits which such a residence naturally inculcates.

The town is plentifully supplied with excellent springwater, which within the last few years has been brought at a great expense for the use of the inhabitants and the shipping; and it is now lighted with gas. There are no manufactures of woollen or cotton goods in Peterhead, although, from its situation, there is every reason to believe that such manufactures might be carried on with advantage.

The places of worship are, the original parish churchy the East parish church or chapel of ease, the Episcopal chapel, and the United Session, Congregational, and Methodist meeting-houses. In the town there is a news-room, and also a reading society, who have a large and valuable lib rary; and there have lately been established an association for the promotion of science, literature, &c. and a mechanics’ institution. There is a weekly market, which is held on Friday; and there are two annual fairs, viz. on the third Tuesday in May and the second Tuesday in November, both old style.

Of late years the town has very much increased, both in inhabitants and in trade and shipping. The inhabitants are intelligent and industrious, and therefore there is reason to anticipate the future extension and prosperity of the burgh. The population of the town in 1838 amounted to 6200. The number of qualified electors was 211.
