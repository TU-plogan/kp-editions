PEARCE, Dr, lord bishop of Rochester, was the son of a distiller in High Holborn. He received his education in Westminster school, where he was distinguished by his merit, and elected one of the king’s scholars. In 1710, when he was twenty years old, he was elected to Trinity College, Cambridge. During the first years of his residence at the university, he occasionally amused himself with lighter compositions, some of which are inserted in the Guardian and Spectator. In 1716, he published his edition of Cicero De Oratore, and, at the desire of a friend, dedicated it to Lord Chief Justice Parker, afterwards Earl of Macclesfield, to whom he was an entire stranger. This incident laid the foundation of his future fortune; for Lord Parker soon recommended him to Dr Bentley, master of Trinity, to be made one of the fellows; and the doctor consented to this upon condition that his lordship would promise to “unmake” him again as soon as it lay in his power to give him a living. In 1717, Mr Pearce was ordained at the age of twenty-seven, having taken time enough, as he thought, to attain a sufficient knowledge of the sacred office. In 1718, Lord Parker was appointed chancellor, and invited Mr Pearce to live with him in the capacity of his chaplain. In 1719, the latter was instituted into the rectory of Stapplcford Abbots, in Essex; and, in 1720, into that of St Bartholomew, behind the Royal Exchange, worth L.400 a year. In 1723, the lord chancellor presented him to St Martin’s-in-the-Ficlds. His majesty, who was then at Hanover, had been applied to in favour of Dr Claget, who was then along with him, and the doctor actually kissed hands upon the occasion; but, upon the king’s return, the chancellor disputed the point, and was permitted to present Mr Pearce. The latter soon attracted the notice and esteem of persons in the highest stations and of the greatest abilities. Besides Lord Parker, he could reckon amongst his patrons or friends, Mr Pulteney, afterwards Earl of Bath, Archbishop Potter, Lord Hardwicke, Sir Isaac Newton, and many other eminent personages. In 1724, the degree of doctor of divinity was conferred on him by Archbishop Wake. The same year he dedicated to his patron the Earl of Macclesfield his edition of Longinus on the Sublime, with a new Latin version and notes.

When the church of St Martin’s was rebuilt, Dr Pearce preached a sermon at the consecration, which he afterwards printed, and accompanied with an essay on the origin and progress of temples, traced from the rude stones which were first used for altars to the noblc structure of Solomon, which he considers as the first temple completely covered. His observations on the building called the Temple of Dagon removes part of the difficulty which presents itself in the narration of the manner in which Samson destroyed it.

The deanery of Winchester having become vacant, Dr Pearce was appointed to it in 1739; and in the year 1744 he was elected prolocutor of the Lower House of Convocation for the province of Canterbury. His friends now began to think of him for the episcopal dignity; but he appeared rather to decline it. However, after several difficulties had been started and removed, he consented to accept the bishopric of Bangor, and promised Lord Hardwicke to do it with a good grace. He accordingly made proper acknowledgements of the royal goodness, and was consecrated on the 12th of February 1748. Upon the declining state of health of Dr Wilcocks, bishop of Rochester, the bishop of Bangor was several times applied to by Archbishop Herring to accept of Rochester, and the deanery of Westminster, in exchange for Bangor; but he then for the first time signified his desire to obtain leave to resign and retire to a private life. His lordship, however, upon being pressed, suffered himself to be prevailed upon. “My Lord,” said lie to the Duke of Newcastle, “your grace offers these dignities to me in so generous and friendly a manner, that I promise you to accept them.” Upon the death of Bishop Wilcocks he was accordingly promoted to the sec of Rochester and deanery of Westminster in 1756. Bishop Sherlock died in 1761, and Lord Bath offered his interest to get the Bishop of Rochester appointed to succeed him in the diocese of London; but the latter told his lordship, that he had determined never to be Bishop of London or Archbishop of Canterbury.

In the year 1763, his lordship being then in the seventy-third year of his age, and finding himself less fit for the business of his stations as bishop and dean, informed his friend Lord Bath of his intention to resign both, and live in a retired manner upon his private fortune. Lord Bath undertook to acquaint his majesty, who named a day and hour, when the bishop was admitted alone into the closet. He told the king, that he wished to have some interval between the fatigues of business and eternity; and desired his majesty to consult proper persons about the propriety and legality of his resignation. In about two months the king informed him that Lord Mansfield saw no objection, and that Lord Northington, who had been doubtful, on further consideration thought that the request might be complied with. Unfortunately for the bishop, Lord Bath had applied for Bishop Newton to succeed him. This alarmed the ministry, who thought that no dignities should be obtained except through their hands. They therefore opposed the resignation; and his majesty was informed that the bishops disliked the design. His majesty sent to him again, and at a third audience told him that he must think no more of resigning. The bishop replied, “Sire, I am all duty and submission ;” and then retired. In 1768 he obtained leave to resign the deanery; in 1773 he lost his lady; and after some months of lingering decay he died at Little Ealing, on the 29th of June 1774.

This eminent prelate distinguished himself in every part of his life by the virtues proper to his station. His Literary abilities, and application to sacred and philological learning, appear by his works, the principal of which are, 1. A Letter to the Clergy of the Church of England, on occasion of the Bishop of Rochester’s commitment to the Tower, 1722; 2. Miracles of Jesus vindicated, 1727 and 1728; 3. A Review of the Text of Milton, 1733; 4. Two Letters against Dr Middleton, occasioned by the doctor’s letter to Waterland, on the publication of his Treatise entitled Scripture Vindicated, 1752; and, 5. a Commentary, with notes, on the [7:17:166]four Evangelists and the Acts of the Apostles, together with a new translation of St Paul’s first Epistle to the Corinthians, and a paraphrase, with notes, in two vols. 4to.
