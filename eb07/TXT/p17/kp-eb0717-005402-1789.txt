PARACATU, a comarca of the province of Minas Geraes, in Brazil, South America. This district, which was detached from Sahara, and formed into a separate comarca in 1815, comprehends all the country lying to the westward of the river St Francisco, from the Carinhenha to the Abaité. Cazal states that the latter river is formed by two streams of the same name, one coming from the south-west, the other from the north-west, their sources being nearly one hundred miles apart. The intervening territory is a forest tract, called Matto da Corda, enclosing several campinhas, or extensive grazing lands. The principal heads of the Paracatu are the Escuro and the Prata. The latter is said to have yielded some fine diamonds, and it was customary for a strong guard of soldiers to patrol its banks. Twenty miles north of the confluence of the Paracatu, the St Francisco receives the large river Urucuya. At almost an equal distance between the mouths of these two rivers is the considerable arraial of St Ro-mâo, which carries on an extensive inland trade, especially in salt, obtained from Pilâo Arcado and its vicinity. Above the mouth of the Urucuya the St Francisco receives on its western margin a number of rivers, on most -of which there is a parish or arraial, but immense tracts of country are wholly unappropriated. On the banks of the St Francisco, and to the eastward, great numbers of cattle are bred, and large herds are sent to Rio, a distance of above six hundred miles. The want of salt in these parts is a serious evil, as it is requisite for the cattle; nor will they, it is said, breed well without it. The river Abaité ’ is distinguished by having produced the largest diamond that was ever found in America. It weighed nearly an ounce, and was accidentally discovered by three outlaws when searching for gold. This spot has since been wrought at different periods with various success; but although large diamonds have been found, their quality has been indifferent, and the works are now abandoned. Paracatu do Principe, the only town in the district, owes its origin to its mines, which were first discovered in 1744. A great number of adventurers were lured to the spot by the quantity of gold found, and the Indians were expelled from their native territory. The town, however, has very much decayed. The gold is of a good colour, but of indifferent quality, and difficult of extraction, from the want of water. Diamonds having subsequently been discovered in various parts, the working of the gold-washings is now restricted to a few leagues round the town. The town has the advantage of a healthy situation, upon an elevated plain. The houses are of taipe; the streets are paved; and, besides the church, there are four hermitages. In the neighbourhood, the vine, the orange, and the pine-apple flourish luxuriantly, and there is abundance of deer and game. The town contains above one thousand inhabitants, but of the population of the district no correct estimate can be formed.
