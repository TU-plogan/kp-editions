PECTORAL, a sacerdotal habit or vestment, which was worn by the J ewish high priest. The Jews call it Hhoschen, the Greeks yoaâˆ•ov, the Latins rationale and pectorale, and in our version of the Bible it is called breastplate. It consisted of embroidered stuff, about a span square, and was worn upon the breast, set with twelve precious stones, arranged in four rows, and containing the names of the twelve tribes. It was fastened to the shoulder by two chains and hooks of gold. God himself prescribed the form of the pectoral.

Pectoral, a breastplate of thin brass, about twelve fingers square, worn by the poorer soldiers in the Roman army, who were rated under one thousand drachmae.
