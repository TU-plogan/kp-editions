PHAeDO, a native of Elis, was the founder of the Eliac sect of philosophy, and the person whose name Plato inscribed in one of his most celebrated dialogues. The exact date of his birth and death is unknown, but he flourished B. c. 399. By the fortune of war he was taken prisoner, and reduced to a state of slavery. He was brought to Athens, where he became known to Socrates, who admired his talents so much that he caused Alcibiades or Crito to release him from servitude. He then became one of the most devoted attendants on his benefactor. It appears that he was not at all satisfied with the manner in which he was introduced by Plato into his dialogue; and he used to declare publicly that he had never spoken in that way, and that he had never heard Socrates use the language which Plato put into his mouth. Plato was so much offended with this proceeding, that, in revenge, he threatened to bring a lawsuit against Phaedo, to prove that he had never received his freedom. (Athenaeus, xi. 505, e; 507, c.) He composed several dialogues, the titles of which were, Zopyrus, Simon, and several which it was doubtful if they belonged to him; Nicias, Antimachus, Medus, ascribed by some to Aeschines, by others to Polyaenus; Sythici Sermones, ascribed also to Aeschines; and three others quoted by Suidas. He was succeeded in his school by Pleistanus of Elis, Pleistanus by Stilpo, Stilpo by Menedemus of Eretria and Asclepiades of Phlius. (Diogenes Laertius’s Life of Phaedo.)
