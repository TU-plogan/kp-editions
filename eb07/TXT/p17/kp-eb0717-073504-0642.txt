PIAZZA, a town of the island of Sicily, in the intendancy of Calatanisetta and district of Noto. It is a fine town, situated on a hill, in a healthy situation, 100 miles from Palermo, the Plutia of Diodorus. It contains 2424 houses, with 13,000 inhabitants, who cultivate the fertile soil near them, and carry on a great trade in its production. Near to it is the Lake of Pergusa, the scene of the rape of Proserpine.

Piazza, in building, popularly called piache, an Italian name for a portico or covered walk, supported by arches. The word literally signifies a broad open place or square; and hence it was also applied to the walks or porticos around them.
