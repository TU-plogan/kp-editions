PARVICH, an island near Dalmatia, containing many [7:17:107] Roman antiquities, which evidently show that it was a Roman station. It seems to have been amongst the number of those islands which Pliny calls Celadussae, supposed to be an inversion of δοσκεkαδος, meaning ill sounding or noisy. Parvich is not of large extent, but is extremely fertile. Every product attains perfection there, particularly those which require a very shallow soil, such as wine, oil, mulberry trees, and fruit. The aspect of this island is also very pleasant at a distance, but that of the others adjacent shocks the eye by their high, rocky, and naked hills. The name of Parvich seems to have been given it because it is the first one observed on going out of the harbour of Sibe-nico the Illyrian word parvi signifying first.
