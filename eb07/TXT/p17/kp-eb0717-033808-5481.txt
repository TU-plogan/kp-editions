PHANTASIA was the daughter of Nicarchus of Memphis in Egypt. It has been supposed that she wrote a poem on the Trojan war, and another on the return of Ulysses to Ithaca, compositions from which Homer is supposed to have copied the greater part of his Iliad and Odyssey when he visited Memphis, where they were deposited.
