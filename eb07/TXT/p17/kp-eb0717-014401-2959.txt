PATRIPASSIANS, Patripassiani, in Ecclesiastical History, a Christian sect, who appeared about the latter end of the second century, and were so called from their ascribing the passion to the Father. They asserted the unity of God in such a manner as to destroy all distinctions of persons, and to make the Father and Son precisely the same; and in this they were followed by the Sabellians and others. The author and head of the Patripassians was Praxeas, a philosopher of Phrygia, in Asia. Swedenborg and his followers seem to hold the same faith.
