PHOCION, a very celebrated Athenian general, was descended from a family which at no time had been particularly distinguished in the political transactions of their country. He was born b. c. 402, and died b. c. 317, at the age of eighty-five. His early years were spent under the direction of Plato and Xenocrates, and his subsequent career showed that he had profited by their instruction. His aspect was forbidding, though his disposition was mild and gentle. It was remarked, that he was never seen to laugh or to weep. He commenced his military career under Chabrias, and gained so much influence with that general that he directed many of his proceedings. The victory at Naxos, B. c. 376, was in a great measure due to his prudence and military talents; nor was he less distinguished as a statesman and orator. He was quick in perception, and ready in debate, so that Demosthenes feared him more than any other orator, and is said to have called him the Hatchet. Phocion was aware of the true position of his country, knowing that she could no longer maintain that predominating influence which she had possessed during the last century. Peace was therefore the true policy of Athens, and he at all times advocated such a course of conduct. Yet, though his sense of the true interests of his country led him to be the promoter of peace, he was at all times ready to assist with his military talents. He commanded in the expedition, B. c. 350, against Euboea, and gained the battle of Jamynae. When Philip king of Macedonia laid siege to Byzantium, and the cities along the coast, Phocion relieved these cities from all danger, and compelled Philip to retire. At the head of his army he endured all the fatigues of the lowest of his soldiers; and when he appeared more warmly dressed than usual, the soldiers used to consider it the sign of a severe winter. He was a man of the strictest integrity; and, at a time when few of the orators and statesmen of Athens were able to resist the temptation of enriching themselves at the expense of their country, Phocion remained poor, and refused all the offers of the Macedonian kings. He was, of course, opposed to the policy of Demosthenes, and employed all his influence to thwart his measures. In the troubles which followed the death of Alexander, he was favourable to the party of Antipater; and when Polysperchon re-established the popular form of government, Phocion was seized, and being brought before an assembly, [7:17:450]composed chiefly of slaves and strangers, he was condemned to die. He was put to death in his eighty-fifith year.
