PART is a portion of a whole, considered as divided or divisible.

Logical Part is a division for which we are indebted to the schoolmen. It refers to some universal as its whole; in which sense the species are parts of a genus, and individuals or singulars are parts of the species.

Physical Part is that which, though fit enter into the composition of a whole, may yet be considered apart, and under its own distinct idea; and in this sense a continuum is said to consist of parts. Physical parts, again, are of two kinds, homogeneous and heterogeneous. The first are those of the same denomination with some other; the second are of a different denomination. Parts, again, are distinguished into subjective, essential, and integrant; a division of which the schoolmen were likewise the authors.

Aliquot Part is a quantity which, being repeated any number of times, becomes equal to an integer. Thus 6 is an aliquot part of 24, and 5 an aliquot part of 30.

Aliquant Part is a quantity which, being repeated any number of times, becomes always either greater or less than the whole. Thus 5 is an aliquant part of 17, and 9 is an aliquant part of 10. The aliquant part is resolvable into aliquot parts. Thus 15, an aliquant part of 20, is resolvable into 10, a half, and 5, a fourth part, of the same number.
