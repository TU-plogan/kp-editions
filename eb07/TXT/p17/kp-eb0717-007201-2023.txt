PARIA, a province of Bolivia, in South America, situated in the department of Oruro. On the north and northeast it is bounded by the provinces of Pacajes and Oruro, on the east and south-east by Porco, on the south-west by Lipes, and on the west by Caranjas. This province is traversed by a rapid river called the Desaguadero, or Drain, which is invariably represented in maps of Peru and Bolivia as flowing into the lake of Titicaca, whilst the reverse is the fact. It issues from this celebrated sheet of water, and, after flowing a considerable distance, its waters are dissipated by spontaneous evaporation. The province of Paria is situated in a mountainous tract of country, and being very elevated, the temperature is consequently cold. Like Oruro and other provinces in this region, it is a mining district, and contains several mines of silver. There are some lakes in the province, from which salt is extracted; and also some hot springs. The lake of Paria is from three to four leagues in length and two in width, and abounds in excellent fish. Alcedo says that it has a whirlpool, which sucks down floating bodies, and finds a passage to the sea under the cordillera, and through the shore, close to the port of Iqueique. In 1748 its waters rose to an immense height, a phenomenon which Alcedo attributes to the stoppage of its subterranean passage; but this was far more likely to arise from volcanic agency, so frequent in this country, raising and depressing the land in various directions. Farming operations are carried on in Paria, but little grain is produced; the rearing of cattle, which are plentiful, chiefly occupying the attention of the inhabitants. The cheese made here of sheep’s milk is esteemed a great delicacy, and is much sought after. The capital of the province, which bears the same name, is situated 210 miles west-north-west of Chuquisaca, in 18° 50' south latitude, and 68° 20 ’ west longitude. The population amounts to 50,000, of which number 37,000 are Indians, and 13,000 Creoles.

Paria, Gulf of, a gulf of South America, situated to the north-west of the embouchure of the river Orinoco, and having on the west the province of Cumana, and on the east the large island of Trinidad. On Terra Firma, and north-west from the mouths of the Orinoco, a peninsula or neck of land projects towards the east, in the exact direction of another but much smaller neck of land which juts out from the north-western extremity of the island of Trinidad. These projections approach within a few leagues of each other, but the passage is interrupted by two or three islands, which, from their relative position, form four openings called Boccas del Drago, or the Mouths of the Dragon. Again, at the south-western extremity of Trinidad, a neck of land advances in a westerly direction, towards a part of the delta of the Orinoco, and approaches to within twelve or fourteen miles of it. This passage is likewise interrupted by islands, and is called the Serpent’s Mouth. Thus the mainland embosoms an immense bay, whilst the island of Trinidad, which lies at its mouth, forms also a bay, facing the other, by its northern and southern extremities projecting forwards. Both shores thus bend and mutually approach each other, so as to form two comparatively narrow entrances, by which the waters of the gulf communicate with those of the ocean. The Gulf of Paria, at its widest part, that is, from the shores of Trinidad to those of Colombia, is eighty-three miles across. In the other direction, [7:17:73]from the Bocca on the south to the Boccas del Drago on the north, it measures forty-three miles. In depth it varies from eight to thirty fathoms; but there is anchorage throughout its whole extent, though on the coast of Paria its soundings are much less. On the south side of the Serpent’s Mouth, which communicates with the Atlantic Ocean, and receives in the rainy season the vast flood of waters which pour as from an inland ocean through the mouths of the Orinoco, a considerable current is found setting into the gulf, which is thus reported to have its waters raised four or five inches above their usual level. The surface-water at this time, which is during the months of July, August, and September, is also said to be fresh. This is by no means an unlikely circumstance, arising from the inferior specific gravity of fresh water as compared with that of the sea; and the surface of the gulf will also continue a longer time partially fresh, from its being embayed on all sides by land, so as to shut out the swell and agitation of the ocean, which would cause a more rapid commixture of the fresh and salt water. It was this current which Columbus encountered, and which gave him so unfavourable an opinion of the Gulf of Paria, which he accordingly called the Melancholy Gulf. It is of course most violent during the rainy months; but a current generally sets into the gulf through the Serpent’s Mouth to the northward during the dry season; it is, however, partial and unimportant. In the months of December, January, and February the tide sets through the Dragon’s Mouth from the northward, by which the current is occasionally overpowered. The water of the Gulf of Paria is generally of a turbid and dull green cast, but in the interior it presents everywhere a tranquil and glassy surface. The winds are in general light, never increasing to more than a gentle breeze, excepting in autumn, when a few transient squalls disturb its serenity. It may indeed be regarded as a spacious harbour, affording secure anchorage in all its parts, and perfectly free from gales, storms, and accidents; for if vessels happen to get aground, the soft muddy bottom receives them without injury. The nights are generally calm and quiet, the principal annoyance to the mariner being the want of wind; so that coasting along the shores of the gulf is extremely troublesome and tedious. Its waters abound with various kinds of fish; and numerous flocks of terns and pelicans may at all seasons be seen here and there, busily employed in catching their prey. The western shore of the gulf, which forms part of a province of Colombia formerly called Paria, is remarkable for its fertility and beauty. Columbus spoke with rapture of this luxuriant land, and in his enthusiasm he concluded that it was the terrestrial paradise which had received the progenitor of the human race pure from his Creator’s hands. (See the article Orinoco.) The point of the peninsula, which runs for a great many leagues into the sea opposite the island of Trinidad, is called Point Paria, and is situated in latitude 9. 12. north, and longitude 62. 1. west from Greenwich.
