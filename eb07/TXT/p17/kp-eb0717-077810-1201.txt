PLANTAGENET, the surname of the kings of England from Henry II. to Richard III. inclusive. Antiquaries are much at a loss to account for the origin of this name; the best derivation they can find for it being, that Fulk, the first Earl of Anjou of that name, stung with remorse for some wicked action, went, as a work of atonement, in pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where, being soundly scourged with broom twigs, which grew plentifully on the spot, he afterwards took the surname of Plantagenet, which was retained by his posterity.
