+=====================================================================+


PATIN, Guy, professor of physic in the Royal College of Paris, was born in the year 1602. He made his way in the world merely by the force of his genius, being at first only corrector of a printing-house. He was a man of great wit and erudition, and spoke with the gravity of a Stoic; but his expressions were nevertheless very satirical, and he hated bigotry, superstition, and knavery. Notwithstanding his sarcastic tendency, however, he was upright and well disposed, an affectionate father and an amiable member of society. He died in the year 1672, and owed his reputation, not to any writings upon physic published in his lifetime, but to his letters, which appeared after his death.

Patin, Charles, son of the preceding, was born in Paris in 1633, and made so surprising progress, that he maintained, in Greek and Latin, theses on all parts of philosophy, in 1647. He studied the law in compliance with the wishes of an uncle, and was admitted as an advocate in the parliament of Paris; but he could not lay aside the study of physic, for which he had always a decided inclination. Having therefore quitted the law, he devoted himself to physic, and after taking his doctor’s degree, he applied himself to practice with success. He afterwards travelled into Germany, Holland, England, Switzerland, and Italy. In 1676 he was appointed professor of physic in Padua; and three years afterwards he was created a knight of St Mark. He died in that city in 1694. His works are numerous, and well known to learned physicians.
