PHILIPPI, a town of European Turkey, in Macedonia, at the foot of Mount Pangaeus, eight miles from the seashore, and twenty-six leagues to the eastward of Salonica. On the plain near it was decided the fate of Rome in the battle fought by Augustus and Marc Antony on the one side, against Brutus and Cassini on the other. The place still exhibits the remains of an amphitheatre, and several other monuments of its antiquity and prosperity, although at present it has an inconsiderable population.
