PENTAMETER, in ancient poetry, a kind of verse, consisting of five feet or metres; and hence the name. The first and second feet may be either dactyls or spondees; the third is always a spondee; and the two last anapests. A pentameter line subjoined to an hexameter constitutes what is called elegiac verse.
