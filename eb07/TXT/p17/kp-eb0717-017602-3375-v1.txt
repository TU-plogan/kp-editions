PELAGIUS was a native of Great Britain, but whether of England, Scotland, or Wales, is as uncertain as it is immaterial. He was born towards the close of the fourth century, and educated in the monastery of Bangor, in Wales, of which he became a monk, and afterwards abbot. In the early part of his life he passed over to France, and thence proceeded to Rome, where he had the insolence to promulgate certain opinions different from those of the church. His morals being irreproachable, he gained many disciples; and the heresy he preached made so rapid a progress, that it became necessary for the pope to exert his power. To avoid the danger, Pelagius passed over to Sicily, in the year 409, attended by his friend and pupil Celestins. In 411 they landed in Africa, continued some time at Hippo, and were present at the famous conference between the Catholics and Donatists, which was held at Carthage in 412. From thence they travelled into Egypt, and from Egypt, in 415, to Palestine, where they were graciously received by John bishop of Jerusalem. In the same year Pelagius was cited to appear before a council of seventeen bishops, held at Diospolis. They were satisfied with his creed, and absolved him of heresy. The African bishops, however, being displeased with their proceedings, appealed to the Roman pontiff, who first approved, and afterwards condemned, the opinions of Pelagius; the latter, with his pupil Celestins, was publicly excommunicated; and all the bishops who refused to subscribe the condemnation of the Pelagian heresy were immediately deprived. What became of him after this period is entirely unknown; but it seems very probable that he retired to Bangor, and died abbot of the monastery of that place. He wrote, 1. Expositionum in Epistolas Paulinas, lib. xiv.; 2. Epistola ad Demetriadem de Virginitate; 3. Explanatio Symboli ad Damasum; 4. Epistolae ad viduam duae; and, 5. De Libero Arbitrio. These, and many other fragments, were scattered amongst the works of St Jerome. They were also col lected by Garnerius, and published in Append. Op. Mercatoris, p. 373.
