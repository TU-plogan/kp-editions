PANTOMIME, Tlαντομιμος, amongst the ancients, a person who could imitate all kinds of actions and characters by signs and gestures, without speaking.

The pantomimes formed a part of the theatrical entertainments of the ancients; and their chief employment was to express by gestures and action whatever the chorus sung, changing their countenance and behaviour as the subject of the song varied. They were very ancient in Greece, being, according to some, derived from the heroic ages; but however this may be, they were certainly known in Plato’s time. In Rome, it was as late as the reign of Augustus before they made their appearance. With respect to their dress, it was various, being always suited as near as possible to that of the person they were to imitate. The crocota was much used amongst the Roman pantomimes, in which, as well as in other female dresses, they personated women.

“The pantomimes,” says Gibbon, “who maintained their reputation from the age of Augustus to the sixth century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people. The vast and magnificent theatres of Rome were filled by 3000 female dancers, and by 3000 singers, with the masters of the respective chorusses. Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly enforced against the professors of the liberal arts.”

Pantomimes are still very common. In some respects indeed they differ from those of antiquity; but they retain the name, and, like these, they consist in the representation of things merely by gestures.
