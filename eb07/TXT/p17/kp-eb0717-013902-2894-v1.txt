PATNA, a large and celebrated city of Hindustan, in the province of Bahar, of which it is the capital. It is a city of great antiquity, and is supposed to have been the Palibothra of the ancients. It is situated on the southern shore of the Ganges, which is here five miles wide during the rainy season, and deep enough to float a ship of war. The city is built along the river, and is one continued street for many miles along the Ganges, whilst it is only one mile in breadth. The houses of the natives are generally built of mud; but those of the Europeans, which extend from Banki-poor, are of brick, and make a very handsome appearance, which is not the case with the rest of the city. It contains several mosques and temples; but they are old, and without ornament. It was formerly fortified after the fashion of Hindustan, and still possesses a small citadel, which is now used as a barrack and store-house; but neither this nor the fortifications of the town could have resisted a regular attack of modern artillery for twenty-four hours, although it has often made an obstinate defence against the attack of Indian troops. The town is large and populous; and chintzes and dimities of various kinds are manufactured here, as well as cloths resembling diaper and damask linen. Flannels are also woven in the vicinity, as well as a sort of canvass from cotton. The neighbouring country produces the finest opium and saltpetre, and great quantities of wheat and other valuable grains; also sugar and indigo. Opium and saltpetre are strictly monopolized; but a considerable trade is carried on in all other articles. A large quantity of saltpetre is annually despatched for internal consumption, and for exportation. It was here that the English first established a factory, the remains of which are still to be seen, where two hundred English prisoners were massacred in 1763, under the orders of the German adventurer Somro, or Summers, then in the service of Meer Cossim; immediately after which the city was captured by the British, and has ever since remained in their possession. A monument is erected to ι the sufferers, in the European burying-ground. The Company have erected here a depot to contain rice. It is a building of stone, in shape like a bee-hive, with two winding staircases on the outside, which have been ascended on horseback. Banki-poor, one of the suburbs of Patna, is the residence of the servants of the Company. They compose a numerous establishment, with liberal appointments. The travelling distance from Patna to Calcutta by Moorshedabad is 400 miles, from Benares by Buxar 155, from Delhi 661, from Agra 544, from Lucknow 316 miles. Long. 85.15. E. Lat. 25. 37. N.
