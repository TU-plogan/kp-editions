PEREKOP, a Russian town and fortress at the entrance of the Crimea, to which it is the only practicable approach by land. The town consists of two rows of houses, which line the sides of the great road. Next to its importance as a defensive station, it is of consequence as being the residence of a commission charged with the administration of the salt lakes of the Crimea. It is a great thoroughfare during the summer, more than 20,000 loaded carts of salt passing through it for the supply of the south of Russia. The vast ditches, ramparts, and walls of this place have been recently put in good order. The population consists of Russians, Greeks, Armenians, and Tartars, and, many of the latter being migratory, is very fluctuating.
