PEEK, in nautical language, is a word used in various senses. Thus the anchor is said to be a-peek when the ship, being about to weigh, comes over her anchor in such a manner that the cable hangs perpendicularly between the hawse and the anchor.

To heave a-peek is to bring the peek so that the anchor may hang aâˆ™peek. A ship is said to ride a-peek when, lying with her main and fore-yards hoisted up, one end of her yards is brought down to the shrouds, and the other raised up on end; which is chiefly done when she lies in rivers, lest other ships, falling foul of the yards, should break them. Riding a broad peek denotes much the same thing, excepting that the yards are only raised to half the height.

Peck is also used for a room in the hold, extending from the bitts forward to the stern. In this room men of war keep their powder, and merchantmen their provisions.
