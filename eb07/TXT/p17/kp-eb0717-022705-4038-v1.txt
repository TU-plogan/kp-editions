PENZANCE, a seaport and market-town of Cornwall, in the parish of Madron and hundred of Penwith, 289 miles from London, and a few from the Land’s End. It has a tolerable harbour, which, however, is dry at low water. It is in a district which abounds in minerals, chiefly lead, tin, and copper, with some silver·. Mining operations form the chief occupation of the inhabitants. It has a market on Saturday, which is well and cheaply supplied. In virtue of the municipal corporation reform law, passed in 1835, the town annually elects the corporation, consisting of a mayor, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors; and for this purpose it is divided into two wards. The population amounted in 1801 to 3382, in 1811 to 4022, in 1821 to 5224, and in 1831 to 6563.
