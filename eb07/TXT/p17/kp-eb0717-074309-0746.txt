PILLARS, in antiquarian topography, are large single stones set up perpendicularly. Tliose of them which are found in this country were the work of the Druids; but as they are the most simple of all monuments, they are unquestionably more ancient than even Druidism itself. They were placed as memorials recording different events; as remarkable instances of God’s mercies, of contracts, singular victories, boundaries, and sometimes sepulchres. Various instances of these monuments erected by the patriarchs occur in the Old Testament. Such was that raised by Jacob at Luz, afterwards by him named Bethel; and such also was the pillar placed by him over the grave of Rachel. They were likewise marks of execrations and magical talismans. These stones, from having long been considered as objects of veneration, were at length idolatrously worshipped by the ignorant and superstitious; wherefore, after the introduction of Christianity, some had crosses cut upon them, which was considered as taking them out of the category of works devoted to the service of the devil. Vulgar superstition of a later date has led the common people to regard them as persons transformed into stone for the punishment of some crime, generally that of sabbath-breaking. This notion, however, is not confined to single stones, but is also told of whole circles; as the monuments called [7:17:744]the hurlers in Cornwall, and Polloric stones in Warwickshire. The former are by the vulgar supposed to bave once been men, who were thus transformed as a punishment for playing on the Lord’s day at a game called hurling ; the latter are believed to consist of a pagan king and his army.
