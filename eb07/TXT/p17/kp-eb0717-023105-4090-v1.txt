PERIAPATAM, a town of the south of India, in the province of Mysore, and towards the borders of the Coorg country. It is the city and domain of an ancient Polygar chief, who was conquered nearly two centuries ago by one of the rajahs of Mysore. The town and fort, and the surrounding country, were laid waste by orders of Tippoo Sultan, when the British army was approaching to it in 1790. In 1799 a battle was fought near this place, between General Stuart’s forces and those of Tippoo, in which the latter were totally defeated, and the road to Seringapatam laid open to the victorious army. This district produces about 2000 weight annually of sandal wood, which is conveyed in great quantities to Tellicherry, and thence to China and Nubia. Under the mild government of its present rajah it is recovering from the desolation to which it was exposed. Long. 76. 25. E. Lat. 12. 20. N.
