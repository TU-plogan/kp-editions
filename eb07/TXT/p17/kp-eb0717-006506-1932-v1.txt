PARAMARIBO, the principal town of Dutch Guiana, and capital of the province of Surinam. It is situated on the right bank of the beautiful river Surinam, about eighteen miles from its embouchure. It is about one mile and a half in length by about three quarters of a mile in breadth, and is built in the form of an oblong square. The streets are regularly laid out, and lined with orange, shaddock, tamarind, and lemon trees, which appear in perpetual bloom; whilst their branches are, at the same time, weighed down with fruit. The walks are covered with fine gravel and sea-shells, and not paved with large stones. The houses, which are generally of two stories in height, are sumptuously furnished. The rooms are seldom papered or plastered, but wainscoated with’ cedar, Brazilian, or mahogany wood. The town-hall is an elegant edifice, covered with tiles, the other buildings being for the most part roofed with thin split boards called shingles. In this hall the different courts are held; and underneath are the prisons for European delinquents. There is a Protestant church, a Lutheran chapel, and two Jewish synagogues, the one German, and the other Portuguese. Although not fortified, the town is defended by Fort Zelandia on the east, and by the natural defences of the river on the south-east, a large savannah on the west, and an impenetrable wood on the north-east. The citadel is separated from the town by a large esplanade, where the troops parade. There is a large and commodious military hospital. Opposite to the town the river Surinam is about a mile in breadth, and thus affords a noble road for shipping. The commerce of this town, although now surpassed by that carried on in British Guiana, is considerable; and the Dutch have made great and successful exertions to improve it. The exports are coffee, sugar, cocoa, cotton, and indigo; the imports are flour, beef, pork, herrings, salted mackerel, spermaceti candles, horses, lumber, and European manufactures. The number of inhabitants may be estimated at from 18,000 to 20,000.
