PENKRIDGE, a market-town situated within the hundred of Cuttlestone, in the county of Stafford, 129 miles from London. It stands on the river Penk, and has a market, which is held on Saturday. It is a very ancient town, being supposed to have been the Pennocrucicum of the Romans; but it has very little trade. The population amounted in 1801 to 1133, in 1811 to 1934, in 1821 to 2299, and in 1831 to 2351; but the parish, which is more extensive, appears by the last census to have contained 2991 persons.

PENMAN-Mawr, a mountain in Caernarvonshire, 1400 feet in height. It hangs perpendicularly over the sea, at so vast a height, that few spectators are able to look down the dreadful steep. On the side which is next the sea, there is a road cut out of the side of the rock, about six or seven feet wide, which winds up a steep ascent.
