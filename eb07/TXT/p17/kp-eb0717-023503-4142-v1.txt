PERM, a town and very extensive government of Russia. The province is situated chiefly in European, but partly also in Asiatic Russia, and is bounded by the government of Viatka on the west, and that of Tobolsk on the east. It has an area of 116,000 square miles, with a population of not more than 1,100,000. It is of a very diversified surface, being intersected from north to south by branches of the great Ural chain. The hills are covered with [sand and impenetrable forests, which afford abundant shelter to wild animals, such as the bear, the wild boar, the wolf, foxes, and hares, and the sable and the marten, which are hunted over their farms. It is not a productive country; the summer is warm; but towards autumn, the chill air from the mountains often blights the produce of the harvest, and renders it necessary to import corn for the sustenance of the inhabitants. It has mines of copper, iron, and salt, which it exports to the annual amount of 2000 tons of copper and 10,000 tons of iron; cattle are also exported. The inhabitants are a mixed race, partly Russian and partly of Finnish and Tartar descent. They are principally occupied as shepherds; about 50,000 are employed in the mines. Perm is an inland province. T⅛e rivers by which it is intersected are far from the sea; those on the west side of the Ural Mountains flowing into the Kama, which joins the Wolga, and those on the east side falling mostly into the Oby, the outlet of which is the frozen ocean. The inhabitants are partly Christians, partly Mahommedans and Pagans. The town of Perm is situated on the river Kama. It has some neat public buildings, such as two churches, the government-offices, a public school, and an hospital; and carries on an extensive trade in the metals wrought in the surrounding country. The population is 3800. It is 910 miles south by east of St Petersburg, and 720 east-north-east of Moscow. Long. 56. 26. 30. E. Lat. 58.1. 13. N.
