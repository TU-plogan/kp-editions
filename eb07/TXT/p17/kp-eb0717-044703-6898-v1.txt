PHILYRA, in fabulous history, was one of the Oceanides, whom Saturn met in Thrace. The god, to escape from the vigilance of Rhea, changed himself into a horse, and by Philyra had a son half a man and half a horse, called Chiron. Philyra was so ashamed of having given birth to such a monster, that she entreated the gods to change her nature; and she was accordingly metamorphosed into a tree, called by her name amongst the Greeks.
