PETERS le Port, a market-town of England, in the island of Guernsey. It is situated on the south-eastern part of the island, and consists of one long, narrow street. It is defended by two ports, one of which, called Castle Cornet, stands on a rock, separated by an arm of the sea from the land, and which commands both the town and the harbour. A pier of vast stones affords protection to the harbour, where there is good anchorage, and whence ships may depart in all states of the weather; and it also forms a pleasant and extended walk. There is some trade with Newfoundland; and formerly there was much smuggling carried on, but that has been stopped by the introduction of a custom-house. The population has much increased of late years, and in 1831 amounted to 5966 males and 7924 females.
