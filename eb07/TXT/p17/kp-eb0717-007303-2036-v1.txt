PARINACOCHAS, a province of Peru, in the department of Ayachucho. It has an elevated situation in that part of the chain of the Andes which sweeps down in a circular form towards Arequipa. The temperature therefore is throughout cold, with the exception of some hollows amongst the mountains, where it is comparatively mild; and grain, herbs, and fruits, are produced in abundance. The mountains abound in mines of silver and of gold. The pasture of this province is plentiful, and of excellent quality; and numerous herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep and goats, are reared in the plains and the valleys. In the more elevated parts there are abundance of guanucas, or Peruvian camels. The chief occupations of the inhabitants consist in superintending their live stock, and manufacturing woollen cloths. In this province there is a lake called Parinaco-cha, seven leagues in length by about one in breadth, and in which a white bird of the name of panuira breeds. This name has been corrupted into Parina, and the word cocha or lake being added, has given rise to the designation of the province. The chief town is called Pausa, but it does not appear to be a place of any importance. The population, about 12,000 souls, is dispersed in some thirty settlements.
