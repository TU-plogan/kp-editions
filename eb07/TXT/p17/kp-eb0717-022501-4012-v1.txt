PENSIONARY, or Pensioner, a person who has an appointment or yearly sum, payable during life, by way of acknowledgment, and charged on the estate of a prince, company, or particular person.

Grand Pensionary, an appellation formerly applied to the first minister of the states of Holland. The grand pensionary was chairman in the assemblies of the states of that province; he proposed the matters to be consulted on, collected the votes, formed and pronounced the resolutions of the states, opened letters, conferred with foreign [7:17:226] ministers, and performed various other functions. His business was also to inspect the finances, to maintain the authority of the states, and to see that the laws were observed; and he was perpetual deputy of the states-general of the United Provinces. His commission was, however, only given him for five years, after which it was deliberated whether or not it should be renewed; but there is no instance of its being revoked, and therefore death only put an end to the functions of this important minister.

Pensionary was also the first minister of the regency of each city in Holland. His office was to give his advice in affairs relating to the government, either of the state in general, or of the city in particular; and in assemblies of the states of the province hebfficiated as speaker in behalf of his city.
