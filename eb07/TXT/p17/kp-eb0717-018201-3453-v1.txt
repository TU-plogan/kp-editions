These islands are far from being fertile, and when the surface is not bare rock, it consists of sand, with a greater or less proportion of vegetable soil. The larger islands 'are covered with trees, bushes, and grass. In the large islands traces of the kangaroo are to be seen, and turtle-tracks on the beaches. Their names are Vanderlin’s Island, Northwest, South-west, and Centre Islands. The latitude of Centre Island is 15. 39. S.
