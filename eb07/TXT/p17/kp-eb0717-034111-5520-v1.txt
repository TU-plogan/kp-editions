PHEBE, a deaconess of the port of Corinth, called Cenchrea. St Paul had a particular esteem for this holy woman; and Theodoret thinks the apostle lodged for some time at her house, whilst he continued at or near Corinth. It is thought that she brought to Rome the epistle he addressed to the Romans, in which she is recommended in so advantageous a manner. The apostle says (Rom. xvi. 1, 2), “I commend unto you Phebe our sister, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea, that ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you; for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.” Some moderns have advanced a notion that Phebe was the wife of St Paul; but none of the ancients has said any thing to justify such an opinion. It is generally supposed that, in quality of deaconess, she was employed by the church in Some ministrations suitable to her sex and condition; as to visit and instruct the Christian women, to attend them in their sickness, and to distribute alms amongst them.
