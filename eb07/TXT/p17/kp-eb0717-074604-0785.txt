PINEROLO, one of the provinces into which the continental part of the kingdom of Sardinia, in Italy, is divided. It is bounded on the north and north-west by Susa, on the east by Turin, on the south by Saluzzo, and on the west by France. It extends over 550 square miles, and contains one city, forty-six towns and villages, with 125,000 inhabitants. A portion of the Cottian Alps is comprehended in this province, in which are found the four valleys of Lucerna, Perosa, San Martino, and Pragelato, which were inhabited by the Waldenses. The district is well watered by several streams, the principal of which, the Clusone, receives the other river. Though for the most part mountainous, the valleys are productive, and there is sufficient corn raised for the consumption of the inhabitants, whilst silk, chestnuts, and turpentine serve the purpose of exchange for the few foreign commodities that are needed. The capital of the province is the city of the same name. It is situated at the foot of the Alps, and is the see of a bishop, whose sumptuous cathedral, with six monasteries and five nunneries, are the most distinguished objects. It contains 11,500 inhabitants, who spin wool and silk, manufacture goods of both materials, and trade also in corn, wine, cattle, and charcoal. It was formerly the residence of the Dukes of Savoy, most of whom were buried in it. Long. 7. 8. E. Lat. 44. 53. N.
