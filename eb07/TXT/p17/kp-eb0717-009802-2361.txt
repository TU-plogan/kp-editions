PARRHASIUS, a celebrated painter, the son of Evenor, was a native of Ephesus, and flourished in the year 397 before Christ, being the contemporary of Zeuxis, Eupompus, and Timanthes. He was the first who succeeded in giving the proper proportion to his figures, in throwing the expression of the passions into the countenance, and in causing the figure to appear to start from the canvass. Several who had preceded him were successful in finishing particular parts, but none could rival him in putting the whole together. Zeuxis was the only one of his contemporaries who at all approached him, and even he was at last obliged to acknowledge his inferiority. (See Zeuxis.) One of his most curious paintings was a representation of the Demos of Athens, in which he had contrived to exhibit all the various passions with which that celebrated people were affected. His painting of the Hoplites, or the armed man running, had the effect of a person perspiring from excessive exertion; and another who was taking off his arms seemed to be panting for breath. Parrhasius was, like Zeuxis, distinguished for his vanity and arrogant mode of life. He used to wear a purple dress, a golden crown on his head, to hold in his hand a staff studded with golden nails, and to wear golden latchets to his shoes (Aelian. Var. Hist. ix. 11). He was once beaten by Timanthes, in the subject of Ajax disputing with Ulysses respecting the arms of Achilles (Plin. xxxv. 36, 7-11; Athen, xii. 543, e. d. xv. 687, b. c.).

Parrhasius, Janus, a famous grammarian in Italy, who was born at Cosenza, in the kingdom of Naples, in the year 1470. He was intended for the law, the profession of his ancestors; but he refused to pursue it, and cultivated classical learning. His real name was Johannes Paulus Parisius; but, according to the practice of the grammarians of the age, he took instead of it that of Parrhasius. He taught at Milan with much reputation, being admired for a graceful delivery, in which he chiefly excelled other professors. It was this charm in his voice which brought a vast concourse of people to his lectures; and, amongst others, he had the pleasure of seeing General Trimoles, who was then threescore years of age. He went to Rome when Alexander VI. was pope, and had nearly been involved in the misfortunes of Bernardini Cajetan and Silius Savello, with whom he had some correspondence; but he escaped the danger, by the information of Thomas Phoedrus, professor of rhetoric, and canon of St John Lateran, whose advice he followed by retiring from Rome. Soon afterwards, he was appointed public professor of rhetoric at Milan; but the liberty which he took in censuring the teachers there as arrant blockheads provoked them in return to asperse his morals. He, in consequence, went to Vicenza, where he obtained a larger salary; and he held this professorship till the states of the Venetians were laid waste by the troops of the League; upon which he went to his native country, having made his escape through the army of the enemy. He was at Cosenza when his old friend Phoedrus persuaded Julius to send for him to Rome; and although that design proved abortive by the death of the pope, yet, on the recommendation of John Lascaris, he was called thither under Leo X. the successor of Julius. Leo was before favourably inclined towards him, and on his arrival at Rome appointed him professor of polite literature. He had been now some time married to a daughter of Demetrius Chalcondylas; and he took with him to Rome, Basil Chalcondylas, brother of Demetrius Chalcondylas, professor of the Greek tongue at Milan. But he did not long enjoy the office which had been conferred upon him by the pope; for, worn out by his studies and labours, he became so afflicted with the gout, that for some years there was no part of his body unaffected except his tongue. He left Rome and returned to Calabria, his native country, where he at last died in the greatest misery. Several works have been ascribed to him.
