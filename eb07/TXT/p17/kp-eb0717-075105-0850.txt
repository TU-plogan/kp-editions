PISO, Lucius Calpurnius, surnamed the Frugal, on account of his parsimony, was descended of the illustrious family of the Pisos, which gave so many great men to the Roman republic. He was tribune of the people in the year 149 before Christ, and afterwards consul. During his tribuneship he published a law against the crime of concussion or extortion, entitled Lex Calpurnia de pecuniis repetundis. He happily ended the war in Sicily. To reward the services of one of his sons, who had distinguished himself in that expedition, he left him by his will a golden crown, weighing twenty pounds. Piso joined to the qualities of a good citizen the talents of a lawyer, an orator, and an historian.
