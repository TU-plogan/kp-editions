PELEG, son of Eber, was born in the year of the world 1757. The Scripture says his father gave him the name of Peleg, signifying division, because in his time the earth began to be divided (Gen. xi. 16; x. 25); whether it was that Noah had begun to distribute the earth amongst his descendants, some years before the building of Babel, or that Peleg came into the world the same year that Babel was begun, and at the division of languages, or that Eber by a spirit of prophecy gave his son the name of Peleg some years before the tower of Babel was begun, is not absolutely certain. That which perplexes the interpreters is, that Peleg came into the world not above a century after the deluge. But it would seem, that the number of men in existence was not then sufficient for such an undertaking as that of Babel. In the next place, Joktan the brother of Peleg had already thirteen sons at the time of this dispersion, which happened after the confusion of Babel (Gen. x. 26, 27, 28). But Peleg being born in the thirty-fourth year of Eber (Gen. xi. 16), it is impossible his brother Joktan should have had such a number of children at the birth of Peleg. It would seem, therefore, that he was not born at the time of the dispersion. ^ Î¹ To this it may be answered, that Moses has there enumerated the names of the thirteen sons of Joktan (in Gen. x. 26) by way of anticipation, though they were not born until some time after the confusion at Babel; but as they possessed a very large country, it was convenient to take notice of them, and to name them amongst the other descendants of Noah, who divided the provinces of the East amongst themselves. However this may have been, at the age of thirty years Peleg begat Reu, and died at the age of 239.
