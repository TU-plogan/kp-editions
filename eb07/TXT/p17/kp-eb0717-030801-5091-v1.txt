PERUGIA, a delegation or province of the States of the Church, in Italy, and a part of the ancient Umbria. It is 1793 square miles in extent, and contains seven cities, nineteen market-towns, with numerous villages, and 181,540 inhabitants. It includes a large portion of the Apennines, and is therefore very hilly; but that part through which the Tiber passes is a succession of beautiful and fertile valleys, producing abundance of corn, pulse, fruit, cattle, silk, oil, and wine, besides much honey and wax. The capital is a city of the same name, situated in a rich valley between the Tiber and Lago Perugia, and surrounded by walls and ditches, but not deemed capable of being defended. It is the see of an archbishop, and, besides the cathedral, adorned with the pencil of Peter Perugiano and óf Raffaele, contains forty-five parish churches, twenty-four monasteries, twenty-five nunneries, and several charitable institutions; besides a university, which has of late years greatly declined. There are several learned societies, a fine theatre, and some pleasing promenades. In Perugia, though an ancient city, few remains of antiquity are to be seen. The most remarkable of those that remain are the gate of the Grimana Palace, called the arch of Augustus, and the temple of Mars, at the gate of St Angelo. The population is doubtful, some authors stating it at 68,000, whilst Balbi, the latest authority, estimates it only at 30,000. A considerable trade in the raw productions of the fertile soil which surrounds the city centres here; and there are manufactures of silks and velvets, of woollen goods, hats, leather, tartaric acid, brandy, and li- 4 queurs. Many of the private houses are adorned with và-luable paintings of the ancient masters. Long. 12. 16. 53. E. Lat. 48. 6. 46. N.
