PATHHEAD, a large well-built village of Scotland, in the parishes of Crichton and Cranstoun, in the county of Mid-Lothian, ten miles and a half from Edinburgh. It consists of one long street, built upon both sides of the road leading to Kelso. The houses are generally of one story, and occupied by those engaged in husbandry, in collieries, and in furnishing the district with those necessaries which cannot be easily supplied from the capital. The population is about 1000. The parish church of Crichton is about two miles distant, and was founded in the year 1449. It is a neat little building, of Gothic architecture, in the form of a cross; and the internal arrangement is also Gothic. Near it is the magnificent ruin of Crichton Castle, which, for beauty of architecture, internal accommodation, and strength of walls and situation, is hardly to be excelled by any of the old baronial castles of Scotland.

Pathhead, a large and populous village in the parish of Dysart, in Fifeshire, Scotland. It is contiguous to the town of Kirkcaldy, being merely separated from it by a steep ascent called the Path. The village consists of three streets of plain substantial houses, inhabited by a most industrious class, who are chiefly engaged in the weaving and manufacturing of linen goods, especially of checks and ticks. There are two places of worship, one belonging to the Established Church, the other to the body of Antiburghers. An elegant and commodious school was erected a few years ago, for the free education of 150 children, by the trustees of the late Robert Philp, Esq. of Kirkcaldy, who left a large sum of money for that purpose. The population in 1831 amounted to 3330.
