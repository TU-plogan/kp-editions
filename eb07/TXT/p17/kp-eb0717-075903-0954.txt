PITOT, Henry, descended of a noble family of Languedoc, was born at Aramont, in the diocese of Usez, on the 29th of May 1695, and died there on the 27th of December 1771, aged seventy-six. He studied the mathe-riiatics without a master, and went to Paris in 1718, where he formed a close friendship with the illustrious Reaumur. In 1724 he was admitted a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, and in a few years he rose to the rank of pensioner. Besides a great number of Memoirs printed in the collection of that society, he published in 1731 the Theory of the Working of Ships, in one volume 4to; a work of considerable merit, which was translated into English, and caused the author to be admitted into the Royal Society of London. In the year 1740, the states-general of Languedoc made choice of him as their chief engineer, and at the same time gave him the appointment of inspector-general of the canal which unites the two seas. That province is also indebted to him for several monuments of his genius, which will transmit his name with lustre to posterity. The city of Montpellier being in want of water, Pitot brought from a distance of three leagues the water of two springs, which furnish a plentiful supply of that necessary article. The water is brought to the magnificent

Place du Peyron, and thence distributed throughout the city. This work is the admiration of all strangers. The celebrated Marshal de Saxe was the great patron and friend of Pitot, who had taught him the mathematics. In 1754 he was honoured with the order of St Michael. In the year 1735 he married Marie Leonine Pharambier de Sab-balloua, descended of a very ancient noble family of Navarre; but by this marriage he had only one son, who became advocate-general of the court of accounts, aids, and finances of Montpellier. Pitot was a practical philosopher, and a man of uncommon probity and candour. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Sciences of Montpellier, before which his eloge was pronounced in 1772, by Μ. de Ratte, perpetual secretary, in presence of the states of Languedoc; and, in the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris, the same honour was done him by the Abbé de Fouche, who was then secretary.
