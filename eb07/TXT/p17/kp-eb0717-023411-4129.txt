PERISTALTIC, a vermicular spontaneous motion of the intestines, performed by the contraction of the circular and longitudinal fibres of which the fleshy coats of the intestines are composed; by means of which the chyle is driven into the orifices of the lacteal veins, and the faeces are protruded towards the anus.
