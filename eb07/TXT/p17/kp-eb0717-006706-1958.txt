PARASANG, an ancient Persian measure, which differed at different times and in different places, being usually thirty, sometimes forty, and occasionally fifty stadia or furlongs. The word, according to Littleton, is formed from parasch angarius, that is, the space a postman rides from one station or angaria to another.
