PHOCYLIDES, a Greek poet, was a native of Miletus, in Ionia, and flourished b. c. 544, being the contemporary of Theognis. He was the author of some epic poems and elegies; but, of all his works, only a poem (Carmen Nutheti-con), of two hundred and seventeen verses, has been preserved. As it is only alluded to by an ancient scholiast on Nicander, there is some doubt if it be really the production of Phocylides, as none of the passages quoted by Plato, Aristotle, Strabo, and other writers, are to be found in any part of this poem. It is published in all the editions of the Sententiae of Theognis; but the most valuable one is that by J. A. Schier, with a Latin translation, and learned annotations, Leipzig, 1751, 8vo.
