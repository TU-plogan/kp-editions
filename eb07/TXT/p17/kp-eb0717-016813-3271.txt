PEDOMETER, or Podometer, formed from ττους, pes, foot, and μtτξοv, measure, a mechanical instrument, in the form of a watch, consisting of various wheels with teeth, catching in one another, all disposed in the same plane, which, by means of a chain or string fastened to a man’s foot, or to the wheel of a chariot, advance a notch each step, or each revolution of the wheel; so that the number being marked on the edge of each wheel, one may number the paces, or measure exactly the distance from one place to another. There are some of them which mark the time on a dial-plate, and, being very much like a watch, are accordingly worn in the pocket. '
