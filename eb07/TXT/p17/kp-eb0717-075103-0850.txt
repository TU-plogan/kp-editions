PISISTRATUS, the son of Hippocrates, was descended from one of the most illustrious families of Athens, which claimed to derive their origin from Codrus, and through him traced their pedigree to Nestor and the Pylian kings. At the time that he began to take part in the political affairs of his country, there were three factions struggling for power; those of the Lowlands, Highlands, and Coast. Megacles, chief of the great family of the Alemaeonidae, took the lead of the Coast party, whilst Pisistratus headed the democratical faction of the Highlanders. Solon had tried to calm their passions by the wisdom of his laws, but the contending parties had refused to submit; and when he returned, after an absence of several years, he found much confusion, and everything tending towards a state of anarchy. Pisistratus was determined to secure to himself the chief authority in the government; and by pretending to the people that he was in danger of his life, he obtained a guard for the security of his person, and it was not long before he made himself master of the citadel. He thus became what was afterwards called Tyrant of Athens, b. c. 560; though Herodotus expressly states, that all the laws continued in force, and that the constitutional powers of the magistrates were not in the least restricted. Solon used to say, that were it not for his ambition, there would not be a man better disposed, or a more worthy citizen, in Athens. Though Solon was no doubt deeply mortified that his countrymen were unable to maintain the political constitution which he had formed for them, it does not appear that he broke off all connection with Pisistratus. He took the wiser course of trying to direct his measures for the benefit of his country, and assisted him in the administration of the commonwealth.

How long Pisistratus continued to maintain himself in power is not stated, but he was at last driven into exile, by the two parties of Megacles and Lycurgus uniting their strength. A dispute between the victors induced Megacles to propose an accommodation with Pisistratus, upon condition that he should marry his daughter; and this was at once acceded to. A quarrel, however, with Megacles again took place, and Pisistratus was obliged to retire to Eretria in Euboea. Here he continued to increase his influence, till a favourable opportunity presented itself of regaining his former position. It was in the eleventh year of his second banishment that he returned, when the Athenians flocked to his standard, and, in the words of Herodotus, preferred tyranny to liberty. He defeated the Alemaeonidae, and entered Athens, promising safety to all who returned quietly to their homes. Some of the leaders were of course banished, but the great body of the people seem to have benefited by the change. He was kind to the poor, and introduced many laws and regulations which were highly advantageous to his country. He was a lover of learning, and is said to have been the first who arranged the poems of Homer as we now have them. Cicero speaks of his eloquence in the highest terms. He continued to direct the administration of Athens till bis death, B. c. 527, thirty-three years after his first usurpation, of which time he ruled seventeen years. He left two sons, Hippias and Hipparchus, who succeeded to his power.
