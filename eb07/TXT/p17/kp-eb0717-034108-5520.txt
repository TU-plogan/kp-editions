PHAROS, a small oblong island, adjoining the continent of Egypt, and over-against Alexandria. On this island stood a lighthouse of the same name, having four sides, each a stadium in length, and a tower so elevated as to be seen nearly a hundred miles off. Some affirm that each of its four corners rested on a large sea-crab of hard transparent stone brought from Ethiopia or Memphis; but others imagine that the crabs were only added externally to the base by way of ornament, or as emblematical of its situation and use. The architect was Sostrates the Cnidian, as appears by an inscription engraved upon the tower, under Ptolemy Philadelphus, who expended upon it eight hundred talents. On account of the port of Alexandria, the entrance to which was difficult and dangerous, the Pharos was called “the key of the Egyptian Sea,” and even of Egypt itself; and Pharos, from being originally a proper name, at length became an appellative to denote all kinds of lighthouses.

Pharos, a lighthouse or pile of building, raised near a port, where fire is kept burning in the night, to guide and direct vessels near at hand. The pharos of Alexandria, built on the island of Pharos, was anciently so famous that it communicated its name to all the rest. This magnificent tower consisted of several stories and galleries, with a lantern at the top, in which a light being kept continually burning, might be seen many leagues at sea, and along the coast. It was accounted one of the seven wonders of the world. It was built by the celebrated architect Sostrates, a native of Cnidus, or, according to some, by Dei-phanes, the father of Sostrates, and cost Ptolemy Philadelphus eight hundred talents. See Sea-Lights.
