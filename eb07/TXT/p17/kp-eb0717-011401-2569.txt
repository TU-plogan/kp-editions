PASTO, a province of Colombia, in South America, in the department of Cauca. It is the most southerly province in the department, lying next to Quito, within half a degree of the equator, and under the seventy-sixth meridian west from Greenwich. The triple chain of the Magdalena cordilleras, and the double chain of those of Quito, here unite into one mass, which is called by Humboldt the Knot of the Mountains of Los Pastos. The inhabited parts of Pasto are elevated 10,000 feet above the level of the sea. It is the Thibet of equinoctial America. As its name indicates, it abounds in excellent pastures, and consequently in cattle, and is watered by several considerable rivers. Although it is situated at a great height, yet the temperature is also high, from its vicinity to the equator; and wheat and other productions of such climates are found here. In the woods grows the tree which yields a resin called in that country mopa-mopa, from which the natives make a very beautiful varnish, of so durable a quality that it cannot be softened by boiling water, nor dissolved by acids. In its most northern part rises the volcano of Pasto, of which the last eruption took place in the year 1727. The principal town, also called Pasto, is situated about eighty miles south-south-west from Popayan, in latitude 1. 15. north, and longitude 76. 46. west. It is a considerable place, containing some seven or eight thousand inhabitants, who are celebrated for the manufacture of a peculiar species of cabinet-work. That portion of the grain of Pasto which is exported is principally conveyed to Popayan.
