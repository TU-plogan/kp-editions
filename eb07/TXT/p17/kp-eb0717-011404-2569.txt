PATAECI, in Mythology, images of gods which the Phoenicians carried upon the prows of their gallies. Herodotus denominates them πατωικοι. The word is Phoenician, and derived from pethica, signifying titulus. ^[1. See Bocchart’s Clianaan, lib. ii. cap. 3. ] But Scaliger does not agree in this, and Morin derives it from itilinκος, monkey, an animal vVhich had been an object of worship amongst the Egyptians, and might therefore have been honoured by their neighbours. Mr Elsner has observed, however, that Herodotus does not call the pataeci gods; but that they obtained this dignity from the liberality of Hesychius, Suidas, and other ancient lexicoraphers, who place them at the stern of ships, whereas Herodotus placed them at the prow. Scaliger, Bochart, and Selden have bestowed some pains upon this subject; and Morin has likewise inserted a learned dissertation concerning it, in the Mémoires de ïAcad, des Inscript, et des Belles Lettres; but Mr Elsner thinks it defective in point of evidence.
