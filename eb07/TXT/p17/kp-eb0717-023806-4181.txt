PERPIGNAN, an arrondissement of the department of the Eastern Pyrenees, in France, extending over 557 square miles. It comprehends seven cantons, divided into eighty-five communes, and containing 57,800 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, the see of a bishop, and the seat of the departmental courts of law and boards of government. It stands on the left bank of the river Tet, about ten miles from the Mediterranean Sea. As a frontier place towards Spain, it is strongly fortified, and defended by a citadel.
