PATRIOTISM is a love of one’s country, one of the noblest passions that can warm and animate the human breast. “Zeal for the public good,” says Mr Addison, “is the characteristic of a man of honour and a gentleman, and must take place of pleasures, profits, and all other private gratifications “whosoever wants this motive, is an open enemy, or an inglorious neuter, to mankind, in proportion to the misapplied advantages with which nature and fortune have blessed him.” This love of our country does not import an attachment to any particular soil, climate, or spot of earth, where perhaps we first drew our breath, though those natural ideas are often associated with the moral ones, and, like external signs or symbols, help to ascertain and bind them; but it imports an affection to that moral system or community which is governed by the same laws and magistrates, and the several parts of which are variously connected one with the other, and all united [7:17:144]upon the basis of a common interest. Wherever this love of our country prevails in its genuine vigour and extent, it swallows up all sordid and selfish regards; it conquers the love of ease, power, pleasure, and wealth; nay, when the partialities of friendship, gratitude, private affection, or regards to a family, come in competition with it, it teaches us to sacrifice all, in order to maintain the rights and promote and defend the honour and happiness of our country.
