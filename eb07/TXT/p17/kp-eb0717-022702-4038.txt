PENULA, amongst the ancient Romans, was a coarse garment or cloak worn in cold or in rainy weather. It was shorter than the lacerna, and therefore more proper for travellers. It was generally brown, and succeeded the toga after the state became monarchical. Augustus abolished the custom of wearing the penula over the toga, considering it as too effeminate for Romans; and the aediles had orders to suffer none to appear in the circus or forum with the lacerna or penula. Writers are not agreed as to the precise difference between these two articles of dress; but we are told that they were chiefly worn by the lower orders of the people.
