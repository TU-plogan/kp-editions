PETCHELEE, a considerable and extensive province of China, in which Peking, the capital, is situated. Being one of the northerly provinces of China, its climate is cold, and the winter is severe, all the rivers being frozen during four months in the year, from November to March. It is in general of a sandy soil; a great part of it is a dead flat, and the sea-coast is bordered with extensive marshes. To the north the country is elevated, and rises into that range of lofty mountains along which the great wall is conducted. The country is not favourable for the production of rice; but it is well fitted for wheat, barley, and the other grains of the temperate climates. The principal river is the Peiho, which rises within the Tartar frontier, and, after passing Peking, discharges itself into the Yellow Sea, or Gulf of Petchelee. By means of this sea a considerable trade is carried on with Corea and Japan. But this province is chiefly indebted for its prosperity to the communications established between its rivers and the Imperial Canal, which affords a navigable communication across the whole empire. The population is estimated at 38,000,000.
