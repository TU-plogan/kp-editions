PEST, or Pesth, a city of the Austrian kingdom of Hungary, the capital of a circle, extending over 4202 square miles, and which comprehends two cities, twenty markettowns, and 319 villages, with 380,000 inhabitants. The city is situated on the left bank of the Danube, opposite to Buda, with which it is connected by a bridge of boats. The town has no walls nor gates, and is defended by a citadel. It is the trading portion of the Hungarian metropolis, and abounds in manufactures of various kinds, though mostly on a small scale. It has a university and several other institutions for education. It contains 3400 houses, and about 60,000 inhabitants. The vicinity is fertile, and produces much good wine. In the early part of 1838, Pest suffered severely from an inundation of the Danube, by which many houses were destroyed, and a great number of individuals lost their lives. Judging from the accounts which have been published, the desolation occasioned by this sudden and resist less outburst of the river must have been truly terrific, and many years will probably elapse before the injury done by the flood can be fully repaired.
