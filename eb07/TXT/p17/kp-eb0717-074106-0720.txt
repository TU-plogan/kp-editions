PIERINO del Vaga, an eminent Italian painter, the son of poor parents, and a native of Tuscany, was born about the year 1500. He was placed apprentice with a grocer in Florence, and got some instructions from the painters to whom he was sent with colours and pencils; but an artist named Vaga taking him to Rome, he was called Del Vaga, from living with him, his real name being Buonacorsi. He studied anatomy and the other sciences necessary for his profession, and had somewhat of everything that was good in his compositions. After Raffaelle’s death, he united with Julio Romano and Francisco Penni in finishing the works in the Vatican which were left imperfect by their common master; and, to confirm their friendship, he married Penni’s sister. He gained the highest reputation by his performances in the palace of Prince Doria at Genoa; but the multiplicity of his occupations, and the vivacity of his imagination, exhausted his spirits in the flower of his age; and he died in the year 1547.
