PARANYMPH, amongst the ancients, the person who waited on the bridegroom, and directed the nuptial solemnities, and who was also called pronubus and auspex, because the ceremonies began by taking auspicia. As the paranymph officiated only on the part of the bridegroom, a woman called pronuba officiated on the part of the bride.
