PAO, San Joan del, a town of Columbia, in South America, about fifty leagues south-west from Caraccas. It is situated on the river Pao, the course of which was turned about the end of the seventeenth century, and, instead of flowing into Lake Valencia, directed into the Portugueza, a branch of the Apure, which itself is an affluent of the Orinoco. The town consists of several handsome streets, has a neat parish church, and is inhabited chiefly by the proprietors[7:17:3] of the cattle reared on the fertile plains which surround the town. It contains a population of between 5000 and 6000. Lat. 9. 20. N.
