PHREATIS, or Phreattium, in Grecian antiquity, was a court belonging to the civil government of Athens, situated upon the sea-shore, in the Piraeus. The name is commonly derived απo row pgíaro¢, because it stood in a pit; or, as others suppose, it is formed from the name of the hero Phre-atus. This court heard such causes as concerned persons who had fled from their own country for murder, or those who had fled for involuntary murder, and had afterwards committed a deliberate and wilful murder. The first w∩o was tried in this place was Teucer, on a groundless suspicion that he had been accessory to the death of Ajax. The accused was not allowed to land, or so much as to cast anchor, but pleaded his cause in his bark, and if found guilty, he was committed to the mercy of the winds and waves, or, as some say, suffered there condign punishment; but if innocent, he was only cleared of the second fact, and, according to custom, underwent a twelvemonth’s banishment for the former.
