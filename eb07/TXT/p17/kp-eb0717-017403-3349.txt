PEIRCE, James, an eminent dissenting minister, born at Wapping, London, in the year 1674. He was educated at Utrecht and Leyden; after which he spent some time at Oxford, in,order to enjoy the benefit of frequenting the Bodleian Library. He then for two years preached the Sunday-evening lecture at the meeting-house in Miles Lane, London, and afterwards settled at Cambridge. In 1713 he was removed to a congregation at Exeter, where he continued until the year 1718; when the Calvinists amongst the dissenters having proposed a subscription to articles of faith, which were to be signed by all the dissenting ministers in the kingdom, he refused, and was consequently ejected from his congregation. Upon this, a new meeting was opened at Exeter, of which Mr Peirce continued minister till his death in 1726. He was a man of strict virtue, exemplary piety, and great learning; and he wrote, 1. Exercitatio Philosophica de Homoemeria Anaxagorea; 2. Thirteen pieces on the Controversy between the Church of England and the Dissenters; 3. Ten pieces on the Controversy about the Ejectment at Exeter; 4. Six pieces on the Doctrine of the Trinity; 5. A Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistles of St Paul to the Colossians, Philippians, and Hebrews; 6. An Essay in favour of giving the Eucharist to Children; and, 7. Fourteen Sermons.
