PARABLE, a fable or allegorical instruction, founded on something real or apparent in nature or history, from which a moral is drawn by comparing it with something wherein the people are more immediately concerned: such are the parables of Dives and Lazarus, of the Prodigal Son, of the Ten Virgins, and others. Dr Blair observes, that of parables, which form a part of allegory, the prophetical writings are full; and if to us they sometimes appear obscure, we must remember, that in those early times it was universally the mode throughout all the eastern nations to convey sacred truths under mysterious figures and representations.
