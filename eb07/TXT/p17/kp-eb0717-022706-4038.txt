PEOR, a famous mountain beyond Jordan, which Eusebius places between Heshbon and Livias. The mountains Nebo, Pisgah, and Peor, were near one another, and probably formed parts of the same chain or ridge. It is very likely that Peor took its name from some deity of the same name, which was worshipped there; for Peor, Phegor, or Baal-peor, was known in this country.
