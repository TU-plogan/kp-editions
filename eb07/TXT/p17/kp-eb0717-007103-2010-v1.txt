PARGA, a town of Greece, situated on the coast of Albania, fourteen miles from Cape Bianco, and ten from Paxos. It is built on a conical rock about 250 feet above the level of the sea, which surrounds it on three sides, and, with a fortress on the narrow neck which joins it to the main, forms a strong post. The territory around extends two or three miles in a circle, and till 1818 was inhabited by a population of from 3000 to 4000 persons, who had cultivated the soil with equal care and success. They were mostly persons who bad established themselves there in opposition to Ali Pasha, who reigned absolute master of Albania, under the nominal authority of the Grand Signior. These people wished to place themselves under the protection of the British government; but the terms upon which they stood with Ali prevented an honourable acceptance of their proposal. After some warlike demonstrations, which were followed by negotiations, Ali agreed, on the place being given up to him, to pay the large sum of L.200,000 to the inhabitants, and give them permission to leave the territory. This most of them embraced, and were removed to the islands where British protection afforded them security. Long. 20. 23. 30. E. Lat. 39. 16. 15. Ν.
