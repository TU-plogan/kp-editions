PHOCAEA, the most northern of the cities of Ionia, was situated on the coast, about two hundred stadia from Smyrna. It was founded by a colony of Phocians, led by two Athenians, Philogenes and Damon, and was not admitted into the Ionian confederacy till it had received, from Teos and Erythrae, kings of the race of the Codridae. Its citizens are said to have been the first amongst the Greeks who extended their voyages to great distances; in fact, the Adriatic, Tuscany, and even Tartessus, were visited in pursuit of commercial speculations. After the conquest of Croesus, Cyrus sent his general Harpagus to reduce the Greek cities of Ionia, and the Phocaeans abandoned their city rather than submit to the Persian yoke, b. c. 544. Some of them returned, but the greater part eventually settled in Italy, and founded the city of Velia. Phocaea, however, must still have continued to exist, as it furnished three ships in the Ionian revolt. Livy describes the city as standing at the bottom of a bay, and as being of an oblong shape. It enclosed a space of two miles and a half in length, and then contracted on both sides into a narrow wedge-like form, which place they called Lampter, or the lighthouse. It had two excellent harbours; the one towards the south was called Naustathmos, and the other was situated close to Lampter. It was taken and plundered by the Romans in the war against Antiochus. Phocaea founded Massilia, and Attalia in Corsica. The site is still called Palaio Fokia.
