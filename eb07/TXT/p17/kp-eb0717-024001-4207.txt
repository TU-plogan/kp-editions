PERSAIM, or Bassein, a town of the Birman empire, and province of Pegu, situated on the river Irrawaddy, which is here called Persaim, and is navigable for ships up to the town. Owing to the inundation of the river, the town is built on piles of wood eight feet from the ground, which admit the tide under them to wash the place, which is the receptacle of every thing that is filthy. The houses are built of wood and mats. During the wars between the Peguans and Birmans this town was burned down, and has never recovered its former splendour. The British obtained, in 1757, a grant of land for the establishment of a factory, but this grant was never ratified by the king. Long. 95. 0. E. Lat. 16. 50. N.
