PASSIR, a town and district of Borneo, pleasantly situated on a river of the same name, about fifty miles from its mouth, near the bottom of a large bay, on the eastern side of the island. The river is joined by five other tributary streams, and is very rapid near the town, above which the tide ascends, rising to the height of several feet. The u town consists of three hundred wooden houses, situated on the northern side of the river, most of them inhabited by Buggess merchants. This was formerly a place of considerable trade. In the year 1772 the East India Company attempted to establish a factory here for the sale of opium, piece-goods, &c.; but the plan was frustrated by a commotion amongst the natives, at which the English commander took an alarm, and quitted the country. Passir has since this period been seldom visited by Europeans; more especially since several vessels have been cut off by the numerous pirates who frequent the coast and the neighbouring islands. The Chinese who have settled here are remarkably industrious, and are in possession of the principal trade. The surrounding country is fertile, and yields in great abundance rice, besides benzoin, aloes, pepper, cassia, and long nutmegs; also various kinds of fruit, excellent mastic and other gums, particularly dragon’s blood; honey, gold dust, and camphor. The imports are nearly similar to those of the other Malay ports, namely, opium, fire-arms, gunpowder, lead, iron, and steel, cutlery, swords, cloths, chintzes, looking-glasses, &c. The inhabitants do not bear a good character. They are fraudulent and treacherous, and have cut off many ships in the most treacherous manner. They are also unjust in their weights and measures, and are expert in the practice of various other frauds. The country is flat and unhealthy, being covered with thick woods, and annually overflowed. The exhalations from this moisture, and the thick fogs, are extremely insalubrious. The thick fogs turn to rain, and are accompanied by chilling winds. The great numbers of frogs and vermin which are generated by the heat, and afterwards destroyed, occasion an intolerable stench, and add to the unhealthiness of the place. Long, of the town 116. 10.
