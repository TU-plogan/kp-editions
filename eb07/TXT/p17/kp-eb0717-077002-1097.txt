PITTACUS, a native of Mitylene, in Lesbos, was one of the seven wise men of Greece. His father’s name was Hyrradius. With the assistance of the sons of Alcaens, he delivered his country from the oppression of the tyrant Melanchrus; and, in the war which the Athenians waged against Lesbos, he appeared at the head of his countrymen, and challenged to single combat Phrynon, the enemy’s general. As the event of the war seemed to depend upon this combat, Pittacus had recourse to artifice, and, when engaged, entangled his adversary in a net which he had concealed under bis shield, and easily despatched him. He was amply rewarded for this victory; and his countrymen, sensible of his merit, unanimously appointed him governor of their city, with unlimited authority. In this capacity, Pittacus behaved with the greatest moderation and prudence; and after he had governed his fellow-citizens with the strictest justice, and enforced the most salutary laws, he voluntarily resigned the sovereign power after having enjoyed it for ten years; observing, that the virtues and innocence[7:17:771] of private life were incompatible with the power and influence of a sovereign. His disinterestedness gained him many admirers; and when the Mitylenians wished to reward his public services by presenting him with an immense tract of territory, he refused to accept more land than could be contained within the space to which a javelin could be thrown. He died in the seventieth year of his age^, about 579 years before Christ, after he had spent the last· ten years of his life in literary ease and peaceful retirement.
