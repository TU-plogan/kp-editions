PINDAR, the most celebrated lyric poet that Greece produced, was a native of Thebes in Boeotia, and born b. c. 518, forty years before the expedition of Xerxes. He was the contemporary of Aeschylus, but younger than Simonides, and somewhat older than Bacchylides. It was scarcely to be expected that the early years of such a distinguished poet should pass without some extraordinary event taking place, and it is accordingly stated that he was exposed on a desert mountain, and that he was fed by bees. Whether his father’s name was Diophantus or Scopelinus is uncertain, but he was of the humble profession of a player on the flute, which he at first intended that his son should pursue. Finding, however, that his talents entitled him to occupy a higher position in the drama of life, he placed him under Lasus of Hermione, a poet who then enjoyed a high reputation. Although he lived in one of the most eventful periods of Grecian history, it does not appear that he took any active part in the political struggles of his country. It has been even doubted whether his feelings in favour of the liberty of Greece were so ardent as to induce him to oppose the progress of the Persians. Before the battle of Plataea a seditious movement had taken place in Thebes, and a strong party had joined the Persians. In a passage of the poet written at this period, Polybius imagines he can satisfactorily discover that Pindar was the advocate of this step, and of course visits him with not unmerited reproach. Stobaeus, however, gives this same passage more fully, and it there appears that the poet recommends peace, not in reference to the Persians, but to his fellow-citizens, who were tearing one another to pieces in civil broils. But a still stronger proof that Polybius had taken a prejudiced view of his character, is found in the circumstance that the poet wrote a dithyrambic poem after the battle of Plataea, in which he spoke so warmly in admiration of Athens, that the prevailing party amongst his countrymen took umbrage at it, and visited him with punishment. The Athenians, on the other hand, erected a statue to his honour. Again we find him comparing the victories of Hiero at Cumae and Himera to the most illustrious engagements of the Greeks against the Persians. It is impossible, therefore, to doubt that he joined heartily in support of Greek independence, though he does not seem to have thought that a monarchical government, justly and mildly administered, was unworthy of respect. Of his private history nothing farther is known, except that he died at an advanced age, probably about the year B. c. 439. According to one tradition, he died whilst he was resting on the bosom of his young disciple Theoxenus, after he had taken part in the active exercises of the gymnasium. He was the writer of many poems, but they have all perished except some fragments, and those hymns which he composed in honour of the conquerors at the solemn games of Greece. They are divided into four books, of which the first contains those who had conquered at the Olympic games, and consists of fourteen odes; the second, addressed to the conquerors of the Pythian games, contains twelve odes; the third, addressed to the Nemean conquerors, contains eleven odes; and the fourth, celebrating the Isthmian conquerors, contains eight odes. It is difficult to believe that the reputation of Pindar was founded upon the poetry which has come down to us, and indeed his dithyrambic hymns are spoken of as his finest productions. He is no doubt distinguished by a warm and enthusiastic genius, and by bold and figurative expressions; but the abruptness of his transitions, and the numerous allusions to persons and things now altogether unknown, and which, if known, would not interest the reader, very much diminish the pleasure with which his poetry is read. Still the opinion of Horace must for ever place him in the foremost rank of lyric poets.

Fiery, immense, profound he flowes As from a mountaille tumbling goes A torrent fed with showers, flyes o’er The well-knowne limits of the shore. √∖ polio’s bayes are due to him, Whether new words swolne to the brim, He (bold) through dithyrambies throw, Where every new word doth loosely flow; Whether gods, kings, or gods’ allies He chant, who by a just surprise, The Centaurs vanquish’d, and supprest Chimaera’s dreadful flamingerest.
