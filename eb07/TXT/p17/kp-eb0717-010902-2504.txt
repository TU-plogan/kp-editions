PASIGRAPHY (from οτας, omnis, and γoα<pω, scribo), the art of writing on any subject whatsoever, so as to be universally understood by all nations of the earth. The idea of establishing such a language is deemed by many extremely fanciful and absurd, whilst the practicability of it is as strenuously contended for by others. Hints respecting such a system of writing as might be understood by all mankind are to be met with in the writings of many eminent philosophers; but the attempt has signally failed, even in the hands of a Leibnitz, a Kircher, a Becher, and a Wilkins. Kant is clearly of opinion, however, that such a pasigraphy falls within the limits of possibility; nay, he even prognosticates that it will certainly be established at some future period.
