PEER, in general, signifies an equal, or one of the same rank and station. Hence, in the acts of some councils, we find these words: “with the consent of our peers, bishops, abbots,” and others. Afterwards the same term was applied to the vassals or tenants of the same lord, who were called peers, because they were all equal in condition, and obliged to serve and attend him in his courts; and peers in fiefs, because they all held fiefs of the same lord.

Peer of the Realm, a lord who has a seat and vote in the House of Lords, which is also called the House of Peers. These lords are called peers, because, though there is a distinction of degrees in our nobility, yet in public actions they are equal; as in their votes in parliament, and in trying any nobleman or other person impeached by the Commons. See Parliament.
