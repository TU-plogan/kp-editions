PEMBROKE, the county-town of the shire of that name, in South Wales, situated on a branch of the fine haven of Milford. It is 250 miles from London, and ten from Haverford West. It is a very ancient town, and was once defended by strong walls and a powerful castle, the ruins of which still remain. It consists of one long street, rising up to the remains of the castle, which has an imposing aspect. There are two churches, St Mary’s and St Michael’s, the latter of which is of a remote age. The county assizes and elections are held here; and there is a tolerable market, which is held on Saturday, but little trade of any kind. In virtue of the municipal reform law passed in 1835, the town elects annually a corporation, consisting of a mayor, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors, with justices of the peace nominated by the crown; for which purpose it is divided into two wards. The population amounted in 1801 to 2595, in 1811 to 2525, in 1821 to 4925, and in 1831 to 6511.
