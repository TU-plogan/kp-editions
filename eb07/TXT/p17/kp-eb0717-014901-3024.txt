PATRONYMIC, amongst grammarians, is applied to such names of men or women as are derived from those of parents or ancestors. Patronymics are derived from the father, as Pelides, that is, Achilles the son of Peleus; or from the mother, as Philyrides, that is, Chiron the son of Philyra; or from the grandfather on the father’s side, as Aea-cides, or Achilles the grandson of Aeacus; or from the grandfather by the mother’s side, as Atlantiades, Mercury the grandson of Atlas; or, lastly, from the kings and founders of nations, as Romulidae, the Romans, so called from their founder King Romulus. The terminations of Greek and Latin patronymics are chiefly four, viz. des, of which we have already given examples; as, as Thaumantias, that is, Iris the daughter of Thaumas; is, as Atlantis, that is, Electra, the daughter of Atlas; and ne, as Nerine the daughter of Nereus. Of these terminations, des is masculine; and as, is, and ne are feminine; des and nβ are of the first declension, as and is of the third. The Russians, in their usual mode of address, never prefix any title or appellation of respect to their names; but persons of all ranks, even those of the first distinction, call each other by their Christian names, to which they add a patronymic. These patronymics are formed in some cases by adding Vitch, the same as our Fitz, to the Christian name of the father; and in others by [7:17:150]Of or Ef. The former is applied only to persons of condition, the latter to those of inferior rank.
