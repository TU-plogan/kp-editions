PERCY Isles, a chain of islands in the South Pacific Ocean, distant about thirty miles from the north-east coast of New Holland, and extending from about 21. 32. to 21.45. S. lat. The name of Percy Islands was given them in 1802 by Captain Flinders, who laid down their respective situations and bearings. The largest island is about thirteen miles in circumference. Turtle abound in these islands, which are visited by the Indians for the purpose of catching them. The large vampyre bat is frequently found here, hanging by the claws with its head downwards.
