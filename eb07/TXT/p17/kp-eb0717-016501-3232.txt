PEACE, Temple of, a very celebrated fane at Rome, which in the year 191 was consumed by a fire, produced, as some writers suppose, by a slight earthquake. Dio Cassius, however, supposes that the fire began in the adjoining houses; but however this may have been, the temple, with all the surrounding buildings, was reduced to ashes. That magnificent structure had been raised by Vespasian after the destruction of Jerusalem, and enriched with the spoils and ornaments of the temple of the Jews. The ancients speak of it as one of the most stately buildings in Rome. There men of learning used to hold their assemblies, and to deposit their writings, as many others deposited their jewels, and whatever else they esteemed of great value. It was likewise employed as a kind of magazine for the spices which were brought by the Roman merchants from Egypt and Arabia; so that many rich persons were reduced to beggary, all their valuable effects and treasures having been consumed in the conflagration.
