PICUMNUS and Pilumnus were two Roman deities, who presided over the auspices required before the celebration of nuptials. Pilumnus was supposed to patronize children, as his name seems in some manner to indicate, “quod pellat mala infantiae.” The manuring of the land was first invented by Picumnus, for which reason he is also called Sterqzulinizes. Pilumnus was also invoked as the god of bakers and millers, because he was said to have first invented the art of grinding corn.
