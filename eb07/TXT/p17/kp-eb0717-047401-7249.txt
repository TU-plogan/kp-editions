PHRYGIA, a country in Asia. The origin of the name is uncertain; but some say that it was derived from the river Phryx, now Sarabat, which divides Phrygia from Caria, and empties itself into the Hermus; whilst others think that it was so called from Phrygia, the daughter of Asopus and Europa. The Greek writers inform us that the country took its name from the inhabitants, and these from the town of Brygium in Macedonia, whence they first passed into Asia, and gave the name of Brygia or Phrygia to the country where they settled. Bochart is of opinion that this tract was called Phrygia from the Greek verb pguyg∕v, to burn or parch, which, according to him, is a translation of its Hebrew name, derived from a verb of the same signification.

Nor are the opinions of authors less various as to the ancient boundaries of this country; an uncertainty which gave rise to an observation of Strabo, that the Phrygians and Mysians had distinct boundaries, but that it was scarcely possible to ascertain them. The same writer adds, that the Trojans, Mysians, and Lydians, are, by the poets, all blended under the common name of Phrygians, which Claudian extends to the Pisidians, Bithynians, and Ionians. Phrygia proper was, according to Ptolemy, bounded on the north by Pontus and Bithynia; on the west by Mysia, Troas, the Aegean Sea, Lydia, Maeonia, and Caria; on the south by Lycia; and on the east by Pamphylia and Galatia. It lies between the 37th and 41st degrees of north latitude, and extends in longitude from 56 to 62 degrees. The inhabitants of this country, mentioned by Ptolemy, are the Lycaones and Anthemisenii towards Lycia, and Moccadelis or Moccadine; the Cyddeses or Cydisses towards Bithynia; and the Peltini or Speltini, the Moxiani, Phylacenses, and Hiera-politae, between these. To the latter may be added the Berecyntes, mentioned by Strabo.

Phrygia is commonly divided into the Greater and Lesser, called also Troas. But this division did not take place till Troas had been subdued by the Phrygians; and hence it is rather considered by some Roman writers as a part of Phrygia, than Bithynia, Cappadocia, or any other of the adjacent provinces. In after ages the Greater Phrygia was divided into two districts or governments; one called Phrygia Pacatiana, from Pacatianus, who, under Constantine, was the praefectus praetorio of the East; and the other Phrygia Salutaris, from some miraculous cures supposed to have been performed there by the archangel Michael.

This country, and indeed all Asia Minor, was in ancient times greatly celebrated for its fertility. It abounded in all sorts of grain, being, for the most part, a champaign country covered with a deep and rich soil, and plentifully watered by small rivers. In some parts it produced bitumen and other combustible substances. The plains were also well stocked with cattle and pasture grounds. The air was anciently deemed pure and wholesome, although it is now in some parts thought extremely bad, great part of the country lying uncultivated.

Phrygia Major anciently contained several cities of great celebrity, such as Apamea, Laodicea, Hierapolis, Gordium, &c. There were also in it some famous rivers, such as the Marsyas, the Maeander, &c. The Maeander is now named Madre or Mindre, and was much celebrated by the ancients for its windings and turnings; whence all such windings and turnings have been denominated meanders.

The Phrygians accounted themselves the most ancient people in the world. Their origin, however, is extremely uncertain. Josephus and St Jerome say that they were descended from Togarmah, one of Gomer’s sons; and that they were known to the Hebrews under the name of Tigrammanes. The heathen authors derive them from the Brygians, a people of Macedonia. But this is a mere conjecture, being totally unsupported, except by the similarity of names. Bochart thinks that the Phrygians were the offspring of Gomer the eldest son of Japhct, the word Phrygia being the Greek translation of his name. Josephus makes Gomer the father of the Galatians; but by the Galatians he must necessarily mean the Phrygians inhabiting that part of Phrygia which the Galatians had made themselves masters of; the descendants of Gomer having been placed by Ezekiel to the northward of Judaea, near Togarmah (which Bochart takes to be Cappadocia), long before the Gauls passed over into Asia. We are willing to let Gomer enjoy the fine country which Bochart has been pleased to assign him, and concede to him the honour of being the progenitor of the Phrygians, since we know no other person upon whom it can be conferred with any degree of probability.

The ancient Phrygians are described as superstitious, voluptuous, and effeminate, without any prudence or foresight, and of such a servile temper that nothing but stripes and ill usage could make them perform their duty; a character which gave rise to several trite and well-known proverbs. They are also said to have been the inventors of divination by the singing, flying, and feeding of birds. Their music, commonly called the Phrygian mood, is alleged by some as a proof of their effeminacy.

The government of this country was certainly monarchical; for during the reigns of some kings, Phrygia was subject to one prince. Ninnacus, Midas, Manis, Gordius and his descendants, were undoubtedly sovereigns of all Phrygia. But some time before the Trojan war we find this country divided into several petty kingdoms, and different princes reigning at the same time. Apollodorus mentions a king of Phrygia as contemporary with Hus king of Troy. Cedrenus and others speak of one Teuthrans, a king of a small country in Phrygia, whose territories were ravaged by Ajax, whilst he himself was slain in single combat, his royal seat laid in ashes, and his daughter, named Teemessa, carried away captive by the conqueror. Homer makes mention of Phorcys and Ascanius, both princes and leaders of the Phrygian auxiliaries who came to the relief of Troy. Tantalus, a prince no less famous for his great wealth, than infamous for his covetousness and other detestable vices, was only king of Sipylus and its adjacent district. That Phrygia was subdued either by Ninus, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, or by the Amazons, as we read in Suidas, is not sufficiently established. Most authors who speak of Gordius tell us, that the Phrygians, having .sent to consult an oracle in order to learn how they might put an end to the intestine broils which divided their country into many factions and parties, received for answer, that the most effectual means to deliver themselves and their country from the calamities under which they groaned, was to commit the government to a king; an advice which they followed accordingly, and placed Gordius on the throne.

Apamea was the chief emporium of all Asia Minor. Thither resorted merchants and traders from all parts of Greece, Italy, and the neighbouring islands. Besides, we know from Syncellus, that the Phrygians were for some time masters of the sea; and none but trading nations ever prevailed on that element. The country produced many choice and useful commodities, which afforded considerable exports. They had a safe coast, convenient harbours, and whatever may incline us to think that they carried on a considerable trade. But as most of the Phrygian records are lost, we will not dwell on conjectures so difficult to be ascertained.

We have no remains of the Phrygian laws; and in regard to their learning, as we are informed that for some time they enjoyed the sovereignty of the sea, we may at least allow them a competent skill in geography, geometry, and astronomy, besides their reputed knowledge of music. Some have been of opinion that the Phrygian language bore a great resemblance to the Greek; but the contrary is manifest from the few Phrygian words which have been transmitted to us, and carefully collected by Bochart and Rudbe-chius[7:17:475]. To these we may add the authority of Strabo, who, after attempting to derive the name of a Phrygian city from the Greek, concludes that it is a difficult matter to discover any similitude between the barbarous words of the Phrygian language and the Greek. The Phrygian tongue, after the experiment made by Psammetichus, king of Egypt, was looked upon by the Egyptians as the most ancient language )f the world. But other nations, particularly the Scythians, refused to submit to their opinion, as founded on an argument of no real weight. “As the two children,” say they, “had never heard the voice of any human creature, the word bee, or bekkos, the first they uttered, was only an imitation of the goats that had suckled them, and happened to be a Phrygian word signifying bread”

As the Phrygians were superstitious, their idols were consequently numerous. The chief of these was Cybele, who went by a variety of names. They also worshipped Bacchus under the name of Sabazios, and called his priests Saboi.

The history of their kings is dark and uncertain, and the dates of their several reigns and actions cannot now be fixed. We refer such of our readers, therefore, as wish to know what is certain respecting them, to the Ancient Universal History.
