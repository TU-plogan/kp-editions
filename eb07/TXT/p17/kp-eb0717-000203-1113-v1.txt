PANY Isle, one of the Philippines, 110 miles in length by thirty-eight in average breadth. It is situated due south of Luzon, between the 122d and 123d degrees of east longitude. The island is marshy, and consequently unhealthy. When viewed from the sea, it exhibits numerous villages on the declivity of the hills, the houses of which are generally well built, and arranged with great regularity. In the interior are found deer, hogs, buffaloes, and wild animals; and cattle and horses range at pleasure through the uncultivated parts. The inhabitants manufacture handkerchiefs and cloths from cotton, and from the fibres of another plant, with which they supply the neighbouring islands. It has the reputation of containing gold and silver mines. The principal establishments of the Spaniards on this island are at Ilo-ilo and Antigua, on which oeast there is good anchorage in ten fathoms, at a considerable distance from the shore. There is no security here either for life or property. The principal settlement, Antigua, is extremely ill governed and defended, vessels being plundered in the harbour by the pirates, who carry their crews into slavery. Long. 122. 33. E. Lat. 11. 15. N.
