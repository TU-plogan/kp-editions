PATROCLUS, a Grecian chief at the Trojan war. He was the son of Menoetius, by Sthenele, whom some call Philomela or Polymela. The accidental murder of Clyso-nymus, the son of Amphidamas, in the time of his youth, forced him to fly from Opus, where his father reigned. Having gone to the court of Peleus, king of Phthia, he was cordially received, and contracted the most intimate friendship with Achilles, the king’s son. When the Greeks proceeded to the Trojan war, Patroclus went with them at the express desire of his father, who had visited the court of Peleus; and he accordingly embarked with ten ships from Phthia. He was the constant companion of Achilles, lodging with him in the same tent; and when the hero refused to appear in the field of battle, because he had been offended by Agamemnon, Patroclus imitated his example, and by his absence became the cause of much evil to the Greeks. At last, however, Nestor prevailed upon him to return to the war, and Achilles permitted him to appear in his armour. The bravery of Patroclus, together with the terror which the sight of the arms of Achilles inspired, soon routed the victorious armies of the Trojans, and obliged them to fly for safety to the city. He would have broken down the walls; but Apollo, who interested himself for the Trojans, opposed him; and Hector, at the instigation of that god, dismounted from his chariot to attack him as he attempted to strip one of the Trojans whom he had slain. The engagement was obstinate; but Patroclus was at length overpowered by the valour of Hector and the interposition of Apollo. His arms became the property of the conqueror; and Hector would have severed his head from his body had not Ajax and Menelaus prevented it. His body was at last recovered, and carried to the Grecian camp, where Achilles received it with the loudest lamentations. His funeral was observed with the greatest solemnity. Achilles sacrificed near the burning pile twelve young Trojans, four of his horses, and two of his dogs; and the whole was concluded by the exhibition of funereal games, in which the conquerors were liberally rewarded by Achilles. The death of Patroclus, as described by Homer, gave rise to new events. Achilles forgot his resentment against Agamemnon, and entered the field to avenge the death of his friend; and his anger was gratified only by the slaughter of Hector, who had more powerfully kindled his wrath by appearing at the head of the Trojan armies in the armour which had been taken from the body of Patroclus. The patronymic of Actorides is often applied to Patroclus, because Actσr was father to Menoetius.
