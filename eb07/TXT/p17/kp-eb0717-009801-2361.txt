PARRELS, in a ship, are frames made of trucks, ribs, and ropes, which, having both their ends fastened to the yards, are so contrived as to go round the masts, that by their means the yards may move up and down upon the mast. The parrels also, along with the breast-ropes, fasten the yards to the masts.
