PHILTER, or Philtre (philtrum), in Pharmacy or Chemistry, a strainer. This term is also used for a drug or preparation, which, it is pretended, will excite love. The word is formed from the Greek p∕λsw, I love, or p∕λoς, lover ; because philters were given by the Greeks and Romans to excite love. Many grave authors believe the reality of these philters, and allege various facts in confirmation of their sentiments.
