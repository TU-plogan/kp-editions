PARKUR, a small district of Hindustan, situated about the twenty-fourth degree of north latitude. This part of the country has been seldom visited by Europeans, but is described by the natives as of a sandy and rocky nature, ill supplied with water. It has to the north the sandy desert, to the south Cutch, to the east Gujerat, and to the west the province of Sinde. There is no cultivation, except by means of irrigation from wells or tanks. The territory is said to contain between forty and fifty villages.
