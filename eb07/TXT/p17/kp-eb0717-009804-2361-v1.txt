PARRICIDE, the murder of one’s parents or children. By the Roman law, this crime was punished in a much more severe manner than any other kind of homicide. The delinquents, after being scourged, were sewed up in a leathern sack, with a live dog, a cock, a viper, and an ape, and were then cast into the sea. Solon, it is true, in his laws, made none against parricide, apprehending it impossible that any one could be guilty of so unnatural a barbarity; and the Persians, according to Herodotus, entertained the same notion, when they adjudged all persons who killed their reputed parents to be bastards.
