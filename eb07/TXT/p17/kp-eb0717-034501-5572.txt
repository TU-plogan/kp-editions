PHILETAS, a Greek poet and grammarian, belonging to the island of Cos, flourished under Philip and Alexander the Great, and was preceptor of Ptolemy Philadelphus. He was the author of some Elegies, Epigrams, and other works, which have not come down to us, and is celebrated in the poems of Ovid and Propertius as one of the best poets of his age. Aelian informs us, we presume in jest, that his body was so slender and feeble, that he was obliged to have some lead in his pockets, to prevent his being carried away by the wind.
