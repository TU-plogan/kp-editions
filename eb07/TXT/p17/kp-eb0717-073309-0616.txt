PIASTUS, a native of Poland, was originally a wheelwright, and the son of Cossisco, a citizen of Cruswitz. He flourished in the year 830, when, on the extinction of the family of Popiel, great disputes arose about his successor, and Cracow was afflicted with a severe famine. During this extremity, when the people were dying in the streets, the credulous historians of the time relate that two pilgrims, or two angels in human form, having been hospitably entertained by Piastus, they promised him the crown of Poland; and being ordered by the pilgrims to distribute among the multitude his onlyremaining little cask of the common liquor of the country, he piously obeyed their instructions, and the cask was found inexhaustible. The people in astonishment cried out, “a miracle and as it appeared to the electors that this was a declaration of Heaven in favour of Piastus, they resolved on elevating him to the vacant throne.

Though we make but little account of the marvellous means by which it is said that the hospitable wheelwright ascended the ducal throne of Poland, it would be presumptuous entirely to omit a fact attested by all the writers upon this subject. It seemed proper therefore to take notice of it, but we leave it to the reader’s judgment to attach what faith he pleases, or none at all, to the story. Being now raised to the supreme dignity, he was not intoxicated with his prosperity. His natural charity, benevolence, and sweetness of disposition, remained; nothing being altered but his power of doing good. He was truly called the father of his people; the injured never returned unredressed, nor merit unreward [7:17:734]ed. Piastus wiped the tear from the eyes of the widow; and was himself the guardian of the orphan, the general patron of the poor and distressed. His excellent inclinations served him instead of great abilities; and the happiness which his people enjoyed made them forget that their prince was not born a statesman and a warrior. Several intestine commotions arose during his administration, all which he quelled by the mildness and clemency of his nature; for his nobility were ashamed of rebelling against a sovereign who devoted his whole life to render his people happy. He removed the court from Cruswitz, a city which he detested, because it was the scene of Popiel’s crimes and tragical end, and fixed his residence at Gnesna, where he died beloved, esteemed, and even adored, by his subjects. It is in memory of this excellent prince that all the natives of Poland who have since been promoted to the ducal or regal dignity were called Piastes, in contradistinction to the foreigners.
