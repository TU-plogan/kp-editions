PICTET, Benedict, a celebrated divine, descended of a distinguished family. He was born at Geneva in 1655; prosecuted his studies with great success; and after having travelled into Holland and England, he taught theology in his own country, with an extraordinary reputation. The university of Leyden, after the death of Spantreina, solicited him to come and fill the place of that eminent person; but he thought that his own country had the best right to his services, and for this generosity on his part he received its thanks through the members of council. A languishing disorder, occasioned by excessive fatigue, hastened his death, which happened on the 9th of June 1724, at the age of sixty-nine years. This minister had much sweetness and affability in his manner; and the poor found in him a comforter and a friend. He published in Latin and French a great number of works, which are much esteemed in Protestant countries. The principal of these are, 1. A System of Christian Theology, in Latin, in three vols. 4to, the best edition of which is that of 1721; 2. Christian Morality, printed at Geneva, 1710, in eight vols. 12mo; 3. the History of the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries, intended as a sequel to that of Sueur, printed in 1713, in two vols. 4to,∙ 4. Several controversial treatises; 5. A great number of tracts on morality and piety, amongst which we must distinguish the Art of Living and Dying Well, published at Geneva, 1705, in 12mo; 6. Some Letters; 7. Sermons, from 1697 to 1721, in four vols. 8vo; with a vast number of other pieces, the names of which it would be tedious to inention, but which, as Μ. Sennebier says, “all show evident marks of piety and good sense.”
