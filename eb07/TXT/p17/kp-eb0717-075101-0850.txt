PISCADORE or Ponghou Islands, a cluster of small islands in the North Pacific Ocean, in the channel of Formosa, about six leagues from the west coast of that island. According to PÃ©rouse, they are a heap of rocks, which assume all kinds of shapes, and are totally barren, but have a good and sheltered harbour. The Chinese maintain a garrison here. They are situated between the island of Formosa and the port of the island of Emouy, and extend from 23. 10. to 23. 40. N., about twenty-four miles; the westernmost is in 119. 27. E. long.
