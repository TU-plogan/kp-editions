YAKOUTSK, one of the four districts into which the province of Irkoutsk, in Asiatic Russia, is divided. It extends as far as the Frozen Ocean, north from the boundary of the provinces of Irkoutsk proper and of Nertschinsk. It is bounded on the east by the province of Okhotsk, which intervenes between the eastern extremity of Asia. It is watered by the great river Lena, which traverses its whole extent from south to north. The climate is so severe as to prevent the ripening of grain to advantage; and even a crop of rye is extremely uncertain, as in June the ground in the vicinity of Yakoutsk is frozen three feet deep. The inhabitants subsist chiefly by hunting; but this formerly lucrative branch of trade has considerably fallen off, in consequence of the depredations made on the game by the activity of the hunters. The sables have become extremely scarce; but other animals still abound, and bring considerable gain.

The tribe that inhabits this dreary region bears the name of the Yacoutes. They formerly occupied the countries on the Angara and Upper Lena, and are supposed to have been originally a Tartar race; but being driven from their original abodes by the Mongols and Burats, they have taken shelter in the frozen solitudes of the Lower Lena. They occupy an extensive territory, extending eighteen degrees from north to south, and nearly fifty from east to west. This desolate country is but thinly peopled. The number of males paying tribute amounts to 34,979, which, it is supposed, may be about the third of the entire number of both sexes. Those who inhabit the southern districts of this province are tolerably rich and industrious, and possess the usual size, activity, and vigour: but those farther to the north live poorly; they are seldom able to procure bread, and feed on onions, garlic, and other roots, with various sorts of berries, both fresh and preserved, which form their chief luxuries. They are remarkably ignorant and superstitious, and live in the continual dread of evil spirits. The Shamans, a set of magical impostors, enjoy unbounded influence among them. They are eager for spirits, and greedily drink brandy when they can procure it, and use as a substitute fermented mare’s milk, which forms the chief luxury of their feasts. They now submit quietly to the Russian yoke, though they long continued to view that nation with hostility. They acknowledge their subjection by an annual tribute, generally paid in furs.

Yakoutsk, the capital of the above province, is situated on the western bank of the Lena, on a plain surrounded by mountains, which enclose it at the distance of ten or twelve miles. It is a place of some trade, notwithstanding the inhospitable climate in which it is situated, being the emporium of the fur trade; all the furs which are collected in the extensive regions of the north being brought to this place, as are also all the Russian and Asiatic commodities which are imported in exchange. It also forms a species of entrepôt for the Russian trade with Kamtschatka and the western coast of America. The dreary winter is the greatest disadvantage of this place. The cold is excessive; and the inhabitants arc almost entirely confined to their houses, the daylight continuing during the deadness of the season for only a few hours. They consume their time, accordingly, between drinking and sleeping; and they use ice as the most effectual mode of stopping up every chink and crevice, being applied, like double glass, to the outside of the windows. Yakoutsk contains 500 or 600 houses, and about 3000 inhabitants, who for the most part are Cossacks or Yakoutes. Long. 140. 8. E. Lat. 60. 2. N.
