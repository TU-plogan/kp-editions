YETHOLM, a parish on the confines of England, in the county of Roxburgh, containing two villages of the same name. One of these, Town Yetholm, is the place where the largest colony of Gipsys in Scotland is to be found. The strolling habits and vagabond life which they lead are too well known to require any description here; but it may be stated, that in consequence of the operation of the new police act for Scotland and England, there is every probability of a change taking place in their erratic mode of life, by their being compelled to settle to steady occupations in a fixed place of abode, or otherwise being liable to be imprisoned as vagrants. Their number is at present about 100. The village is situate in a valley about one mile in length and [7:21:961] a quarter of a mile in breadth, through which the Bowmont flows. The parish church is situated in Kirk Yetholm, whilst in Town Yetholm there are two dissenting places of worship. The population of the parish in 1831 was 1289.
