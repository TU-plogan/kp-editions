YEZD, a city of Persia, in the province of Khorassan, on the frontier of Seistan. It is situated in a sandy desert, contiguous to a range of lofty mountains. Being a great commercial emporium between Hindustan, Bokhara, and Persia, it is a place of considerable trade, is large and flourishing, and the bazaar is supposed to contain 20,000 houses, besides those of the Guebres or worshippers of fire, which are estimated at 4000. These Guebres are a persecuted remnant, who, after the extinction of the greater part of their race, are still suffered to exist in a state of oppression, being subjected to a poll-tax of twenty piastres, besides the various exactions of the Persian government. There were formerly many opulent Hindus in this place; but, in order to escape the exactions of the governor, who intended to plunder them, they all fled in one night to Candahar, where they have established themselves, and since that period there have not been more than nine Hindus in Yezd. The city imports corn from Ispahan. Cattle are scarce, and sell high. The town is famous for the manufacture of silk stuffs, which are superior to any in Persia. The fort has but a mean appearance, and the town is destitute of a wall. It is about 300 miles east of Ispahan. Long. 55.30. E. Lat. 32. 30. N.
