YAWNING, an involuntary opening of the mouth, generally produced by weariness or an inclination to sleep. Yawning, according to Boerhaave, is performed by expanding at one and the same time all the muscles capable of spontaneous motion, by greatly extending the lungs; by drawing in gradually and slowly a large quantity of air, and gradually and slowly breathing it out after it has been retained for some time and rarefied, and then restoring the muscles to their natural state. Hence the effect of yawning is to move, accelerate, and equally distribute all the humours through all the vessels of the body, and consequently to qualify the muscles and organs of sensation for their various functions. Sanctorius observes, that a great deal is insensibly discharged, when nature endeavours to get rid of the retained perspirable matter, by yawning and stretching the limbs. To these a person is most inclined just after sleep, because a greater quantity going off by the pores of the skin than at other times, whenever a person wakes, the increasing contraction that then happens closes a great deal of the perspirable matter in the cutaneous passages, which will continually give such irritations as excite yawning and stretching; and such motions, by shaking the membranes of the whole body, and shifting the contact of their fibres, and the enclosed matter, by degrees throw it off. Hence we see the reason why healthful strong people are most inclined to such motions, because they perspire most in time of sleep, and therefore have more of the perspirable matter to lodge in the pores, and greater irritations. The advantages of some little exercise just after waking in a morning are considerable, as it throws off all the perspirable matter that is ready for its exit from the body. When yawning is troublesome, Hippocrates says that it is cured by long, deep respiration, or drawing in the air at long intervals.
