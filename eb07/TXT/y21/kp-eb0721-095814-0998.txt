YARE, among sailors, implies ready or quick: as, be yare at the helm; that is, be quick, ready, and expeditious at the helm. It is sometimes also used for bright by seamen: as, to keep his arms yare; that is, to keep them clean and bright.

Yare, a river of Norfolk, which runs from west to east through that county, passing by Norwich, and falling into the German Ocean at Yarmouth.
