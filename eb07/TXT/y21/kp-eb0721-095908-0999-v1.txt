YELL, one of the islands of Shetland, lying north-east from the Mainland, and divided from it by an arm of the sea, called Yell Sound. By some it is thought to have been the Thule of the ancients. It is seventeen miles long and from six to eight broad. It is very mountainous, and full of moss; but there are considerable pastures, in which the islanders feed a great many sheep; and it also affords plenty of peat. It has eight large harbours. It is divided into two parishes; and its inhabitants are partly supported by the cod, ling, and whale fisheries, and by agriculture. Their number in 1831 amounted to 3492.
