YUNAN, a province of China, situated on its south-western frontier, bounded on the north by Sechuen and Tibet, on the east by Quang-see and Koei-tchoo, on the south by Laos, and on the west by Ava and Pegu. It is about 300 miles in length by 250 in breadth, and though mountainous, it is one of the most fertile and opulent in China, being well watered both by rivers and lakes. Its produce is gold, copper, and tin, amber, rubies, sapphires, agates, pearls, precious stones, marble, musk, silk, elephants, horses, gums, medicinal plants, and linen. It has a vast commerce, contains twenty-one cities of the first class, and fifty-five of the second and third. The population is estimated by Sir George Staunton at eight millions.
