YEOMAN, the first or highest degree among the plebeians of England, next in order to the gentry. The yeomen are properly freeholders, who having land of their own, live on good husbandry.

Υεομαν is also a title of office in the king’s household, of a middle place or rank between an officer and a groom.

Υεομεν of the Guard were anciently 250 men of the best rank under gentry, and of larger stature than ordinary, each being required to be six feet high. At present there are but 100 yeomen in constant duty, and seventy more not in duty; and as any of the 100 dies, his place is supplied out of the seventy. They are dressed after the manner of King Henry VIII.’s time. They formerly had diet as well as wages when in waiting, but this was withdrawn in the reign of Queen Anne.
