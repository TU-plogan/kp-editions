YARKUND, a city of Cashgar, in that part of Chinese Tartary which commonly goes by the name of Little Bucharia. It is situated on a river of the same name, on the eastern side of that great range of mountains which extends northwards from the Himalaya range, and divides Chinese from Independent Tartary. This city, after enjoying a high degree of celebrity in that part of Asia, was destroyed by Meerza Abubekr, grandson of Timour, who however restored it to prosperity, when its population increased; and the air being salubrious, he made it his residence, adorning it with splendid edifices, bringing water into the streets, and in other ways rendering it fit for a royal abode. Its walls are about 1200 feet high; and numerous gardens, the finest in the world, were planted around it. It is at present defended by a wall of stone cemented with mud, in which there are five gates. The houses are mean, being built of stone and mud, and have all balconies. The bazaar runs from east to west, and is described as consisting of a range of seats upon a platform, behind which there are handsome shops, chiefly occupied by Chinese. It contains more than ten large colleges, for the support of which lands are assigned, and plenty of caravanserais for the accommodation of travellers. The town is watered by canals from the river, from which are filled certain reservoirs, of mud and stone, which supply the inhabitants with water when the canals are frozen and the river low. The water of the river is also employed in irrigating the surrounding cultivation and gardens. The inhabitants of this and the other towns in this part of Asia are chiefly mechanics, merchants, and teachers or priests. Many of them are afflicted with the glandular swelling in the throat called goitre. The women of the country, whether high or low, do not wear veils. The Russians carry on a commercial intercourse with Yarkund, which is a great emporium of inland trade. It is within the dominion of the Chinese, under whose government it has been for the last eighty years. Long. 78. 27. 45. E. Lat. 38. 19. N.
