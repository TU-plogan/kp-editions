YOUGHAL, a town in the county of Cork, is situated about 140 statute miles from Dublin, and lies on the shore of a harbour of the same name, into which, at spring-tides, vessels of 400 or 500 tons burthen can enter. It is of great antiquity, and was formerly a place of strength. The old walls in great part remain, and still form, on the summit of the hill to the westward, the boundary of the town. Owing to the very abrupt rise of this hill, the town is confined between it and the water, and can only extend itself in the direction of its length from north to south; but in both these directions it has outgrown its ancient limits, which are there only to be traced by partial remains of the walls. Youghal, notwithstanding its vicinity to Cork, which will probably prevent its ever rising into any great commercial importance, has yet a considerable trade with England, particularly in the export of agricultural produce. It contained, according to the census of 1831, about 9600 inhabitants, and 1200 houses, being, on an average, exactly eight to a house. The increase of population in ten years is supposed to have been about 1000, but is not very accurately known. When the census was taken, there were only six houses building. The greater part of the town belongs to the duke of Devonshire.
