YANG-TSE-KIANG, the largest river in the Chinese empire, and one of the greatest in the world. Its source, which is unknown to Europeans, is laid down in the Chinese maps as situated among the mountains of Tibet. It flows during the first part of its course along the borders of China; after which it enters the Chinese territory, and passes, in a westerly course, through Sechuen, Houquang, and Kiang-nan, the central provinces, diffusing, far and wide, commerce and fertility, and facilitating the internal intercourse of the empire. Increased in its progress by numerous tributary streams, it becomes truly magnificent when it passes the great city of Nanking, from the fleets of trading craft with which it is covered; and there is thence a continued succession of cities, towns, and villages, diversified by the high cultivation of the intervening country. It falls into the Gulf of Tsong-ming, in the Eastern Seas, about 120 miles to the east of Nanking.
