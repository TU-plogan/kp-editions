YELLOW River, or Hoangho, a great river of China, which, along with the parallel stream of Yang-tse-kiang, or Blue River, has its sources in the unknown clefts of the Tibetian Mountains, probably the lofty central chain of the Asiatic continent; and after a tortuous course of [7:21:960] great length, estimated at about 1800 or 2000 miles, it falls into the Yellow Sea by numerous channels, in about 33° north latitude. In the early part of its course it runs northward, and is carried beyond the limits of the Chinese empire, being turned aside by a lofty chain of mountains for 500 or 600 miles. It afterwards turns into an opposite direction, and reaching the original line of its course, again enters the Chinese empire, and by its winding progress diffuses more widely the benefit of its waters. Though broad and rapid, it is in many places so shallow as to be unfavourable for navigation. It is also liable to overflow its banks, so that it has been necessary to raise dikes for the defence of the surrounding country.

Yellow Sea, a large gulf, about 120 miles in length and eighty in breadth, connected with the Gulf of Pe-tche-lee, and extending along the coast of the province of the same name in Chinese Tartary.
