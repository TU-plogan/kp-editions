YEMEN, a large province of Arabia, comprehending its finest and most fertile portion, situated partly on the Red Sea and partly on the Indian Ocean. It is surrounded by the provinces of Hadramaut, Nedjed, and Hedjaz. It was celebrated by the ancients under the title of Arabia Felix, but modern researches do not by any means justify this appellation: some parts are no doubt fertile, but in general it is barren and unproductive. It is divided into two parts, differing greatly in soil and climate. The plain of the Tehama, which forms a broad belt along the whole of the coast, consists almost entirely of a waste of dry and unproductive sand. It is about two daysâ€™ journey in breadth, and is scorched by torrid heats. The Djcbal, or mountainous district, in the interior, presents in many parts a more agreeable aspect. The hills, though precipitous, are fertile in many spots, and enjoy a more temperate air. The lower declivities are covered with trees and aromatic shrubs, and the mountain chains are divided by fine valleys, which, being watered by numerous streams, can be advantageously cultivated. The natives are industrious agriculturists, though their instruments are rude; and in many districts the fields are cultivated like gardens. The grains chiefly raised are barley, millet, and dhourra: there is not an adequate supply of water for the cultivation of rice. The aromatic plants which grow upon the sides of the hills are the most valuable products of this region. The coffee produced in Yemen has always possessed a flavour which cannot be rivalled by that of any other country to which the shrub has been transplanted from this its native region; and Mocha coffee is in request all over the world. The balm of Mecca, and the tree bearing incense, are also produced in Yemen, though they are found in greater perfection on the opposite coast of Africa.

Like the rest of Arabia, Yemen was formerly parcelled out among a number of different sovereigns in unequal portions; but it has been formed into a considerable monarchical state, subject to a sovereign who assumes the modest title of Imam or doctor, but exercises over his subjects an authority nearly absolute. He is forced however to pay respect to the pride of the aristocracy, namely, the schiechs or hereditary chiefs, who here, as over all Arabia, possess a high influence, and, seated in their strong castles in the interior, often set his mandates at defiance. The sovereigns of Yemen were formerly reduced under the Saracen power, and afterwards under the soldans of Egypt. They were since menaced by the growing power of the Wahabees, who made themselves masters of all the seaports except Mocha; but their power and kingdom being extinguished by Mehemet Ali, this country came under his dominion. In consequence of the late successful operations of the British fleet against Syria, it will revert with that country to the rule of the sultan.
