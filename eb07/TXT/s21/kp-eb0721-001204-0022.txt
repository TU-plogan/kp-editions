SWAFFHAM, a town of the hundred of South Greenhoe, in the county of Norfolk, ninety-three miles from London. It is well built, in a pleasant and healthful district. The church is of the cathedral form, with an elegant turret and steeple. It is not a place of much trade, but has a good market on Saturday. In the market is a handsome cross erected at the expense of the earl of Orford. The number of inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 2350, in 1821 to 2836, and in 1831 to 3285.
