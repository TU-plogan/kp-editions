SWORD, an offensive weapon worn at the side, and serving either to cut or stab. Its parts are, the handle, guard, and blade; to which may be added the bow, scabbard, pummel, &c.

Sword of State, which is borne before the king, lords, and governors of counties, cities, or boroughs, &c. For or before the king, it ought to be carried upright; the hilt as low as the bearerâ€™s waist, the blade up between his eyes. For or before a duke, the blade must decline from the head, and be carried between the neck and the right shoulder. For or before an earl, the blade is to be carried between the point of the shoulder and the elbow; and for or before a baron, the blade is to be borne in the bend of the arm.
