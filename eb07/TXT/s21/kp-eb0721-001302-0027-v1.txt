SWANSEA, a seaport town of South Wales, in the county of Glamorgan, 206 miles from London. It stands at the mouth of the river Tawy, which serves as its haven. It is a tidal harbour, and can only be entered with the flood-tides, but it has a good dry dock. The town is in a semicircular form, on a rising ground, and has a good appearance. The chief street is wide and long, and contains some very handsome houses of private persons, but scarcely a public building worthy of notice. The shipping that arrives and departs is numerous. The copper ore raised in Cornwall is brought to this town to be smelted in its vicinity. A vast quantity of coal is raised in the neighbour hood, part of which is used in the several manufactories; but a large portion is also exported to Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset. There are establishments for making pottery-ware, tin, cast and wrought iron, and beer. Swansea has of late become a much-frequented bathing place, and has been supplied with all the institutions usually found in similar towns, lt is a borough, and for municipal purposes is divided into three wards, and is governed by a portreeve, six aldermen, and seventeen councillors. Jointly with Aberavon, Kenfig, Loughor, and Neath, it returns one member to the House of Commons. It has several fine gentlemen’s seats near it. The market is on Wednesday, but the town is well supplied with provisions daily. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 10,007, and in 1831 to 13,256.
