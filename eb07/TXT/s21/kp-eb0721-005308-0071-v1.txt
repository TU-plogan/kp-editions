SYMPHEROPOLE, the capital city of the Russian province of Krimea. It stands on the southern part of the peninsula, about twenty miles from the sea, in a fine valley at the base of the Tauridan Mountains, on the small river Salghir. It was the residence of the khans or chiefs of the peninsula till it was seized by the Russians. It now consists of two parts; the European part, built since 1783 by the Europeans, and the Tartar or Asiatic part, which, till very lately, consisted of structures in the peculiar fashion of the natives. The new town displays wide streets; and, besides the crown buildings, the houses of the governor and vice-governor, the police, the hospital, and the banracks, there is a considerable number of handsome edifices. The cathedral is yet unfinished, though a large sum has been expended on it. It is on the spot where Suwarof gained a great victory over the Turks. The city is now said to contain about 10,000 inhabitants, its prosperity having increased within the last twenty years.
