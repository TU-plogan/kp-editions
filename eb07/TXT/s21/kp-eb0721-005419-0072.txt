SYNTHESIS, in Logic, denotes a branch of method, opposite to analysis. In the synthesis or synthetic method, we pursue the truth by reasons drawn from principles before established or assumed, and propositions formerly proved;[7:21:55] thus proceeding by a regular chain, till we come to the conclusion. Such is the method in Euclidâ€™s Elements, and most demonstrations of the ancient mathematicians, which proceed from definitions and axioms, to prove propositions, &c. and from those propositions proved to prove others. This method we also call composition, in opposition to analysis or resolution.
