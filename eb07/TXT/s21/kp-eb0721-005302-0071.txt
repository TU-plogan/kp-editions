SYLLABLE, in Grammar, one or more letters pronounced by a single impulse of the voice, forming a complete sound, and constituting a word or a part of a word. No single letter except a vowel can form a syllable. The longest syllable in the English language is the word strength. The most natural way of dividing words into syllables is, to separate all the simple sounds of which any word consists, so as not to divide those letters which are joined close together according to the most accurate pronunciation.
