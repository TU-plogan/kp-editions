SZEGEDIN, a large city of the kingdom of Hungary, in the province of the Farther Theiss, and circle of Song-rab, of which it is the capital. It stands on the river Theiss, where that stream is joined by the Maros. It is well built and strongly fortified, is the scat of a Greek propope, of a Piarist college, and of a Catholic gymnasium.[7:21:66] From its situation on a great river, it carries on extensive trade both upwards and downwards, but chiefly in the products of its soil. Here they build numerous boats and barges, which are loaded with tobacco, corn, wood, and some manufactured goods both of wool and cotton. The tobacco raised near the city is highly valued in all the Austrian dominions, and the quantity annually exported is said to exceed 60,000 quintals. The public buildings have nothing remarkable, but the city contains 4600 dwellings, and the inhabitants now amount to 32 500 having increased to that number from 25,690 since the year 1817.
