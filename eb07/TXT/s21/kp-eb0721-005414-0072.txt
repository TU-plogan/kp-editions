SYNODALS, or Synodies, were pecuniary rents (commonly of two shillings), paid to the bishop, or archdeacon, at the time of their Easter visitation, by every parish priest. They were thus called, because usually paid in synods. For the same reason, they are sometimes also denominated sy-nodalica; but more usually, procurations.
