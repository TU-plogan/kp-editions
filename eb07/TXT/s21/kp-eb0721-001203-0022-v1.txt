SUTULEGE, a celebrated river of Hindustan, and the easternmost of those five rivers which are called the Punjab. It has its rise in the lofty ridge of the Himalaya Mountains, and flows in a southerly direction, bounding to the east the country of Lahore, where it enters Hindustan at Bellaspoor. The stream is 100 yards wide when the waters are at the lowest. About the middle of its course it is joined by the Beyah or Hyphasis, in the latitude of 30. N., after which the united stream takes the name of Kirah. It falls into the Indus near the 29th degree, about eighty miles below Moultan. It is navigable 200 miles above its conflux with the lndus. The length of its course, including its windings, may be 600 miles.
