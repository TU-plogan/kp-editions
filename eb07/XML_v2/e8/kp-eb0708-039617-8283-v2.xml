                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ECHO</label>, a sound reflected or reverberated from
                    a solid concave body, and so repeated to the ear. The word is formed from the
                    Greek ηχoς, <hi rend="italic">sound,</hi> which comes from the verb ηχsω, <hi
                        rend="italic">sono.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The ancients being wholly unacquainted with the true cause of the echo,
                    ascribed it to several which are sufficiently whimsical. But the moderns, who
                    know sound to consist in a certain tremor or vibration in the sonorous body,
                    communicated to the contiguous air, and by that means to the ear, give a more
                    consistent account of echo. For a tremulous body, striking on another solid
                    body, may evidently be repelled without destroying or diminishing its tremor;
                    and consequently a sound may be redoubled by the resilition of the tremulous
                    body, or air. But a simple reflection of the sonorous air is not enough to
                    explain the echo; for then every plain surface of a solid hard body, as being
                    fit to reflect a voice or sound, would redouble it, which we find does not hold.
                    In order to produce an echo, therefore, it should seem that a kind of
                    concameration or vaulting is necessary, in order to collect, and by collecting
                    to heighten and increase, and afterwards reflect, the sound, as we fihd is the
                    case in reflecting the rays of light, where a concave mirror is required. In
                    effect, as often as a sound strikes perpendicularly on a wall, behind which is
                    any thing of a vault or arch, or even another parallel wall, so often will it be
                    reverberated in the same line, or other adjacent ones. For an echo to be heard,
                    therefore, it is necessary that the ear should be in the line of reflection; for
                    the person who made the sound to hear its echo, it is necessary that he should
                    be perpendicular to the place which reflects it; and for a manifold or
                    tautological echo, it is necessary that there should be a number of walls, and
                    vaults or cavities, either placed behind or fronting each other. A single arch
                    or concavity can scarcely ev∙er stop and reflect all the sound; but if there be
                    a convenient disposition behind it, part of the sound propagated thither, being
                    collected and reflected as before, will return another echo; or if there be
                    another concavity, opposed at a due distance to the former, the sound reflected
                    from the one upon the other will be tossed back again by the latter.</p>
                <p part="N">Echoes may be produced in circumstances wholly different. For, first, a
                        <hi rend="italic">plane</hi> obstacle reflects back the sound in its due
                    tone and loudness, allowance being made for the <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193328296?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8296-0397"
                    />proportionable decrease of the sound, according to its distance; secondly, a
                        <hi rend="italic">convex</hi> obstacle reflects the sound somewhat smaller
                    and somewhat quicker, though weaker, than otherwise it would be; and, thirdly, a
                        <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> obstacle echoes back the sound larger,
                    slower, and also inverted, but never according to the order of words. Nor does
                    it seem possible to contrive any single echo that shall invert the sound, and
                    repeat backwards; because, in such a case, the word last spoken, that is, which
                    last occurs to the obstacle, must be repelled first, which cannot be. For where
                    in the mean time should the first words hang and be concealed; or how, after
                    such a pause, could they be revived and animated again into motion? From the
                    determinate concavity or arching of the reflecting bodies, it may happen that
                    some of them shall only echo back one determinate note, and only from one place.
                    Fourthly, the echoing body being removed farther off, it reflects more of the
                    sound than when nearer, which is the reason why some echoes repeat but one
                    syllable, some one word, and some many. Fifthly, echoing bodies may be so
                    contrived and placed, that by reflecting the sound from one to the other, either
                    directly and mutually, or obliquely and by succession, out of one sound, a
                    multiple echo or many echoes shall arise. Add to this, that a multiple echo may
                    be made, by so placing the echoing bodies at unequal distances, that they may
                    reflect all one way, and not one on the other. By this means a manifold
                    successive sound will be heard, one clap of the hands like many, one <hi
                        rend="italic">ha</hi> continued like laughter, one single word like many of
                    the same tone and accent, and one viol like many of the same kind imitating each
                    other. Lastly, echoing bodies may be so arranged that from any one given sound
                    they shall produce many echoes different both as to tone and intention. By this
                    means a musical room may be so contrived that one instrument playing therein
                    shall not only seem as many of the same sort and size, but even as a concert of
                    different ones; which is effected by placing certain echoing bodies so that any
                    note placed shall be returned by them in thirds, fifths, and eighths.</p>

                    some particular musical tone; and others, <hi rend="italic"
                        >polysyllal&gt;ical,</hi> which return many syllables, words, and sentences.

                    echoes are those which return syllables and words the same oftentimes

                <p part="N">At the sepulchre of Metella, wife of Crassus, there was an echo, which
                    repeated what was said five times. Authors mention a tower at Cyzicus, where the
                    echo repeated seven times. One of the finest echoes we read of is that mentioned
                    by Barthius, in his notes on the <hi rend="italic">Thebais</hi> of Statius (lib.
                    vi. 30), which repeated the words uttered seventeen times; it was situated on
                    the banks of the Naha, between Coblentz and Bingen. Barthius assures us that he
                    bad proved what he writes, and had counted seventeen repetitions.</p>

                    a term applied to certain kinds of vaults and arches, most commonly of the

                    speech by Juno, and only permitted to answer to the questions which were put to
                    her. Pan had formerly been one of her admirers, but he never enjoyed her
                    favours. Echo, after she had been punished by Juno, fell in love with Narcissus;
