                    1549, was allied by birth to the highest families connected with the profession
                    of law, and himself one of its most distinguished ornaments. After having
                    completed his classical studies, he applied himself to that of law, and received
                    the instructions of the famous professors who then taught in the universities of
                    Louvain, Cologne, and Heidelberg. On his return to France, the civil disorders
                    which broke out in all parts having forced him to seek an asylum in foreign
                    countries, he retired to Geneva, where he hoped to find the tranquillity
                    necessary for his pursuits. He was received with distinction, and nominated to a
                    chair of law in 1580. Henry IV. appointed him magistrate of Gex in 1589; but
                    this city having the year after been taken by the Duke of Savoy, his house was
                    pillaged, and no resource remained for him but to pass into Germany. He,
                    however, proceeded no farther than Strasburg, where he taught the Pandects from
                    1591 till 1600, when the elector palatine called him to Heidelberg. But the
                    proceedings of his colleagues forced him six months afterwards to return to
                    Strasburg, where he remained three years more, at the end of which time he
                    consented to resume his functions at Heidelberg, upon an assurance which was
                    given him that he should have nothing to apprehend from the jealousy of the
                    other professors. It was only then that his countrymen became sensible of the
                    fault which had been committed in not endeavouring to retain in Franc^ a man of
                    such distinguished merit, and he was offered the chair which Cujas had just left
                    vacant at Bourges; but he declined the offer upon the ground of his age, which
                    did not admit of his attempting to form a new establishment; and he alleged the
                    same excuse in opposition to all the instances which were made to draw him to
                    Angers, to Valence, and to other universities of France and Germany. In 1618 he
                    was sent as deputy by the elector palatine to Louis X1IL, who received him well,
                    and solicited him to remain in Paris; but Godefroy had become attached to
                    Heidelberg, where he enjoyed all the consideration due to his talents, and where
                    he desired to end his days. In this expectation, however, he was disappointed.
                    The war, which extended to the palatinate, forced him to return a third time to
                    Strasburg, where, oppressed with grief and infirmities, he expired on the 7th of
                    September 1632, in the seventy-third year of his age. His friend Bernegger
                    pronounced his funeral oration, which is printed in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Opuscula</hi> of Loisel. Of all the works of Godefroy, that which does him
                    the greatest honour, and ensures him a permanent rank amongst jurisconsults, is
