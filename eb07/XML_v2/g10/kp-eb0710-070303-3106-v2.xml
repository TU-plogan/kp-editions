                    The density of the population on the plains is greater than in any other part of
                    Spain; but as a great proportion of the country is covered with lofty, and in
                    many parts uninhabitable mountains, it is not much more thickly peopled than the
                    general average of the kingdom. The mountains of Granada are much higher than
                    any other range in Europe; for though the extreme summit of Mont Blanc is
                    somewhat higher than the most elevated peak of the Sierra Nevada, yet none of
                    the other points in the Alps attains the same altitude. The ridge called, from
                    its being perpetually covered witlι snow, the Sierra Nevada, runs from
                    north-east to south-west. .Geometrical levels were taken in 1804, and the
                    highest peaks were found to be, Mulahacen, 12,762 feet, and Picacho de Veleta,
                    12,459 feet, above the level of the sea. The height at which perpetual snow is’
                    to be found is 9915 feet. In the winter indeed it descends considerably lower,
                    but above that line it never wholly melts so as to discover the surface. This
                    range of mountains declines gradually towards the south till it approaches
                    Almeria, where it again rises to the height of 7800 feet on the Sierra de Gador.
                    This sierra is a solid rock of marble, without any other covering than the snow,
                    which lies on the higher parts of it three quarters of the year, and only
                    totally melts in the hottest months of summer. Near it is the singular rock
                    called Filabres, which appears to be an enormous pyramid of white marble, 2000
                    feet in height, and four miles in circumference at the base; and has no mixture
                    of any other stones or earth with it. To the eastward of the range of the Sierra
                    Nevada the mountains called the Apuxarras extend to the sea, and stretch from
                    Almeria to Motril on the coast of the Mediterranean, about seventeen leagues.
                    This range of mountains may be considered as a very sterile tract of country in
                    general, but on it are mixed plains and valleys which are highly fruitful, and
                    nourish considerable herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats, and besides
                    feed great abundance of pigs, which furnish hams in considerable quantities. The
                    plains interspersed in this mountain range afford great quantities of mulberry
                    trees, on which silk worms are reared, and their produce is one of the
                    foundations of the silk manufactories of the capital. It was to these mountains
                    that the Moorish race was removed on the final subjection of their capital to
                    Ferdinand; and the industry they displayed seems to have been continued by the
                    other inhabitants, after the remainsof that singular race were most impoliticly
                    and wickedly banished from these mountain retreats to the shores of Africa.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides these mountains on the eastern division, there are many ranges
                    between the capital and Gibraltar, which, though they do not equal them in
                    height, exhibit a grandeur and sublimity both pleasing and awful. Amongst these
                    may be classed the Sierra Vermcja and the Sierra de Ar-boto, which approach the
                    coast near Marvella, and the Sierra Junquilla on the road to Ronda. These,
                    though slightly sprinkled with snow, have no permanent covering of that
                    substance, except during the winter months.</p>
                <p part="N">The rivers of Granada are the Xenil and the Darro, issuing from the
                    Sierra Nevada; the Guadalhora, which rises in the mountains near Antequera, and
                    waters the most fertile of its valleys; and the Guadiaro, which issues from the
                    mountains near Ronda.</p>
                <p part="N">The valleys of Granada deserve attention, from being perhaps the most
                    fertile spots in Europe, and yielding with but little labour the richest
                    productions of nature in the greatest abundance. Amongst these is prominent the
                    Vega or plain of Granada, if that can be called a valley which is 2400 feet
                    above the level of the sea. This plain, however, is so surrounded by the
                    loftiest mountains, that it is in effect, and has in appearance, all the
                    properties of a rich valley. The melted snow from the Sierra Nevada is
                    perpetually descending in the form of transparent rivulets; and the industry of
                    the inhabitants has been constantly directed to conducting these into such
                    channels as can most effectually irrigate the lands. As the melting of the ice
                    and snow proceeds most rapidly in the warmest weather, the summer months, the
                    parched land, which most requires moisture, is thus provided with it most
                    copiously. The decomposition of the rocks which surround the plain is constantly
                    proceeding, and the rapid torrents derived from the melting of the snow bring
                    into the plain a constant succession of new soil, which in spreading itself over
                    the land by the process of irrigation, refreshes the earth, and invigorates
                    vegetation. The highest enjoyment a practical agri culturist of good observation
                    can have, is in riding over this plain, and viewing the rapid progress of
                    vegetation, the rich productions of the soil, and the admirable skill displayed
                    in dispensing the refreshing streams which descend from the lofty mountains.</p>
                <p part="N">In the midst of this plain, and in the most fruitful and delightful part
                    of it, is that estate which, by the gratitude of the Spanish nation, has been
                    conferred on the Duke of Wellington. The Sota de Roma is a fine tract of land,
                    about five miles in length and two miles in breadth. It was retained by
                    Ferdinand at the conquest of Granada, and made an appendage to the crown; and
                    several successive monarchs used it as a retreat from the cares of a throne.
                    Having been granted to Wall when prime minister of Spain, he rebuilt the mansion
                    in part, and fitted it up in the best taste. He improved the grounds, laid out
                    gardens, and made roads through the woods, which he stocked with game of all
                    kinds, but especially pheasants, a species of bird which does not generally
                    thrive in other parts of Spain. At his decease it reverted to tl&gt;c crown, and
                    was afterwards granted to Godoy, prince of the peace; but on his forfeiture it
                    came again into the possession of the government, when it was granted in
                    perpetuity to the Duke of Wellington. More than four thousand acres are
                    woodland, and abound with good elm trees, the right of cutting which used to be
                    reserved by the crown. The other part of this domain is excellent cultivated
                    land, with great facilities of irrigation, and produces most extraordinary crops
                    of wheat, barley, hemp, flax, and fruits of all kinds.</p>
                <p part="N">The parts of the plain near Alhama yield prodigious crops of wheat and
                    barley. They are cultivated in open fields at a distance from towns or even
                    villages. At seed time the proprietors with their labourers pitch tents on the
                    ground, and remain at the fields till the seed is deposited. At the harvest,
                    tents are again pitched; the inhabitants of <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193523119?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3119-0704"/>the town
                    fill them, and continue in the fields till the whole of the produce is cut and
                    thrashed out. This last operation is performed on a thrashing floor in the open
                    air. In each large division of com-land there is a circular portion, very level,
                    paved with large stones; on these thrashing floors the com is piled in the
                    straw, and a number of unbroken horses, or more commonly mares, are held by long
                    reins, and driven round the circle. By their treading the corn is separated from
                    the straw with great facility. The dry state which the straw is brought to by
                    the time it is cut makes it separate with but little labour; and from this
                    dryness of the straw, it is so broken in the operation of thrashing, that it
                    becomes like our chopped straw, and is carefully preserved in that condition as
                    food for cattle in those dry months when no vegetation is visible in the
                    meadows. This plan of thrashing the com on floors in the fields where it grew is
                    derived from high antiquity, and its practicŧ may be seen in the sacred writings
                    at the time of the patriarch Abraham. So dry is the climate of Spain, that the
                    corn could not be carried to a distance, even if the roads were good and wheel
                    carriages were used, without shaking out the greater part of the grain. After
                    this description of the mode of harvesting the grain, it need not be added that
                    bams are not necessary appendages to a com farm. The straw in the broken state
                    here described is formed into stacks, and the grain, when separated from the
                    straw, and by a flapping wheel from the chaff, is deposited in paniers, and
                    conveyed on the backs of asses to the granaries of the proprietors in the towns,
                    where, for the most part, and not on their farms, they reside. In some parts of
                    Granada there is a mode of preserving wheat for many years without its
                    sustaining any injury. In caves hewn in the granite rocks they carefully line
                    the bottom and sides with chaff or the finest of the broken straw; the caverns
                    are then filled with the grain in bulk, and the top covered with chaff to the
                    thickness of about eighteen inches. In tlιis state no humidity can reach it from
                    without; and the heat of the climate having perfectly dried it in the process of
                    harvesting, it may remain secure for almost any period. Some repositories of
                    this kind made by the Moors three centuries ago have been discovered within
                    recent periods, and the grain was as good as when first deposited. It was the
                    practice of the’ Moors, on the birth of a child, to lay up its future portion in
                    grain, concealed in these caves, which, from the turbulent state of the country,
                    were usually in as secret spots as they could select. When the child reached
                    maturity his property was pointed out and his provision appropriated; but
                    sometimes those who knew of the secret deposit were cut off, and the grain
                    remained bŵried without discovery.</p>
                <p part="N">Many practices in the husbandry of Granada which differ from those in
                    the other parts of Spain may be traced to the circumstances in which the Moors
                    were placed, when, having been subdued in the other parts of the peninsula,
                    their sole dominion for three hundred years was contracted to the small but rich
                    kingdom of Granada.</p>
                <p part="N">The cultivation of mulberry trees, and the breeding of silk worms which
                    depend upon them, is an important portion of the agriculture of Granada. Long
                    practice and attention has led the cultivators to know the species of mulberries
                    whieh yield the most leaves, and the greatest quantity of silk from the worms
                    that feed on them. The white mulberry, when grafted on the stock of the wild
                    mulberry, is now almost universally preferred, as those leaves produce not only
                    the greatest proportionate quantity of silk, but it is also of a much finer
                    quality than that yielded by either the white or the black mulberry leaves. As
                    the trees are cultivated not for the sake of the fruit, but solely for the food
                    which the leaves supply, it is customary to cut off the tops, which, they find,
                    diminishes the quantity of the fruit and increases that of the leaves. The worms
                    suffer much by any great humidity in the leaves on which they feed; and hence
                    the cultivators are careful not to gather any as long as the dew remains on
                    them, or after a shower of rain; and if the weather appears lowering, it is the
                    practice to gather as many leaves as will suffice for three or four days’
                    consumption; but care is taken that they neither become shrivelled nor mildewed,
                    in either of which cases they would injure the worm. There is perhaps no animal
                    whose voracity compared with its size equals that of the silk worm, especially
                    during the eight or ten days which precede their beginning to spin. It is
                    estimated that the leaves of a tree of ten years growth are devoured in three
                    days by as many worms as will yield seven pounds of silk. The silk produced by
                    the worms here is calculated as one 1&gt;ound from 2500 worms. The quantity of
                    silk produced on the plains of Granada, on an average of years, is 100,000
                    pounds, and there must consequently be two hundred and fifty millions of worms,
                    and near three millions five hundred thousand mulberry trees in full bearing,
                    besides those decayed, and those not arrived at maturity.</p>
                <p part="N">If the vegetable productions of Granada were enumerated, they would be
                    found to include almost every gift of every climate; for as the variation in
                    temperature descends from that of the coldest to that of almost the hottest
                    regions of the globe, so the different productions are all to be met with here
                    within a very narrow compass. On the high levels the apples, pears, and plums of
                    the colder parts of Europe grow to perfection. In the middle regions they have
                    wheat, barley, wine, hemp, flax, grapes, olives, peaches, apricots,
                    pomegranates, and other similar fruits; whilst in the hotter regions in the low
                    valleys, on a level with the sea, coffee, cotton, sugar cane, and indigo, are
                    cultivated with success; and those more rare fruits, the pine-apple, the
                    chircmaya, the guava, and the banana, are brought to perfection in the open air.
                    The agriculture of the level parts from Manveļla to Velez Malaga, except that
                    the labourers are not negro slaves, exactly resembles that of the islands in the
                    West Indies; and the face of the country and its different productions recal to
                    the mind of the traveller the scenery, the odours, and all the sensations
                    experienced in the finest districts of the tropical regions.</p>
                <p part="N">From the agriculture we turn next to the mineral riches which this
                    province affords in return for the labour of man. In former times mines of gold
                    and silver were wrought, and the sands of the river Darro were found to be
                    enriched with grains of the former precious metal. The veins still exist; but
                    since the discovery of the mines of Mexico and Peru, and the value of the
                    precious metals has been reduced, they have ceased to yield sufficient to pay
                    the labourers’ wages that must be employed in them. Copper, iron, and lead are
                    found in the mountains of secondary formation; and though from the scarcity of
                    fuel they are not worked to the extent which they might be if that commodity
                    were more abundant, yet it is ascertained that they are as rich in ore now as at
                    the former periods when their produce formed the foundation of an extensive
                    commerce with Egypt, Greece, and the borders of Asia. No part of the world
                    abounds with more beautiful marbles than the province of Granada. The public
                    buildings, the fountains, the statues, and the ornaments made from them on the
                    spot, strike the beholder with surprise, by their beauty, their variety, and
                    their cheapness; but from their bulky and weighty character, the difficulty of
                    transporting them over mountains and precipices where no roads have been formed,
                    is such as to preclude their removal with any chance of being repaid for the
                    labour bestowed on it. Alabaster, jasper, and most beautiful serpentine, are in
                    some degree articles of commerce; and the fluates of lime, called in England
                    Derbyshire spar, are worked into various fanciful and ornamental pieces of
                    furniture.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523132?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3132-0705"/>
                <p part="N">The manufactories of this province are considerable for the extent of
                    the population, and consist of silks, linens, woollens, sail-cloth, leather, and
                    other articles, the particulars of which will be found under the names of the
                    different places in which they are carried on.</p>
                <p part="N">The foreign commerce almost wholly passes through the port of Malaga,
                    and will be found under that article; but the domestic trade is the most
                    considerable and most beneficial. The part to the north of the mountains
                    supplies the sea coast with corn, cattle, and some manufactures, and receives in
                    return coffee, sugar, cotton, and the other productions of the warmer climate.
                    It sends to Castille corn, oil, and dried figs, and receives in return some wine
                    and manufactured articles.</p>
                <p part="N">The salubrity of the climate of Granada varies with the various
                    elevations. On the sea coast the valleys are excessively hot; and, though not
                    uniformly, are frequently subject to those visitations which have thinned the
                    population of several cities in the western hemisphere. In the year 1804 an
                    epidemic fever which passed along the shores of Spain visited this province with
                    most fearful destruction to human life; and, though not to the same extent, yet
                    before and since, such fevers have prevailed. On the more elevated plains, and
                    on the mountains, such pestilential dispensations have not been experienced, and
                    the inhabitants enjoy as much health, strength, activity, and longevity as in
                    any part of the world.</p>

                    the Moorish government, its final subjugation, and the subsequent extirpation of
                    the remainder of the Arabian race, will fall more naturally under our notice of
                    the history of the whole kingdom of Spain.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Granada,</hi> a city of Spain, and capital of the
                    province or kingdom of that name, in Andalusia. It is situated partly in the
                    celebrated plain called the Vega de Granada, and partly on the declivity of a
                    hill whose summit is covered with that massive pile of buildings called the
                    Alhambra, of which a description may be seen under that article. The rivers
                    Xenil and Darro have their rise in the mountains, and pass through the city; the
                    former is a clear, and at times a small stream, but the latter is a mountain
                    torrent, at some periods almost destitute of water, and at others overflowing
                    its banks, and producing extensive inundations. After traversing the plain, both
                    streams unite and force their way into the Guadalquivir. Many of the streets of
                    Granada are steep, most of them are narrow, and all of them are ill paved. No
                    object can be more strikingly beautiful at a few miles distance than this city,
                    but the appearance on entering it by no means corresponds to the distant
                    impressions.</p>
                <p part="N">The market-place or great square is spacious and well proportioned. The
                    houses have piazzas, which afford shelter from the heat of the sun; but the want
                    of glass windows, and the substitution of red shutters, give them a mean
                    appearance. The cathedral is a very large and splendid but irregular building,
                    having been formed by throwing into One edifice three contiguous churches. The
                    high altar, the pulpits, and the choir, are fine groups, and beautifully adorned
                    with some of the finest specimens of variegated and highly polished marble that
                    has been found in this vicinity. It has within it two fine monuments, one to the
                    memory of Philip I., the other to that of Ferdinand and Isabella; and it is
                    adorned with some pictures from the pencil of that celebrated artist Alonzo
                    Cano, which, though disgusting to Protestants from the sacred objects they
                    represent, yet possess exquisite merit as paintings. There are some fine statues
                    executed by the same artist, who was a sculptor as well as a painter. The
                    vice-regal palace, in which is the supreme court of justice for the province, is
                    an extensive and splendid building; but its effect is destroyed by having houses
                    so close as to prevent a proper view of it. The palace of the archbishop is a
                    very large pile, but of no particular beauty, though, as having been the scene
                    of the adventures of Gil Blas, in the work of Le Sage, which every one has read,
                    it is generally inquired for and noticed by travellers.</p>
                <p part="N">The city of Granada contains at present 66,660 inhabitants, who are
                    generally a more industrious people than the other natives of Spain. The
                    activity of the Moors, if not their blood, has been left behind them; and, in
                    spite of the bad maxims of the court of Madrid, this city displays considerable
                    industry in many arts and manufactures. The woollen manufactories employ about
                    7000 persons of the two sexes, and afford cloths, serges, baizes, and stuffs,
                    but not in sufficient quantities for the consumption of the surrounding
                    district, the deficiency being supplied by importation through the port of
                    Malaga. The whole of the silk which the plain yields is made in this city into
                    taffetas, satins, ribbons, and similar goods; and, besides their own produce,
                    silk in some years is brought from Vaįencia to be used in this place. There are
                    manufactories of linen, sail-cloth, and a very small one of cotton. The
                    sail-cloths are estimated as of most excellent quality, and are but little
                    subject to the mildew in the most humid climate. Iron and steel are made here
                    into the various smaller articles required for domestic and agricultural
                    purposes. The Carthusian convent is an extensive establishment; and the fathers
                    possess several farms, which they cultivate themselves; and some other of the
                    religious foundations are very rich. Institutions for education are upon a low
                    scale; and most of those destined for the learned profession receive their
                    instruction either in the universities of Seville or Alcala. From the locality
                    of this city, it is remarkably healthy. The vicinity of the Sierra Nevada, from
                    which cool breezes blow in the midst of summer, tends to give a freshness to the
                    atmosphere, even in the dog-days; and, considering the productions, the climate!
                    and the beautiful streams, it is not wonderful that the Moors long looked back
                    with fond regret to the delightful spot from which, after an obstinate
                    resistance, they were at length most reluctantly driven.</p>
