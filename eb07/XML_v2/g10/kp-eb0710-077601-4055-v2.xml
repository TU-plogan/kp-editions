                    Lord Brooke, a poet and miscellaneous writer, was born in the year 1554, and
                    descended from the noble families of Beauchamps of Powick and Willoughby de
                    Brooke. In company with his cousin Sir Philip Sidney, he began his education at
                    a school in Shrewsbury; whence he went to Oxford, where he remained for some
                    time as a gentleman commoner, and then removed to Trinity Coìlege, Cambridge.
                    Having left the university, he visited foreign courts, and thus to his knowledge
                    of the ancient languages added an acquaintance with the modern. On his return to
                    England he was introduced to Queen Elizabeth by his uncle Robert Greville, at
                    that time in her majesty’s service; and by means of Sir Henry Sidney, lord
                    president of Wales, he was nominated to some lucrative employments in that
                    principality.</p>
                <p part="N">On the accession of King James I. he was installed knight of the bath;
                    and soon afterwards obtained a grant of the ruinous castle of Warwick, which he
                    repaired at a considerable expense, and where he probably resided during the
                    earlier part of this reign. In the year 1614, he was made under-treasurer and
                    chancellor of the exchequer, a member of the privy-council, and gentleman of the
                    bed-chamber; and in 1620 he was raised to the dignity of baron by the style and
                    title of Lord Brooke of Beauchamp's Court. He was also privy-councillor to King
                    Charles I., in the beginning of whose reign he founded an historical lecture in
                    Cambridge. Having thus attained the age of seventy-four, through a life of
                    continued prosperity, and being universally admired as a gentleman and a
                    scholar, he fell by the hand <hi rend="italic">of</hi> an assassin, one of his
                    own domestics, who immediately stabbed himself with the same weapon with which
                    he had murdered his master. Notwithstanding Lord Orford’s flippant and
                    depreciatory estimate of Lord Brooke’s talents, he appears to have cherished a
                    taste for polite learning, particularly for poetry and history. His principal
                    works are, 1. The Life of the renowned Sir Philip Sidney, London, 1652, in 12mo;
                    2. Certaine Learned and Elegant Werkes of the Right Hon. Fulke Lord Brooke,
                    written in his youth and familiar exercise with Sir Philip Sidney, London, 1633;
                    3. The Remains of Sir Fulke Greville Lord Brooke, being Poems of Monarchy and
                    Religion, never before printed, London, 1670, in 8vo. Lord Orford erroneously
                    attributes to him “Five Yeares of King James, or the condition of the State of
                    England, and the relation it hath to other Provinces,” 1643; a work which was
                    evidently written by one of the Presbyterians, and which was republished with
                    additions in 1651, 4to.</p>
