                    the younger, born 16 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> and died 19 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> who seems to have
                    inherited all the virtues of his father, and to have been distinguished, in a
                    profligate and selfish age, for strictly honourable conduct, and a kind regard
                    to the feelings of others. He was a particular favourite of Augustus, who caused
                    him to be adopted (4 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.)</hi> into the family of his
                    uncle Tiberius, and gave him the command of eight legions on the banks of the
                    Rhine (7 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.).</hi> Here he remained till the death of
                    Augustus (14 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.),</hi> regulating the affairs of Gaul,
                    and keeping in check the restless and warlike Germans beyond the Rhine. He was
                    engaged in collecting the revenue in Gaul when the news of the emperor’s demise
                    reached him, and he does not appear to have hesitated a momentas to the course
                    which his duty called on him to pursue. Though urged by his personal friends,
                    and not ignorant of the strong party which the popular conduct of hts family had
                    secured to him, he refused to contest the crown with his uncle Tiberius. On the
                    contrary, he hurried to the armies in Germany to employ his influence in
                    inducing them to submit to the authority of Tiberius, and upon his arrival found
                    that the armies of both the Upper and Lower Rhine had refused to take the oath
                    of allegiance, and wished to proclaim himself emperor. It required all his
                    firmness and prudence to extricate himself from the difficulties in which he
                    found himself involved, and he only succeeded in quelling the sedition by
                    forging an imperial rescript, granting them all that they demanded. The
                    appearance of deputies from the senate caused the sedition again to break out;
                    but he contrived to induce the less violent part of the soldiers to seize the
                    ringleaders and put them to death. (Tacit. <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> i.
                    31-35.) He then led his troops against the Marsi and Catti, to give them an
                    opportunity of atoning for their conduct, and laid waste the country inhabited
                    by these tribes. The next year Arminius, who possessed great influence with his
                    countrymen, induced them to revolt. The Cherusci, one of the most powerful
                    nations of Germany, and all the surrounding tribes, prepared to make an
                    incursion into the Roman territory; but Germanicus, becoming acquainted with
                    their intentions, anticipated them in their movements, and boldly penetrated
                    into their country. Defeating the Bructeri near the spot where Verus and his
                    legions had fallen, he pursued Arminius; but the battle which he fought was
                    doubtful. Next year he determined to save his army from the risks and fatigues
                    of a march through a thicldy-wooded and difficult country', by building a fleet
                    and conducting it along the coast. He was successful in this proceeding, and
                    landed his army at the mouth of the river Amisia, <hi rend="italic">Ems.</hi> He
                    defeated the united forces of the Germans in two battles; but as he was
                    returning to the Rhine he was overtaken by a tempest, and many of his vessels
                    were lost. Tiberius, suspicious of his intentions, and jealous of his
                    popularity, took this opportunity of withdrawing him from the scene of his
                    glory. On his return to Rome he enjoyed the honour of a triumph for all the
                    victories he had gained over the Germans. (Tacit. <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> i.
                    51-71; ii. 6-26.)</p>
                <p part="N">Germanicus was too formidable a subject and too virtuous a character not
                    to excite unmingled fear in the mind of the suspicious Tiberius; and as the
                    tyτant did not dare to cut him off in presence of the Roman people, he sent him
                    into honourable banishment, by giving him the command of the province of Asia.
                    Thither the emperor had also sent Piso, who was devoted to his interests, and
                    the uncompromising enemy of Germanicus, a person, in short, who would stop at
                    nothing to rid himself of his opponent. At Antioch Germanicus was taken ill, and
                    died after a short illness, the innocent victim of Piso and his master Tiberius.
                    He was deeply regretted by the Roman people, who regarded him as likely to bring
                    back the halcyon days of the Augustan age. It will readily be imagined that he
                    was a patron of literature and the sciences; and he was himself an author,
                    having translated the Phenomena of Aratus, and written epigrams, several of
                    which have been preserved. They have been published in a work entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Carmina Familia</hi><hi rend="italic">Caesareoe,</hi> Coburg,
                    1715. His life has been written by Beaufort, Leyden, 1741.</p>
