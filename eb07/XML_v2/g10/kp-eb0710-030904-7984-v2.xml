                <p part="N"><label type="entry">GAME LAWS</label>. The term <hi rend="italic"
                        >game,</hi> in a large sense, seems to comprehend all animals obtained by
                    fowling and hunting, animals <hi rend="italic">feroe naturoe,</hi> as
                    contradistinguished to tame animals, such as horses, cows, sheep, and the like,
                    which do not fly the dominion of man, but generally keep within the same
                    pastures and closes; but in its stricter acceptation it applies only to those
                    wild animals which the <hi rend="italic">game laws</hi> and other arbitrary
                    constitutions have distinguished by that appellation.</p>
                <p part="N">The view taken on this subject by Judge Blackstone is this: By the law
                    of nature, says he, every man, from the prince to the peasant, has an equal
                    right of pursuing and taking to his own use all such creatures as <hi
                        rend="italic">are Jera: natur&lt;e,</hi> and therefore the property of
                    nobody, but liable to be seized by the first occupant; and so it was held by the
                    imperial law even so late as the time of Justinian. But this right, like others
                    of the same kind, may be restrained by positive laws, and we find has been so
                    restrained by the municipal laws of many nations. Yet however defensible these
                    provisions may in general be, on the footing of reason, or justice, or civil
                    policy, we roust notwithstanding acknowledge, that in their present shape they
                    owe their immediate origin to slavery, having been introduced into Europe along
                    with the féodal system. On the Norman conquest, the right of pursuing and taking
                    such animals as were accounted <hi rend="italic">game</hi> was held to belong to
                    the king, or to such only as were authorized by him. And this, the learned
                    commentator says, as well upon the principles of the féodal law, that the king
                    is the ultimate proprietor of all the lands in the kingdom, as upon another
                    maxim of the common law, that these animals are <hi rend="italic">bona</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">vocantia,</hi> and, having no other owner, belong to the king
                    by his prerogative. Wherefore, he concludes, all persons, of what property or
                    distinction so-</p>
                <p part="N">ever, who kill game without the king’s grant, are guilty of encroaching
                    on the royal prerogative; and those persons who do so without having what is
                    called a qualification, are guilty not only of the original offence, but also of
                    the aggravations created by the statutes for preserving the game; which
                    aggravations are so severely punished, and those punishments so implacably
                    inflicted, that the offence against the king is seldom thought of, provided the
                    miserable delinquent can make his peace with the lord of the manor.</p>
                <p part="N">The doctrine thus promulgated, novel and startling as it was, maintained
                    itself long on the mere name and reputation of the author. It is now, however,
                    admitted to be incorrect. The law of Canute, noticed by Blackstone, “quilibet
                    homo dignus venatione sua, in sylva et in agris sibi propriis et in dominio
                    suo,” was confirmed by many succeeding kings; and there is no instance, civil or
                    criminal, in which a person has been sued or prosecuted on behalf of the king
                    for taking game, unless he took it out of some privileged place. On the
                    contrary, there is a current of dicta and decisions showing that owners of land
                    have uniformly been considered as having a local property in game, and a right
                    to take it whilst upon their own land.</p>
                <p part="N">However, the legislative provisions are in restraint of the common law
                    right; and these provisions were till lately many and various, and not a little
                    obscure and intricate. But in October 1831 an important act was passed to amend
                    the laws of England relative to game, namely, 1 and 2 Gul. IV. c. 32, which
                    repealed about thirty previous statutes on the subject, and, excepting as to
                    game certificates, may be looked upon as containing nearly the whole law in
                    relation to game.</p>
                <p part="N">This statute of William begins by enacting that the word <hi
                        rend="italic">game</hi> shall, for all the purposes of the act, be deemed to
                    include hares, pheasants, partridges, grouse, heath or moor game, black game,
                    and bustards. It then sets out the <hi rend="italic">days</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">times</hi> during which game shall not be killed, declaring
                    that if any person shall kill or take any game, or use any dog, gun, net, or
                    other engine or instrument for the purpose of killing or taking any game on a
                        <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Christmas day,</hi> he
                    shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay, for every such offence, such sum of
                    money, not exceeding L-5, as to the justices shall seem meet, together with the
                    costs of conviction; and prohibiting, under a penalty, the killing or taking any

                    in the new Forest of Southampton) between 10th December and 20th August, or in

                    it further declares, that if any person, with intent to destroy or injure any
                    game, shall at any time put any poison or poisonous ingredient on any ground,
                    whether open or enclosed, where game usually resort, or in any highway, every
                    such person shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay such sum of money, not
                    exceeding L.10, as to the justices shall seem meet, together with the costs of
                    conviction; and further, that if any person <hi rend="italic">licensed</hi> to

                    possession, or control, any bird of game after the expiration of ten days (one
                    inclusive and the other exclusive) from the respective days in each year on
                    which it shall become unlawful to kill or take such birds of game respectively
                    as aforesaid, or if any person not being licensed to deal in game, shall buy or

                    in each year on which it shall become unlawful to kill or take such birds of

                    which it shall become unlawful to kill or take such birds of game respectively
                    as aforesaid, every such person shall, on conviction, forfeit and pay, for every

                    meet, together with the costs of conviction. The act then provides that the
                    same, except as therein mentioned, shall not affect or alter the laws respecting
                        <hi rend="italic">game certificates</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    declares that all regulations and provisions contained in any act relative to
                    game certificates, as far as they relate to gamekeepers of manors, and to the
                    amount of duty for game certificates to be charged upon or in respect of
                    gamekeepers of manors in the cases specified in such act, shall apply to all
                    gamekeepers of lands appointed under this act; and it furtherdeclares, that
                    every person who shall have obtained an annual game certificate shall be
                    authorized to kill and take game, but subject to the law of trespass, and
                    provided always that no game certificate on which a less duty than L.3.13s. 6d.
                    is chargeable under the acts relating to game certificates shall authorize any
                    gamekeeper to kill or take any game, or to use any dog, gun, net, or other
                    engine or instrument, for the purpose of killing or taking game, except within
                    the limits included in his appointment as gamekeeper; but that in any case where
                    such gamekeeper shall kill or take any game, or use any dog, gun, net, or other
                    engine or instrument, for the purpose of killing or taking game, beyond such
                    limits, he may be proceeded against as if he had no game certificate whatsoever.
                    Then follow certain clauses which determine the rights of landlords in relation
                    to the game. The act declares, that in all cases where any person shall occupy
                    any land under any lease or agreement made previously to the passing of the act,
                    the lessor or landlord shall have the right of entering upon such land, or of
                    authorizing any other person or persons who shall have obtained an annual game
                    certificate to enter upon such land, for the purpose of killing or taking the
                    game thereon; and no person occupying any land, under any lease or agreement,
                    either for life or for years, made previously to the passing of this act, shall
                    have the tight to kill or take the game on such land, except where the right of
                    killing the game has been expressly allowed to such person by the lease or
                    agreement, or except where, upon the original granting or removal of the same, a
                    fine shall have been taken, or except where, in the case of a term for years,
                    the lease or agreement shall have been made for a term exceeding twenty-one
                    years; provided always that nothing contained in the act shall authorize any
                    person seised or possessed of land to kill or take the game, or to permit any
                    other to do so, where, by any deed, grant, lease, or any written or parole
                    demise or contract, a right of entry on such land for the purpose of killing or
                    taking the game has been or shall be reserved or retrieved by, or given or
                    allowed to, the granter or other person whatsoever; nor shall the act affect any
                    reservation or agreement already made in relation to game, nor in any manner
                    prejudice the rights of manor, forest, chase, or warren, nor any of his
                    majesty’s forest rights, nor the rights of any grantee of the crown; nor shall
                    the act be deemed to give to any owner of cattlegates, or rights of common, upon
                    or over any wastes or commons, any interest or privilege which he had not
                    before, nor authorize him to pursue or kill the game found on such wastes or
                    commons, nor defeat or diminish the rights and privileges of any lord, or of any
                    steward of the crown, of any manor, lordship, or royalty, in or over such wastes
                    or commons; but that the lord or steward of the crown, of any manor, &amp;c.
                    shall have the right to pursue and kill the game upon the wastes or commons
                    therein, and to authorize any other person who shall have obtained an annual
                    game certificate to enter upon such wastes or commons for the purpose of
                    pursuing and killing game thereon. And it is further enacted, that where the
                    lessor or landlord shall have reserved to himself the right of killing the game
                    upon any land, it shall be lawful for him to authorize any other person who
                    shall have obtained an annual game certificate, to enter upon such land for the
                    purpose of pursuing and killing game thereon; and also, that where the right of
                    killing game is by the act given to any lessor or landlord, in exclusion of the
                    right of the occupier of the land, or where such exclusive right has been or
                    shall be specially reserved by or granted to, or does or shall belong to, the
                    lessor, landlord, or any person whatsoever, other than the occupier of such
                    land, then and in every such case the occupier, if he shall pursue, kill, or
                    take any game upon the land, or give permission to any other person so to do,
                    without the authority of the lessor, landlord, or other person having the right
                    of killing the game, shall on conviction forfeit and pay for such pursuit, such
                    a sum of money, not exceeding L.2, and for every head of game so killed or
                    taken, such a sum of money, not exceeding L.l, as the justices shall be pleased
                    to award, together with the costs of conviction. Then follow certain provisions
                    allowing lords of manors and stewards of the crown-manors to appoint one or more
                    gamekeepers to preserve or kill the game, and with power to seize dogs, guns,
                    nets, and other engines and instruments used within the limits by uncer-tiĥcated
                    persons, and also allowing lords of manors and stewards of crown-manors to grant
                    deputations to persons as gamekeepers; and, after particular regulations
                    respecting appointments of gamekeepers in Wales, the act declares that no
                    appointment or deputation of a gamekeeper shall be valid, unless registered with
                    the clerk of the peace.</p>
                <p part="N">These provisions are followed by a series of important clauses in regard
                    to the <hi rend="italic">possession, purchase, and sale</hi> of game. The act
                    declares, that every person who shall have obtained an annual game certificate,
                    shall have power to sell game to any person <hi rend="italic">licensed</hi> to
                    deal in game, provided always that no game certificate on which a less duty than
                    L.3. 13s. 6d. is chargeable, shall authorize any gamekeeper to sell game, except
                    on the account and with the written authority of the master whose gamekeeper he
                    is; and the act appoints special sessions of the peace, to be holden in the
                    month of July yearly, for the purpose of granting licenses to persons therein
                    pointed out to deal in game; and every person so licensed shall annually, and
                    during the continuance of his license, and before he shall be empowered to deal
                    in game under his license, take out a certificate, with a duty of L.2, to be
                    paid to the collector of assessed taxes for the district, under a penalty of
                    L.20. And further, the act declares, that if any person licensed to deal in game
                    shall, during the period of license, be convicted of any offence whatever
                    against the act, his license shall thereupon become null and void. Other clauses
                    which follow create penalties for <hi rend="italic">killing or taking game,</hi>
                    or using any dog, gun, or other engine, for the purpose of searching for or
                    killing or taking game without a game certificate; for <hi rend="italic"
                        >destroying or taking the eggs</hi> of any bird of game, or of any swan,

                    license to deal in game, may sell game for consumption in their own houses, such
                    game having been procured from some person licensed to deal in game; for <hi

                    persons assuming or pretending to be licensed; and the whole is closed by a

                        >servants</hi> of licensed dealers. Then follows the 30th section, with this
                    preamble: “And whereas, after the commencement of this act, game will become an
                    article which may be legally bought and sold, and it is therefore just and
                    reasonable to. provide some more summary means than now by law exist for
                    protecting the same from trespassers ;” whereupon various regulations are made
                    respecting <hi rend="italic">trespass</hi> in search or pursuit of game. These,
                    however, we shall hereafter specify, because they are substantially the same
                    with those contained in an act since passed for Scotland, to which kingdom the
                    unrepealed act 9 Geo. IV. c. 69, also extends.</p>
                <p part="N">In this country there was originally, as in England, no restraint on the
                    taking of game within one’s own land. It is particularly noticed, that in the
                    time of King Alexander it was not defended nor forbidden to any man to hunt nor
                    to chase the hare and fox, and other wild beasts, without forests and warrens,
                    wheresoever they were found ÍM. T. C. c. 52); and as late as the time of King
                    James II. an act was passed (1474, c. 60), declaring that it should not be
                    lawful to hunt or destroy game “in <hi rend="italic">vtheris</hi> closes or
                    parkes,” without the owner’s leave. In the following century the idea of game as
                    the subject of gentlemen’s pastime appears; and the act 1551, c. 9, was passed,
                    to restrain certain modes of detroying birds then commonly practised,
                    “quhairthrow the noblemen of the realme can get na pastime of halking and
                    hunting, like as hes beene had in times bypast." In the beginning of the
                    seventeenth century the principle of the first English qualification act (13
                    Rich. II. c. 13), the title of which is, “None shall hunt but they who have a
                    sufficient living,” was adopted by the Scottish legislature in the act 1600, c.
                    23; and upon that principle, no doubt, soon followed the statute 1621, c. 31,
                    which enacts “that no man hunt or hawk at any time hereafter, who hath not a
                    plough of land in heritage, under the pain of L.100 Scots, half to the king and
                    half to the prosecutor.” This is the substantive <hi rend="italic">Game
                        Qualification Act</hi> of Scotland; and under it the courts have held, that
                    a qualified person may communicate the right of shooting to any individual over
                    the lands of the former; and that a qualified landlord may hunt on his ground in
                    the hands of tenants, paying damage; but that neither a servitude of pasturage
                    nor a lease of land carry a right to kill game, nor yet a lease of game, as
                    against singular successors; nor can a qualified person hunt on the property of
                    another without the owner’s leave.</p>
                <p part="N">To the qualification required by the act 1621 has been added, by
                    subsequent statutes, that of <hi rend="italic">a game certificate,</hi> as in
                    England. To make the privilege valuable, various penalties have also been
                    enacted against <hi rend="italic">poachers</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    lately the act of 9 Geo. IV. c. 69, was passed, applicable to both England and
                    Scotland, to prevent persons <hi rend="italic">going armed by night</hi> for the
                    destruction of game and rabbits. To all these is now to be added the act above
                    alluded to, namely, 2 and 3 Gul. IV. c. 68, which, though limited to Scotland,
                    is, as already mentioned, nearly a transcript of the 30th and following sections
                    of the late English game act. It enacts and declares, that if any person shall
                    commit any trespass, by entering or being in the daytime upon any land without
                    leave of the proprietor, in search or pursuit of game, or of deer, roe,
                    woodcocks, snipes, quails, landrails, wild ducks, or conies, such person shall
                    forfeit and pay a penalty not exceeding L.2, which is enlarged in the case of
                    the trespass being by a person having his face blackened, coloured, or
                    disfigured, for the purpose of disguise, or by persons to the number of five or
                    more together; and it further declares, that such trespassers may be required to
                    quit the land, and give their names and abodes, and, on their refusal so to do,
                    may be arrested. But it is provided, that the act shall not extend against
                    persons hunting or coursing with hounds or greyhounds, and being in fresh
                    pursuit of any deer, hare, or fox already started upon any other land on which
                    such persons were entitled to hunt or course. The act also declares, that game
                    may be taken from trespassers not delivering the same up when lawfully demanded;
                    and it provides a summary means for ensuring the conviction and punishment of
                    offenders; declaring also, that all penalties created by the statute shall go to
                    the poor of the parish. (u. u. u.)</p>
