                        >Sublimity.</hi> These terms have a double import, commonly signifying the
                    quality or circumstance in objects by which the emotions of grandeur and
                    sublimity are produced, and sometimes also the emotions themselves.</p>
                <p part="N">In treating this subject, it is necessary that the impression made on
                    the mind by the magnitude of an object, abstracting from its other qualities,
                    should be ascertained; and because abstraction is a mental operation of some
                    difficulty, the safest method of judging is, to choose an object which is
                    neither beautiful nor deformed, if such an one can be found. The plainest that
                    occurs is a huge mass of rubbish, the ruins perhaps of some extensive building;
                    or a large heap of stones, such as are collected together for keeping in memory
                    a battle or other remarkable event. Such an object, which in miniature would be
                    perfectly indifferent, makes an impression by its magnitude,and even appears
                    agreeable. And supposing it large enough to fill the eye, and prevent the
                    attention from wandering to other objects, the impression it makes will be so
                    much the deeper.</p>
                <p part="N">But though a plain object of this kind be agreeable, it is not termed
                        <hi rend="italic">grand</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> nor is it entitled to
                    that character, unless, together with its size, it be possessed of other
                    qualities which contribute to beauty, such as regularity, proportion, order, or
                    colour; but, according to the number of such qualities combined with magnitude,
                    it will be more or less grand. Thus St Peter’s church at Rome, the great pyramid
                    of Egypt, the Alps towering above the clouds, an arm of the sea, and, above all,
                    a clear and serene sky, are ^rand, because, besides theirdimensions, they are
                    beautiful in an eminent degree. On the other hand, an overgrown whale, having a
                    disagreeable appearance, is by no means grand. A large building, remarkable for
                    its regularity and proportions, is grand; and yet a much larger building, if
                    destitute of regularity, has not the least tincture <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193523171?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3171-0708"/>of
                    grandeur. A single regiment in battle-array makes a grand appearance, which the
                    surrounding crowd" does not, though perhaps ten times the number; and a regiment
                    where the men are all in one uniform, and the horses of one colour, makes a
                    grander appearance, and consequently strikes more terror, than where there is
                    confusion of colour and dress. Thus greatness or magnitude is the circumstance
                    which distinguishes grandeur from beauty; in other words, agreeableness is the
                    genus, of which beauty and grandeur are species.</p>
                <p part="N">The emotion of grandeur, if duly examined, will be found to furnish
                    additional proof of the truth of our doctrine. That this emotion is pleasant in
                    a high degree, requires no other evidence than an appeal to the feelings,
                    produced by the view of a grand object; and if an emotion of grandeur be
                    pleasant, its cause or object, as already observed, must infallibly be agreeable
                    in proportion.</p>
                <p part="N">The qualities of grandeur and beauty are not more distinct than the
                    emotions which these qualities produce in a spectator. All the various emotions
                    of beauty have one common character; that of sweetness and gaiety. The emotion
                    of grandeur has a different character. A large object that is agreeable,
                    occupies the whole attention, and swells the heart with a vivid emotion, which,
                    though extremely pleasant, is rather serious than gay. And this affords a good
                    reason for distinguishing in language these different emotions. The emotions
                    raised by colour, regularity, proportion, and order, have such a resemblance to
                    each other, ąs readily to come under one general term, <hi rend="italic">the
                        emotion of beauty</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the emotion of grandeur
                    is so different from these, that it deserves to have a peculiar name applied to
                    it.</p>
                <p part="N">Though regularity, proportion, order, and colour, contribute to grandeur
                    as well as to beauty, yet these qualities are not by any means so essential to
                    the former as to the latter. To establish this proposition, some preliminary
                    remarks are necessary. In the first place, the mind, not being totally occupied
                    with a small object, can give its attention at the same time to everý minute
                    part; but in a great or extensive object, the mind, being totally occupied with
                    the capital and striking parts, has no attention left for those which are little
                    or indifferent. In the next place, two similar objects appear not to be similar
                    when viewed at different distances; the similar parts of a very large object
                    cannot be seen except at different distances; and for this reason its
                    regularity, and the proportion of its parts, are in some measure lost to the
                    eye; neither are the irregularities of a very large object so conspicuous as
                    those of one which is small. Hence it is that a large object is not so agreeable
                    by its regularity as a small object, nor so disagreeable by its
                    irregularities.</p>
                <p part="N">These considerations render it evident that grandeur is satisfied with a
                    less degree of regularity, and of the other qualities mentioned, than is
                    requisite for beauty. This may be illustrated by an experiment. Suppose that,
                    approaching a small conical hill, we take an accurate survey of every part, and
                    are sensible of the slightest deviation from regularity and proportion. If the
                    hill were to be considerably enlarged, so as to make us less sensible of its
                    regularity, it would upon that account appear less beautiful. It would not,
                    however, appear less agreeable, because some slight emotion of grandeur would
                    come instead of that which it had lost in beauty. Lastly, suppose the hill
                    enlarged to a great mountain; then the small degree of beauty which is left
                    would be merged in its grandeur. Hence it is that a towering hill is delightful,
                    if it have but the slightest resemblance of a cone; and a chain of mountains is
                    not less so, though deficient in the accuracy of order and proportion. We
                    require a small surface to be smooth; but in an extensive plain, considerable
                    inequalities are overlooked. In a word, regularity, proportion, order, and
                    colour, contribute to grandeur as well as to beauty; but with this remarkable
                    difference, that in passing from small to great they are not required in the
                    same degree of perfection. This remark serves to explain the extreme delight we
                    feel in viewing the face of nature, when sufficiently enriched and diversified
                    with objects. The bulk of the objects in a natural landscape are beautiful, and
                    some of them grand; a flowing river, a spreading oak, a round hill, an extended
                    plain, are delightful; and even a rugged rock, or barren heath, though in
                    themselves disagreeable, contribute by contrast to the beauty of the whole; but
                    if to these we add the verdure of the fields, the mixture of light and shadow,
                    and the sublime canopy spread over all, it will not appear wonderful that so
                    extensive a group of splendid objects should swell the heart to the utmost, and
                    raise the strongest emotion of grandeur. The spectator becomes conscious of an
                    enthusiasm which cannot bear confinement, or the strictness of regularity and
                    order; he loves to range at large, and is so enchanted with magnificent objects
                    as to overlook slight beauties or deformities.</p>
                <p part="N">The same observation is applicable in some measure to works of art. In a
                    small building, the slightest irregularity is disagreeable; but in a magnificent
                    palace, or in a large Gothic church, irregularities are less regarded. In an
                    epic poem, we pardon many negligences which would not be permitted in a sonnet
                    or an epigram. But notwithstanding such exceptions, it may justly be laid down
                    as a rule, that in works of art, order and regularity ought to be governing
                    principles; and hence the justice of the observation of Longinus, that “in works
                    of art we have regard to exact proportion, and in those of nature, to grandeur
                    and magnificence.”</p>
                <p part="N">The same reflections are in a great measure applicable to sublimity,
                    particularly that, like grandeur, it is a species of agτeeableness; that a
                    beautiful object placed on an elevated position appears more agreeable than
                    formerly, and produces in the spectator a new emotion, termed <hi rend="italic"
                        >the emotion of sublimity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that the
                    perfection of order, regularity, and proportion, is less required in objects
                    elevated or placed at a distance, than in those which are at hand.</p>
                <p part="N">But though a grand object is agreeable, we must not thence infer that a
                    little object is disagreeable; which would be unfortunate for man, considering
                    that he is surrounded with so many objects of that description. The same thing
                    holds true with respect to place. A body placed high is agreeable; but the same
                    body placed low is not by that circumstance rendered disagreeable. Littleness
                    and lowness of place are precisely similar in this, that of themselves they
                    produce neither pleasure nor pain. And in this may be discovered a peculiar
                    adaptation in fitting the internal constitution of man to his external
                    circumstances. Were littleness and lowness of place agreeable, greatness and
                    elevation could not be so; were littleness and lowness of place disagreeable,
                    they would occasion uninterrupted uneasiness.</p>
                <p part="N">The difference between great and little with respect to agreeableness is
                    remarkably felt in a series when we pass gradually from one extreme to the
                    other. A mental progress from the capital to the kingdom, and from that to
                    Europe, to the whole earth, to the planetary system, to the universe, is
                    extremely pleasant; the heart swells, and the mind is dilated at every step. Nor
                    is the returning in an opposite direction positively painful, though our
                    pleasure lessens at every step, till it vanish into indifference. Such a
                    progress may sometimes produce pleasure of a different sort, arising from our
                    taking a narrower and narrower inspection. The same observation holds good in a
                    progress upwards and downwards. Ascent is pleasant because it elevates us; but
                    descent is never painful; on the contrary, it is for the most part pleasant from
                    a different cause, that it is according to the order of nature. The fall of a
                    stone <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523184?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0710-3184-0709"/>from any height is extremely agreeable by its
                    accelerated motion. We feel it pleasant to descend from a mountain, because the
                    descent is natural and easy. Neither is looking downwards painful; whilst, on
                    the contrary, looking down upon objects forms part of the pleasure of elevation.
                    Looking down becomes painful only when the object is so far below as to create
                    dizziness.</p>
                <p part="N">It has been remarked, that the emotions of grandeur and sublimity are
                    nearly allied; and hence it is, that the one term is frequently put for the
                    other. An increasing series of numbers, for example, producing an emotion
                    similar to that of mounting upwards, is commonly termed <hi rend="italic">an
                        ascending series</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a series of numbers gradually
                    decreasing, producing an emotion similar to that of going downwards, is commonly
                    termed <hi rend="italic">a descending series.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                        y</hi><hi rend="italic">Nc</hi> talk familiarly of going <hi rend="italic"
                        >up</hi> to the capital, and of going <hi rend="italic">down</hi> to the
                    country; and from a lesser kingdom we talk of going <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to
                    a greater, as in the <hi rend="italic">anabasis</hi> of the Greek language, when
                    one travelled from Greece to Persia. We discover the same mode of expression in
                    the language even of Japan; and its universality proves that it is the offspring
                    of a natural feeling.</p>
                <p part="N">This leads us to consider next grandeur and sublimity in a figurative
                    sense, and as applicable to the fine arts. Hitherto thęse terms have been taken
                    in their proper sense as applicable to objects of sight only; and it is of
                    importance to bestow some pains upon this, because, generally speaking, the
                    figurative sense of a word is derived from its proper sense, and particularly so
                    in the present instance. Beauty, in its original signification, is confined to
                    objects of sight; but as many other objects, intellectual as well as moral,
                    raise emotions resembling that of beauty, the resemblance of the effects prompts
                    us to extend the term <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi> to these objects. The same
                    principle serves equally to explain the terms <hi rend="italic">grandeur</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">sublimity,</hi> when employed in a figurative sense. Every
                    emotion, from whatever cause it proceeds, which resembles an emotion of grandeur
                    or elevation, is called by the same name. Thus generosity is said to be an <hi
                        rend="italic">elevated</hi> emotion, as well as great courage; and that
                    firmness of soul which is superior to misfortunes obtains the peculiar name of
                        <hi rend="italic">magnanimity.</hi> On the other hand, every emotion which
                    contracts the mind, and fixes it upon things trivial or of no importance, is
                    termed <hi rend="italic">low,</hi> by its resemblance to an emotion produced by
                    a little or low object of sight. Thus an appetite for trifling amusements is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">low taste.</hi> The same terms are applied to
                    characters and actions. We talk familiarly of an <hi rend="italic">elevated</hi>
                    genius, of a <hi rend="italic">great</hi> man, and equally so of <hi
                        rend="italic">littleness</hi> of mind. Some actions are <hi rend="italic"
                        >great</hi> and <hi rend="italic">elevated,</hi> and others are <hi
                        rend="italic">little</hi> and <hi rend="italic">grovelling.</hi> Sentiments,
                    and even expressions, are characterised in the same manner. An expression or
                    sentiment which raises the mind is denominated <hi rend="italic">great</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">elevated</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the
                    sublime in poetry. In such figurative terms, we lose the distinction between
                    great and elevated in their proper sense; for the resemblance is not so entire
                    as to preserve these terms distinct in their figurative application. And we
                    carry this figure still further. Elevation, in its proper sense, imports
                    superiority of place, and lowness inferiority of place; hence we say a man of
                        <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> talents, of <hi rend="italic">superior</hi>
                    rank, of <hi rend="italic">inferiorparts,</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                        >inferior</hi> taste, and such like. The veneration we have for our
                    ancestors, and for the ancients in general, being similar to the emotion
                    produced by an elevated object of sight, justifies the figurative expression of
                    the ancients being <hi rend="italic">raised</hi> above us, or possessing a <hi
                        rend="italic">superior</hi> place, llιe notes of the gamut, proceeding
                    regularly from the blunter or grosser sounds to the more acute and piercing,
                    produce in the hearer a feeling somewhat similar to that which is produced by
                    mounting upwards; and this gives occasion to the figurative expressions, <hi
                        rend="italic">a high note, a low note.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Such indeed is the resemblance in feeling between real and figurative
                    grandeur, that amongst the nations on the eastern coast of Africa, who are
                    directed purely by nature, the officers of state are, with respect to rank,
                    distinguished by the length of the batoon each carries in his hand; and in
                    Japan, princes and great lords exhibit their rank by the length and size of
                    their sedan poles. Again, it is a rule in painting, that figures of a small size
                    are most proper for grotesque pieces; but that an historical subject generally
                    requires figures as large as the life, or nearly so. The resemblance of these
                    feelings is in reality so strong, that elevation in a figurative sense is
                    observed to have the same effect, even externally, with real elevation.</p>
                <p part="N">The resemblance in feeling between real and figurative grandeur is
                    humorously illustrated by Addison in criticising English tragedy. “The ordinary
                    method of making a hero is to clap a huge plume of feathers upon his head, which
                    rises so high, that there is often a greater length from his chin to the top of
                    his head than to the sole of his foot. One would believe that we thought a great
                    man and a tall man the same thing. As these superfluous ornaments upon the head
                    make a great man, a princess generally receives her grandeur from those
                    additional incumbrances that fall into her tail. I mean the broad sweeping train
                    that follows her in all her motions, and finds constant employment for a boy who
                    stands behind her to open and spread it to advantage.” On the same principle,
                    the Scythians, impressed with the fame of Alexander, were astonished when they
                    found him a little man.</p>
                <p part="N">The gradual progress from small to great is not less remarkable in
                    figurative than in real grandeur or elevation. Every one must have observed the
                    delightful effect of a number of thoughts or sentiments, artfully disposed like
                    an ascending series, and making impressions deeper and deeper as they proceed.
                    Such a disposition of members or clauses in a period is termed a <hi
                        rend="italic">climax.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Within certain limits grandeur and sublimity produce their strongest
                    effects; which, however, lessen by excess as well as by defect. This is
                    remarkable in grandeur and sublimity taken in their proper sense. The grandest
                    emotion which can be excited by a visible object is where the object can be
                    taken in at one view; but if so immense as to be comprehended only in parts, it
                    tends rather to distract than to satisfy the mind.<note anchored="true"

                    elevation is where the object is seen distinctly; a greater elevation lessens in
                    appearance the object, till it vanishes out of sight with its pleasant emotions.
                    The same thing is equally remarkable in figurative grandeur and elevation.
                    Sentiments may be so strained as to become.obscure, or to exceed the capacity of
                    the human mind; but against such license of imagination every good writer will
                    be upon his guard; and it is therefore of importance to observe, that even the
                    true sublime may be carried beyond that pitch which produces the strongest
                    impression. We are undoubtedly susceptible of a greater elevation than can be
                    inspired by human actions the most heroic and magnanimous: this is evident from
                    the feelings produced by Milton’s description of superior beings: yet every man
                    must be sensible of a more constant and agreeable elevation when the history of
                    his own species is the subject. He enjoys an elevation equal to that of the
                    greatest hero, of an Alexander or a Caesar, of a Brutus or an <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193523197?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3197-0710"
                    />Epaminondas; he accompanies these heroes in their most sublime sentiments and
                    hazardous exploits, with a magnanimity equal to theirs; and he finds it no
                    stretch to preserve the same tone of mind for hours together without sinking.
                    The case is not the same in describing the actions or qualities of superior
                    beings. The reader’s imagination cannot keep pace with that of the poet; the
                    mind, unable to support itself in a strained elevation, falls as from a height,
                    and the fall is immoderate like the elevation; or where that effect is not felt,
                    it must be prevented by some obscurity in the conception, which frequently
                    attends the descriptions of unknown objects. A mind unable to raise itself to
                    the full contemplation of the Supreme Being self-existent and eternal, or to
                    support itself in a strained elevation, finds itself more at ease in using the
                    intercession of some saint whose piety and penances whilst on earth are supposed
                    to have rendered him a favourite in heaven; and hence the part assigned to
                    tutelary saints, such as St Francis and St Dominic, amongst the Roman
                    Catholics.</p>
                <p part="N">Objects of sight which are not remarkably great nor elevated scarcely
                    raise any emotion of grandeur or sublimity; and the same things hold respecting
                    other objects; for we often find the mind roused and animated, without being
                    carried to that height. This difference may be discerned in many sorts of music,
                    as well as in some musical instruments. A kettle-drum rouses, and a hautboy is
                    animating; but neither of them inspires an emotion of sublimity. Revenge
                    animates the mind in a considerable degree; but it never produces an emotion
                    which can be termed <hi rend="italic">grand</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >sublime</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and perhaps no disagreeable passion
                    ever has that effect.</p>
                <p part="N">No desire is more universal than that of being exalted and honoured; and
                    upon this account chiefly are we ambitious of power, riches, titles, fame, which
                    would suddenly lose their relish did they not elevate us above others, and
                    command submission and deference; indeed it may be thought that our attachment
                    to things grand and lofty proceeds from their connection with our favourite
                    passion. This connection has undoubtedly its effect; but that the preference
                    given to things grand and lofty must have a deeper root in human nature, will
                    appear from considering that many bestow their time upon low and trifling
                    amusements, without having the least tincture of such a noble passion; yet these
                    very persons talk the same language with the rest of mankind, and prefer the
                    more elevated pleasures; they acknowledge a more refined taste, and are ashamed
                    of their own as low and grovelling. This sentiment, constant and universal, must
                    be the work of nature; and it plainly indicates an original attachment in human
                    nature to every object which tends to elevate the mind. Some men may have a
                    greater relish for an object not of the highest rank; but they are conscious of
                    the preference given by mankind in general to things grand and sublime, and they
                    are sensible that their own peculiar taste ought to yield to the general
                    inclination.</p>
                <p part="N">Whať is said above suggests a rule for attaining the sublime in such
                    works of art as are susceptible of it; and that is, to present those parts or
                    circumstances only which make the greatest figure, keeping out of view every
                    thing low or tnvιal; for the mind, elevated by an important object, cannot,
                    without reluctance, be forced down to bestow any share of its attention upon
                    trifles. Such a judicious selection of capital circumstances is by an eminent
                    critic styled grandeur of manner. In none of the fine arts is there so great
                    scope for that rule as in poetry, which thus enjoys a remarkable power of
                    bestowing upon objects and events an air of grandeur. When we are spectators,
                    every minute object presents itself in its order; but in describing at second
                    hand, these are laid aside, and the capital objects are brought close together.
                    A judicious taste in thus selecting the most interesting incidents, to give them
                    an united force, accounts for a fact which may appear surprising; namely, that
                    we are more moved by spirited narrative at second hand, than by being spectators
                    of the event itself, in til its circumstances.</p>
                <p part="N">There is another rule which chiefly regards the sublime, though it is
                    applicable to every sort of literary performance intended for amusement; namely,
                    to avoid as much as possible abstract and general terms. Such terms, like
                    mathematical signs, are contrived to express our thoughts in a concise manner;
                    but images, which are the life of poetry, cannot be raised in any perfection
                    except by introducing particular objects. General terms, which comprehend a
                    number of individuals, must however be excepted from this rule. Our kindred, our
                    clan, our country, and words of the like import, though they scarcely raise any
                    distinct image, have a wonderful power over the passions; the greatness of the
                    complex object overbalances the obscurity of the image; and the associations, of
                    which it is the mnemonic type, fill the mind with exalted emotions.</p>
                <p part="N">Grandeur being an extremely vivid emotion, is not readily produced in
                    perfection, except by reiterated impressions. The effect of a single impression
                    can be but momentary; and if one feel suddenly something like a swelling or
                    exaltation of mind, the emotion vanishes as soon as felt. Single thoughts or
                    sentiments are often cited as examples of the sublime; but their effect is far
                    inferior to that of a grand subject displayed in its capital parts.</p>
                <p part="N">The straining of an elevated subject beyond due bounds, or beyond the
                    reach of ordinary conception, is not a vice so frequent as to require the
                    correction of criticism. But the false sublime is a rock which writers of more
                    fire than judgmentcommonly split upon. One species of false sublime, known by
                    the name of bombast, is common amongst writers of a mean genius; it is a serious
                    endeavour, by strained description, to exalt a low or familiar subject, which,
                    instead of becoming sublime, fails not to become ridiculous. The mind, indeed,
                    under the influence of some animating passions, is extremely prone to magnify
                    its objects beyond natural bounds; but such hyperbolical description has its
                    limits, and when carried beyond the impulse of the propensity, it degenerates
                    into burlesque. Another species of false sublime, which is still more faulty
                    than bombast, is that of forcing elevation by introducing imaginary beings
                    without preserving any propriety in their actions; as if it were lawful to
                    ascribe every extravagant» and inconsistency to beings of the poet’s creation.
                    In a word, exaggeration of every kind, with a view to produce a great effect, is
                    not only contrary to the principles of good taste, but becomes disgusting or
                    ludicrous, very probably both.</p>
