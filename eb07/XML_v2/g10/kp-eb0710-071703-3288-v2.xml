                    customary tour through France and Italy, he wrote a variety of letters to Mr
                    West and to his parents, which are printed with his poems, and full of interest.
                    Architecture, Gothic as well as Grecian, painting and music, with the manners
                    and customs of the people, were all studied by him with success. But, whilst at
                    Reggio, an unfortunate difference took place between him and Walpole, and they
                    parted in mutual displeasure. A great deal has been said of this quarrel, but
                    the real cause of it has never been sufficiently explained. Walpole, however,
                    affected to take the blame on himself, and in doing so he was very probably
                    right. On his return, Gray finding himself in narrow circumstances, yet with a
                    mind indisposed to active employment, retired to Cambridge, where he devoted
                    himself to study; and soon afterwards his friend West died. The melancholy
                    impressed on him by this event may be traced in his admired Elegy written in a
                    Country Churchyard<pb break="no" facs="nls:193523301?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0710-3301-0718"/>; which is believed to have been begun, if not
                    finished, about this time, though the conclusion, as it stands at present, is
                    certainly different from what it was in the original manuscript copy. The first
                    impulse of hie sorrow for the death of his friend gave birth to a tender sonnet
                    in English, written on the model of Petrarch; and also to a sublime apostrophe
                    in hexameter verse, with which he intended to commence one of his books <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Principiis Cogitandi.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">From the winter of the year 1742 till the day of his death, his
                    principal residence was at Cambridge, whence he seldom was absent for any
                    considerable time, except between the years 1759 and 1762, when, on the opening
                    of the British Museum, he took lodgings in Southampton Row, in order to have
                    access to the Harleian and other manuscripts there deposited, from which he made
                    several curious extracts, amounting in all to a tolerably sized folia
                    volume.</p>
                <p part="N">About the year 1747, Mason, afterwards the editor of his poems, was
                    introduced to Gray. The former had written, a year or two before, some
                    imitations of Milton’s juvenile poems, particularly a Monody on the Death of
                    Pope, and two pieces entitled <hi rend="italic">II</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Bellicoso</hi> and <hi rend="italic">II Pacifico,</hi> on the peace of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle; and the latter had revised them at the request of a friend.
                    This laid the foundation of an intimacy which continued without interruption
                    until the death of Gray.</p>
                <p part="N">About the year 1750, Mr Gray having put the last touches to his Elegy
                    written in a Country Churchyard, communicated it to Walpole, who was too much
                    charmed with it to withhold it from his acquaintance. Accordingly it was shown
                    about for some time in manuscript, and received with all the applause which it
                    so justly merited. At last the publisher of one of the magazines having
                    surreptitiously obtained a copy, Gray wrote to Walpole, desiring that he would
                    put the manuscript into the hands of Mr Dodsley, and order him to print it
                    immediately. This proved the most popular of all our author’s publications. It
                    passed through eleven editions in a very short space of time, and was translated
                    into Latin, first by Ansty and Roberts, and afterwards by Lloyd.</p>
                <p part="N">From July 1759 till the year 1762, Gray resided generally in London,
                    with the view, as we have already mentioned, of having more ready access to the
                    British Museum. In the summer of 1765 he undertook a journey to Scotland for the
                    benefit of his health, which was then in a precarious state, and having passed
                    through Edinburgh and Perth, he proceeded to Glammis Castle, the seat of Lord
                    Strathmore, where he resided for some time; after which he visited the north,
                    where he formed an acquaintance with Dr Beattie, then but little known beyond
                    the immediate circle of his friends at Aberdeen. Gray’s account of this journey
                    is praised by Dr Johnson as curious and elegant; “for,” says the doctor, “as his
                    comprehension was ample, his curiosity extended to all the works of art, all the
                    appearances of nature, and all the monuments of past events.” Part of the
                    summers of 1766 and 1767 he passed in journeys in England; and he had intended
                    to make a second tour in Scotland, but returned to London without accomplishing
                    his design. In July 1768 his grace the Duke of Grafton wrote him a polite
                    letter, informing him that his majesty had been graciously pleased to offer to
                    him the professorship of modem history in the university of Cambridge, then
                    vacant by the accidental death of Mr Brocket. This place was valuable in itself,
                    as the salary amounted to L.400 a year; but what rendered it particularly
                    acceptable to Mr Gray was its being given him without solicitation. He was
                    indeed remarkably disinterested or indifferent about money in all his pursuits.
                    Though his income, before this addition, was but small, he never read oι wrote
                    with a view of rendering his labours useful to himself. He may be said to have
                    been one of the few personages connected with literature, especially the
                    poetical department, who are devoid of selfishness, and at the same time
                    attentive to economy; and he was also amongst mankind in general one of those
                    rare economists, who possess that talent, untinctured with the slightest stain
                    of avarice. When his circumstances were at the lowest, he gave away such sums in
                    private charity as would have done credit to an ampler purse. But what chiefly
                    deterred him from seeking any advantage by his literary pursuits, was a certain
                    degree of pride, which led him to despise the idea of being thought an author by
                    profession.</p>
                <p part="N">It is probable, however, that early in life he had an intention of
                    publishing an edition of Strabo; for his papers contain a great number of notes
                    and geographical disquisitions on that author, particularly respecting that part
                    of Asia which comprehends Persia and India. The indefatigable pains which he had
                    bestowed on the writings of Plato, and the quantity of critical as well as
                    explanatory observations which he left upon almost every part of that ancient
                    philosopher’s works, plainly indicate that no man in Europe was better prepared
                    to republish and illustrate them than Mr Gray. Another work, on which he had
                    bestowed uncommon labour, was the <hi rend="italic">Anthologie.</hi> In an
                    interleaved copy of that collection of Greek epigrams, he has transcribed
                    several additional ones, which he selected in his extensive reading, inserted a
                    great number of critical notes and emendations, and also subjoined a copious
                    index. But whether he intended this performance for the press or not, has not
                    been ascertained. The only work which he meditated with a direct view to
                    publication from the beginning, was a history of English Poetry, upon a plan
                    sketched out by Pope. He has mentioned this himself in an advertisement to the
                    three fine imitations of Norse and Welsh poetry which he gave the world in the
                    last edition of his poems. But after he had made considerable preparations for
                    the execution of this design, and Mason had proffered his assistance, he was
                    informed that Mr Wharton, of Trinity College, Oxford, was engaged in a work of
                    the same kind. The undertaking was therefore relinquished by mutual consent; and
                    s∞n afterwards, upon that gentleman desiring a sight of the plan, Gray readily
                    sent him a copy of it.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst other sciences which he cultivated, Gray had acquired a great
                    knowledge of Gothic architecture. He had seen and accurately studied on the
                    spot, whilst abroad, the Roman proportions, both in ancient times, and in the
                    works of Palladio. In his later years he applied himself to study those
                    stupendous structures of more modem date which adorn our own country, and which,
                    if they have not the same grace, undoubtedly possess at least equal dignity,
                    with those of ancient times. He endeavoured to trace this mode of building from
                    its commencement through the various changes it underwent, until it arrived at
                    its perfection in the reign of Henry VIII. and ended in that of Elizabeth. For
                    this purpose, he did not so much rely upon written accounts, as on that internal
                    evidence which the buildings themselves exhibit of their respective antiquity;
                    since they constantly furnish to the well-informed eye, arms, ornaments, and
                    other marks, by which their several ages may be ascertained. On this account he
                    applied himself to the study of heraldry as a preparatory science; and he has
                    left behind him a number of genealogical papers, more than sufficient to prove
                    him a complete master of that subject. By these means he attained such prompt
                    sagacity in architectural matters, as to be enabled to pronounce, at first
                    sight, the precise time when every particular part of any of our cathedrals was
                    erected. But the favourite study of Gray for the last ten years of his life was
                    natural history, which he then rather resumed than commenced; for, by the
                    instructions of his uncle An-trobus, he was a considerable botanist at the age
                    of fifteen. The marginal notes which he has left on Linnaeus and other writers
                    on the vegetable, animal, and fossil kingdoms, are <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193523314?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3314-0719"/>very
                    numerous; but the most considerable are those on ' Hudson’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Flora Anglica,</hi> and the tenth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Systema
                        Natura·,</hi> which he interleaved and filled almost entirely. Whilst
                    employed on zoology, he read with great care Aristotle’s treatise on that
                    subject, and explained many difficult passages of that obscure ancient, by the
                    lights he had received from modem naturalists. In a word, excepting pure
                    mathematics, and the studies dependent on that science, there was hardly any
                    branch of human learning in which he had not acquired a competent skill, and in
                    most of them a consummate mastery. To this account oi his literary character we
                    may add, that he had a fine taste in painting, prints, gardening, and music; and
                    was moreover a man of good breeding, as well as of virtue and humanity.</p>
                <p part="N">Gray died in 1771; and an edition of his poems, with memoirs of his life
                    and writings, were published by Mr Mason in 1775, 4to. This gentleman, however,
                    instead of employing his own pen in delineating the character of Gray, has
                    adopted one drawn by the Reverend Mr Temple, rector of Mamhead in Devonshire,
                    and communicated in a letter to Mr Boswell. “Perhaps,” says Mr Temple, “he
                    (Gray) was the mosťleamed man in Europe. He was equally acquainted with the
                    elegant and profound parts of science, and that not superficially, but
                    thoroughly. He knew every branch of history, both natural and civil; had read
                    all the original historians of England, France, and Italy; and was a great
                    antiquarian. Criticism, metaphysics, morals, politics, made a principal part of
                    his plan of study; voyages and travels of all sorts were his favourite
                    amusement; and he had a fine taste in painting, prints, architecture, and
                    gardening. With such a fund of knowledge, his conversation must have been
                    equally instructing and entertaining; but he was also a good man, a well-bred
                    man, a man of virtue and humanity. There is no character without some speck,
                    some imperfection; and I think the greatest defect in his was an affectation in
                    delicacy, or rather effeminacy, and a visible fastidiousness, or contempt and
                    disdain of his inferiors in science. He also had, in some degree, that weakness
                    which disgusted Voltaire so much in Mr Congreve: though he seemed to value
                    others chiefly according to the progress they had made in knowledge, yet he
                    could not bear to be considered himself merely as a man of letters; and though
                    without birth, or fortune, or station, his desire was to be looked upon as a
                    private independent gentleman, who read for his amusement. Perhaps it may be
                    said, what signifies so much knowledge, when it produces so little? Is it worth
                    taking so much pains to leave no memorial but a few poems? But let it be
                    considered that Mr Gray was, to others, at least innocently employed; to
                    himself, certainly beneficially. His time passed agreeably; he was every day
                    making some new acquisition in science; his mind was enlarged, his heart
                    softened, and his virtue strengthened; the world and mankind were shown to him
                    without a mask; and he was taught to consider every thing as trifling, and
                    unworthy the attention of a wise man, except the pursuit of knowledge, and the
                    practice of virtue in that state wherein God hath placed us.”</p>
                <p part="N">The more recent, and perhaps also the more valuable editions of the
                    collected works of Gray, are, 1. That by Thomas James Mathias, London, 1814, in
                    4to; and, 2. That by the Rev. John Mitford, London, 1816, in two vols. 4to. The
                    edition of Mathias, besides the poetical works of Gray, contains Memoirs of his
                    Life and Writings, including his correspondence, by Mason, together with
                    extracts, philological, poetical, and critical, from the author’s original
                    manuscripts. In the edition of Mitford the poems are accompanied and illustrated
                    with critical notes, and to them are prefixed a Life of the author, and an Essay
                    on his Poetry.</p>
