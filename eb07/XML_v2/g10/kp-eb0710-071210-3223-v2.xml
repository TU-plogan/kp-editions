                    illustrious Irish orator and statesman, was born at Dublin in the year 1750. His
                    father followed the profession of barrister, and, though not remarkable for

                    corporation of Dublin extended to him its patronage, in consequence of which he
                    was elected as representative of the city in parliament, and made recorder.

                    College, Dublin. Here he also greatly distinguished himself amongst
                    contemporaries who afterwards became the chief ornaments of the senate and the
                    bar. His original intention was to have studied for a fellowship, but the
                    persuasions of his relatives induced him to remove to England, where he entered
                    himself as a student of the Middle Temple. When the requisite number of terms
                    had expired, he returned to his native country, and in the year 1772 was called
                    to the Irish bar. His practice seems to have been small; but that his talents
                    had already begun to make an impression, is proved by the fact, that in 1775 he
                    was brought into the Irish parliament under the auspices of Lord Charlemont.
                    From this period the life of Grattan became a portion, and a very conspicuous
                    one, of the history of his country. He joined the ranks of the opposition, and
                    the accession of strength which it thereby acquired soon became apparent. The
                    effect of his commanding eloquence was not confined to those who listened to it
                    in the house. He infused the patriotic spirit, with which he was himself
                    actuated, into the country at large. It is allowed, indeed, that the volunteer
                    bands who had begun to assemble in various parts of Ireland, acquired new
                    confidence from the bold, uncompromising tone assumed by the young speaker; and
                    in the course of a few years, their ranks swelled to the number of eighty
                    thousand men, armed, disciplined, and prepared for the field. The menacing
                    attitude which Ireland assumed at this critical period, and the boldness with
                    which the members of the Irish opposition, particularly Grattan, contested the
                    supremacy of the sister kingdom, induced the British legislature, in the year
                    1782, to repeal the statute of the 6th of George I. By this law it had been
                    enacted that the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193523236?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0710-3236-0713"/>crown of Ireland should be inseparably annexed
                    to that of Great Britain; that Ireland should be bound by British acts of
                    parliament, if named therein; that the Irish House of Lords should have no
                    appellate jurisdiction; and that the last appeal, in all cases of law and
                    equity, should lie to the British House of Peers. For Grattan's exertions in
                    getting this statute rescinded, his country was profuse in laudatory addresses
                    to him; and the parliament rewarded his services by a grant of L.50,000. A more
                    magnificent donation was intended, but Grattan declined to accept it. That
                    bestowed was large enough to inspire envy and provoke misconstruction. The
                    following sessions of parliament were stormy; and the young patriot had to
                    contend, amongst others, with Mr Flood, an antagonist formidable alike by his
                    acknowledged talents and the unscrupulous virulence of his attacks. The latter
                    maintained that the act of repeal did not involve a renunciation of the British
                    claims, and that therefore they might be resumed and exercised at any time. This
                    sophistry found supporters "in both houses of parliament, and the reputation of
                    Grattan actually began to wane. But the energy and success with which he opposed
                    Mr Ord’s celebrated propositions, brought forward in 1785, fully re-established
                    his fame. One of these was, that the Irish legislature should, from time to
                    time, adopt and re-enact such statutes of the British parliament as related to
                    the regulation of commerce. In opposing this proposal Grattan put forth all his
                    powers, and from this period he began to be acknowledged as the leader of the
                    country party, and as the head of the Irish Whig Club. The members of this
                    association were reciprocally bound not to accept office under any
                    administration which had not for its avowed principle the conceding of certain
                    popular measures. These consisted of a bill to make the great officers of the
                    crown responsible for their proceedings; a bill to prevent revenue officers from
                    voting at elections; and a place and pension bill. Several other important
                    subjects engaged the attention of Grattan at this period; and amongst these was
                    the establishment of a provision for the clergy independently of tithes. He also
                    brought in a bill to encourage the improvement of barren lands, by exempting
                    reclaimed wastes from paying ecclesiastical dues during the space of seven
                    years. But both these measures were rejected by the legislature, principally
                    through the influence of the established church.</p>
                <p part="N">About the same period Grattan strenuously advocated an extension of
                    civil rights to his Roman Catholic countrymen. That a Protestant statesman
                    should exert himself in behalf of those who professed a religious creed
                    different from his own, was, at the time when Catholic emancipation was at
                    length conceded by the British parliament, a matter of such frequent occurrence,
                    that no personal claim to distinction could be raised upon that ground. To
                    entertain such sentiments was not considered as sufficient to subject the person
                    entertaining them to public suspicion as one infected witlι pernicious opinions.
                    But during the early career of Grattan, the subject was viewed in another
                    aspect, and through a different medium. In Ireland, whilst the heads of the
                    Protestant church, with the majority of the Protestants, were arrayed in
                    opposition to any concession to the Catholics, in England the tide of vulgar
                    prejudice ran so strongly in the same direction, that a great civil convulsion
                    had nearly arisen out of it. When these facts and circumstances are taken into
                    consideration, the conduct of Grattan will appear in its true light, as that of
                    a wise statesman, and a fearless patriot. His principal object was to obtain the
                    elective franchise for the Catholics; but the administration of that day
                    indignantly rejected the prayer of their petitions.</p>
                <p part="N">On the arrival of Earl Fitzwilliam, as lord-lieutenant, in 1795, Mr
                    Grattan attached himself to that highly popular nobleman, and under his auspices
                    originated many plans which had for their object to promote the peace and
                    prosperity of his native land. But the recall of his lordship put a stop to all
                    amelioration, and at the same time generated universal discontent, which was
                    increased by the creation of new sinecures and the lavish profusion of titles.
                    The consequences were memorable and instructive. The society of United Irishmen,
                    whose ostensible object was reform, but who really aimed at the independence of
                    Ireland, acquired new courage from these dissensions, and some even proposed to
                    establish a republic in that country. The triumph of the French Revolution had
                    no doubt inspired these daring projectors with hopes of success. A large portion
                    of the people adopted their principles; military associations were formed, and
                    numbers disciplined and armed; whilst an intercourse was opened with France, by
                    which succours and assistance were liberally promised. From the commencement of
                    the rebellion which ensued, Mr Grattan advised measures of conciliation; and
                    when he saw that there was no hope of stemming the general movement, he withdrew
                    from parliament, and retired to his country residence.</p>
                <p part="N">But the grand project of Mr Pitt for effecting a union between Great
                    Britain and Ireland summoned him from his retirement. He obtained a seat in
                    parliament for the express purpose of opposing that measure, which, he
                    maintained, would prove fatal to the best interests of Ireland. Its success did
                    not, however, prevent him from accepting a seat in the imperial parliament, and
                    there employing his talents and eloquence for the benefit of both countries. He
                    was chosen, in 1805, to represent the small borough of Malton; and in the year
                    following he was returned as one of the members for Dublin. Throughout the
                    remainder of his career, his public conduct continued to evince the purest
                    patriotism and the most undeviating consistency, illustrated by an eloquence
                    fraught with the finest inspirations of genius and liberty. Notwithstanding the
                    uniform and vehement opposition of the corporation of the city which he
                    represented, he continued to advocate the Catholic claims with equal zeal and
                    ability. Accordingly, towards the close of his life, we find him complying with
                    an unanimous requisition on the part of the Catholics of Ireland, to present
                    their petition to the British parliament, and to give it his support. Some of
                    his friends represented the fulfilment of this duty as incompatible with his
                    health, which had now begun to decline; but he nobly replied, that “he would be
                    happy to die in the discharge of his duty.” This event did actually take place;
                    for he expired on the 14th of May 1820, soon after his arrival in London; and
                    bis remains were interred in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p part="N">It is comparatively easy for posterity to judge for themselves of the
                    moral and political qualities of a statesman's character, because these can be
                    dispassionately determined from the information afforded by history as to the
                    course of conduct which he had pursued, and the measures which he had supported.
                    If Mr Grattan be thus estimated, he must ever be accounted one of the most
                    ardent, consistent, and patriotic of modern statesmen. Viewing him as an orator,
                    we can only judge of his excellence by the report of contemporaries, who but
                    rarely agree in such matters. We are informed· that he had to contend with an
                    indifferent voice, which was thin, and, considered simply as an organ of sound,
                    unequal to the expression of impassioned feelings. His action, too, was seldom
                    elegant or graceful, but it possessed a far higher character; it was forcible
                    and energetic. Animation and ardour predominated in his manner; and his
                    pronunciation was distinct and articulate. These are the qualities which are
                    calculated most powerfully to impress a mixed assembly; and the effects which he
                    accordingly produced on several occasions were not surpassed by those of any
                    orator of modern times. “With much of national peculiarity, but <pb break="no"

                    too, of individual mannerism, his eloquence is, beyond all doubt, of a very high
                    order. Perhaps, after making every deduction for obvious defects, he may even be
                    accounted an orator of the first class. For he possesses an originality, and a
                    force, rising far above any excellencies of mere composition. Fervid, vehement
                    thoughts, clothed in language singularly pointed and terse; an extraordinary
                    power of invective, so remarkable indeed, that he may be ranked among the
                    greatest masters of the sarcastic style; and, above all, and it is the
                    distinguishing character of his oratory, a copious stream of the most sagacious
                    and original observations, or the most acute and close arguments, flowing,
                    though not continuous and unbroken, yet with an ease the more surprising,
                    because they almost all are in the shape of epigrams ;—these are the high and
                    rare merits which strike the reader of Mr Grattan’s speeches, and must have
                    produced a still deeper impression upon those who heard him in his prime.”—“He
                    had deep, and warm, and generous feelings, and, when roused to enthusiasm, they
                    sometimes found vent in simple language; but his accustomed style of epigram is
                    far more prejudicial to the expression of passion than to the conduct of an
                    argument; and accordingly, his declamation was by no means equal to his
                    reasoning, if we except the vituperative parts of it, which were among the
                    finest of all his performances. He had a lively and playful fancy, which he
                    seldom permitted to break loose; and his habits of labour were such that he
                    abounded in all the information, ancient and recent, which his subject required,
                    and could finish his composition with a degree of care seldom bestowed upon
                    speeches in modern times. Finally, he was a person of undaunted spirit, and
                    always rose with the difficulties of his situation. He was ready, beyond any
                    man, perhaps, wþo ever laboured his speeches so habitually. No one ever took him
                    off his guard. Whoever dreamt that he had caught him unawares, was speedily
                    roused to a bitter sense of his mistake; and it is a remarkable circumstance,
                    that, of all his speeches now preserved, the two most striking in point of
                    execution are those personal attacks upon Mr Flood and Mr Corry, which, from the
                    nature of the occasions that called them forth, must, of necessity, have been
                    the production of the moment. The epigrammatic form in which he delighted to
                    throw all his ideas, and the diction adapted to it, had become so habitual to
                    him, that, upon such emergencies, they obeyed his call with the readiness of a
                    natural style; and he could thus pour forth his indignation in antithesis and
                    point, as easily as the bulk of mankind, when strongly excited, give vent to
                    their feelings in the sort of language which, from this circumstance, we are
                    accustomed to term the eloquence of nature or of passion.</p>
                <p part="N">“In the more glaring defects of what has been called the Irish School of
                    Orators, he certainly did not abound. Extravagance of passion; strained pictures
                    of feeling; exuberance of metaphor, and of forced metaphor; and, worse than all,
                    excess of passion expressed by unnatural and far-fetched imagery, in language
                    quite wide of nature, and often . wholly incorrect ;—from these characteristic
                    vices of his country’s fanciful and ingenious and ready orators, he was exempted
                    beyond all his contemporaries, by the chastening effects of classical
                    discipline. Occasionally, indeed, they do break out in his compositions; but,
                    generally speaking, it is rather in the style than in the ideas that he departs
                    from nature; or if in the ideas, it is in his love of point, rather than in his
                    proneness to metaphor. In one great quality he not only stands single among his
                    countrymen, but may be pronounced eminently superior to our own greatest
                    orators; and it is that in which all modern compositions, those of Dante and
                    perhaps of Milton alone excepted, fall so far short of the ancient, and
                    especially the Greek exemplars; we mean the dignified abstemiousness, which
                    selects one leading and effective idea, suddenly presents it in a few words, and
                    relies upon its producing the impression desired, without saying all that can be
                    said, and, as it were, <hi rend="italic">running down</hi> the topic. In Mr
                    Grattan’s speeches we constantly meet with opinions delivered, or illustrations
                    flung out, in a single sentence, or limb of a sentence, and never again recurred
                    to, although the opinion may have been so sagacious, and the illustration so
                    happy, that a copious modern, or even an ancient of the school of Cicero, would
                    have worked the one into a dissertation, and the other into an allegory. This is
                    a merit of the very highest order, subject to the remarks already made upon the
                    difficulty of making things thus lightly touched at once perceived by an
                    audience, and the aggravation of that difficulty by the obscurity incident to
                    the epigrammatic style.”</p>
