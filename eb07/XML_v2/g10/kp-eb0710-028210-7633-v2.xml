                <p part="N">The Galatae were a portion of that great Celtic race which is found from
                    the earliest times in the valleys of the Danube and of the lofty Alps, and which
                    began to press towards the east during the weakness of the Macedonian empire
                    under the successors of Alexander. A large body of this people under their
                    leader Brennus <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 278), made their appearance in
                    Dardania, a district of Macedon, with the intention of plundering Greece. Here a
                    dispute arose, and a party of twenty thousand men under Leono-rius and Lutarius,
                    separating from the main body, directed their course through Thrace to
                    Byzantium, now Constantinople, and encamping before it, laid this city and all
                    the adjoining country under contribution. Perceiving the beautiful shores of
                    Asia, and being invited by Nicomedes king of Bithynia, who was then at war with
                    his brother Zipaetes, to cross the straits, they willingly acceded to the
                    request. They had no difficulty in deciding the contest in favour of Nicomedes,
                    but, like the Saxons, they refused to evacuate the country when their services
                    were no longer required; and so powerful did they find themselves amongst the
                    effeminate inhabitants of Asia, that they even proceeded to parcel out to the
                    three tribes of which they were composed, the Trocmi, Tolistoboii, and
                    Tectosages, the several parts of Asia Minor. They, however, fixed themselves
                    towards the sources of the Sangarius, and at last became so formidable, that
                    even the kings of Syria consented to comply with their demands. It was Attalus
                    king of Pergamus (about 235 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.),</hi> who first ventured
                    to resist their extortions, and meeting them in the field, gained a complete
                    victory. Not long afterwards Prusias king of Bithynia was also successful in an
                    attack which he made on them. They continued, however, to be the terror of Asia,
                    until the Romans, having defeated Antiochus the Great, king of Syria <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 189), directed their arms against these
                    marauders. A great portion of them were cut to pieces, and the remainder were
                    happy to be allowed to retain quiet possession of their lands.</p>
                <p part="N">Strabo tells us that the whole of Galatia was originally divided into
                    four principalities, at the head of each of which was a tetrarch; but in later
                    times they were reduced to one. It seems that this change was made by the Romans
                    in favour of Deiotarus, who had assisted them in the Mithridatic war. Some time
                    afterwards the whole of Galatia came into the possession of the Romans, who made
                    it a province of their empire. St Jerome states, that in his time they spoke the
                    same language as the Treviri in Gaul. St Paul addressed one of his epistles to
                    the Christians of Galatia. The possessions of the Tolistoboii were to the south,
                    and their chief town was Pessinus; the Tectosages occupied the central parts of
                    the province, having Ancyra for their capital; and the Trocmi were found in the
                    north-eastern portion of the country, towards Pontus and Cappadocia, the chief
                    town of which was Tavium. Their history is chiefly found in Livy, xxxviii.
