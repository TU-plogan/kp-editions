                    of Mirabeau, the rédacteur of the principal works of Jeremy Bentham, and one of
                    the most remarkable men of his time, was born in the month of July 1759 at
                    Geneva, of which his family had been citizens of good repute from the days of
                    Calvin. Shortly after his birth his father died, leaving a widow and five
                    children wholly unprovided for. But the good widow, though placed in such
                    destitute circumstances, and supported by little except the courage inspired by
                    maternal affection, found means to educate her children in a place where
                    necessary knowledge was accessible, and poverty not disgraceful. Induced by an
                    anticipation of future eminence, seldom more happily realized, she accordingly
                    contrived to send Stephen to the College of Geneva, where he justified her
                    determination and the sacrifices necessary to carry it into effect, not only by
                    his ability and proficiency, but by the virtuous purpose to which he turned his
                    earliest attainments; for ere long, he not only defrayed the cost of his own
                    education, but even contributed to the support of the family, by assisting the
                    private studies of his comrades in the capacity of <hi rend="italic"
                        >répétiteur}</hi> an office somewhat resembling that of a private tutor in
                    our academical system, and having for its object to prepare the students for
                    examination in the public class, by “grinding” them on the contents of the
                    preceding lecture. Having completed his academical course, he took clerical
                    orders; and in the year 1781 he was chosen one of the pastors of the city, where
                    his talents as a preacher soon attracted general notice, and gave promise of his
                    becoming one of the most brilliant and persuasive of pulpit orators. But the
                    political troubles which disturbed Geneva in 1782 suddenly turned the course of
                    his life into a different channel.</p>
                <p part="N">Two parties of opposite principles, one being attached to the authority
                    of the magistrates, and the other anxious to extend the privileges of the
                    people, but most widely separated as to the extension or limitation of the right
                    of suffrage, had long divided that republic; and the disputes of these parties
                    gained lustre from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the most way ward, moody, and perverse
                    of all the men of genius who have approached the borders of insanity, which,
                    indeed, he appears more than once to have overpassed. The more liberal party
                    received the name of <hi rend="italic">representans,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >petitioners,</hi> from a representation presented by them against the
                    legality of the proceedings of the magistrates respecting the writings and
                    person of that celebrated but unhappy man; whilst, on the other hand, the
                    magistrates, who refused the prayer of the petition, and their adherents who
                    supported them in this refusal, were thenceforward called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >negatives.</hi> During twenty years a struggle had been maintained between
                    these parties with various success, but without bloodshed, though certainly not
                    without violence. At length, in the autumn of 1782, when the petitioners had
                    gained the ascendency, the courts of Versailles and Turin, in concert with the
                    canton of Berne, surrounded Geneva with an armed force, and, under pretence of
                    some ancient guarantees, imposed anew constitution on the republic, and at the
                    same time compelled the leaders of the representative party to fly from their
                    country.</p>
                <p part="N">Dumont was not included in the proscription. But his heart had been
                    touched with the love of liberty; he could endure chains nowhere patiently, and
                    chains at home, where he was free by birthright, not at all. He therefore became
                    a voluntary exile, and went to join his mother and sisters at St Petersburg, a
                    city to which many Genevese had carried their honourable patrimony of ability
                    and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193326580?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0708-6580-0265"/>knowledge. In this he was probably influenced
                    in part by the example of his townsman Lefort, who was the first tutor,
                    minister, and general of the Czar At St Petersburg he became pastor of the
                    French church, an office he filled for eighteen months, during which time he
                    obtained the consideration due to his great merit and excellent character. But
                    his views were directed towards Great Britain, where most of the Genevese exiles
                    had taken refuge, and where some of them were actually employed in negociating
                    with government for permission to establish a Swiss colony in Ireland. He left
                    St Petersburg in 1785; and soon after his arrival in London went to reside with
                    Lord Shelburne, then a minister of state, who confided to him the education of
                    his sons. Lord Shelburne, afterwards Marquis of Lansdowne, a man distinguished
                    for his cultivation of the society of men of letters, foreign as well as native,
                    soon discovered the great talents of Dumont, who gradually became a friend, or
                    rather member of the family; and it was at the house of this minister that he
                    became acquainted with some of the most illustrious men of the country, amongst
                    whom may be mentioned Fox, Sheridan, Lord Holland, and Sir Samuel Romilly. His
                    coĥnection with these and other distinguished individuals, founded upon
                    friendship, similarity of opinions and literary occupations, and the pursuit of
                    great objects of public utility, gave them full opportunities of appreciating
                    his worth. He was generally known as a man of profound knowledge, correct
                    judgment, irreproachable character, and brilliant wit, and esteemed for the
                    possession of these high and invaluable qualities, which were exemplified
                    throughout the whole course of his life.</p>
                <p part="N">About this time began his close connection with Sir Samuel Romilly, “a
                    man,” says Sir James Mackintosh, “whose whole excellence will be little
                    understood by the world, until they see the narrative traced by himself of those
                    noble labours of self-education, by which he taught himself every sort of
                    ability which is necessary to serve mankind, and still more of that
                    self-discipline by which he at length formed a character yet more exalted than
                    his genius, composed of a probably unparalleled union of tender affection with
                    unbending principle, and producing those dispositions towards the magnanimous
                    and heroic which were hidden from the vulgar by the solemn decorums of a formal
                    profession, and are seldom found to be capable of breathing so long under the
                    undisturbed surface of a well-ordered and prosperous community. The habitual or
                    mechanical part of Romilly’s life was necessarily governed by those of his
                    profession and country. The higher element, however, secretly and constantly
                    blended itself with every thought and feeling; and there were moments when his
                    moral heroism carried the majesty of virtue into the souls of the perplexed and
                    affrighted vulgar.” The friendship which united these two remarkable men
                    increased daily; nor did its ardour or activity cease, until death unexpectedly
                    rent asunder the tie which bound them together, and left Dumont inconsolable for
                    the loss of his departed friend, whom he never mentioned without tears. There
                    was a third in the circle, who is very strikingly described by Sir James
                    Mackintosh.</p>
                <p part="N">“Among the closest friends of Romilly and Dumont was George Wilson, a
                    man little known beyond the circle of his friends and that of his contemporaries
                    in the profession of the law, and one whom it would be difficult to make known
                    to others, without the use of that language of vague panegyric, the abuse of
                    which had more lowered it in his own eyes, than even in those of most men of
                    modesty and taste. It might be said by as unaffectedly conscientious a man as
                    himself, if such another there be, that among those who thoroughly knew him, the
                    degree of esteem for him was always considered as exactly indicative of the
                    degree of sagacity and purity of the man who entertained it. Yet even he was not
                    more upright and benevolent than his two friends; though, having less vivacity
                    than the one and less ardour than the other, he was not so liable to be allured
                    by imagination from the rigid observance of the severe maxims of that moral
                    prudence which is the safeguard of virtue. With a keen relish for pleasantry,
                    and perfectly exempt from all gloom and harshness, he yet shunned the amusement
                    of W’ilkes’s conversation, solely from deference to morality. When Mirabeau
                    visited England about 1786, Wilson did not follow the example of his friends in
                    cultivating the society of that extraordinary man, whose ill-trained fancies
                    were better adapted to sudden felicities than to composition, and whose
                    conversation was animated by an irregular benevolence, neither smothered by the
                    profligacy of his youth, nor altogether extinguished by the intrigues and
                    corruptions of his latter years.”</p>
                <p part="N">In 1788 Dumont undertook a journey to Paris in company with Romilly; and
                    it was under the auspices of the latter that he first became acquainted with
                    Mirabeau. During a sojourn of two months in the French capital, he saw that
                    extraordinary man almost every day; and a certain affinity of talents and
                    pursuits led to an intimate connection between two persons diametrically opposed
                    to each other in habits and in character. It was after his return from Paris
                    that Dumont commenced his acquaintance with Mr Bentham; a circumstance which
                    exercised a powerful influence over his future opinions, and, as it were, fixed
                    his career as a writer on legislation. Filled with admiration for the genius of
                    Bentham, and profoundly impressed with the truth of his theory, and the
                    important consequences to which it immediately led, Dumont applied all his
                    talents to make the writings of the great English jurist generally known, and
                    devoted the greater part of his life in order to render available to the world
                    at large the inexhaustible store of knowledge which the active mind of Bentham
                    was continually increasing. We may mention here, that the following works are
                    the result of that confraternity of genius, talents, and labour, which was thus
                    established, viz. <hi rend="italic">Treatises on Legislation,</hi> published in
                    1822, in 3 vols. 8vo, now (1833) in the third edition; <hi rend="italic">Theory
                        of Punishments and Rewards,</hi> 2 vols. 8vo, also in the third edition; <hi
                        rend="italic">Tactics of Legislative Assemblies,</hi> two editions, 1815 and
                    1822; <hi rend="italic">Judicial Evidence,</hi> published in 1823, second
                    edition 1830; and <hi rend="italic">Judicial Organization and Codification,</hi>
                    1828, 8vo. Of course we make no mention here of the numerous editions published
                    in foreign countries.</p>
                <p part="N">In the summer of 1789, that season of promise and of hope, especially to
                    a Genevese exile, Dumont suspended his labours in England in order to proceed to
                    Paris along with his friend Duroverai, ex-attorney-general of the republic of
                    Geneva. The object of the journey was to obtain through Μ. Necker, who had just
                    returned to office, and by means of the events which were then passing in
                    France, an unrestricted restoration of Genevese liberty, by cancelling the
                    treaty of guarantee between France and Switzerland, which prevented the republic
                    from enacting new laws without the consent of the parties to this treaty. The
                    proceedings and négociations to which this mission gave rise, necessarily
                    brought Dumont into connection with most of the leading men in the Constituent
                    Assembly, and made him an interested spectator, sometimes even a participator,
                    indirectly, in the events of the French revolution. The same cause also led him
                    to renew his acquaintance with Mirabeau, whom he found occupied with his duties
                    as a deputy, and with the composition of his journal, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Courrier</hi><hi rend="italic">de Provence,</hi> in which he was assisted
                    by Duroverai, Claviĕre, and other Genevese patriots. For a time Dumont<pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193326593?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6593-0266"/>
                    took an active and very efficient part in the conduct of this journal, supplying
                    it with reports as well as original articles, and also furnishing Mirabeau with
                    speeches to be delivered or rather read in the assembly. This is now completely
                    established by his highly instructive and interesting posthumous work entitled
                        <hi rend="italic">Recollections of Mirabeau.</hi> In fact, his friend George
                    Wilson used to relate, that one day, when they were dining together at a table
                    ďhôte at Versailles, he saw Dumont engaged in writing the most celebrated
                    paragraph of Mirabeau’s address to the king for the removal of the troops, which
                    was believed to have been written by the orator himself. He also reported such
                    of Mirabeau’s speeches as he did not write, and, with a disinterested sacrifice
                    of his own reputation to the diffusion of what he considered as truth,
                    embellished and strengthened them from his own stores, which were inexhaustible.
                    But this co-operation, so valuable for Mirabeau, arid so self-devoted on the
                    part of Dumont, was destined soon to come to an end; for, being attacked in
                    pamphlets as one of Mirabeau’s writers, he felt hurt at the notoriety thus given
                    to his name in connection with a man occupying Mirabeau’s peculiar position, and
                    resolved to return to England, which he accordingly did in 179L The reputation
                    of being a subaltern writer was, as he himself states, by no means flattering;
                    and the credit of an influential connection with a man whose character was far
                    from being untainted alarmed his delicacy. He saw that he had no alternative but
                    to put an end to a copartnership of which Mirabeau was certain to reap all the
                    advantage, whilst the odium or discredit would alone fall to the lot of
                    Mirabeau’s associate; and he acted upon this conviction with a promptitude and
                    decision worthy of his character.</p>
                <p part="N">In the eventful years which followed he continued to live chiefly at
                    Lansdowne House, or at Bowood, where the most remarkable men of Europe as well
                    as of Britain were frequent and welcome guests. Latterly, he began to form an
                    intimate friendship with Lord Holland, whom he had known from childhood; and lie
                    became a member of the society of familiar friends, the habitual visitors at
                    Holland House, who, during many years, saw a succession of celebrated guests of
                    every country, party, religion, and of every liberal profession or station,
                    which is likely to continue unmatched until another house be found that boasts
                    such a master. “His mind was at that time in a most perfectly mature state, with
                    much experience of very memorable events, and familiar intercourse with the most
                    eminent men,” besides an abundant store of amusing and striking anecdotes. “He
                    had entirely subdued the popular and declamatory propensities which characterize
                    youthful genius, yet without being in the least degree withdrawn from the love
                    of letters and the delights of society by those scientific pursuits which
                    occupied a subsequent period.” In 1801 he travelled over various parts of Europe
                    with Lord Henry Petty, now Marquis of Lansdowne, and brought back a fresher
                    acquaintance with the mental occupations of the continental nations, from whom
                    England had for years been separated by a wider and deeper channel than that
                    formed by the hand of nature. But Dumont had then opened a new course of more
                    serious occupations.</p>
                <p part="N">“In 1801 he published the <hi rend="italic">Traites</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de Legislation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the first fruits
                    of his zealous labours to give order, clearness, and vivacity, to the profound
                    and original meditations of Bentham, hitherto praised only by a very few patient
                    readers, and but little better known, even by name, to the English than to the
                    European public. The extraordinary merit of these writings, manuscript and
                    printed, chiefly .attracted his mind towards them; inferior circumstances,
                    however, contributed their part to the fervour with which lie devoted himself to
                    them. Trained in the hasty and shallow philosophy which then reigned,
                    metaphysical principles were a novelty, in the contemplation of which he was too
                    agreeably employed to examine the solidity of the foundation on which they
                    rested. Wearied with the common-places of philanthropic declamation, which
                    passed for philosophy, he ran with eagerness into the opposite extreme of new
                    terms, dry definitions, and simple principles. The method of Bentham is
                    undoubtedly a powerful instrument for the discovery of truth, especially in the
                    juridical part of moral science. It is, however, a method which may become more
                    than mischievous, by the very circumstance of its apparent perfection.</p>
                <p part="N">“Supposing every other objection to that system to be answered, it will
                    still be evident that the value of its application in every particular instance
                    must be in proportion to the exactness and completeness with which every
                    circumstance is enumerated that can affect the determination of the question.
                    But the enumeration is not <hi rend="italic">complete,</hi> merely because the
                    names of all such circumstances are enumerated. It is not thus that the
                    philosopher proceeds in those sciences where the success is uncontested. He
                    calculates the <hi rend="italic">degree</hi> of every force that acts on a body;
                    he ascertains the <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> of every element which goes
                    to make up a compound; and an error in either of these respects is, in truth and
                    effect, a want of exact and complete enumeration, which may lead to the most
                    false results. Such mistakes in the physical sciences are easily detected. In
                    the moral sciences it is extremely easy <hi rend="italic">to seem</hi> to form a
                    complete theory by such general and vague inductions, because the means of quick
                    and palpable detection are wanting. Wherever analysis is <hi rend="italic"
                        >really</hi> exhaustive, it is the most perfect of instruments; but where it
                    only reaches a semblance of exactness, it produces or perpetuates error in the
                    exact proportion of its seeming approach to truth. There is no remedy against
                    this dangerous distemper but the habit of never forgetting that, in each case,
                    the main question always must be, ‘ How much of each enumerated cause is likely
                    to act in the instance before me ?’ No show of accuracy, no superiority of
                    method, can dispense with this question, or enable any man to answer it
                    otherwise than by approximation. But with these high and arduous matters we must
                    not deal more largely in this place. The talent with which Μ. Dumont performed
                    his task is as generally acknowledged as the perfect disinterestedness which led
                    him to employ so much talent in expounding the opinionsand enlivening the
                    reasoning of others. It is due to him to say, that he always considered the
                    system as a model, to be always consulted and approached, but never imposed
                    without a cautious regard to circumstances. It must also be observed. that
                    however entirely he adopted the speculations, delighted in the method, and even
                    acquiesced in the language of Bentham, that for which he really felt a warm
                    zeal, and consecrated the labour of his life, was the practical establishment of
                    that grand reformation of law, which owes indeed much to the writings of
                    Bentham, and to the discussions which they daily contribute to spread and keep
                    up, but which, so far from being peculiar to him, is zealously supported by
                    those who dissent from his moral theories, and was common to him, at least in
                    that more obvious part of it which relates to criminal law, with the
                    philosophers of the eighteenth century, who pursued the same object, though with
                    less distinctness of view, less precision of language, and less knowledge of the
                    abuses to be reformed. The mind of Dumont moved onward with that of the
                    reformers of jurisprudence throughout Europe. He does not needlessly question
                    the singularities of his venerable master; but his attachment was to the main
                    stock of reforming principle. Those who knew him need not be reminded, that if
                    his principles have any <pb break="no" facs="nls:193326606?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0708-6606-0267"/>tendency to a cold and low morality, they were
                    in that respect altogether defeated by the nature of Dumont; a man of the utmost
                    simplicity and frankness, of a most unusually affectionate and generous
                    disposition. A man of so much letters and wit could not have worked into his
                    practical nature any indifference to art and accomplishment, to real learning,
                    or to the only eloquence which deserves the name.”</p>
                <p part="N">In 1814 the restoration of Geneva to independence induced Dumont to
                    return to his native place, which he loved with that fervour which can only be
                    felt by the citizen of a small republic. He was immediately chosen a member of
                    the supreme council, and by conciliating opponents, moderating partizans, and
                    gaining the confidence and respect of all, he became in time its chief leader
                    and ornament, as he would have been in more conspicuous and powerful assemblies.
                    At the time of his death he had completed a code of law, which, as chairman of a
                    committee appointed for that purpose, it would have been his duty to present to
                    the supreme council on its assembling after its vacation; but at the moment when
                    he was thus about to engrave his name on the annals of his beloved country, and
                    to honour her, by rendering her, as he hoped, an example to Europe, he was cut
                    off in the full vigour of his faculties, and on the cvc of their most
                    conspicuous exertion. In the autumn of 1829 he undertook a tour of pleasure, or
                    rather of relaxation, to the north of Italy, in company with one of his friends,
                    M. Bellamy Aubert; and his family were impatiently expecting his. return when
                    they received the tidings of his death. He died at Milan, in October 1829, in
                    the seventy-first year of his age.</p>
                <p part="N">Dumont was wholly untainted by political or philosophical bigotry, which
                    has corrupted so many of those who inveigh against every form of that vice. His
                    friends at Geneva, at Paris, or in London, were very far from sharing his
                    peculiar opinions. Surrounded by fifty-three nephews or nieces in the first or
                    second degree, the issue or progeny of three sisters, he treated them with a
                    patriarchal tenderness very foreign from the scorn of some Epicureans for “the
                    charities of father, son, and brother.” In his will he leaves legacies to all;
                    touchingly assuring them that they must not measure his kindness by his
                    bequests. In every instance of the youngest child, he seems, with the most
                    affectionate solicitude, to have weighed the needs and desires of each, and to
                    have considered all their little claims as worthy of conscientious
                    consideration. His will, which is dated in May 1826, opens with an
                    acknowledgment worthy of him. “I begin this testamentary disposition by an act
                    of gratitude towards God, for having blessed me with a peaceable and independent
                    life, which has owed its chief happiness to the charm of study and the
                    enjoyments of friendship.” Such was Dumont, a pattern of wisdom and goodness,
                    the like of which it is seldom indeed given us to contemplate, in the ordinary
                    course of this rude and selfish world. <hi rend="italic">(Notice of Μ.

                    seventeenth century. He followed the profession of arms, but not obtaining
                    promotion so rapidly as he expected, he quitted the service, and travelled
                    through different parts of Europe. He stopped in Holland with the intention of
                    there publishing an account of his travels. But in the interval, at the request
                    of his bookseller, he wrote and published several pamphlets, which were eagerly
                    sought after, by reason of the unceremonious manner in which he treated the
                    ministry of France. This freedom having deprived him of all hope of employment
                    in his own coun. try, he now thought of forming a permanent establishment in
                    that where he resided; and the knowledge which he had already acquired of the
                    relations and interests of different nations having led him to entertain the
                    idea of opening a course of lectures on public law, he lost no time in carrying
                    it into effect. The project succeeded far beyond his expectations; and some
                    useful compilations which he published about the same period made him favourably
                    known, in foreign countries. The emperor of Germany appointed him his
                    historiographer, and some time afterwards conferred on him the title of Baron de
                    Carlscroun. He died at Vienna in 1726, at an advanced age. Dumont wrote with
                    facility, but his style is deficient in vigour and correctness; nevertheless,
                    his. works are esteemed as containing a great number of documents valuable for
                    history. The following is a list of the works published by Dumont: 1. <hi
