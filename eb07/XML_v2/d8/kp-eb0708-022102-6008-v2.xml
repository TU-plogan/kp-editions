                    Swedish naturalist of eminent talents, and a distinguished pupil of the great
                    Linnaeus, was born in 1748. His father, a clergyman near Gottenburg, died during
                    the minority, if not the infancy, of his son; in consequence of which the care
                    of the education of the latter devolved on a maternal uncle. This was Dr Lars
                    Montin, a member of the Stockholm Academy, known to the world by several
                    botanical writings, and, amongst others, by an inaugural dissertation on the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Splαclιηum,</hi> published under the presidency of
                    Linnaeus, 28th March 1750; and reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Amoenitates
                        Academicae,</hi> vol. ii. 263. The early education of young Dryander, as far
                    as we can learn, was chiefly in the University of Gottenburg; but he afterwards
                    removed to Lund, where he took his degree of master of arts, or doctor in
                    philosophy, under the presidency of Lidbeck, in 1776; on which occasion he
                    published a dissertation, <hi rend="italic">fungos</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >regno</hi><hi rend="italic">vegetabili vindicans.</hi> He combated the
                    ideas of certain philosophers, who, led by analogy rather than observation and
                    judgment, were disposed to believe that <hi rend="italic">fungi</hi> might, like
                    corals and corallines, be the production of animals. But though Mr Dryander thus
                    asserted the vegetable nature of these bodies, he subsequently imbibed, from his
                    friend and preceptor Linnaeus, an insuperable dislike to their use as food; nor
                    could the most delicate mushrooms of the most luxurious table ever tempt him to
                    overcome this prejudice. We know not at what period he went to study at Upsal,
                    nor how long he remained there. He became for some time domestic tutor to a
                    young Swedish nobleman, after which he visited England, under the patronage of
                    his countryman the well-known Dr Solander, who introduced him to the
                    acquaintance of Sir Joseph Banks; and on the sudden death of Solander in 1782,
                    he succeeded to the place of that eminent man, in the confidence and friendship
                    of his distinguished patron. He was, in like manner, domesticated under the roof
                    of Sir Joseph as his librarian, and continued in that situation as long as he
                    lived. Mr Dryander also held the offices of librarian to the Royal and the
                    Linnaean Societies. He was one of the first founders of the latter in 1788; and
                    took a principal interest in all its concerns, especially in drawing up its laws
                    and regulations, when this society was incorporated by royal charter in 1802.
                    He, moreover, fulfilled the duties of a very active vice-president, till the
                    time of his decease, which happened towards the end of October 1810, in the
                    sixty-third year of his age. His remains were deposited in the vault of St Ann’s
                    Church, Soho, the funeral being attended by a number of his friends, principally
                    members of the Linnaean Society.</p>
                <p part="N">The acknowledged publications of Mr Dryander on the subject of botany
                    consist of the following dissertations: 1. <hi rend="italic">An Account of the
                        Genus Albuca,</hi> in the Stockholm <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> for
                    1784, in Swedish; 2. <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Genus Begonia,</hi>
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Linnaean Society,</hi> vol. i. In
                    this essay twenty-one species are determined, with an indication of nine
                    doubtful ones, though the genus was previously supposed to consist of a solitary
                    species only. 3. <hi rend="italic">On Genera and Species of Plants</hi> which
                    occur twice or three times in Professor Gmelin’s edition of Linnaeus’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae; Trails, of Linn.
                        Soc.</hi> vol. ii. These corrections unfortunately extend no farther than
                    the class <hi rend="italic">Octandria.</hi> Their author intended to have
                    completed them, but other occupations intervened; and the book which was the
                    object of his correction soon fell into absolute neglect, as far as regards
                    botany; insomuch that its errors, however great and numerous, became harmless.
                    4. <hi rend="italic">Lindsea, a new Genus of Ferns</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi><hi rend="italic">Trans, of Linn. Soc.</hi> vol. iii. This genus is
                    distinguished from <hi rend="italic">Pteris,</hi> by the <hi rend="italic"

                        Trqns.</hi> vol. lxxvii. The tree in question, about which great mistakes
                    had arisen, is here shown to be a species of <hi rend="italic">Styrax.</hi> This
                    paper has been republished and translated.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal works published under the superintendence and correction
                    of the subject of this memoir, were, the <hi rend="italic">Hοrtus Kewensis</hi>
                    of Mr Alton, printed in 1789, and about half the second edition of the same
                    work, interrupted by his death; as well as Dr Roxburgh’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Plants of the Coast of Coromandel,</hi> a splendid and highly valuable
                    publication, for which the world is indebted to the munificence of the East
                    India Company. To both these the critical learning and accuracy of Mr Dryander
                    were most usefully applied, especially in the typographical department. It would
                    be vain to seek for an error in the printing of any thing which had passed
                    through his hands. We have only to regret that the same critical correctness was
                    not extended as a principle to every other department of the works in which he
                    took a part. Had this been the case, the erroneous essential character of <hi
                        rend="italic">Oldenlandia,</hi> copied in <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Kewensis</hi> from Linnaeus and Willdcnow, would not have been
                    allowed to contradict the plate and description of Roxburgh, cited underneath.
                    But, above all, various inaccuracies and faults in nomenclature are propagated
                    and confirmed by an authority which Mr Dryander himself never intended to give.
                    He has often assured the writer of this notice, that, had he published in his
                    own name, he would not have adopted such inaccuracies; which is mentioned here
                    to prevent the errors of others being laid to his charge. The popular <hi
                        rend="italic">Species</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum</hi> of Willdenow
                    being the avowed guide, the author of that work must be responsible for matters
                    which it did not come within the scope of the author or editor of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi rend="italic">Kewensis</hi> to correct. Many
                    subjects, however, are most skilfully elucidated in this publication, as well as
                    in the sequel of its second edition by Mr Brown, and these cannot escape the
                    discrimination of an intelligent reader. Practical botany was but a secondary or
                    occasional pursuit of Mr Dryander, and he had a diffidence of his powers, and a
                    consequent distaste for the technical and descriptive parts of the science. The
                    descriptions he had prepared for Mr Bauer’s splendid figures of <hi
                        rend="italic">Ericoe,</hi> published by Mr Alton, were readily and even
                    gladly thrown into the fire, on occasion of a difference of opinion respecting
                    the intended title of the work.</p>
                <p part="N">The study in which this most acute and correct man found ample scope for
                    the exercise of his talents was bibliography. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Catalogus</hi><hi rend="italic">Bïbliothecae Historico-Naturalis Josephi
                        Banks,</hi> is a model for all future writers in this line; but a model
                    rather calculated to check than to excite imitation. A work so ingenious in
                    design, and so perfect in execution, can scarcely be produced in any science; so
                    faultless a specimen of typography we have never elsewhere seen. The frank and
                    unvarnished sincerity of Mr Dryander’s character was secondary only to his
                    universal and fastidious exactness upon every subject that came under his
                    notice. He could not be a silent witness of the slightest injustice,
                    misrepresentation, or. misconception. His impatience of contradiction arose more
                    from the quickness of his penetration into the confusion and inaccuracy of
                    ordinary intellects and characters<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193326021?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6021-0222"/>, than from
                    any natural severity. All clearness, honesty, and precision himself, he had
                    little indulgence for those who fell short of his standard, and these were the
                    greater part of mankind. On being asked what share Dr Smith had in the
                    composition of the <hi rend="italic">Flora Grceca,</hi> he replied, with a
                    vehemence which startled the inquirer, “Every word !” When teazed, as was too
                    often his lot, by the questions of the heedless and superficial, he never
                    neglected the duties of the office he had undertaken, if he coul¢ not always
                    conceal his impatience under their performance. But when the humblest cultivator
                    of real science applied for his assistance, all his stores were laid open; the
                    most condescending liberality graced his conversation; and he was careful that
                    what he communicated should not only be heard but understood. The versatility of
                    his genius and conversation was no less admirable than their exactness. Whether
                    the subject were a question in science, or a point of history; the politics of
                    Europe, or the tittle-tattle of an obscure German court; the literary talents
                    and performances of any distinguished man, or his private transactions; the
                    intrigues for a place at court, a professorship, or a domestic establishment; he
                    was sure to throw some light upon it. Few men are more missed in the circle in
                    which he moved, nor can his place in general society be readily supplied. (x.
