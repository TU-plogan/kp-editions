                    generally in presence of two or more witnesses or umpires.</p>

                <p part="N">The origin of duelling may be traced to that barbarous state of society
                    in which personal courage was followed as the ruling principle, and esteemed as
                    the noblest ornament, of life. Under the influence of such principles, the
                    considerations of justice and humanity were little regarded; and patience under
                    injuries being branded as infamous and cowardly, men were naturally impelled,
                    not only to avenge their own wrongs, but to gratify their private resentments,
                    at the point of the sword.</p>
                <p part="N">Before the dawn of Christianity had thrown its light upon the
                    interesting doctrine of a providence superintending the affairs of men, the
                    belief of an adequate distribution of rewards and punishments in the present
                    life seems to have been generally received. The rich, the prosperous, and the
                    happy, were apt to be considered as the peculiar favourites of Heaven; whilst
                    disease, misfortune, and sudden or violent death, were regarded as the
                    inflictions of divine vengeance on the crimes of the sufferers. Hence, in a
                    superstitious age, arose the practice of making a direct appeal to the deity in
                    the single combat, under the persuasion that the justice of Heaven would
                    infallibly declare for the innocent, and visit the perjured and the guilty with
                    dishonour and death.</p>
                <p part="N">The duel, as a judicial trial, prevailed at an early period amongst the
                    Germans, Danes, and Franks; and by a law instituted in 501, by Gondeband, king
                    of Burgundy, it was allowed in legal proceedings in lieu of swearing.,</p>
                <p part="N">Louis le Débonnaire was the first French monarch who permitted to
                    litigants the trial by arms; and the same mode of trial was introduced into
                    England, with other Norman customs, by William the Conqueror. It was only used,
                    however, in three cases; in the court martial or court of chivalry, in appeals
                    of felony, and in civil cases upon issue joined in a writ of right; in which
                    last it was the only decision, until Henry IL, with consent of parliament,
                    introduced the grand assize. None were exempt from the trial by battle but
                    females, the sick and the maimed, and persons under fifteen or above sixty years
                    of age; ecclesiastics, priests, and monks, being allowed to produce champions in
                    their stead.</p>
                <p part="N">The trial by battle, however, soon degenerated into a convenient pretext
                    for gratifying private revenge under sanction of the law, or on pretence of
                    discovering truth and punishing perjury. Under the feudal system it was of
                    course warmly patronized, being but too congenial with the feelings and habits
                    of the fierce and haughty barons, who, uncontrolled by any principles of law or
                    religion, disdained to submit their differences to any arbitration, or to seek
                    any reparation for an injury but by the sword. Arms were the sport, plunder and
                    revenge the business, of their lives. And to such a height did the evils arising
                    from their private quarrels and petty warfare increase, that it became necessary
                    to adopt some means for controlling and directing the torrent of military
                    violence, which threatened to sweep away every feeling of justice and humanity,
                    and subject the peace and comfort of the community to the unrestrained passions
                    of a fierce and lawless aristocracy. Martial societies were accordingly
                    instituted, whose duty it was to protect the weak and defenceless, to relieve
                    the oppressed, to correct abuses, and to promote the public good.</p>
                <p part="N">Hence arose chivalry and knight-errantry, which, although they modified
                    in some degree the evil of duelling, by imposing a minute and punctilious system
                    of observances, had yet a tendency to perpetuate the practice, by instituting
                    those false and fantastic principles of honour, the evils of which are still
                    felt in the modern duel. With the code of punctilious regulations, the grounds
                    and motives of the duel were changed and extended. Malice and revenge gave place
                    to the gratification of personal vanity, and the desire of that renown for deeds
                    of arms which was considered as the glory of the age. Tilts and tournaments were
                    the pastime of the nobles, and were not only countenanced by the presence of the
                    prince, who not unfrequently shared the dangers of the field, but graced by the
                    attendance of female beauty and distinction, from whose hands the successful
                    champion received the prize of his achievements, and at whose feet he longed to
                    lay the trophies of his victory. jSee <hi rend="smallcaps">Chivalry.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The tournament continued in high estimation, notwithstanding the many
                    valuable lives sacrificed on the most frivolous occasions, until the middle of
                    the sixteenth century, when the death of Henry II. of France, in a tournament
                    given in honour of his sister’s marriage, gave a check to these sanguinary
                    amusements. At this entertainment Henry sent his lance to Count Montgomerie, the
                    captain of his guards, who at first declined the challenge; but on the king
                    repeating his commands, he was compelled to obey. At the encounter, Montgomerie
                    purposely broke his lance against the king’s breastplate; but unhappily for the
                    monarch he wore his helmet open, and a splinter of the lance flying up into his
                    eye, pierced his brain. He survived for about a month in great agony, and died
                    on the 10th July 1559. (Cockburn <hi rend="italic">on Duels.)</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In no country has the duel on private and personal quarrels prevailed to
                    so great an extent as in France. Francis I. encouraged the practice by his
                    well-known determination “that the lie was never to be borne without
                    satisfaction but by a base-born fellow.” By his challenge to the Emperor Charles
                    V. he set an example which his high-minded nobles were but too eager to follow;
                    and under the countenance of their monarch their native propensity to the single
                    combat was indulged to an extent which all the power of his successors was
                    scarcely able to control.</p>
                <p part="N">The power of the church was frequently exerted to restrain these bloody
                    proceedings, especially by a council at Valentia in 855, and lastly by the
                    council of Trent, session XXV. chap. 19, which excommunicated not only the
                    combatants, but their associates, and even the spectators of the battle;
                    declaring the custom to be detestable, introduced by Satan for the destruction
                    both of body and soul. It adds, that “all advisers, supporters, witnesses,
                    orthose in any way concerned, are likewise excommunicated. Princes also who
                    connive at duels are to be deprived of all temporal power, jurisdiction, and
                    dominion over the places where they have permitted duels to be fought.”</p>
                <p part="N">Philip the Fair, at the close of the thirteenth century, forbade all
                    gages or pledges of battle; but this prohibition was afterwards relaxed in
                    several instances, and in 1306 a royal ordonnance was published, prescribing
                    rules, conditions, and ceremonies for the combat.</p>
                <p part="N">In the reign of Henry II. a noted duel was fought in the king’s presence
                    between Guy Chabot de Jarnac and Francis de la Chastaignerie, in which the
                    latter was slain; and on this occasion Henry is said to have taken an oath never
                    to allow another during his reign. An edict was published accordingly; but this,
                    which appears to have been the first royal prohibition of the duel, was
                        productive<pb break="no" facs="nls:193326424?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0708-6424-0253"/> of no good effeets. The prohibition indeed
                    arose rather from the king’s grief for the loss of his friend Chastaignerie than
                    from any desire on public grounds to abolish the custom; and it appears rather
                    to have aggravated the evil, by increasing the number of private duels: for the
                    same punctilious notions of honour from which the duel generally originated, and
                    the same dread of the imputation of cowardice which kept it alive, were still
                    entertained; and as the royal permission, without which the duel had formerly
                    been high treason, could not now be obtained, each man became the judge in his
                    own cause; and in those delicate cases, of whieh the law could take no
                    cognizance, the point of honour was more likely to be stretched than
                    curtailed.</p>
                <p part="N">The parliament of Paris in 1599 declared all persons who had assisted or
                    been present at the prosecution of these unlawful quarrels to be rebels to the
                    king, transgressors of the laws, and disturbers of the public peace.</p>
                <p part="N">Henry IV., during the first eighteen years of whose reign no less than
                    four thousand gentlemen are said to have perished by the duel, alludes in his
                    ediet at Blois, 1602, to the disorders arising from this barbarous eustom; and
                    in 1609 he added to the penalties already imposed, punishment by death,
                    eonfiseation of goods, fines, imprisonment, and degradation from honour, on all
                    who were in any way concerned in these combats, not only principals and seconds,
                    or bearers of challenges, but spectators, and even those who, being accidentally
                    present, did not interfere to prevent bloodshed. The severity of these edicts
                    might have contributed greatly to diminish the evil; but unfortunately they
                    arose rather from the complaints of the people, and the persuasions of the Duke
                    of Sully, than from any desire on the part of Henry himself to abolish a custom
                    for whieh he privately entertained a great partiality, as was evident from the
                    readiness with which he granted pardons to offenders, and even privately
                    encouraged particular duels. He readily gave permission to Crequi to fight Don
                    Philip of Savoy, and even added this encouraging compliment, “If I were not a
                    king I would gladly offer myself to be your second.”</p>
                <p part="N">It was not be expected that laws, however severe, the open violation of
                    whieh was thus eountenaneed by the monarch himself, eould be productive of any
                    benefieial effeets; and we find the passion for the single combat continuing
                    unabated during the reign of the succeeding monareh Louis XIII. To sueh extent
                    indeed did it prevail, that the common inquiry when acquaintances met was not,
                    “what is the news to-day,” but “who fought yesterday;” and Lord Herbert, who was
                    ambassador at the court of Louis, says, that “there is searee a Frenchman worth
                    looking on who has not killed his man in a duel.”</p>
                <p part="N">Two noblemen, however, Montmore∏ei eount de Boutte-ville, the most
                    renowned duellist of the day, and the Marquis de Beuoron, persisting to fight in
                    defianee of the royal interdict, were tried according to law, and both beheaded.
                    This execution caused for a time a cessation of the sanguinary custom; but it
                    was reserved for Louis XIV. to give the first effectual eheck to the eontinuanee
                    of the practice.</p>
                <p part="N">During the minority of this prince a very desperate battle was fought
                    between the Dukes de Beaufort and de Nemours, each attended by four friends. The
                    seconds of the Duke de Nemours were the Marquis de Villars, the Chevalier de la
                    Chaise, D’Uzerehes, and Compan; and the Duke de Beaufort was attended by
                    D’Henricourt, De Ris, Buri, and Brillet. They fought five against five, with
                    swords arid pistols. Nemours was shot by Beaufort, the Marquis de Villars killed
                    D’Henricourt, and D’Uzerehes slew De Ris: the rest were only slightly
                    wounded.</p>
                <p part="N">This, with another desperate encounter fought in 1663, four against
                    four, determined the king on taking some decided step to prevent the recurrence
                    of such disgraceful and bloody quarrels. The famous edict published in 1679,
                    with the solemn agreement entered into by the principal nobility, “that they
                    would never fight a duel on any pretence whatever,” and the firmness of Louis in
                    refusing pardon to all offenders, contributed more to restrain this unhappy
                    propensity than all the efforts of his predecessors.</p>
                <p part="N">The practice of duelling in England, although it never prevailed to sueh
                    an extent as in Franee, may be traced to the same causes which gave rise to it
                    on the Continent. The duel, as we have already mentioned, was early in use
                    amongst the Franks and Normans, and was probably by them introduced into
                    England.</p>
                <p part="N">One of the latest instances of the trial by battle occurred in the reign
                    of Elizabeth in the year 1571, of which Sir Henry Spelman, who was eye-witness,
                    gives an account of the whole proceedings, which were conducted, he says, “non
                    sine magna jurisconsultorum perturbatione.” A proceeding having been instituted
                    in the Court of Common Pleas, for recovery of some manorial rights in the Isle
                    of Hartic, Kent, the defendant offered to maintain his right to possession by
                    the duel. The petitioners accepted the challenge, and as the court does not
                    appear to have had the power of refusal, ehampions wcre appointed, and all the
                    requisite forms adjusted. The queen, to prevent bloodshed, had commanded the
                    parties to compromise; but, anxious at onee to save the credit of the defendant,
                    who demanded the eombat, and to support the authority of the law, whieh enjoined
                    its being fulfilled, the ceremony of the duel was allowed to proceed. On the
                    appointed day the justices of the eommon pleas and the counsellors appeared at
                    Tothil Fields as umpires of the combat; but as the petitioners did not appear to
                    acknowledge their ehampion, they were nonsuited, and victory declared for the
                    defendant. Thus ended the last judicial eombat we read of in a civil case.
                    Another, however, occurred in the court of ehivalry in 1631, and in the county
                    palatine of Durham in 1638; and the trial by battle was claimed so late as 1818,
                    in the ease of Thornton v. Ashford, in an appeal of murder.</p>
                <p part="N">But although the duel was disused in judicial proceedings, the ťantastie
                    notions of honour to which it gave rise still prevailed; and as the law eould
                    take∙no cognizance of points of honour and personal affronts, private duelling
                    rather increased in the reigns of Elizabeth and James 1.</p>
                <p part="N">During the civil wars the minds of men were too much occupied with the
                    agitating events of the time to pay much attention to the settlement of points
                    of etiquette; and as the contest was between the eommonalty and all that was
                    royal and noble in the land, private feuds were forgotten, and those who would
                    have turned their swords against each other in private quarrel, disdained to
                    employ them in such a eause against men of mean birth and ignoble sentiment.</p>
                <p part="N">The custom, however, again gained ground after the restoration of
                    Charles II.; and although he did issue a proclamation to put the existing laws
                    in foree, this object was defeated by his great laxity in pardoning
                    offenders.</p>
                <p part="N">In consequenee of a duel between the Duke of Hamilton and Lord Mohura in
                    1712, whieh was fought with the greatest ferocity and apparent determination of
                    murder, and in which both parties were killed, the subjeet again came under the
                    consideration of government. At the meeting of parliament in the following year,
                    the queen’s speeeh alluded to the subject in this sentence: “thepra-tice of
                    duelling requires some speedy and effectual remedy.” No preeise notiee was taken
                    of this part of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193326437?mode=fullsize"

                    Commons; and a bill which was brought in for the more effectual restraint of the
                    duel was thrown out on a second reading.</p>
                <p part="N">Since the fashion of wearing the sword has been abandoned, private duels
                    have become less frequent in this country, and we have not now to deplore the
                    numerous and often fatal rencontres which, during the last century, were so
                    frequently begun and concluded in the moment and heat of passion, and not seldom
                    on the most frivolous occasions. Such was the duel between Lord Byron and Mr
                    Chaworth in 1765, which originated in a dispute during dinner about the quantity
                    of game on their respective manors. The parties retired to an adjoining room,
                    where they fought by the uncertain light of one small tallow candle, and Mr
                    Chaworth, although the more expert swordsman, was mortally wounded.</p>
                <p part="N">By the laws of this country all the parties concerned in a duel which
                    terminates fatally are guilty of murder, however fairly the combat may have been
                    conducted, and however great the provocation.</p>
                <p part="N">The suddenness of the provocation, and the agitation of excited
                    feelings, which in other cases may be pled in extenuation of the crime, cannot
                    be urged in favour of those who, after ample time for deliberation, meet for the
                    avowed purpose of murder. It is seldom indeed that the extreme penalty is
                    inflicted, except in cases where unfair advantage has been taken, or which are
                    otherwise attended with peculiar aggravation.</p>
                <p part="N">The duel between Major Campbell and Captain Boyd, for which the former
                    was executed in 1808, is well known, and was considered as little better than
                    deliberate assassination. But in the case of Lieutenant Blundell, who was killed
                    in a duel at Carisbrooke Castle, in the Isle of Wight, in 1813, every thing
                    appears to have been conducted with perfect fairness; yet the surviving
                    principal, the seconds, and two others who were considered accessary, were
                    convicted of murder at the Hampshire assizes, and sentenced to death; and
                    although the royal pardon was obtained, they were all dismissed from his
                    majesty’s service.</p>
                <p part="N">Foster expresses the following opinion: “Deliberate duelling, if death
                    cnsueth, is in the eye of the law murder. For duels are generally founded on
                    deep revenge. And though a person should be drawn into a duel, not upon a motive
                    so criminal, but merely upon a punctilio of what swordsmen falsely call honour,
                    that will not excuse. For he that deliberately sheddeth the blood of another,
                    upon a private quarrel, acteth in defiance of all laws, human and divine,
                    whatever his motive may be.” And Judge Blackstone: “When both parties meet
                    avowedly with an intent to murder, thinking it their duty as gentlemen, and
                    claiming it as their right, to wanton with their own lives, and those of their
                    fellow-creatures, without any warrant or authority from any power either divine
                    or human, but in direct contradiction to the laws both of God and man, the law
                    has justly fixed the crime and punishment of murder on them, and on their
                    seconds also."</p>
                <p part="N">In a moral point of view the practice admits of no defence, for the very
                    principle on which the duellist proceeds is one which, if universally adopted,
                    would be subversive of all good order, namely, that an individual may be the
                    judge of his own cause, and the avenger of his own wrongs. The legislature has
                    provided a reparation for all those injuries which the wisdom of legislators has
                    thought it reasonable to redress; and for an individual, or body of individuals,
                    to adopt a law for the regulation of their own conduct, differing in spirit and
                    opposed in principle to the laws of the country, is alike inconsistent with
                    sound moral and political philosophy. Such is the law of honour, as it is
                    called, a law by which no wise or sober-minded man would desire to regulate his
                    life: it prescribes none,of those duties which we owe to God as his creatures,
                    it admits or connives at many direct violations of his laws, and it imposes no
                    restraint on that indulgence of the sensual <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    passions, which is degrading to human nature, injurious to society, and opposed
                    to all that is really good and honourable in the character of man. But
                    unfortunately “the law of honour having annexed the imputation of cowardice to
                    patience under an affront, challenges are given and accepted with no other
                    design than to prevent or wipe off this suspicion, and without any other concern
                    than to preserve the duellist’s own reputation and reception in the world.”</p>
                <p part="N">Every man of experience in the world must be convinced of the truth of
                    this remark. And it is not one of the least evils of this system, that the word
                        <hi rend="italic">honour·,</hi> which, rightly understood, denotes all that
                    is truly noble and virtuous, should be prostituted as a pretext for gratifying
                    the most malignant of human passions, or as a cover for that moral cowardice,
                    the fear of being thought afraid.</p>
                <p part="N">“Duels,” says Sir George Mackenzie, “are but illustrious murders. It is
                    an imperious crime, which triumphs both over public revenge and private virtue,
                    and tramples boldly upon the laws of the nation and the life of our enemy.
                    Courage thinks law here to be but pedantry, and honour persuades men that
                    obedience here is cowardice.” It has been the aim of every moral writer to
                    expose the folly, and of every wise legislature to check the prevalence, of this
                    pernicious practice; yet so powerful is the domineering influence of fashion,
                    that a custom originating in barbarism, and cherished only by pride and
                    selfishness, has for ages stood its ground against all the arguments of reason
                    and religion. Its prevalence is indeed abated in our country, and it is to be
                    hoped there are not many men in the present day who fight for the mere
                    gratification of revenge; but it is to be feared that there are not a few who,
                    condemning the custom in their hearts, are yet compelled to “go as an ox to the
                    slaughter,” and to “die as a fool dĩeth,” under the dread of an imputation of
                    cowardice, which they would not otherwise deserve. Nor is it likely that the
                    duel will ever be entirely abolished by the law as at present administered.
                    Death, which the law of honour views as but an adequate reparation for an
                    offensive word, is thought too severe a punishment for what the laws of God and
                    man both declare to be murder. The penalty, therefore, is seldom inflicted; and
                    where many are acquitted, all will hope to escape.</p>
                <p part="N">“Death,” says Mr Addison, “is not sufficient to deter men who make it
                    their glory to despise it; but if every one who fought a duel were to stand in
                    the pillory, it would quickly diminish the number of these imaginary men of
                    honour, and put an end to so absurd a practice.”</p>
