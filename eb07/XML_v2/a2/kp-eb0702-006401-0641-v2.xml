                        >Ecclesiastical History,</hi> is the name of a sect in the Christian church,
                    established in the empire of Abyssinia. The Abyssinians are a branch of the
                    Copts or Jacobites, with whom they agree in admitting but one nature in Jesus
                    Christ, and rejecting the council of Chalcedon: whence they are called <hi
                        rend="italic">Eutychians</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Monophysites,</hi> and
                    stand opposed to the Melchites. They are only distinguished from the Copts, and
                    other sects of Jacobites, by some peculiar national usages. The Abyssinian sect
                    or church is governed by a bishop or metropolitan styled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Abuna,</hi> sent them by the Coptic patriarch of Alexandria residing at
                    Cairo, who is the only person that ordains priests. The next dighity is that of
                    Komos, or Hegumenos, who is a kind of archpresbyter. They have canons also, and
                    monks: the former of whom marry; the latter, at their admission, vow celibacy,
                    but with a reservation: these, it is said, make a promise aloud, before their
                    superior, to keep chastity; but add in a low voice, <hi rend="italic">as you
                        keep it.</hi> The emperor has a kind of supremacy in ecclesiastical matters.
                    He alone takes cognizance of all ecclesiastical causes, except some smaller ones
                    reserved to the judges; and confers all benefices, except that of Abuna.</p>
                <p part="N">The Abyssinians have at different times expressed an inclination to be
                    reconciled to the see of Rome; but rather out of interests of state than any
                    other motive. The Emperor David, or the queen regent on his behalf, wrote a
                    letter on this head to Pope Clement VII. full of submission, and demanding a
                    patriarch from Rome to be instructed by; which being complied with, he publicly
                    àbjured the doctrine of Ľutychius and Dioscorus in 1626, and allowed the
                    supremacy of the pope. Under the emperor Sultan Seghed all was undone again; the
                    Romish missionaries settled there had their churches taken from them, and their
                    new converts banished or put to death. The congregation <hi rend="italic">de
                        propaganda</hi> have made several attempts to revive the mission, but to
                    little purpose.—The doctrines and ritual of this sect form a strange compound of
                    Judaism, Christianity, and superstition. They practise circumcision, and are
                    said to extend the practice to the females as well as males; th¾y observe both
                    Saturday and Sunday as Sabbaths; they eat no meats prohibited by the law of
                    Moses; women are obliged to the legal purifications; and brothers marry their
                    brothers’ wives, &amp;c. On the other hand, they celebrate the Epiphany with
                    peculiar festivity, in memory of Christ’s baptism; when they plunge and sport in
                    ponds and rivers; which has occasioned some to affirm that they were baptized
                    anew every year. They have four Lents: the great one commences ten days earlier
                    than ours, and is observed with much severity, many abstaining therein even from
                    fish, because St Paul says there is one kind of flesh of men, and another of
                    fishes. They allow of divorce, which is easily granted among them, and by the
                    civil judge; nor do their civil laws prohibit polygamy itself. They have at
                    least as many miracles and legends of saints as the Romish church; which proved
                    no small embarrassment to the Jesuit missionaries, to whom they produced so many
                    miracles, wrought by their saints, in proof of their religion, and those so well
                    circumstantiated and attested, that the Jesuits were obliged to deny miracles to
                    be any evidence of a true religion; and in proof hereof, to allege the same
                    arguments against the Abyssinians which Protestants in Europe allege against
                    Papists. They pray for the dead, and invoke saints and angels; have so great a
                    veneration for the virgin, that they charge the Jesuits with not rendering her
                    honour enough. They venerate images in painting; but abhor all those in relievo,
                    except the cross. They hold that the soul of man is not created; because, say
                    they, God finished all his works on the sixth day. They admit the apocryphal
                    books, and the canons of the apostles, as well as the apostolical constitutions,
                    for genuine. Their liturgy is given by Alvarez, and in English by Pagit; and
                    their calendar by Lüdolph.</p>
