                    painter of considerable eminence, was bom in Scotland, October 24. 1682. He was
                    the son of William Aikman, Esq. of Cairney, and was intended by his father to
                    follow his own profession, which was that of an advocate at the Scotish bar. But
                    the genius of the son led him to other studies. He devoted himself to the fine
                    arts, especially that of painting; and having for some time prosecuted his
                    studies in Britain, in the year 1707 he went to Italy, resided in Rome for three
                    years, afterwards travelled to Constantinople and Smyrna, and in 1712 returned
                    to his own country. About the year 1723 he fixed his residence in London, where
                    he followed the profession of painting, and had the good fortune to be
                    patronised by the duke of Argyle, the earl of Burlington, Sir Godfrey Kneller,
                    and other liberal en-couragers of the arts. He painted many portraits of persons
                    of the first rank in England and Scotland, and a large picture of the royal
                    family for the earl of Burlington, now in the possession of the duke of
                    Devonshire, which was unfinished at his death. Some of his portraits painted in
                    Scotland are in the possession of the duke of Argyle, the duke of Hamilton, and
                    others. Mr Aikman died in London, June 4. 1731. Six months previous to his death
                    he had lost a son at the age of 17. The remains of both were removed to
                    Edinburgh, and were interred in the Greyfriars church-yard on the same day. Mr
                    Somerville, the author of the Chace, Mr Mallet, Mr Allan Ramsay the Scotish
                    poet, and Mr Thomson, were among Mr Aikman’s intimate acquaintance; and the muse
                    of each, in elegiac numbers, offered a warm tribute to the memory of their
                    departed friend. The following epitaph, from the pen of Mr Mallet, was engraved
                    on his tomb:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Dear to the good and wise, disprais’d by none, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Here sleep in peace the father and the son; </l>
                    <l part="N"> By virtue, as by nature, close ally’d, </l>
                    <l part="N"> The painter’s genius, but without the pride; </l>
                    <l part="N"> Worth unambitious, wit afraid to shine, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Honour’s clear light, and friendship’s warmth divine. </l>
                    <l part="N"> The son, fair rising, knew too short a date; </l>
                    <l part="N"> But, oh! how more severe the father’s fate! </l>
                    <l part="N"> He saw him torn untimely from his side, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Felt all a father’s anguish—wept, and died. </l>
                </lg>
                <p part="N">Mr Aikman’s style of painting was an imitation of the pleasing
                    simplicity of nature. It is distinguished by softness of light, mellowness of
                    shade, and mildness and harmony of colouring. His compositions have more placid
                    tranquillity of ease than boldness of touch and brilliancy of effect. His
                    portraits are supposed to have some resemblance to those of Kneller, not only in
                    the imitation of the dresses of the time, but in the similarity of tint and
                    manner of working.</p>
