                    consequence of his improvements in the military art, he formed an association
                    with Francisco Pizarro and Hernando de Luque, for the purpose of discoveries and
                    conquest upon the Peruvian coast. The governor of Panama having sanctioned their
                    enterprise, they devoted their united exertions to that undertaking. Pizarro
                    directed the conquest, and Almaġro was appointed to conduct the supplies of
                    provisions and reinforcements. In the first two unsuccessful attempts, he
                    performed this office with persevering fidelity and uncommon activity. His
                    perseverance was followed with complete success; for they at last discovered the
                    coast of Peru, and landed at Ťumbez, situated about three degrees south of the
                    line, and distinguished by its temple, and a palace of the incas or sovereigns.
                    Pizzaro was sent over to Spain to solicit further powers, after the three
                    adventurers had previously adjusted their future preferments, and agreed that
                    Pizarro should be governor, Almagro lieutenant-governor, and Luque bishop. In
                    this negotiation Pizarro obtained the clerical dignity for Luque; but, chiefly
                    concerned about his own interest, he neglected the preferment of Almagro. On his
                    return, Almagro was so enraged, that he refused to act with such a perfidious
                    companion, and resolved to form a new association. Pizarro for the present
                    artfully endeavoured to avert the indignation of Almagro, and gradually soothed
                    the 'rage and disappoinţmęnt of the soldier. The union was renewed upon the
                    former terms; and it was solemnly stipulated that a common expense and a common
                    advantage should take place.</p>
                <p part="N">'In February 1531, leaving Almagro at Panama to supply provisions and
                    reinforcements, Pizarro set sail for. Peru. He attacked a principal settlement
                    of the natives in the province of Coaque, obtained immense spoil, and made such
                    ample remittances to Almagro as enabled him to complete his reinforcement; and
                    in the close of the year 1532 Almagro arrived at St Michael with a body of <pb

                    men nearly double the number of those whom Pizarro had along with him. The
                    Spaniards about this time took captive the unfortunate Inca Atahualpa; and after
                    they had received an immense sum for his ransom, they barbarously put him to
                    death. Ferdinand Pizarro sailed for Spain with the news of their success, and
                    with remittances to a great amount; and consequently Almagro gained that
                    elevated station he had so long and so eagerly desired. But no sooner did he
                    receive the intelligence of his promotion by the royal grant, than he attempted
                    to seize Cuzco, the imperial residence of the incas, under pretence that it lay
                    within his destined territory. This produced a new quarrel; but peace was
                    restored upon condition that Almagro should attempt the conquest of Chili, and,
                    if he did not find in that province an establishment adequate to his merit, that
                    Pizarro should yield up to him a part of Peru.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1535 he accordingly set out at the head of 570 Europeans, and in
                    crossing the mountains he suffered great hardships and losses by mistaking the
                    route; but at length he descended into the plains of that devoted region. Here
                    he met with a more vigorous resistance from the natives than the Spaniards had
                    ever experienced in other countries. He had, however, made some progress, when
                    he was recalled to Peru by the news of the natives having risen in great
                    numbers, and attacked Lima and Cuzco. He pursued a new route, and marching
                    through the sandy plains on the coast, he suffered by heat and drought
                    calamities not inferior to those which he had endured from cold and famine on
                    the summits of the Andes. Arriving at a favourable moment, he resolved to hold
                    the place both against the Indians and his Spanish rivals. He attacked the
                    Peruvian army with great vigour, and making a great slaughter, he proceeded to
                    the gates of Cuzco without any further interruption. The open, affable, and
                    generous temper of Almagro gained over to his side many of the adherents of the
                    Pizarros, who were disgusted with their harsh and oppressive conduct. With the
                    aid of these he advanced towards the city by night, surprised the sentinels, and
                    surrounded the house where the two brothers Ferdinand and Gonzalo Pizarro
                    resided, who were compelled, after an obstinate defence, to surrender at
                    discretion. A form of government was settled in the name of Almagro, and his
                    jurisdiction over Cuzco was universally acknowledged. This was the origin of a
                    civil war, the beginning of which was very advantageous to Almagro, who by
                    skilful manoeuvres entirely routed a body of Spanish troops advancing to the
                    relief of Cuzco, and made Alvarado, their commander, prisoner. But instead of
                    improving these advantages, he unwisely marched back to Cuzco, and there awaited
                    the arrival of Pizarro, who, convinced of his own feeble resources, proposed an
                    accommodation, and with his usual art protracted the negotiation until he found
                    himself in a condition to meet his antagonist in the field of battle. Meanwhile
                    Alvarado and one of the Pizarros, by bribing their keepers, found means to
                    escape, and persuaded 60 of the men who guarded them to attend them in their
                    flight; and the governor released the other. When Pizarro thought himself
                    sufficiently prepared to settle the dominion of Peru, he marched with an army of
                    500 men to Cuzco. Almagro, previously to this, worn out with age and infirmity,
                    resigned the command to Orgognez. A fierce and bloody battle ensued, in which
                    Almagro’s army was defeated, and the commander wounded. About 140 soldiers fell
                    in the field, and Orgognez, along with several officers of distinction, was
                    massacred in cold blood. During that fatal day, Almagro, placed in a litter,
                    which was stationed on an eminence, beheld from thence the total discomfiture of
                    his troops, and felt all the indignation of a soldier who had seldom expe
                    rienced defeat. He was taken prisoner, remained several months in confinement,
                    and was afterwards tried and condemned to death. In the view of an ignominious
                    death, the courage of the veteran forsook him, and he unsuccessfully supplicated
                    for life in a manner unworthy of his former character. All the arguments he
                    could employ were ineffectual. The Pizarros remained unmoved by all his
                    entreaties. As soon, however, as Almagro saw that his fate was inevitable, he
                    resumed his courage, and exhibited all his usual dignity and fortitude. In the
                    year 1538, and in the 75th year of his age, he was strangled in prison, and
                    afterwards beheaded. He left one son by an Indian woman of Panama; and, in
                    consequence of a power which the emperor had granted him, he declared his son
                    his successor in the government, although he was then a prisoner in Lima.</p>
                <p part="N">With the qualities of intrepid valour, indefatigable activity, and
                    insurmountable constancy, he blended the more amiable dispositions of frankness,
                    generosity, and candour. These qualities rendered him beloved by his followers,
                    and his misfortunes excited their sympathy and pity; so that his death was
                    universally regretted, and particularly by the poor Indians, who deemed him
                    their guardian and protector against the cruel and unfeeling Pizarro. Upon the
                    whole review of his character, it appears just to conclude, that he was,
                    although of inferior abilities, a more amiable man than his rival.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Almagro,</hi> the Younger, by his courage,
                    generosity, and other accomplishments, was placed at the head of tlιe party
                    after the death of his father. The father, conscious of his own inferiority from
                    the total want of education, used every possible means to improve the mind and
                    embellish the manners of his son; so that he soon acquired those accomplishments
                    which rendered him respected by illiterate adventurers, who cheerfully ranged
                    round his standard, and by his dexterity and skill sought deliverance from the
                    oppressions of Pizarro. Juan de Herrada, an officer of great abilities,
                    continued still to direct his councils, and to regulate his enterprises; and,
                    while Pizarro confided in his own security, a conspiracy wa&lt;s formed against
                    him, which terminated in his death. The assassins, exulting in their success,
                    and waving their bloody swords, hastened to the street, proclaimed the death of
                    the tyrant, and compelled the magistrates and principal citizens of Lima to
                    acknowledge Almagro as lawful successor of his father. But his reign was of
                    short duration; for, in 1541, Vaca de Castro, arriving at Quito, produced the
                    royal commission, appointing him governor of Peru, together with all the
                    privileges and authority of Pizarro. The talents and influence of the new
                    governor soon overpowered the interest of Almagro, who, perceiving the rapid
                    decline of his influence, hastened with his troops to Cuzco, where his opponents
                    had erected the royal standard under the command of Pedro Alvarcz Holguin.
                    Herrada, the guide of his counsels, died during his march; and from that time
                    his measures were conspicuous for their violence, concerted with little
                    ingenuity, and executed with little address. At length, on September 16, 1542,
                    the forces of Almagro and Vaca de Castro met, and victory long remained
                    doubtful, till at last it declared for the new governor. Almagro conducted the
                    military operations of that fatal day with a gallant spirit, worthy of a better
                    cause, and deserving of a better fate; and his followers displayed uncommon
                    valour. In proportion to the number of combatants the carnage was very great. Of
                    Ið'ļ men, 500 fell in the field, and many more were woun cd. Almagro escaped,
                    but being betrayed by some of ms own officers, he was publicly beheaded at
                    Cuzco, and in him the name and spirit of the party of Almagro became
                    extinct.</p>
