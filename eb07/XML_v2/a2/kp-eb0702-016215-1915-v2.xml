                    been tribune of a legion before the death of Domitian. He was the person chosen
                    by the army of Lower Moesia to carry the news of Nerva’s death to Trajan,
                    successor to the empire. Trajan, however, conceived some prejudices against him;
                    and Adrian, perceiving that he was no favourite with the emperor, endeavoured to
                    ingratiate himself with the empress Plotina, by which means he succeeded in
                    obtaining for his wife Sabina, the emperor’s grand-niece and next heiress. This
                    was probably the first step to his future advancement, and facilitated his
                    ascent to the throne. As questor he accompanied Trajan in most of his
                    expeditions, and particularly distinguished himself in the second war against
                    the Dacians. Afterwards he was successively tribune of the people, pretor,
                    governor of Pannonia, and consul. After the siege of Atra in Arabia was raised,
                    Trajan, who had already given him the government of Syria, left him the command
                    of the army; and at length, when he found death approaching, it is said he
                    adopted him. Adrian, who was then in Antiochia, as soon as he received the news
                    thereof, and of Trajan’s death, declared himself emperor, on the 11th August, A.

                <p part="N">No sooner had he arrived at the imperial dignity than he made peace with
                    the Persians, to whom he yielded up great part of the conquests of his
                    predecessors; and from generosity or policy he remitted the debts of the Roman
                    people, which, according to the calculation of those who have reduced them to
                    modern money, amounted to 22,500,000 golden crowns; and he burnt all the bonds
                    and obligations relating to those debts, that the people might be under no
                    apprehension of being called to an account for them afterwards. There are medals
                    in commemoration of this fact, in which he is represented holding a flambeau in
                    his hand, to set fire to all those bonds which he had made void. He went to
                    visit all the provinces, and did not return to Rome till the year 118, when the
                    senate decreed him a triumph, and honoured him with the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">Father of his Country</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he
                    refused both, and desired that Trajan’s image might triumph. No prince travelled
                    more than Adrian, there being hardly one province in the empire which he did not
                    visit. In 120 he went into Gaul; from thence he went over to Britain, in order
                    to subdue the Caledonians, who were making continual inroads into the provinces.
                    Upon his arrival they retired towards the north. He advanced, however, as far as
                    York, where he was diverted from his intended conquest by the description there
                    given him of the country <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031928?mode=fullsize"

                    Agricola. In hopes, therefore, of keeping them quiet by enlarging their bounds,
                    he delivered up to the Caledonians all the lands lying between the two friths
                    and the Tyne; and at the same time, to secure the Roman province from their
                    future incursions, built the famous wall which still bears his name.<note

                            though called by the Roman historians <hi rend="italic">murus,</hi>
                            which signifies a wall of stone, was only composed of earth covered with
                            green turf. It was carried on from the Solway Frith, a little west of
                            the village of Burgh on the Sands, in as direct a line as possible, to
                            the river Tyne on the east, at the place where the town of Newcastle now
                            stands; so that it must have been above 60 English, and near 70 Roman
                            miles in length. It consisted of four parts: 1. The principal <hi
                                rend="italic">agger,</hi> mound of earth or rampart, on the brink of
                            the ditch; 2. The ditch on the north side of the rampart; 3. Another
                            rampart on the south side of the principal one, about five paces distant
                            from it; 4. A large rampart on the north side of the ditch. This last
                            was probably the military way to the line of forts on this work: it was
                            so to those formerly built by Agricola; and if it did not serve the same
                            purpose in this, there must have been no military way attending it. The
                            south rampart might serve for an inner defence in case the enemy should
                            beat them from any part of the principal rampart, or it might be
                            designed to protect the soldiers from any sudden attack of the
                            provincial Britons. For many ages this work has been in so ruinous a
                            condition, that it is impossible to discover its original dimensions
                            with certainty. From their appearance, it seems probable that the
                            principal rampart was at least ten or twelve feet high, and the south
                            one not much less; but the north one was considerably lower. From the
                            dimensions of the ditch, taken as it passes through a lime-stone quarry
                            near Harlow Hill, it appears to have been nine feet deep, and eleven
                            wide at the top, but somewhat narrower at the bottom. The north rampart
                            was about twenty feet distant from the ditch.</p></note> Having thus
                    settled matters in Britain, he returned to Rome, where he was honoured with the

                    Hc soon after went into Spain, to Mauritania, and at length into the East, where
                    he quieted the commotions raised by the Parthians. After having visited all the
                    provinces of Asia, he returned to Athens in 125, where he passed the winter, and
                    was initiated in the mysteries of Eleusinian Ceres. He went from thence to
                    Sicily, chiefly to view Mount AEtna, contemplate its phenomena, and enjoy the
                    beautiful and extensive prospect afforded from its top. He . returned to Rome in
                    the beginning of the year 129; and, accordihg to some, he went again the same
                    year to Africa; and, after his return from thence, to the East. He was in Egypt
                    in the year 132, revisited Syria the year following, returned to Athens in 134,
                    and to Rome in 135. The persecution against the Christians was very violent
                    under his reign; but it was at length suspended, in consequence of the
                    remonstrances of Quadratus, bishop of Athens, and Aristides, two Christian
                    philosophers, who presented the emperor with some books in favour of the
                    Christian religion. He conquered the Jews, and by way of insult erected a temple
                    to Jupiter on Calvary, and placed a statue of Adonis in the manger of Bethlehem:
                    he caused also the images of swine to be engraven on the gates of Jerusalem. At
                    last he was seized with a dropsy, which vexed him to such a degree that he
                    became almost raving mad. A great number of physicians were sent for, and to the
                    multitude of them he ascribed his death. He died at Baiae in the 63d year of his
                    age, having reigned 21 years. The Latin verses he addressed to his soul, which
                    he composed a short time before his death, in a strain of tender levity, have
                    been much criticised, and have been the subject of numerous translations and
                    imitations.</p>

                    In his natural disposition he was suspicious, envious, cruel, and lascivious. In
                    his character there was a strange composition of virtues and vices. He was
                    affable, courteous, and liberal; but he was capricious and unsteady in his
                    attachments, and violent in his resentment. Thus he was distrusted by his
                    friends, and dreaded by his enemies. Antoninus his successor obtained his
                    apotheosis, and prevented the rescission of his acts, which the senate once

                    ascended the papal throne <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 772. He was the son of
                    Theodore, a Roman nobleman, and possessed considerable talents for business. He
                    maintained a steady attachment to Charlemagne, which provoked Desiderius, a king
                    of the Lombards, to invade the state of Ravenna, and to threaten Rome itself.
                    Charlemagne rewarded his attachment by marching with a great army to his aid;
                    and having gained many considerable advantages over Desiderius, he visited the
                    pope at Rome, and expressed his piety by the humiliating ceremony of kissing
                    each of the steps as he ascended to the church of St Peter. The affairs of the
                    church now claimed Adrian’s particular attention; for Irene, who in 780 assumed
                    the regency at Constantinople during the minority of her son Constantine,
                    wishing to restore the worship of images, applied to Adrian for his concurrence.
                    The pontiff readily acquiesced in her proposal for calling a council, and
                    commissioned two legates to attend it. The first council, however, was dispersed
                    by an insurrection of the citizens; but at the next meeting, in the city of
                    Nice, in 787, which was protected by a military force, a decree was passed for
                    restoring the worship of images. Adrian approved the decree, but in the western
                    church it was deemed heretical and dangerous. Charlemagne condemned the
                    innovation, and the French and English clergy concurred in opposing it. A
                    treatise, containing 120 heads of refutation, was circulated as the work of
                    Charlemagne, under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Caroline Books,</hi> in
                    opposition to the decree of the council. This work was presented to the pope by
                    the king’s ambassador, and the pope wrote a letter to Charlemagne by way of
                    reply. The king, and also the Gallican and English churches, retained their
                    sentiments; and in 794 a council was held at Frankfort on the Maine, consisting
                    of about 300 western bishops, by which every kind of image-worship was
                    condemned. Adrian did not live to see a termination of this contest; for after a
                    pontificate of nearly twenty-four years, he died in 795. Adrian seems to have
                    directed his chief attention to the embellishment of the churches and the
                    improvement of the city of Rome; and he was probably furnished by Charlemagne,
                    out of the plunder of his conquests, with ample means for this purpose.</p>

                    the dignity, he accepted it in the 76th year of his age, at the united request
                    of the clergy, nobility, and people. The contest for power between the Greek and
                    Latin ehurches had been very violent some years before his accession to the
                    papal ehair. Adrian, during this contest with the eastern patriarch, was
                    extending his authority over the kings and prinees of the West. He employed his
                    whole interest to induee Charles the Bald, who had taken possession of the
                    kingdom of Lorraine, and who had been crowned at Rheims by the archbishop
                    Hincmar, to relinquish it in favour of the emperor; and he even sent legates to
                    the king, after having attempted to engage Hinemar, the clergy, and the
                    nobility, to desert him, ordering him to surrender to the emperor’s right. The
                    king was invincible; and the pope was obliged to give up the contest. He also
                    further interfered in the concerns of princes, by taking Charles’s rebellious
                    son Carloman, and the younger Hinemar, bishop of Laon, under the proteetion of
                    the Roman see. He proceeded in this business so far, that he was under the
                    necessity of submitting without gaining his point. Death terminated his
                    ambitious projects and his life of inquietude A. D. 872, after a pontificate of
                    five years.</p>

                    only Englishman who ever had the honour of sitting in the papal chair. His name
                    was Nicholas Brekespere, and he was born at Langley, near St Albans, in
                    Hertfordshire. His father having left his family and taken the habit of the
                    monastery of St Albans, Nicholas was obliged to submit to the lowest offices in
                    that house for daily support. After some time he desired to take the habit in
                    that monastery, but was rejected by the abbot Riehard. Upon this he resolved to
                    try his fortune in another country, and accordingly went to Paris; where, though
                    in very poor circumstances, he applied himself to his studies with great
                    assiduity, and made a wonderful profieiency. But having still a strong
                    inclination to a religious life, he left Paris and removed to Provence, where he
                    beeame a regular elerk in the monastery of St Rufus. He was not immediately
                    allowed to take the habit, but passed some time by way of trial, recommending
                    himself to the monks by a striet attention to all their commands. This
                    behaviour, together with the beauty of his person and prudent conversation,
                    rendered him so acceptable to the monks, that after some time they entreated him
                    to take the habit of the canonical order. Here he distinguished himself so much
                    by his learning and strict observance of the monastic discipline, that upon the
                    death of the abbot he was ehosen superior of that house; and we are told that he
                    rebuilt the eonvent. Pope Eugenius HI. being apprized of the great merit of
                    Nicholas, and thinking he might be serviceable to the church in a higher
                    station, created him cardinal-bishop of Alba in 1146. In 1148 his holiness sent
                    him legate to Denmark and Norway, where, by his fervent preaching and diligent
                    instructions, he converted those barbarous nations to the Christian faith, and
                    erected Upsal into an archiépiscopal see. When he returned to Rome, he was
                    received by the pope and cardinals with great marks of honour; and Pope
                    Anastasius, who succeeded Eugenius, happening to die at this time, Nicholas was
                    unanimously ehosen to the holy see in November 1154, and he took the name of <hi

                    congratulate him on his election; upon which occasion Adrian granted very
                    considerable privileges to the monastery of St Albans, particularly an exemption
                    from all episcopal jurisdiction, excepting to the see of Rome. Adrian, in the
                    beginning of his pontificate, boldly withstood the attempts of the Roman people
                    to recover their ancient liberty under the consuls, and obliged those
                    magistrates to abdicate their authority, and leave the government of the eity to
                    the pope. In 1155 he drove the heretie Arnaud of Bresse, and his followers, out
                    of Rome. The same year he excommunicated William, king of Sicily, who ravaged
                    the territories of the church, and absolved that prince’s subjects from their
                    allegiance. About the same time Frederick, king of the Romans, having entered
                    Italy with a powerful army, Adrian met him near Sutrium, and concluded a peace
                    with him. At this interview Frederick consented to hold the pope’s stirrup
                    whilst he mounted on horseback. After which his holiness conducted that prince
                    to Rome, and in St Peter’s chureh placed the imperial crown on his head, to the
                    great mortification of the Roman people, who assembled in a tumultuous manner,
                    and killed several of the imperialists. The next year a reconciliation was
                    brought about between the pope and the Sicilian king, that prince taking an oath
                    to do nothing further to the prejudice of the church, and Adrian granting him

                    fυrtified several castles, and left the papal dominions in a more flourishing
                    condition than he found them. But notwithstanding all his success, he was
                    extremely sensible of the disquietudes attending so high a <hi

                    Salisbury, that all the former hardships of his life were mere ∣ amusement to
                    the misfortunes of the popedom, that he J looked upon St Peter’s chair to be the
                    most uneasy seat in the world, and that his erown seemed to be clapped burning
                    on his head. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> He died September 1.1159, in the
                    fourth year and tenth month of his pontificate, and was buried in St Peter’s
                    church, near the tomb of hisprede-, cessor Eugenius. There are extant several
                    letters and some homilies written by Pope Adrian.</p>

                    cardinal-deacon of St Adrian, and in 1254 sent by him to England, to settle the
                    disputes between Henry III. and his barons. He was employed again for the same
                    purpose by Clement III. when he issued a sentence of excommunication against the
                    king’s enemies. When he was congratulated on his accession to the papal ehair,
                    he said, “I wish you had found me a healthy cardinal rather than a dying pope.”
                    After his election he went to Viterbo to meet the emperor Rodolphus, for the
                    purpose of opposing the usurpation of Charles, king of the Two Sicilies; but
                    died soon after his arrival, having enjoyed his dignity only 38 days. He
                    zealously encouraged the crusade to the Holy Land, and upon his election sent a
                    large sum to Constantinople: towards building galleys.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Adrian</hi> VI. <hi rend="italic">Pope,</hi> was
                    born at Utrecht in 1459. His father was not able to maintain him at school, but
                    he got <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> a place at Louvain, in a college in which a

                    reported that he used to read in the night-time by the light of the lamps in the
                    churches or streets. He made a considerable progress in all the sciences, led an
                    exemplary life, and there never was a man less intriguing or less forward than
                    he. He took his degree of doctor of divinity at Louvain, was soon after made
                    eanon of St Peter’s and professor of divinity at Utrecht, and then dean of St
                    Peter’s and vice-chancellor of the university. He was obliged to leave an <hi

                    Charles. This young prince made no great progress under him: however, never was
                    a tutor more considerably rewarded; for it was by Charles V.’s credit that he
                    was raised to the papal throne. Leo X. had given him the cardinal’s hat in <pb

                    />1517. After this pope’s death, several cabals in the conclave ended in the
                    election of Adrian, with which the people of Rome were very much displeased. He
                    would not change his name, and in every thing he showed a great dislike for all
                    ostentation and sensual pleasures, though such an aversion had been long ago out
                    of date. He was very partial to Charles V. and did not enjoy much tranquillity
                    under the triple crown. He lamented much the wicked morals of the clergy, and
                    wished to establish a reformation of manners among them. He died September 14.

                    Chrysogonus, was a native of Cornetto, in Tuscany. Innocent VIII. sent him
                    nuncio into Scotland and into France; and after he had been clerk and treasurer
                    of the apostolic chamber, Pope Alexander VI. whose secretary he had been,
                    honoured him with the cardinal’s hat. His life was a continued scene of odd
                    alterations. He narrowly escaped death on the day on which Alexander VI.
                    poisoned himself by mistake. Afterward he drew upon himself the hatred of Julius
                    II. so that he was obliged to go and hide himself in the mountains of Trent.
                    Having been recalled by Leo X. he was so ungrateful that he engaged in a
                    conspiracy against him. The pope pardoned his føult; but the cardinal, not
                    caring to trust to this, made his escape, and it could never be known exactly
                    what was become of him. He was one of the first who effectually reformed the
                    Latin style. He studied Cicero with great success, and made many excellent
                    observations on the propriety of the Latin tongue. The treatise he composed, <hi

                    published at Rome in 1515, in folio. He also wrote, in elegant Latin, a treatise
                    on the Christian religion, entitled <hi rend="italic">De Vera</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Philosophia,</hi> printed at Cologne in 1548.</p>
