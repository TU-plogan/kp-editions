                    physician, who published in Latin a Treatise upon the Dysentery, in 1764, and a
                    few pieces in the first volume of the Medical Transactions of the College of
                    Physicians, printed in 1768; but far better known, and to be distinguished
                    chiefly hereafter, as a poet. He was born at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, November 9.
                    1721; and after being educated at the grammar-school in Newcastle, was sent to
                    the universities of Edinburgh and Leyden, at which last he took his degree of
                    doctor in physic. He was afterwards admitted by Mandamus to the same degree at
                    Cambridge; elected a fellow of the college of physicians, and one of the
                    physicians at St Thomas's Hospital; and, upon the establishment of the queen’s
                    household, appointed one of the physicians to her Majesty.</p>
                <p part="N">That Dr Akensidc was able to acquire no other kind of celebrity than
                    that of a scholar and a poet, is to be accounted for by the following
                    particulars in his life and conduct, related by Sir John Hawkins. Mr Dyson and
                    he were fellow-students, the one of law and the other of physic, at Leyden,
                    where, being of congenial tempers, a friendship commenced between them that
                    lasted through their lives. They left the university at the same time, and both
                    settled at London. Mr Dyson took to the bar, and being possessed of a handsome
                    fortune, supported his friend while he was endeavouring to make himself known as
                    a physician; but in a short time, having purchased of Mr Hardinge his place of
                    clerk of the house of commons, he quitted Westminster-hall, and, for the purpose
                    of introducing Akenside to acquaintance in an opulent neighbourhood near the
                    town, bought a house at North-End, Hampstead, where they dwelt together during
                    the summer <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034619?mode=fullsize"

                    clubs and assemblies of the inhabitants.</p>
                <p part="N">At these meetings, which, as they were not select, must be supposed to
                    have consisted of such persons as usually meet for the purpose of gossiping, men
                    of wealth, but of ordinary endowments, and able to talk of little else than news
                    and the occurrences of the day, Akcnside was for displaying those talents which
                    had acquired him the reputation he enjoyed in other companies; but here they
                    were of little use to him; on the contrary, they tended to engage him in
                    disputes that betrayed him into a contempt of those who differed in opinion from
                    him. It was found out that he was a man of low birth, and a dependent on Mr
                    Dyson; circumstances that furnished thosewhom heoffend-éd with a ground of
                    reproach, which reduced him to the necessity of asserting in terms that he was a
                    gentleman.</p>
                <p part="N">Little could be done at Hampstead after matters had proceeded to this
                    extremity. Mr Dyson parted with his villa at North-End, and settled his friend
                    in a small house in Bloomsbury-square, assigning for his support such a part of
                    his income as enabled him to keep a chariot. In this new situation Akenside used
                    every endeavour to become popular, but defeated them all by the high opinion he
                    everywhere manifested of himself, and the little condescension he showed to men
                    of inferior endowments; by his love of political controversy, his authoritative
                    censure of the public councils, and his peculiar notions respecting government.
                    In the winter evenings he frequented Tom’s coffee-house in Devereux-court, then
                    the resort of some of the most eminent men for learning and ingenuity of the
                    time, with some of whom he was involved in disputes and altercations, chiefly on
                    subjects of literature and politics, which fixed on his character the stamp of
                    haughtiness and Self-conceit. Hence many, who admired him for his genius and
                    parts, were shy of his acquaintance. «</p>
                <p part="N">The value of that precept which exhorts us to live peaceably with all
                    men, or, in other words, to avoid creating enemies, can only be estimated by the
                    reflection on those many amiable qualities against which the neglect of it will
                    preponderate. Akenside was a man of religion and strict virtue; a philosopher, a
                    scholar, and a fine poet. His conversation was of the most delightful kind;
                    learned, instructive, and, without any affectation of wit, cheerful and
                    entertaining.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Akenside died of a putrid fever, June 23.1770; and is buried in the
                    parish-church of St James’s, Westminster.</p>
                <p part="N">His poems, published soon after his death in 4to and 8vo, consist of the
                    Pleasures of Imagination, two books of Odes, a Hymn to the Naiads, and some
                    Inscriptions. The Pleasures of Imagination, his capital work, was first
                    published in 1744; and a very extraordinary production it was, from a man who
                    had not reached his 23d year. He was afterwards sensible, however, that it
                    wanted revision and correction; and he went on revising and correcting it for
                    several years; but finding this task to grow upon his hands, and despairing of
                    ever executing it to his own satisfaction, he abandoned the purpose of
                    correcting, and resolved to write the poem over anew upon a somewhat different
                    and enlarged plan. He finished two books of his new poem, a few copies of which
                    were printed for the use of the author and certain friends; of the first book in
                    1757, of the second in 1765. He finished also a good part of a third book, and
                    an introduction to a fourth; but his most munificent and excellent friend,
                    conceiving all that is executed of the new work too inconsiderable to supply the
                    place and supersede the republication of the original poem, and yet too valuable
                    to be withheld from the public, has caused them both to be inserted in the
                    collection of his poems.</p>
