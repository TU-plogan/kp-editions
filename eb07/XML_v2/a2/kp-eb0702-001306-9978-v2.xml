                    Abba, which at first was a term of tenderness and affection, became at length a
                    title of dignity and honour. The Jewish doctors affected it; and one of their
                    most ancient books, containing the sayings or apophthegms of divers of them, is
                    entitled Pirke <hi rend="italic">Abboth</hi> or Avoth; «. <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.</hi> Chapters of the Fathers. It was in allusion to this affectation,
                    that Jesus Christ forbade his disciples to call any man their father on earth;
                    which word St Jerome turns against the superiors of the monasteries of his time,
                    for assuming the titles of <hi rend="italic">Abbots,</hi> or Fathers.</p>
                <p part="N">The name <hi rend="italic">Abbot,</hi> then, appears as old as the
                    institution of monks itself. The governors of the primitive monasteries assumed
                    indifferently the titles <hi rend="italic">Abbots</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Archimandrites.</hi> They were really distinguished from the clergy; though
                    frequently confounded with them, because a degree above laymen.</p>
                <p part="N">In those early days, the abbots were subject to the bishops and the
                    ordinary pastors. Their monasteries being remote from cities, built in the
                    farthest solitudes, they <pb break="no" facs="nls:193029991?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0702-9991-0014"/>had no share in ecclesiastical affairs. They
                    went on Sundays to the parish church with the rest of the people; or, if they
                    were too remote, a priest was sent them to administer the sacraments; till at
                    length they were allowed to have priests of their own body. The abbot or
                    archimandrite himself was usually the priest: but his function extended no
                    farther than to the spiritual assistance' of his monastery; and he remained
                    still in obedience to the bishop. There being among the abbots several persons
                    of learning, they made a vigorous opposition to the rising heresies of those
                    times; which first occasioned the bishops to call them out of their deserts, and
                    fix them about the suburbs of cities, and at length in the cities themselves;
                    from which era their degeneracy is to be dated. Then the abbots threw off their
                    former plainness and simplicity, assumed the rank of prelates, aspired at being
                    independent of the bishops, and grasped at so much power, that severe laws were
                    made against them at the council of Chalcedon. Many of them, however, carried
                    the point of independency, obtained the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                        >lord,</hi> and were distinguished by other badges of the episcopate,
                    particularly the mitre.</p>
                <p part="N">Hence arose new distinctions between the abbots. Those were termed <hi
                        rend="italic">mitred</hi> abbots, who were privileged to wear the mitre, and
                    exercise episcopal authority within their respective precincts; being exempted
                    from the jurisdiction of the bishop. Others were called <hi rend="italic"
                        >crosiered</hi> abbots, from their bearing the crosier or pastoral staff.
                    Others were styled <hi rend="italic">ecumenical</hi> or universal abbots, in
                    imitation of the patriarch of Constantinople: while others were termed <hi
                        rend="italic">cardinal</hi> abbots, from their superiority over all other
                    abbots. In Britain, the mitred abbots were lords of parliament, and called
                    abbots-sovereign, and abbots-general, to distinguish them from the other abbots.
                    And as there were lords-abbots, so there were also lords-priors, who had exempt
                    jurisdiction, and were likewise lords of parliament.</p>
                <p part="N">In Roman Catholic countries, the principal distinctions observed between
                    abbots are those of <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >commendatory.</hi> The former take the vow and wear the habit of their
                    order; whereas the latter are seculars who have received tonsure, but are
                    obliged by their bulls to take orders when of proper age.</p>
                <p part="N">Anciently the ceremony of creating an abbot consisted in clothing him
                    with the habit called <hi rend="italic">cuculus,</hi> or cowl; putting the
                    pastoral staff into his hand, and the shoes called <hi rend="italic"
                        >pedales</hi> on his feet: but at present, it is only a simple benediction,
                    improperly called, by some, consecration.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Abbot</hi> is also a title given to others beside
                    the superiors of monasteries: thus bishops whose sees were formerly abbeys, are
                    called abbots. Among the Genoese, the chief magistrate of the republic formerly
                    bore the title of <hi rend="italic">abbot</hi> of the people.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Abbot,</hi><hi rend="italic">George,</hi>
                    archbishop of Canterbury, was born October 29. 1562, at Guildford in Surrey. He
                    was the son of Maurice Abbot, a cloth-worker. He studied at Oxford, and in 1597
                    was chosen principal of University college. In 1599, he was installed dean of
                    Winchester: the year following he was chosen vice-chancellor of the university
                    of Oxford, and a second time in 1603. In 1604, the translation of the Bible now
                    in use was begun by the direction of King James; and Dr Abbot was the second of
                    eight divines of Oxford, to whom the care of translating the whole New Testament
                    (excepting the Epistles) was committed. The year following, he was a third time
                    vice-chancellor. In 1608, he went to Scotland with George Hume earl of Dunbar,
                    to assist in establishing an union between the,churches of Scotland and England;
                    and in this business he conducted himself with so much address and prudence,
                    that it laid the foundation of all his future preferment. King James ever after
                    paid great deference to his advice and counsel; and upon the death of Dr
                    Overton, bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, he named Dr Abbot for his successor,
                    who was accordingly constituted bishop of those two united sees in December
                    1609. About a month afterwards he was translated to the see of London, and on
                    the second of November following was raised to the archiépiscopal see..</p>
                <p part="N">It is not however improbable, that his extravagant adulation of his
                    royal master, in which he went as far as any other court chaplain could do,
                    contributed not a little to his rapid preferment. In the preface to a pamphlet
                    which he published, the following specimen of ridiculous flattery occurs:
                    Speaking of the king, he says, “whose life hath been so immaculate and
                    unspotted, &amp;c. that even malice itself, which leaves nothing unsearched,
                    could never find true blemish in it, nor cast probable aspersion on it.—Zealous
                    as a David; learned and wise, the <hi rend="italic">Solomon</hi> of our age;
                    religious as Josias; careful of spreading Christ’s faith as Constantine the
                    Great; just as Moses; undefiled in all his ways as a Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah;
                    full of clemency as another Theodosius.”—Yet, as we shall immediately see, Abbot
                    could sometimes oppose the will of the sovereign with courage and constancy.</p>
                <p part="N">His great zeal for the Protestant religion made him a strenuous promoter
                    of the match between the Elector Palatine and the Princess Elizabeth; which was
                    accordingly concluded and solemnized the 14th of February 1612, the archbishop
                    performing the ceremony on a stage erected in the royal chapel. In the following
                    year happened the famous case of divorce between the lady Frances Howard,
                    daughter of the earl of Suffolk, and Robert earl of Essex; which has been
                    considered as one of the greatest blemishes of King James’s reign. The part
                    which the archbishop took in the business added much to the reputation he had
                    already acquired for incorruptible integrity. It was referred by the king to a
                    court of delegates, whose opinion the king and court wished and expected to be
                    favourable to the divorce. But the arehbishop, unawed by royal authority, with
                    inflexible firmness resisted it, and published his reasons for persisting in his
                    opinion; to which the king, disappointed iņ his views, thought fit to reply:
                    Sentence was given in the lady’s favour. In 1618, the king published a
                    declaration, which he ordered to be read in all churches, permitting sports and
                    pastimes on the Lord’s day: this gave great uneasiness to the archbishop, who
                    happening to be at Croydon on the day it was ordered to be read, had the courage
                    to forbid it.</p>
                <p part="N">Being now in a declining state of health, the archbishop used in the
                    summer to go to Hampshire for the sake of recreation; and being invited by Lord
                    Zouch to hunt in his park at Bramzill, he met there with the greatest misfortune
                    that ever befell him; for he accidentally killed the game-keeper by an arrow
                    from a cross-bow which he shot at one of the deer. This fatal accident threw him
                    into a deep melancholy; and he ever afterwards kept a monthly fast on Tuesday,
                    the day on which it happened; and he settled an annuity of L.20 on the
                        widow.<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >Fuller’s <hi rend="italic">Church Hist.</hi> cent. xxvii. p.
                        87.</p></note> Advantage was taken of this misfortune, to lessen him in the
                    king’s favour; but, his majesty said, “An angel might have miscarried in this
                    sort.” His enemies alleging that he had incurred an irregularity, and was
                    thereby incapacitated for performing the offices of a primate, the king directed
                    a commission to ten persons to inquire into this matter. The result was not
                    satisfactory to his Grace’s enemies; it being declared, that, as the murder was
                    involuntary, he had not forfeited his archiepiscopal character.</p>
                <p part="N">The archbishop after this seldom assisted at the council, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193030004?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0004-0015"/>being
                    chiefly hindered by his infirmities; but in the king’s last illness he was sent
                    for, and constantly attended till his majesty expired on the 27th of March 1622.
                    He performed the ceremony of the coronation of King Charles I. though very
                    infirm and distressed with the gout. He was never greatly in this king’s favour;
                    and the duke of Buckingham being his declared enemy, watched an opportunity of
                    making him feel the weight of his displeasure. This he at last accomplished,
                    upon the archbishop’s refusing to license a sermon, preached by Dr Sibthorpe to
                    justify a loan which the king had demanded, and pregnant with principles which
                    tended to overthrow the constitution. The archbishop was immediately after
                    suspended from all his functions as primate; and they were exercised by certain
                    bishops commissioned by the king, of whom Laud, the archbishop’s enemy, and
                    afterwards his successor, was one; while the only cause assigned for this
                    procedure was, that the archbishop could not at that time personally attend
                    those services which were otherwise proper for his cognizance and direction. He
                    did not, however, remain long in this situation; for a parliament being
                    absolutely necessary, his Grace was sent for, and restored to his authority and
                    jurisdiction. But not proving friendly to certain rigorous measures adopted by
                    the prevailing church party, headed by Laud, whose power and interest at court
                    were now very considerable, his presence became unwelcome there; so that, upon
                    the birth of the prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II., Laud had the honour to
                    baptize him, as dean of the chapel. The archbishop being worn out with cares and
                    infirmities, died at Croydon, the 5th of August 1633, aged 71 years; and was
                    buried at Guildford, the place of his nativity, where he had endowed an hospital
                    with lands to the amount of L.300 per annum. A stately monument was erected over
                    the grave, with his cffigy in his robes.</p>
                <p part="N">He proved himself, in most circumstances of his life, to be a man of
                    great moderation to all parties; and was desirous that the clergy should gain
                    the respect of the laity by the sanctity and purity of their manners, rather
                    than claim it as due to their function. His opinions and principles, however,
                    have drawn upon him many severe reflections; particularly from the earl of
                    Clarendon. But Dr Welwood has done more justice to his merit and abilities.<note

                    brother to the former, was born at Guildford in 1560, and completed his studies
                    at Baliol college, Oxford. In 1582, he took his degree of master of arts, and
                    soon became a celebrated preacher; and to this talent he chiefly owed his
                    preferment. Upon the first sermon at Worcester, he was chosen lecturer in that
                    city, and soon after rector of All-saints in the same place. In 1597, he took
                    his degree of doctor in divinity: and, in the beginning of King James’s reign,
                    was appointed chaplain in ordinary to his majesty; who had such an opinion of
                    him as a writer, that he ordered the doctor’s book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Antichristo</hi> to be printed, with his own commentary upon
                    part of the Apocalypse. In 1609, he was elected master of Baliol college; which
                    trust he discharged with the utmost care and assiduity, by his frequent lectures
                    to the scholars, by his continual presence at public exercises, and by promoting
                    temperance in the society. In November 1610, hc was made prebendary of Normanton
                    in the church of Southwell; and, in 1612, his majesty appointed him regius
                    professor of divinity at Oxford. The fame of his lectures became very great; and

                    Suarez, so much pleased his majesty, that when the see of Salisbury became
                    vacant, he named him to that bishopric, and he was consecrated by his own
                    brother at Lambeth, December 3. 1615. W <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> hen he
                    came to Salisbury, he found the cathedral falling to decay, through the avarice
                    and negligence of the clergy belonging to it; however, he found means to draw
                    five hundred pounds from the prebendaries, which he applied towards repairing
                    it. Here he devoted himself to the duties of his function with great diligence
                    and assiduity, visiting his whole diocese in person, and preaching every Sunday.
                    But his sedentary life, and close application to study, brought upon him the
                    gravel and stone; of which he died on the 2d of March 1618, in the 58th year of
                    his age; having filled the sec only two years and three months. He wrote, 1. The
