                    took possession of a district of Africa under the pretence of living in
                    retirement, that their minds might not be distracted from the rigid observance
                    of the precepts of the Koran. Hence they assumed the name of Morabites, which
                    was changed by the Spaniards into that of Almo-ravides. Abubeker ben Omar,
                    called by the Spanish authors Abu Texefien, was the first chief of this tribe.
                    Supported by a powerful army of malcontents from the provinces of Numidia and
                    Libya, which was assembled by the influence of the Morabites or Marabouts, he
                    founded the dynasty of the Almoravides in Barbary, in the year 1051. Texefien
                    was succeeded by his son Yusef or Joseph, who, after having reduced to a state
                    of vassalage the kingdoms of Tremecen, Fez, and Tunis, passed over into Spain
                    during the time of the civil wars, vigorously repulsed the Christians, and soon
                    saw the greater part of the kingdoms of Murcia, Granada, Cordova, Leon, and some
                    parts of Valencia, subjected to his power. He then returned into Africa, and
                    left his newly acquired dominions, with a considerable army, under the
                    government of his nephew Mohammed. On his arrival in Africa, with a view to
                    prosecute and extend his conquest in Spain, lie announced, in a public
                    declaration, a general <hi rend="italic">gazie,</hi> or religious war; assembled
                    a numerous army, with which he embarked at Ceuta; and rejoining his nephew in
                    Andalusia, soon laid waste that province with fire and sword.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1107, five years afterwards, he undertook another invasion,
                    penetrated into the kingdom of Portugal, and reduced the city of Lisbon, with a
                    considerable part of the kingdom. At this time he lost the cities of Alguazir
                    and Gibraltar, which he had formerly taken. On his return to Barbary he was
                    defeated at sea. This induced him to propose a truce, which was agreed to only
                    on condition of his submitting to become the tributary of the Spanish king.
                    Indignant at these humiliating terms, Yusef made a vow that he would never
                    desist in his attempts till he had utterly rooted out the Christian religion in
                    Spain. Accordingly he made preparations for a fresh invasion, embarked his army,
                    and landing at Malaga, marched into the enemy’s country. His progress was
                    ,rapid; but his measures were inconsiderately planned and rashly executed. In
                    the famous battle of the Seven Counts he was indeed victorious, but after a
                    terrible slaughter, and the loss of a great part of his army. This disastrous
                    victory obliged him to return to Africa; and he died soon after at his capital
                    of Morocco. Ali, his son, succeeded to the sovereignty in 1110. This prince, who
                    seems to have been of a less warlike disposition than his father, neglecting his
                    Spanish conquests, turned his attention to the arts of peace, and erected many
                    sumptuous buildings, and in particular the great mosque of Morocco. Alphonso,
                    then king of Arragon, retook from him some considerable cities, which obliged
                    him to undertake an expedition to Spain in support of the Moorish princes. But
                    all his attempts proved unfortunate; and in his last enterprise, though
                    powerfully assisted by the Moorish chiefs, with the loss of 30,000 men he was
                    defeated and slain by Alphonso, in the sixth year of his reign.</p>
                <p part="N">He was succeeded by his son Al Abraham, who devoted himself entirely to
                    pleasure. His subjects were harassed and oppressed with heavy taxes, which
                    excited discontent and open rebellion. A revolution was soon effected, and, in
                    the 25th year of his reign, the government was transferred from the tribe of the
                    Almoravides to the Almohedes. See.ALMθHE^DES., <pb break="no"
