                    is a branch of the mathematics, which has for its object whatever can be

                <p part="N">In this respect, and also in its employing arbitrary signs to denote the
                    things of which it treats, it agrees with arithmetic. The analogy between the
                    two sciences induced Sir Isaac Newton to denominate it <hi rend="italic"
                        >Universal Arithmetic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but by the application of
                    algebra to geometry, the science has acquired a new character and new powers,
                    which render this appellation too limited, and not sufficiently descriptive of
                    its nature. In its present state it is nearly alike related to arithmetic and
                    geometry. In its application to both sciences, the reasoning is carried on by
                    general symbols: its true character consists in this, that the results of its
                    operations do not exhibit the individual values of the quantities which are the
                    subject of investigation, such as we obtain in arithmetical calculations or
                    geometrical constructions. They only indicate the operations, whether
                    arithmetical or geometrical, which ought to be performed on the given
                    quantities, to obtain the value of the quantities sought.</p>
                <p part="N">It has been a question much agitated, at what period and in what country
                    was algebra invented? Who were the earliest writers on the subject? What was the
                    progress of its improvement? And lastly, by what means, and at what period, was
                    the science diffused over Europe?</p>
                <p part="N">It was a common opinion in the 17th century, that the ancient Greek
                    mathematicians must have possessed an analysis of the nature of modern algebra,
                    by which they discovered the theorems and solutions of the problems which we so
                    much admire in their writings; but that they carefully concealed their
                    instruments of investigation, and gave only the results, with synthetic
                    demonstrations.</p>
                <p part="N">This opinion is, however, now exploded. A more intimate acquaintance
                    with the writings of the ancient geometers has shown that they had an analysis,
                    but that it was purely geometrical, and essentially different from our
                    algebra.</p>
                <p part="N">Although there be no reason to suppose that the great geometers of
                    antiquity derived any aid in their discoveries from the algebraic analysis, yet
                    we find, that at a considerably later period it was known to a certain extent
                    among the Greeks.</p>
                <p part="N">About the middle of the 4th century of the Christian era, a period when
                    the mathematical sciences were on the decline, and their cultivators, instead of
                    producing orιgι-. nal works of genius, contented themselves with commentaries on
                    the works of their more illustrious predecessors, there was a valuable addition
                    made to the fabric of, ancient learning.</p>

                <p part="N">This was the treatise of Diophantus on arithmetic, which originally
                    consisted of thirteen books, but of which only the first six, and an incomplete
                    book on polygonal numbers, supposed to be the thirteenth, have descended to our
                    times.</p>
                <p part="N">This precious fragment does not exhibit any thing like a complete
                    treatise on algebra. It rather is an application of its doctrines to a peculiar
                    class of arithmetical questions, which belong to what is now called the
                    indeterminate analysis.</p>
                <p part="N">Diophantus may have been the inventor of the Greek algebra, but it is
                    more likely that its principles were not unknown before his time; and that,
                    taking the science in the state he found it as the basis of his labours, he
                    enriched it with new applications. The elegant solutions of Diophantus show that
                    hc possessed great address in the particular branch of whieh he treated, and
                    that he was able to resolve determinate equations of the second degree. Probably
                    this was the greatest extent to which the science had been carried among the
                    Greeks. Indeed, in no country did it pass this limit, until it had been
                    transplanted into Italy on the revival of learning.</p>
                <p part="N">The celebrated Hypatia, the daughter of Theon, composed a commentary on
                    the work of Diophantus. This, however, is now lost, as well as a similar labour
                    of this illustrious and ill-fated lady on the Conics of Apollonius. It is
                    commonly known that she fell a sacrifice to the fury of a fanatical mob about
                    the beginning of the 5th century.</p>
                <p part="N">About the middle of the 16th century, the work of Diophantus, written in
                    the Greek language, was discovered at Rome in the Vatican library, where
                    probably it had been carried from Greece when the Turks possessed themselves of
                    Constantinople. A Latin translation, without the original text, was given to the
                    world by Xylander in 1575; and a more complete translation, by Bachet de
                    Mezeriac (one of the oldest members of the French academy), accompanied by a
                    commentary, appeared in 1621. Bachet was eminently skilful in the indeterminate
                    analysis, and therefore well qualified for the work he had undertaken; but the
                    text of Diophantus was so much injured, that he was frequently obliged to divine
                    the meaning of the author, or supply the deficiency. At a later period, the
                    celebrated French mathematician Fermat, in addition to the commentary of Bachet,
                    added notes of his own on the writings of the Greek algebraist. These are
                    extremely valuable, on account of Fermat’s profound knowledge of this particular
                    branch of analysis. This edition, the best which exists, appeared in 1670.</p>
                <p part="N">Although the revival of the writings of Diophantus was an important
                    event in the history of the mathematics, yet it was not from them that algebra
                    became first known in Europe. This important invention, as well as the numeral
                    characters and decimal arithmetic, was received from the Arabians. That
                    ingenious people fully appreciated the value of the sciences; for at a period
                    when all Europe was enveloped in the darkness of ignorance, they preserved from
                    extinction the lamp of knowledge. They carefully collected the writings of the
                    Greek mathematicians; they translated them into their language, and illustrated
                    them with commentarieş. It was through the medium of the Arabic tongue that the
                    elements of Euclid were first introduced into Europe; and a part of the writings
                    of Apollonius are only known at the present day by a translation from the
                    Arabic, the Greek original bang probably irrecoverably lost. The Arabians
                    ascribe the invention of thcir algebra to one of their mathematicians,
                    Mahommed-Ben-Musa, or Moses, called also Mah°mmed of Buziana, who flourished
                    about the middle of <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> e 9th century, in the reign
                    of the Caliph Almamon.</p>
                <p part="N">It is certain that this person composed a treatise on tins subject,
                    because an Italian translation was known at' onc time to have existed in Europe,
                    although it be now lost. Fortunately, however, a copy of the Arabic ori <hi
                        rend="subscript"> ir</hi> inal is preserved in the Bodleian Library at
                    Oxford, beding a date of transcription corresponding to the year 1342. The
                    title-page identifies its author with the ancient Arabian. A marginal note
                    concurs in this testimony, and farther declares the work to be the first
                    treatise composed on algebra among the faithful; and the preface, besides
                    indicating the author, intimates that he was encouraged by Almamon, commander of
                    the faithful, to compile a compendious treatise of calculation by algebra.</p>
                <p part="N">The circumstance of this treatise professing to be only a compilation,
                    and, moreover, the first Arabian work of the kind, has led to an opinion that it
                    was collected from books in some other language. As the author was intimately
                    acquainted with the astronomy and computations of the Hindoos, he may have
                    derived his knowledge of algebra from the same quarter. Hence we may conclude,
                    with some probability, that the Arabian algebra was originally derived from
                    India.</p>
                <p part="N">The algebraic analysis having been once introduced among the Arabians,
                    it was cultivated by their own writers. One of these, Mahommed Abulwafa, who
                    flourished in the last forty years of the 10th century, composed commentaries on
                    the writers who had preceded him. He also translated the writings of Diophantus.
                    Probably this was the first translation that was made of the Greek alge-. braist
                    into the Arabian tongue.</p>
                <p part="N">It is remarkable, that although the mathematical sciences were received
                    with avidity, and sedulously cultivated during a long period, by the Arabians,
                    yet in their hands they received hardly any improvement. It might have been
                    expected that an acquaintance with the writings of Diophantus would have
                    produced some change in their algebra. This, however, did not happen: their
                    algebra continued nearly in the same state, from their earliest writer on the
                    subject, to one of their latest, Behau-din, who lived between the years 953 and
                    1031.</p>
                <p part="N">Writers on the history of algebra were long under a mistake as to the
                    time and manner of its introduction into Europe. It has now, however, been
                    ascertained that the science was brought into Italy by Leonardo, a merchant of
                    Pisa. This ingenious man resided in his youth in Barbary, and there learned the
                    Indian method of accounting by the nine numeral characters. Commercial affairs
                    led him to travel into Egypt, Syria, Greece, and Sicily, where we may suppose he
                    made himself acquainted with every thing known respecting numbers. The Indian
                    mode of computation appeared to him to be by far the best. He accordingly
                    studied it carefully; and, with this knowledge, and some additions of his own,
                    and also taking some things from Euclid’s Geometry, he composed a treatise on
                    arith-. metic. At that period algebra was regarded only as a part of arithmetic.
                    It was indeed the sublime doctrine of that science; and under this view the two
                    branches were handled in Leonardo’s treatise, which was originally written in
                    1202, and again brought forward under a revised form in 1228. When it is
                    considered that this work was composed two centuries before the invention of
                    printing, and that the subject was not such as generally to interest mankind, we
                    need not wonder that it was but little known; hence it has always remained in
                    manuscript, as-well as some others by the same author. Indeed it was not known
                    to exist from an early period until the middle, of the last century, when it was
                    discovered in the Maglĩa-becchian library at Florence.</p>
                <p part="N"> The extent of Leonardo’s knowledge was pretty much.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035295?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-5295-0422"/>
                <p part="N">the same as that of the preceding Arabian writers. He could resolve
                    equations of the first and second degree, and he was particularly skilful in the
                    Diophantine analysis. He was well acquainted with geometry, and he employed its
                    doctrines in demonstrating his algebraic rules. Like the Arabian writers, his
                    reasoning was expressed in words at length; a mode highly unfavourable to the
                    progress of the art. The use of symbols, and the method of combining them so as
                    to convey to the mind at a single glance a long process of reasoning, was an
                    invention considerably later than Leonardo’s time.</p>
                <p part="N">Considerable attention was given to the cultivation of algebra between
                    the time of Leonardo and the invention of printing. It was publicly taught by
                    professors. Treatises were composed on the subject; and two works of the
                    oriental algebraists were translated from the Arabian language into Italian. One
                    was entitled <hi rend="italic">the Pule of Algebra,</hi> and the other was the
                    oldest of all the Arabian treatises, that of Mahommed-Ben-Musa of Corasan.</p>
                <p part="N">The earliest printed book on algebra was composed by Lucas Paciolus, or
                    Lucas de Burgo, a minorité friar. It was first printed in 1494, and again in
                    1523. The title is <hi rend="italic">Summa de</hi><hi rend="italic">Arithmetica,
                        Geometria, Proportioni,</hi><hi rend="italic">et Propor-tionalita.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">This is a very complete treatise on arithmetic, algebra, and geometry,
                    for the time in which it appeared. The author followed close on the steps of
                    Leonardo; and, indeed, it is from this work that one of his lost treatises has
                    been restored.</p>
                <p part="N">Lucas de Burgo’s work is interesting, inasmuch as it shows the state of
                    algebra in Europe about the year 1500: probably the state of the science was
                    nearly the same in Arabia and Africa, from which it had been received.</p>
                <p part="N">The power of algebra as an instrument of research is in a very great
                    degree derived from its notation, by which all the quantities under
                    consideration are kept constantly in view; but in respect of convenience and
                    brevity of expression, the algebraic analysis in the days of Lucas de Burgo was
                    very imperfect: the only symbols employed were a few abbreviations of the words
                    or names which occurred in the processes of calculation, a kind of short-hand,
                    which formed a very imperfect substitute for that compactness of expression
                    which has been attained by the modern notation.</p>
                <p part="N">The application of algebra was also at this period very limited; it was
                    confined almost entirely to the resolution of certain questions of no great
                    interest about numbers. No idea was then entertained of that extensive
                    application which it has received in modern times.</p>
                <p part="N">The knowledge which the early algebraists had of their science was also
                    circumscribed; it extended only to the resolution of equations of the first and
                    second degree; and they divided the last into cases, each of which was resolved
                    by its own particular rule. The important analytical fact, that the resolution
                    of all the cases of a problem may be comprehended in a single formula, which may
                    be obtained from the solution of one of its cases, merely by a change of the
                    signs, was not then known: indeed it was long before this principle was fully
                    comprehended. Dr Halley expresses surprise, that a formula in optics which he
                    had found, should by a mere change of the signs give the focus of both
                    converging and diverging rays, whether reflected or refracted by convex or
                    concave specula or lenses; and Molyneux speaks of the universality of Halley’s
                    formula as something that resembled magic.</p>
                <p part="N">The rules of algebra may be investigated by its own principles, without
                    any aid from geometry; and although in some cases the two sciences may serve to
                    illustrate the doctrines of each Other, there is now not the least necessity in
                    the more elementary parts to call in the aid ofth <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi>
                    latter to the former. It was otherwise in former times. Lucas de Burgo found it
                    to be convenient, after the <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> χi ample of Leonardo,
                    to employ geometrical constructions to prove the truth of his rules for
                    resolving quadratic equations, the nature of which he did not completely
                    comprehend; and he was induced by the imperfect nature of his notation to
                    express his rules in Latin verses, which will not now be read with the
                    satisfaction we receive from the perusal of the well-known poem, “the Loves of
                    the Triangles.”</p>
                <p part="N">As it was in Italy that algebra became first known in Europe, so it was
                    there that it received its earliest improvements. The science had been nearly
                    stationary from the days of Leonardo to the time of Paciolus, a period of three
                    centuries; but the invention of printing soon excited a spirit of improvement in
                    all the mathematical sciences. Hitherto an imperfect theory of quadratic
                    equations was all the extent to which it had been carried. At last this boundary
                    was passed, and about the year 1505 a particular case of equations of the third
                    degree was resolved by Scipio Ferreus, a professor of mathematics in Bononia.
                    This was an important step, because it showed that the difficulty of resolving
                    equations of the higher orders, at least in the case of the third degree, was
                    not insurmountable, and a new field was opened for discovery. It was then the
                    practice among the cultivators of algebra, when they advanced a step, to conceal
                    it carefully from their contemporaries, and to challenge them to resolve
                    arithmetical questions, so framed as to require for their solution a knowledge
                    of their own new-found rules. In this spirit did Ferreus make a secret of his
                    discovery: he communicated it, however, to a favourite scholar, a Venetian named
                    Florido. About the year 1535 this person, having taken up his residence at
                    Venice, challenged Tartalea of Brescia, a man of great ingenuity, to a trial of
                    skill in the resolution of problems by algebra. Florido framed his questions so
                    as to require for their solution a knowledge of the rule which he had learned
                    from his preceptor Ferreus; but Tartalea had, five years before this time,
                    advanced farther than Ferreus, and was more than a match for Florido. He
                    therefore accepted the challenge, and a day was appointed when each was to
                    propose to the other thirty questions. Before the time came, Tartalea had
                    resumed the study of cubic equations, and had discovered the solution of two
                    cases in addition to two which he knew before. Floriđo’s questions were such as
                    could be resolved by the single rule of Ferreus; while, on the contrary, those
                    of Tartalea could only be resolved by one or other of three rules, which he
                    himself had found, but which could not be resolved by the remaining rule, which
                    was also that known to Florido. The issue of the contest is easily anticipated;
                    Tartalea resolved all his adversary’s questions in two hours, without receiving
                    one answer from him in return.</p>
                <p part="N">The celebrated Cardan was a contemporary of Tartalea. This remarkable
                    person was a professor of mathematics at Milan, and a physician. He had studied
                    algebra with great assiduity, and had nearly finished the printing of a book on
                    arithmetic, algebra, and geometry; but being desirous of enriching his work with
                    the discoveries of Tartalea, which at that period must have been the object of
                    considerable attention among literary men in Italy, he endeavoured to draw from
                    him a disclosure of his rules. Tartalea resisted for a time Cardan’s entreaties.
                    At last, overcome by his importunity, and his offer to swear on the holy
                    Evangelists, and by the honour of a gentleman, never to publish them, and on his
                    promising on the faith of a Christian to <pb break="no"

                    to cypher, so that even after his death they would be unintelligible to any one,
                    lie ventured with much hesitation to reveal to him his practical rules, which
                    were expressed by some very bad Italian verses, themselves in no small degree
                    cnigmatical∙ He reserved, however, the demonstrations. Cardan was not long in
                    discovering the reason of the rules, and he even greatly improved them, so as to
                    make them in a manner his own. From the imperfect essays of Tartalea, he deduced
                    an ingenious and systematic method of resolving all cubic equations whatsoever;
                    but with a remarkable disregard for the principles of honour, and the oath he
                    had taken, he published, in 1545, Tartalea’s discoveries, combined with his own,
                    as a supplement to a treatise on arithmetic and algebra, which he had published
                    six years before. This work is remarkable for being the second printed book on
                    algebra known to have existed.</p>
                <p part="N">In the following year Tartalea also published a work on algebra, which
                    he dedicated to Henry VIII. king of England.</p>
                <p part="N">It is to be regretted that in many instances the authors of important
                    discoveries have been overlooked, while the honours due to them have been
                    transferred to others having only secondary pretensions. The formulae for the
                    resolution of cubic equations are now called Cardan’s rules, notwithstanding the
                    prior claim of Tartalea. It must be confessed, however, that he evinced
                    considerable selfishness in concealing his discovery; and although Cardan cannot
                    be absolved from the charge of bad faith, yet it must be recollected that by his
                    improvements in what Tartalea communicated to him, he made the discovery in some
                    measure his own; and he had moreover the high merit of being the first to
                    publish this important improvement in algebra to the world.</p>
                <p part="N">The next step in the progress of algebra was the discovery of a method
                    of resolving equations of the fourth order. An Italian algebraist had proposed a
                    question which could not be resolved by the newly invented rules, because it
                    produced a biquadratic equation. Some supposed that it could not be at all
                    resolved; but Cardan was of a different opinion: he had a pupil named Lewis
                    Ferrari, a young man of great genius, and an ardent student in the algebraic
                    analysis: to him Cardan committed the solution of this difficult question, and
                    he was not disappointed. Ferrari not only resolved the question, but he also
                    found a general method of resolving equations of the fourth degree, by making
                    them depend on the solution of equations of the third degree.</p>
                <p part="N">This was another great improvement; and although the precise nature of
                    an equation was not then fully understood, nor was it indeed until half a
                    century later, yet, in the general resolution of equations, a point of progress
                    was then reached which the utmost efforts of modern analyses have never been
                    able to pass.</p>
                <p part="N">There was another Italian mathematician of that period Mio contributed
                    somewhat to the improvement of algebra. This was Bombelli∙ He published a
                    valuable work on the subject in 1572, in which he brought into one view what had
                    been done by his predecessors. He explained the nature of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >irreducible case of</hi> cubic equations, which had greatly perplexed
                    Cardan, who could not resolve it by his <hi rend="superscript"> ru e</hi>; he
                    showed that the rule would apply sometimes to particular examples, and that all
                    equations of this case admitted of a real solution; and he made the important
                    remark, that the algebraic problem to be resolved in this <hi rend="superscript"
                        > c</hi> ase corresponds to the ancient problem of the trisection ot an
                    angle.</p>
                <p part="N">’ T⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> re were two</hi> German mathematicians
                    contemporary <hi rend="superscript"> wιth</hi> Cardan and Tartalea, viz.
                    Stifelius and Scheubelius. Their writings appeared about the middle of the 16th
                    century, before they knew what had been done by the Italians. Their improvements
                    were chiefly in the notation. Stifelius, in particular, introduced for the first
                    time the characters which indicate addition and subtraction, and the symbol for
                    the square root.</p>
                <p part="N">The first treatise on algebra in the English language was written by
                    Robert Recorde, teacher of mathematics and practitioner in physic at Cambridge.
                    At this period it was common for physicians to unite with the healing art the
                    studies of mathematics, astrology, alchemy, and chemistry. This custom was
                    derived from the Moors, who were equally celebrated for their skill in medicine
                    and calculation. In Spain, where algebra was early known, the title of physician
                    and algebraist were nearly synonymous. Accordingly, in the romance of Don
                    Quixotte, when the bachelor Samson Carasco was grievously wounded in his
                    rencounter with the knight, an <hi rend="italic">algebrista</hi> was called in
                    to heal his bruises.</p>
                <p part="N">Recorde püblished a treatise on arithmetic, which was dedicated to
                    Edward VI.; and another on algebra, with this title, “The Whetstone of Wit,”.
                    &amp;c. Here, for the first time, the modern sign for equality was
                    introduced.</p>
                <p part="N">By such gradual steps did algebra advance in improvement from its first
                    introduction by Leonardo, each succeeding writer making some change for the
                    better; but with the exception of Tartalea, Cardan, and Ferrari, hardly any one
                    rose to the rank of an inventor. At length came Vieta, to whom this branch of
                    mathematical learning, as well as others, is highly indebted. His improvements
                    in algebra were very considerable; and some of his inventions, although not then
                    fully developed, have yet been the germs of later discoveries. He was the first
                    that employed general characters to represent known as well as unknown
                    quantities. Simple as this step may appear, it has yet led to important
                    consequences. He must also be regarded as the first that applied algebra to the
                    improvement of geometry. The older algebraists had indeed resolved geometrical
                    problems, but each solution was particular; whereas Vieta, by introducing
                    general symbols, produced general formulae, which were applicable to all
                    problems of the same kind, without the trouble of going over the same process of
                    analysis for each.</p>
                <p part="N">This happy application of algebra to geometry has produced great
                    improvements: it led Vieta to the doctrine of angular sections, one of the most
                    important of his discoveries, which is now expanded into the arithmetic or
                    calculus of sines. He also improved the theory of algebraic equations, and he
                    was the first that gave a general method of resolving them by approximation. As
                    he lived between the years 1540 and 1603, his writings belong to the latter
                    period of the 16th century. He printed them at his own expense, and liberally
                    bestowed them on men of science.</p>
                <p part="N">Tlιe Flemish mathematician Albert Girard was one of the improvers of
                    algebra. He extended the theory of equations somewhat farther than Vieta, but he
                    did not completely unfold their composition; he was the first that showed the
                    use of the negative sign in the resolution of geometrical problems, and he also
                    first spoke of <hi rend="italic">imaginary</hi> quantities, a subject not yet
                    completely cleared up; and he inferred by induction that every equation has
                    precisely as many sorts as there are units in the number that expresses its
                    degree. His algebra appeared in 1629.</p>
                <p part="N">The next great improver of algebra was Thomas Harriot, an Englishman. As
                    an inventor he has been the boast of this country. The French mathematicians
                    have accused the British of giving discoveries to him which were really due to
                    Vieta. It is probable that some of <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193035321?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-5321-0424"/>these may
                    be justly claimed for both, because each may have made the discovery for
                    himself, without knowing what had been done by the other. Harriot’s principal
                    discovery, and indeed the most important ever made in algebra, was, that every
                    equation may be regarded as formed-by the product of as many simple equations as
                    there are units in the number expressing its order. This important doctrine, now
                    familiar to every student of algebra, was yet slowly developed: it was quite
                    within the reach of Vieta, who unfolded it in part, but left its complete
                    discovery to Harriot.</p>
                <p part="N">We have seen the very inartificial form in which algebra first appeared
                    in Europe. The improvements of almost 400 years had not given its notation that
                    compactness and elegance of which it is susceptible. Harriot made several
                    changes in the notation, and added some new signs: he thus gave to algebra
                    greater symmetry of form. Indeed, as it came from his hands, it differed but
                    little from its state at the present time.</p>
                <p part="N">Oughtreed, another early English algebraist, was a contemporary with
                    Harriot, but lived long after him. Hewrote a treatise on the subject, which was
                    long taught in the universities.</p>
                <p part="N"> In tracing the history of algebra, we have seen, that in the form under
                    which it was received from the Arabs, it was hardly distinguishable as a
                    peculiar mode of reasoning, because of the want of a suitable notation; and
                    that, poor in its resources, its applicability was limited to the resolution of
                    a small number of uninteresting numeral questions. We have followed it through
                    different stages of improvement, and we are now arrived at a period when it was
                    to acquire additional power as an instrument of analysis, and to admit of new
                    and more extended applications. Vieta saw the great advantage that might be
                    derived from the application of algebra to geometry. The essay he made in his
                    theory of angular sections, and the rich mine of discovery thus opened, proved
                    the importance of his labours. He did not fully explore it, but it has seldom
                    happened that one man began and completed a discovery. He had, however, an able
                    and illustrious successor in Descartes, who, employing in the study of algebra
                    that high power of intellect with which he was endowed, not only improved it as
                    an abstract science, but, more especially by its application to geometry, he
                    laid the foundation of the great discoveries which have since so much engaged
                    mathematicians, and made the last two centuries ever memorable in the history of
                    the progress of the human mind.</p>
                <p part="N">Descartes’s grand improvement was the application of algebra to the
                    doctrine of curve lines. As in geography we refer every place on the earth’s
                    surface to the equator, and to a determinate meridian, so he referred every
                    point of a curve to some line given by position. For example, in a circle, every
                    point in the circumference might be referred to the diameter. The perpendicular
                    from any point in the curve, and the distance of that perpendicular from the
                    centre or from the extremity of a diameter, were lines which, although varying
                    with every change of position in the point from which the perpendicular was
                    drawn, yet had a determinate relation to each othęr, which was the same for all
                    points in the curve, which depended on its nature, and which, therefore, served
                    as a characteristic to distinguish it from all other curves.</p>
                <p part="N">The relations of lines drawn in this way could be readily expressed in
                    algebraic symbols; and the combination of these constituted what is called the
                        <hi rend="italic">equation</hi> of the curve. This might serve as its
                    definition; and from the equation by the processes of algebra, all the
                    properties of the curve could be investigated</p>
                <p part="N">Descartes’s geometry (or, as it might have been named, the application
                    of algebra to geometry) appeared first in’ 1637. This was six years after the
                    publication of Harriot's discoveries, which was a posthumous work. Descartes
                    availed himself of some of Harriot’s views, particularly the manner of
                    generating an equation without acknowledgement; and on this account Dr Wallis,
                    in his algebra, has reflected with considerable severity on the French
                    algebraist.</p>
                <p part="N">This spirit has engendered a corresponding eagerness in the French
                    mathematicians to defend him. Montucla, in his history of the mathematics, has
                    evinced a strong national prejudice in his favour; and, as usually happens, in
                    order to exalt him, he hardly does justice to Harriot’ the idol of his
                    adversaries.</p>
                <p part="N">In treating of the claims of algebra and geometry to be considered as
                    kindred sciences, a question arises, why was this relation not sooner perceived
                    and appreciated? The sciences of geometry and algebra have each had a distinct
                    origin. The former is the more ancient, and no doubt for this reason, that its
                    principles are less removed from the ordinary affairs of men. The subjects of
                    geometry, extension, and figure are continually presented to attention; and the
                    elements of the science are to a certain extent employed in the most ordinary
                    arts of life. We cannot sufficiently admire the ingenuity with which the natural
                    geometry of the early times had been wrought up into a system more than two
                    thousand years ago; but when we consider that its assistance was wanted in the
                    partition of land, in the erection of houses and temples, and numberless other
                    cases, we need not wonder at the early progress of the science among such an
                    ingenious people as the ancient Greeks.</p>
                <p part="N">Algebra, however, is a more refined speculation. Its first object was
                    number; but the properties of number are more recondite than those of extension
                    and figure.</p>
                <p part="N">In geometry, the objects of our attention are the very figures
                    themselves; but in algebra, the subjects of our reasonings are represented by
                    symbols, which have no resemblance to the things they represent; hence it is not
                    wonderful that algebra should have a later origin, and that it should have been
                    slower in its progress towards perfection.</p>
                <p part="N">Notwithstanding the different origin of geometry and algebra, and their
                    long-continued separate existence, like some chemical substances of different
                    natures, they have a strong affinity; and, when united, their new properties are
                    entirely different from those which belong to each apart. By their union, a new
                    science was created, and new instruments of invention furnished, vastly more
                    powerful than any possessed by the sciences apart.</p>
                <p part="N">The new views which the labours of Vieta, Harriot, and Descartes opened
                    in geometry and algebra were seized with avidity by the powerful minds of men
                    eager in the pursuit of real knowledge. Accordingly, we find in the seventeenth
                    century a whole host of writers on algebra, or algebra combined with
                    geometry.</p>
                <p part="N">Our limits will not allow us to enter minutely into the claims which
                    each has on the gratitude of posterity. Indeed, in pure algebra the new
                    inventions were not so conspicuous as the discoveries made by its applications
                    to geometry, and the new theories which were suggested by their union. The
                    refined speculations of Kepler concerning the solids formed by the revolutions
                    of curvilinear figures, the Geometry of Indivisibles by Cavalerius, the
                    Arithmetic of Infinites of Wallis, and, above all, the Method of Fluxions of
                    Newton, and the Differential and Integral Calculus of Leibnitz, are fruits of
                    the happy union-All these were agitated incessantly by their inventors an <pb

                    De Moivre, Maclaurin, Stirling, and others, in this country; and abroad by

                <p part="N">It is at this period, then, that our sketch of the history of algebra,
                    at least in Europe, must terminate, because of the great number of writers who
                    have in one way or other elucidated or improved different parts of the subject,
                    either directly, or when treating of collateral theories.</p>

                    because it presents the interesting spectacle of the progress of a science from
                    an almost imperceptible beginning, until it has attained a magnitude too great
                    to be fully grasped by the human mind.</p>

                <p part="N">The attention of the learned has, within the last thirty years, been
                    called to a branch of the history of algebra, in no small degree interesting; we
                    mean the cultivation of the science to a considerable extent, and at a remote
                    period, in India.</p>
                <p part="N">We are indebted, we believe, to Mr Reuben Burrow for some of the
                    earliest notices which reached Europe on this very curious subject. His
                    eagerness to illustrate the history of the mathematical sciences led him to
                    collect oriental manuscripts, some of which, in the Persian lan- ≡, with partial
                    translations, were bequeathed to his Mr Dalby of the Royal Military College, who
                    communicated them to such as took an interest in the subject, about the year
                    1800.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1813 Mr Edward Strachey published in this country a
                    translation from the Persian of the Bija Gan-nita (or Vija Ganita), a Hindoo
                    treatise on algebra; and in 1816 Dr John Taylor published at Bombay a
                    translation of Lilawati (or Lilavati), from the Sanscrit original. This last is
                    a treatise on arithmetic and geometry, and both are the production of an
                    oriental algebraist, Bhascara Acharya. Lastly, in 1817 there came out a work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Algebra, Arithmetic, and Mensuration, from the
                        Sanscrit of Brahme-gυptα and Bhascara,</hi> translated by Henry Thomas
                    Cole-brooke, Esq. This contains four different treatises, originally written in
                    Sanscrit verse, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Vĳa Ganita</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lilαvαti</hi> of Bhascara Acharya, and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ganitad'haya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cuttαcαd'hyaya</hi> of Brahmegupta.
                    The first two form the preliminary portion of Bhascara’s Course of Astronomy,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Sidďhanta Sironιani,</hi> and the last two are the
                    twelfth and eighteenth chapters of a similar course of astronomy, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Brahma-sidď</hi><hi rend="italic">hanta.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The time when Bhascara wrote is fixed with great precision, by his own
                    testimony and other circumstances, to a date that answers to about the year 1150
                    of the Christian era. The works of Brahmegupta are extremely rare, and the age
                    in which he lived is less certain. Mr Davis, an oriental scholar, who first gave
                    the public a correct <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> ' <hi rend="superscript">
                        ew</hi> of the astronomical computations of the Hindoos, is θf opinion that
                    he lived in the 7th century; and Dr " ιllιam Hunter, another diligent inquirer
                    into Indian science, assigns the year 628 of the Christian era as about the time
                    he flourished. From various arguments, Mr Colebrooke concludes that the age of
                    Brahmegupta was antecedent to the earliest dawn of the culture of the sciences
                    among the Arabians, so that the Hindoos must have possessed algebra before it
                    was known to that nation.</p>
                <p part="N">Brahmegupta’s treatise is not, however, the earliest work known to have
                    been written on this subject. Ganessa, a distinguished astronomer and
                    mathematician, and the most eminent scholiast of Bhascara, quotes a passage from
                    a much older writer, Arya-Bhatta, specifying algebra under the designation of
                        <hi rend="italic">Vĳa,</hi> and making separate mention of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cuttaxa,</hi> a problem subservient to the resolution of indeterminate
                    problems'of the first degree. He is understood by another of Bhascara’s
                    commentators to be at the head of the older writers. They appear to have been
                    able to resolve quadratic equations, by the process of completing the square;
                    and hence Mr Colebrooke presumes that the treatise of Arya-Bhatta then extant
                    extended to quadratic equations in the determinate analysis, and to
                    indeterminate equations of the first degree, if not to those of the second
                    likewise, as most probably it did.</p>
                <p part="N">Considering the proficiency of Arya-Bhatta in astronomical science, and
                    adverting to the fact of his having written on algebra, and being placed at the
                    head of algebraists when the commentators of extant treatises have occasion to
                    mention the early and original writers on this branch of science, he may be
                    regarded as the great improver of the analytic art in India, and likely to have
                    been the person by whom it was carried to the pitch it was found to have
                    attained among the Hindoos, and at which it was observed to be nearly stationary
                    through the long lapse of ages which have since passed; the later additions
                    being few and unessential in the writings of Brahmegupta, of Bhascara, and of
                    Jnyanaraja, though they lived at intervals of centuries from each other.</p>
                <p part="N">The exact period when Arya-Bhatta lived cannot be determined with
                    certainty; but Mr Colebrooke thinks it probable that this earliest of known
                    Hindoo algebraists wrote as far back as the fifth century of the Christian era,
                    and perhaps earlier. He was therefore nearly as ancient as the Grecian
                    algebraist Diophantus, who is reckoned to have flourished in the time of the
                    emperor Julian, or about <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 360. Supposing then the
                    Hindoo and Greek algebraists to be nearly of the same antiquity, it must be
                    conceded in favour of the former, that he was farthest advanced in the science,
                    since he knew how to resolve equations containing several unknown quantities:
                    now it does not appear that Diophantus could do this. He also had a general
                    method for indeterminate equations, of at least the first degree, to a knowledge
                    of which the Grecian algebraist had certainly not attained.</p>
                <p part="N">It appears from the Hindoo treatises on algebra, that they understood
                    well the arithmetic of surd roots; that they were aware of the infinite quotient
                    resulting from the division of finite quantity by cypher; that they knew the
                    general resolution of equations of the second degree, and had touched on those
                    of higher denomination, resolving them in particular cases, and in those in
                    which the solution may be effected in the manner of quadratics; that they had
                    found a general solution of indeterminate equations of the first degree, and a
                    method for deriving a multitude of answers to problems of the second degree,
                    when one solution was obtained by trials: now this is as near an approach to a
                    general solution of such problems as was made until the time of Lagrange. The
                    Hindoos had also attempted to solve indeterminate equations of higher orders,
                    but, as might be expected, with very little success.</p>
                <p part="N">We have seen how long it was before algebra was applied to geometry in
                    Europe: but the Hindoos not only applied algebra both to astronomy and geometry,
                    but conversely applied geometry to the demonstration of algebraic rules; and
                    indeed they cultivated algebra much more and with greater success than geometry,
                    as appears by the low state of their knowledge of the one, and the high pitch of
                    their attainments in the other.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Colebrooke has instituted a comparison between the Indian algebraist
                    and Diophantus, and found reason to conclude, that in the whole science the
                    latter is very far behind the former. He says, the points in which the <pb

                    a better and more convenient algorithm, lsŕ, the management of equations of more
                    than one unknown quantity; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> the resolution of
                    equations of a higher order, in which, if they achieved little, they had at

                    algebraists; <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> the application of algebra to
                    astronomical investigations and geometrical demonstration, in which also they
                    hit upon some matters which have been re-invented in modern times.</p>
                <p part="N">When we consider that algebra made little or no progress among the
                    Arabians, a most ingenious people, and particularly devoted to the study of the
                    sciences, and that centuries elapsed from its first introduction into Europe
                    until it reached any considerable degree of perfection, we may reasonably
                    conjecture, that it may have existed in one shape or other in India long before
                    the time of Arya-Bhatta: indeed, from its close connection with their doctrines
                    of astronomy, it may be supposed to have descended from a very remote period,
                    along with that science. The late learned Professor Playfair took a great
                    interest in this curious and interesting subject; and, adopting the opinion of
                    Bailly, the eloquent author of the <hi rend="italic">Astronomie Indienne,</hi>
                    he with great ingenuity attempted to prove, in a <hi rend="italic">Memoir on the
                        Astronomy of the Brahmins,</hi> that the observations on which the Indian
                    astronomy is founded were of great antiquity, indeed more than 3000 years before
                    the Christian era. Again, in a later memoir, <hi rend="italic">On the
                        Trigonometry of the Brahmins,</hi> he endeavoured to establish, that the
                    origin of the mathematical sciences in Hindostan must be referred to an equally
                    remote period. The same judicious writer has further considered this most
                    curious subject in a Review of Strachey’s Translation of Bija Gannita <hi
                        rend="italic">{Edinburgh Review,</hi> No. 42), and again, in a Review of
                    Colebrooke’s work on the Indian algebra, to which we have so frequently adverted
                        <hi rend="italic">{Edinburgh Review,</hi> No. 57). This last article,
                    published in 1817, may be supposed to contain the matured opinions of one of the
                    most ardent, able, and we must say most candid, inquirers into the history of
                    Hindoo mathematical science. There is here certainly an abatement of his first
                    confidence in the opinions of Bailly on the Indian astronomy, and a
                    corresponding caution in his own opinion as to the antiquity of the mathematical
                    sciences. The very remote origin of the Indian astronomy had been strongly
                    questioned by many in this country, and also on the Continent; particularly by
                    Laplace, also by Delambre in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi

                    he speaks slightingly of their algebra; and in this country, Professor Leslie,
                    in his very learned work on <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of Arithmetic,</hi>
                    p. 225 and 226, calls the Lilavati “a very poor performance, containing merely a
                    few scanty precepts couched in obscure memorial verses.” We shall conclude this
                    slight sketch of the history of Indian algebra with the last recorded sentiments
                    of Professor Playfair on the mathematical science of India. “Among many subjects
                    of wonder which the study of these ancient fragments cannot fail to suggest, it
                    is not one of the least that algebra has existed in India, and has been
                    cultivated for more than 1200 years, without any signal improvement, or the
                    addition of any material discovery. The works of the ancient teachers of science
                    have been commented on, elucidated, and explained with skill and learning; but
                    no new methods have been invented, nor any new principle introduced. The method
                    of resolving indeterminate problems, that constitute the highest merit of their
                    analytical science, were known to Brahmegupta hardly less accurately than to
                    Bhascara; and they appear to have been understood even by Arya-Bhatta, more
                    ancient by several centuries than either. A long series of scholiasts display in
                    their annotations great acuteness, intelligence, and judgment; but they never
                    pass far beyond the line drawn by their predecessors, which probably seemed even
                    to those learned and intelligent men as the barrier within which it was to be
                    confined. In India, indeed, every thing seems equally insurmountable, and truth
                    and error are equally assured of permanence in the stations they have once
                    occupied. The politics, the laws, the religion, the science, and the manners,
                    seem all nearly the same as at the remotest period to which history extends. Is
                    it because the power which brought about a certain degree of civilisation, and
                    advanced science to a certain height, has either ceased to act, or has met with
                    such a resistance as it is barely able to overcome? or is it because the
                    discoveries which the Hindoos are in possession of are an inheritance from some
                    more inventive' and more ancient people, of whom no memorial remains but some of
                    their attainments in science ?”</p>

                <p part="N">NOTATION AND EXPLANATION OF THE SIGNS.</p>
                <p part="N">1. In arithmetic there are ten characters, which being variously
                    combined, according to certain rules, serve to denote all magnitudes whatever.
                    But this method of expressing quantities, although of the greatest utility in
                    every branch of the mathematics (for we must always have recourse to it in the
                    different applications of that science to practical purposes), is yet found to
                    be inadequate, taken by itself, to the more difficult cases of mathematical
                    investigation; and it is therefore necessary, in many inquiries concerning the
                    relations of magnitude, to have recourse to that more general mode of notation,
                    and more extensive system of operations, which constitute the science of
                    algebra.</p>
                <p part="N">In algebra quantities of every kind may be denoted by any characters
                    whatever, but those commonly Used are the letters of the alphabet; and as in
                    every mathematical problem there are certain magnitudes given, in order to
                    determine other magnitudes which are unknown, the first letters of the alphabet
                        <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> &amp;c. are used to denote known quantities,
                    while those to be found are represented by <hi rend="italic">V, X, y,</hi>
                    &amp;c. the last letters of the alphabet.</p>
                <p part="N">2. The sign + <hi rend="italic">(plus')</hi> denotes that the quantity
                    before which it is placed is to be added to some other quantity. Thus, <hi
                        rend="italic">a+b</hi> denotes the sum of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">b;</hi> 3 + 5 denotes the sum of 3 and 5, or 8.</p>
                <p part="N">• The sign — <hi rend="italic">(minus)</hi> signifies that the quantity
                    before which it is placed is to be subtracted. Thus, <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> denotes the excess of <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> above <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi><hi rend="italic">6</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 2 is the excess of 6
                    above 2. or 4.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Quantities which have the sign + prefixed to them are called <hi
                        rend="italic">positive</hi> or <hi rend="italic">affirmative</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and such as have the sign — are called <hi
                        rend="italic">negative.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035373?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-5373-0428"/>
                <p part="N">When quantities are considered abstractedly, the terms <hi rend="italic"
                        >positive</hi> and <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> can only mean that such
                    quantities are to be added or subtracted; for as it is impossible to conceive a
                    number less than 0, it follows, that a negative quantity by itself is
                    unintelligible. But, in considering the affections of magnitude, it appears,
                    that in many cases a certain opposition may exist in the nature of quantities.
                    Thus, a person’s property may be considered as a positive quantity, and his
                    debts as a negative quantity. Again, any portion of a line drawn to the right
                    hand may be considered as positive, while a portion of the same line, continued
                    in the opposite direction, may be taken as negative.</p>
                <p part="N">When no sign is prefixed to a quantity, + is always understood, or the
                    quantity is to be considered as positive.</p>
                <p part="N">Quantities which have the same sign, either -į-or —, are said to have
                    like signs. Thus, + <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">+b</hi> have
                    like signs, but + <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and — c have unlike signs.</p>
                <p part="N">4. A quantity which consists of one <hi rend="italic">term·,</hi> is
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">Simple;</hi> but if it consist of several terms,
                    connected by the signs + or —, it is then said to be compound. Thus, <hi
                        rend="italic">+ a</hi> and — <hi rend="italic">c</hi> are simple quantities;
                    and <hi rend="italic">b + c,</hi> also <hi rend="italic">a+b</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">d,</hi> are compound quantities.</p>
                <p part="N">5. To dęnote the product arising from the multiplication of quantities.
                    If they be simple, they are either joined together, as if intended to form a
                    word, or else the quantities are connected together, with the sign × interposed
                    between every two of them. Thus, <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> or α × 5, denotes
                    the product of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b;</hi> also <hi
                        rend="italic">abc,</hi> or α × 6 × c, denotes the product of <hi
                        rend="italic">a, b,</hi> and c .∙ the latter method is used when the
                    quantities to be multiplied are numbers. If some of the quantities to be
                    multiplied be compound, each of them has a line drawn over it called a vinculum,
                    and the sign × is interposed, as before. Thus, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ×
                    c+&lt;Z× <hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >f</hi> denotes that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is to be considered as one
                    quantity, the sum of c and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> as a second, and the
                    difference between <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> as a
                    third; and that these three quantities are to be multiplied into one another.
                    Instead of placing a line over such compound quantities as enter a product, it
                    is now common among mathematical writers to inclose each of them between two
                    parentheses, so that the last product maybe otherwise expressed thus, <hi
                        rend="italic">a(c+d)(e</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >f)∙,</hi> or thus, <hi rend="italic">a×(c + d)×(e-f).</hi></p>
                <p part="N">6. A number prefixed to a letter is called a <hi rend="italic">numerical
                        cο-efficient,</hi> and denotes how often that quantity is to be taken. Thus,
                        <hi rend="italic">3a</hi> signifies that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is to be
                    taken three times. When no number is prefixed, the co-efficient is understood to
                    be unity.</p>
                <p part="N">7. The quotient arising from the division of one quantity by another is
                    expressed by placing the <hi rend="italic">dividend</hi> above a</p>
                <p part="N">12</p>
                <p part="N">line, and the <hi rend="italic">divisor</hi> below it. Thus, — denotes
                    the quotient arising from the division of 12 by 3, or 4; - denotes ĆZ</p>
                <p part="N">the quotient arising from the division of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> by

                    multiplication by any assumed quantity as the numerator, and the assumed
                    quantity as the denominator of the fraction. It also appears that a fraction

                    2,4, 6, 8,10, &amp;c. form a series in continued arithmetical proportion, and,
                    in general, such a series may be represented thus:</p>

                <p part="N">By a little attention to this series, we readily discover that it has
                    the following properties:</p>
                <p part="N">1. The last term of the series is equal to the first term, together with
                    the common difference taken as often as there are terms after the first. Thus,
                    when the number of terms is 7, the last term is <hi rend="italic">a + 6d</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and so on. Hence if <hi rend="italic">z</hi> denote the

                        >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> express the first term and common

                <p part="N">2. The sum of the first and last term is equal to the sum of any two
                    terms at the same distance from them. Thus, suppose the number of terms to be 7,
                    then the last term is <hi rend="italic">a + 6d,</hi> and the sum of the first
                    and last <hi rend="italic">2a + 6d;</hi> but the same is also the sum of the
                    second and last but one, of the third and last but two, and so on till we come
                    to the middle term, which, because it is equally distant from die extremes, must
                    be added to itself.</p>
                <p part="N">From the last-mentioned property we derive a rule for finding the sum of
                    all the terms of the series. For if the sum of the first and last be taken, as
                    also the sum of the second and last but one, of the third and last but two, and
                    so on along the series till we come to the sum of the last and first terms, it
                    is evident that we shall have as many sums as there are terms, and each equal to
                    the sum of the first and last terms; but the aggregate of those sums is equal to
                    all the terms of the series taken twice, therefore the sum of the first and last
                    term, taken as often as there are terms, is equal to twice the sum of all the
                    terms; so that if <hi rend="italic">s</hi> denote that sum, we have <hi

                        Resolution of Equations involving one Unknown Quantity.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">57. The general object of algebraic investigation is to discover certain
                    unknown quantities, by comparing them with other quantities which are given, or
                    supposed to be known. The relation between the known and unknown quantities is
                    either that of equality, or else such as may be reduced to equality; and a
                    proposition which affirms that certain combinations of quantities are equal to
                    one another is called an <hi rend="italic">equation.</hi> Such are the following
                    :—</p>
                <p part="N">a? <hi rend="italic">x _</hi> 24</p>
                <p part="N">2 <hi rend="superscript"> +</hi> 3^~ ’ 2*+⅜∕ = <hi rend="italic"
                        >xy.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The first of these equations expresses the relation between an unknown
                    quantity <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and certain known numbers; and the second
                    expresses the relation which the two indefinite quantities <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> have to each other.</p>
                <p part="N">58. When a quantity stands alone on one side of an equation, the terms
                    on the other side are said to be a <hi rend="italic">value</hi> of that
                    quantity. Thus, in the equation <hi rend="italic">x = ay + b</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the quantity <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi> stands alone on one side, and <hi rend="italic">ay+b</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> is its value.</p>
                <p part="N">The conditions of a problem may be such as to require several equations
                    and symbols of unknown quantities for their complete expression. These, however,
                    by rules hereafter to be explained, may be reduced to one equation, involving
                    only one unknown quantity and its powers, besides the known quantities; and the
                    method of expressing that quantity by means of the known quantities constitutes
                    the theory of equations, one of the most important as well as most intricate
                    branches of algebraic analysis.</p>
                <p part="N">59. An equation is. said tobe <hi rend="italic">resolved</hi> when the
                    unknown quantity is made to stand alone on one side, and only known quantities
                    on the other side; and the value of the unknown quantity is called a <hi
                        rend="italic">root</hi> of the equation.</p>
                <p part="N">60. Equations containing only one unknown quantity and its powers, are
                    divided into different <hi rend="italic">orders,</hi> according to the highest
                    power of that quantity contained in any one of its terms. The equation, however,
                    is supposed to be reduced to such a form that the unknown quantity is found only
                    in the numerators of the terms, and that the exponents of its powers are
                    expressed by positive integers.</p>
                <p part="N">61. If an equation contains only the first power of the unknown
                    quantity, it is called a <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> equation, or an equation
                    of the first order. Such is <hi rend="italic">ax+b = c,</hi> where ® denotes an
                    unknown, and <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> known quantities.</p>
                <p part="N">If the equation contains the second power of the unknown quantity, it is
                    said to be of the second degree, or is called a <hi rend="italic">quadratic</hi>
                    equation; such is 4ir <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +3^ = 12 <hi
                        rend="subscript"> j</hi> and in general <hi rend="italic">ax</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">+ bx</hi> = c. If it
                    contains the third power of the unknown quantity, it is of the third degree, or
                    is a <hi rend="italic">cubic</hi> equation; such are x <hi rend="superscript">
                        3</hi> — <hi rend="italic">2x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> +
                    4a? = 10, and <hi rend="italic">ax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">+bx</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >∙ +ca-di</hi> and so on with respect to equations of the higher orders. A
                    simple equation is sometimes said to be <hi rend="italic">linear,</hi> or of one
                        <hi rend="italic">dimension.</hi> In like manner, quadratic equations are
                    said to be of two dimensions, and cubic equations of three dimensions.</p>
                <p part="N">62. When in the course of an algebraic investigation we arrive at an
                    equation involving only one unknown quantity, that quantity will often be so
                    entangled in the different terms as to render several previous reductions
                    necessary before the equation can be expressed under its characteristic form, so
                    as to be resolved by the rules which belong to that form.</p>
                <p part="N">These reductions depend upon the operations which have been explained in
                    the former part of this treatise, and the application of a few self-evident
                    principles, namely, that if equal quantities be added to or subtracted from
                    equal quantities, the sums or remainders will be equal; if equal quantities be
                    multiplied or divided by the same quantity, the products or quotients will be
                    equal; and, lastly, if equal quantities be raised to the same power, or have the
                    same root extracted out of each, the results will still be equal.</p>
                <p part="N">From these considerations are derived the following rules, which apply
                    alike to equations of all orders, and are alone sufficient for the resolution of
                    simple equations.</p>
                <p part="N">63. <hi rend="italic">Rule</hi> 1. Any quantity may be transposed from
                    one side of an equation to the other, by changing its signs.</p>

                <p part="N">The reason of this rule is evident, for the transposing of a quantity
                    from one side of an equation to the other is nothing more than adding the same
                    quantity to each side of the equation, if the sign of the quantity transposed
                    was —; or subtracting it, if the sign was +∙ _</p>
                <p part="N">From this rule we may infer, that if any quantity bθ found on each side
                    of the equation with the same sig∏&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> lt</hi> may be
                    left out of both. Also, that the signs of all the terms of an equation may be
                    changed into the contrary, without affecting the truth of the equation. ∣</p>

                <p part="N">79. When a problem is proposed to be resolved by the algebraic method of
                    analysis, its trüe meaning ought in the first place to be perfectly understood,
                    so that, if necessary, it may be freed from all superfluous and ambiguous
                    expressions, and its conditions exhibited in the clearest point of view
                    possible. The several quantities concerned in the problem are next to be denoted
                    by proper symbols, and their relation to one another expressed agreeably to the
                    algebraic notation. Thus we shall obtain a series of equations, which, if the
                    question be properly limited, will enable us to determine all the unknown
                    quantities required by the rules already delivered in the two preceding
                    sections.</p>
                <p part="N">80. In reducing the conditions of a problem to equations, the following
                    rule will be of service. Suppose that the quantities to be determined are
                    actually found, and then consider by what operations the truth of the solution
                    may be verified; then let the same operations be performed upon the quantities,
                    whether known or unknown, and thus all the conditions of the problem will be
                    reduced to a series of equations, such as is required. For example, suppose that
                    it is required to find two numbers, such, that their sum is 20, and the quotient
                    arising from the division of their difference by the lesser 3; then if we denote
                    the greater of the two numbers by <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and the lesser by
                        <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> and proceed as if to prove the truth of the
                    solution, we shall ιave a; + τ∕ fo <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> the <hi

                    ιeιr difference. Now, as the former must be equal to 20, und the latter divided
                    by <hi rend="italic">y</hi> equal to 3, the first condi- <hi rend="superscript">
                        1011</hi> of tlιe problem will be expressed by this equation, a?+y=20, and
                    the second by --^ <hi rend="superscript"> y</hi> = 3; and from these the values
                    of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> may easily be
                    found.</p>
                <p part="N">81. When the conditions of a problem have been expressed by equations,
                    or translated from the common language into that of algebra, we must consider
                    whether the problem be properly limited; for in some cases the conditions may be
                    such as to admit of innumerable solutions, and in others they may involve an
                    absurdity, and thus render the problem altogether impossible.</p>
                <p part="N">Now, by considering the examples of last section, it will appear, that
                    to determine any number of unknown quantities, there must be given as many
                    equations as there are unknown quantities. Thèse, however, must be such as
                    cannot bc derived from each other, and they must not involve any contradiction;
                    for in the one case the problem would admit of an unlimited number of answers,
                    and in the other case it would be impossible. For example, if it were required
                    to determine <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> from these
                    two equations, <hi rend="italic">2x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">3y</hi> = 13, 4a?—6?/=26; as the latter equation is a
                    consequence of the former (for each term of the one is the half of the
                    corresponding term of the other), it is evident, that innumerable values of a?
                    and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> might be found to satisfy both equations. Again, if
                    a? and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> were to be determined from these equations, <hi
                        rend="italic">x + 2y=8, 3x</hi> + 6τ∕=26, it is easy to see that it is
                    impossible to find such values of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >y</hi> as will satisfy both; for, from the first, we find 3rr=24 — <hi
                        rend="italic">6y</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and from the second, <hi
                        rend="italic">3x</hi> = 26 — <hi rend="italic">6y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> and therefore 24— <hi rend="italic">6y =</hi> 26— <hi rend="italic"
                        >6y,</hi> or 24 — 26, which is absurd; and so also must have been the
                    conditions from which this conclusion is drawn.</p>
                <p part="N">82. But there is yet another case in which a problem may be impossible;
                    and that is, when there are more equations than unknown quantities; for it
                    appears, that in this case, by the rules of last section, we would at last •find
                    two equations, each involving the same unknown quantity. Now, unless these
                    happened to agree, the problem would admit of no solution. On the whole
                    therefore it appears, that a problem is limited when the conditions furnish just
                    as many independent equations as there are known quantities to be determined: if
                    there be fewer, the problem is indeterminate; but if there be more, the problem
                    in general admits of no solution whatever.</p>
                <p part="N">83. In expressing the conditions of a problem by equations, it will
                    sometimes be convenient to introduce as few symbols of unknown quantities as
                    possible. Therefore, if two quantities be sought and their sum be given, suppose
                    it = s; then if the one quantity be represented by <hi rend="italic">χ,</hi> the
                    other may be denoted by s — <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> If, again, their

                <p part="N">85. We are next to explain the resolution of equations of the second
                    degree, or quadratic equations. These involve the second power of the unknown
                    quantity, and may be divided into two kinds, <hi rend="italic">pure</hi> and <hi

                <p part="N">I. <hi rend="italic">Pure</hi> quadratic equations are such as after
                    proper reduction have the square of the unknown quantity in one term, while the

                        i</hi><hi rend="italic">+b=c,</hi> are examples of pure quadratics.</p>
                <p part="N">II. <hi rend="italic">Adfected</hi> quadratic equations contain the
                    square of the unknown quantity in one term, and its first or simple power in
                    another; the remaining terms consisting entirely of known quantities. Such are
                    the following, <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">+ 3x</hi> =28, 2x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =33 — <hi

                <p part="N">The manner of resolving a pure quadratic equation is sufficiently
                    evident. If the unknown quantity be made to stand alone on one side, with unity
                    as a co-efficient, while the other side consists entirely of known quantities,
                    and the square root of each side be taken, we immediately obtain the value of
                    the simple power of the unknown quantity as directed by rule 5th of sect.
                    VI.</p>
                <p part="N">86. In extracting the square root of any quantity, it is necessary to
                    observe, that the sign of the root may be either + or —. This is an evident
                    consequence of the rule for the signs in multiplication; for since by that rule
                    any quantity, whether positive or negative, if multiplied by itself, will
                    produce a positive quantity, and therefore tlιe square of <hi rend="italic"
                        >+a,</hi> as well as that of — <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> is + α <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; so, on the contrary, the square root of + α <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi> is to be considered either as + <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> or as — α, and may accordingly be èxpress-ed thus, <hi rend="italic"
                        >r±za.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">87. Having remarked that the square of any quantity, whatever be its
                    sign, is always positive, it evidently follows that no real quantity whatever,
                    when multiplied by itself, can produce a negative quantity; therefore, if the
                    square root of a negative quantity be required, no such root can be assigned.
                    Hence it also follows, that if a problem requires for its solution the
                    extraction of the square root of a negative quantity, some contradiction must
                    necessarily be involved, either in the condition of the problem, or in the
                    process of reasoning by which that solution has been obtained.</p>
                <p part="N">88. When an adfected quadratic equation is to be resolved, it may
                    always, by proper reduction, be brought to one or other of the three following
                    forms:</p>
                <p part="N">1. <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> λ</hi><hi

                <p part="N">But as the manner of resolving each of the three forms is the very same,
                    it will be sufficient if we consider any one of them.</p>
                <p part="N">Resuming therefore the first equation, or <hi rend="italic">a? +
                        px—q,</hi> let us compare the side of it which involves the unknown quantity

                    resolving adfective quadratic equations.</p>
                <p part="N">1. Bring all the terms involving the unknown quantity to one side, and

                    square of the unknown quantity may be positive.</p>
                <p part="N">2. If the square of the unknown quantity be multiplied by a
                    co-efficient, let the other terms be divided by it, so that the co-cfficient of
                    the square of the unknown quantity may be 1.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Add to both sides the square of half the co-efficient of the unknown
                    quantity itself, and the side of the equation involving the unknown quantity
                    will now be a complete square.</p>
                <p part="N">4. Extract the square root of both sides of the equation, by which it
                    becomes simple with respect to the unknown quantity; and by transposition, that
                    quantity may be made to stand alone on one side of the equation, while the other
                    side consists of known quantities; and therefore the equation is resolved.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Note.</hi> The square root of the first side of the

                    equal to the sum, but if it be —, then it is equal to the difference.</p>

                    both negative. It also follows, that in the former ease the root whieh is

                    alike concerned in a question that produces a quadratic equation, they will be
                    the roots of that equation. A similar observation applies to any number of
                    quantities which require for their determination the resolution of an equation
                    of any degree whatever.</p>

                <p part="N">99. Before we proceed to the resolution of cubic and the higher orders
                    of equations, it will be proper to explain some general properties which belong
                    to equations of every degree, and also certain operations which must frequently
                    be performed upon equations before they be fitted for a final solution.</p>
                <p part="N">In treating of equations in general, we shall suppose all the terms
                    brought to one side, and put equal to 0; so that an equation of the fourth
                    degree will stand thus:</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">a? + pa?+qa?+rx</hi> +s=0, where <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi> denotes an unknown quantity, and <hi rend="italic">p, q, r, s,</hi>
                    known quantities, either positive or negative. Here the co-efficient of the
                    highest power of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is unity, but had it been any other
                    quantity, that quantity might have been taken away, and the equation reduced to
                    the above form, by rules already explained (Sect. VI).</p>
                <p part="N">The terms being thus arranged, if such a quantity be found as, when
                    substituted for <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> will render both sides = 0, and
                    therefore satisfy the equation, that’quantity, whether it be positive or
                    negative, or even imaginary, is to be considered as a root of the equation. But
                    we have seen that every quadratic equation has always two roots, real or
                    imaginary; we may therefore suppose that a similar diversity will take place in
                    all equations of a higher degree; and this supposition appears to be well
                    founded, by the following proposition, which is of great importance in the

                    formula will give eight different expressions for the root. It is, however, to
                    be observed, that as the product of the three quantities √α, <hi rend="italic"

                    so that in this case they must either be all positive, or two of them must be

                    the co-efficients are integers, by supposing <hi rend="italic">z=-.</hi> Thus

                <p part="N">2. Since the last term of the cubic equation is negative; when its three
                    roots are real, they must either be all positive, or two of them must be
                    negative and one positive; for the last term is equal to the product of all the
                    roots taken with contrary signs, sect. 100; so that in this last case, two of
                    the three quantities <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> must be negative, and
                    therefore all the four roots of the biquadratic equation imaginary. If, however,
                    the two negative roots be equal, they will destroy each other in two of the
                    roots of the biquadratic equation, which will then become real and equal. Let us
                    suppose, for example, that <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    are negative and equal; the first two values of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in each

                    no general method has hitherto been found, either for resolving them directly,

                    from them. The same observation will also apply to the formulae for the roots of

                    necessary to find the roots of a cubic equation. But in either cubics or

                    and therefore can be always applied, it is more convenient in practice to employ

                <p part="N">144. It has been shown in sect. 100, that the last term of any equation
                    is always the product of its roots taken with contrary signs. Hence, when the
                    roots are rational, they may be discovered by the following rule:</p>
                <p part="N">Bring all the terms of the equation to one side; find all the divisors
                    of the last term, and substitute them successively for the unknown quantity.
                    Then each divisor, which produces a result equal to 0, is a root of the

                <p part="N">The divisors of 10, the last term, are 1, 2, 5, 10, each of which may be
                    taken either positively or negatively-and these being substituted successively
                    for x, we obtain the following results: </p>
                <p part="N">By putting +1 for ae, 1— 4— 7+10= o —1, —1— 4+ 7+10= 12</p>

                <p part="N">Here the divisors which produce results equal to 0 are +1, —2, and +5;
                    therefore these are the three roots of the proposed equation.</p>

                    be convenient to transform the equation into another, in which the last term has
                    fewer divisors. This may in general be done by forming an equation, the roots of
                    which are greater or less than those of the proposed equation by some
                    determinate quantity; as in the following example:</p>

                    reduced to a quadratic. Accordingly, by performing the division, and putting the

                    pure or adfected, its roots cannot be exactly expressed either by whole numbers
                    or rational fractions. This may be demonstrated by means of the following
                    proposition. If a prime number P be a divisor of the product of two numbers A
                    and B, it will also be a divisor of at least one of the numbers.</p>
                <p part="N">Let us suppose that it does not divide B, and that B is greater than P;

                    by P; therefore, seeing we cannot divide B' by P, let P be divided by B', and

                    be a prime number, it is evident that this series of operations may be continued
                    till a remainder be found equal to unity, which will at last be the case; for
                    the divisors are the successive remainders of the divisions, and therefore each
                    is less than the divisor which preceded it. By performing these operations, we

                <p part="N">149. It follows from this proposition, that if the prime number P, which

                <p part="N">Seeing that if a prime number is not a divisor of <hi rend="italic"

                        Equations by Approximation.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">151. When the roots of an equation cannot be accurately expressed by
                    rational numbers, it is necessary to have recourse to methods of approximation;
                    and by these we can always determine the numerical values of the roots to as
                    great a degree of accuracy as we please.</p>
                <p part="N">The application of methods of approximation is rendered easy by means of
                    the following propositions:</p>
                <p part="N">I. If two numbers, either whole or fractional, be found, which, when
                    substituted for the unknown quantity in any equation, produce results with
                    contrary signs, we may conclude that at least one root of the proposed equation
                    is between those numbers, and is consequently real.</p>
                <p part="N">Let the proposed equation be ae <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> — <hi

                    which, by collecting the positive terms into one sum, and the negative into

                <p part="N">By inspecting this table, it appears that while <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    increases from 0 to a certain numerical value, which exceeds 3, the positive
                    part of the equation, or ir <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> + 10a?, is always
                    less than the negative part, or 5a^ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +15; so that
                    the expression a? <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> +10a? — (ða^+15) or ae <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 3</hi> — 5a? <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +10a?—15
                    must necessarily be negative.</p>
                <p part="N">It also appears, that when <hi rend="italic">X</hi> has increased beyond
                    that numerical value, and which is evidently less than 4, the positive part of
                    the equation, instead of being less than the negative part, is now greater, and
                    therefore the expression a? <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> — 5x <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +10x-15 is changed from a negative to a positive
                    quantity.</p>
                <p part="N">Hence we may conclude that there is some real and determinate value of
                        <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> which is greater than 3, but less than 4, and
                    which will render the positive and negative parts of the equation equal to one
                    another; therefore that value of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> must be a root of the
                    proposed equation; and as wlíat has been just now shown in a particular case
                    will readily apply to any equation whatever, the truth of the proposition is
                    obvious.</p>
                <p part="N">152. Two limits, between which all the roots of any equation are
                    contained, may be determined by this other proposition:</p>
                <p part="N">II. Let N be the greatest negative co-efficient in any equation. Change
                    the signs of the terms taken alternately, beginning with the second, and let N

                    the signs are so changed. The positive roots of the equation are contained
                    between 0 and N+l, and the negative roots between 0 and-—N'-1.</p>

                    and also the number con ’ esponding to any given logarithm, the operations or
                    multiplication and division of numbers may be reduced to the addition and
                    subtraction of their logarithms, and the operations of involution and evolution,
                    to the more simple operations of multiplication and division. Thus, if two

                    multiplied together, by taking the sum of their logarithms, we obtain the
                    logarithm of their product, and, by inspecting the table, the product itself. A
                    similar observation applies to the quotient of two numbers, and also to any
                    power or to any root of a number.</p>

                    Thus, if the radical number be 10, wc shall have the <hi rend="italic"

                    />may suppose that the interest, which is always proportional to the sum lent,
                    or principal, is also proportional to the time during which the principal is
                    employed; and on this hypothesis, the money is said to be improved at <hi

                    which ought to be paid to the lender at successive stated periods is added to
                    the principal, instead of being actually paid, and thus their amount converted
                    into a new principal. When money is lent according to this second hypothesis, it

                    be added at the end of every half-year, or every quarter, or even every instant;
                    and suitable rules might have been found for performing calculations, according
                    to each hypothesis. As such suppositions are, however, never made in actual
                    business, we shall not at present say any thing more of them.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Annuities.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">183. An annuity is a payment made annually for a term of years; and the
                    chief problem relating to it is to determine its present worth, that is, the sum
                    a person ought to pay immediately to another, upon condition of receiving from
                    the latter a certain sum annually for a given time. In resolving this problem,
                    it is supposed that the buyer improves his annuity from the time he receives it,
                    and the seller the purchase-money, in a certain manner, during the continuance
                    of the annuity, so that at the end of the time the amount of each may be the
                    same.. There may be various suppositions as to the way in which the annuity and
                    its purchase-money may be improved; but the only one commonly applied to
                    practice is the highest improvement possible of both, viz. by compound interest.
                    As the taking of compound interest is, however, prohibited by law, the realizing
                    of this supposed improvement requires punctual payment of interest, and
                    therefore the interest in such calculations is usually made low.</p>

                <p part="N">The purchaser is supposed to receive the first annuity A at the end of

                    of the second year, which, being improved for <hi rend="italic">t</hi> —2 years,
                    amounts to AR <hi rend="superscript"> i-2</hi>. In like manner, the third year’s

                        Resolution of Geometrical Problems.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">201. When a geometrical problem is to be resolved by algebra, the figure
                    which is to be the subject of investigation must be drawn, so as to exhibit as
                    well the known quantities connected with the problem, as the unknown quantities
                    which are to be found. The conditions of the problem are next to be attentively
                    considered, and such lines drawn, or produced, as may be judged necessary to its
                    resolution. This done, the known quantities are to be denoted by symbols in the
                    usual manner, and also such unknown quantities as can most easily be determined;
                    which may be either those directly required, or others from which they can be
                    readily found. We must next proceed to deduce from the known geometrical
                    properties of the figure a series of equations, expressing the relations between
                    the known and unknown quantities; these equations must be independent of each
                    other, and as many in number as there are unknown quantities. Having obtained a
                    suitable number of equations, the unknown quantities are to be determined in the
                    same manner as in the resolution of numerical problems.</p>
                <p part="N">No general rule can be given for drawing the lines, and selecting the
                    quantities most proper to be represented by symbols, so as to bring out the
                    simplest conclusion; because different problems require different me-tłiods of
                    solution. The best way to gain experience in this matter, is to try the solution
                    of the same problem in different ways, and then apply that which succeeds best
                    to other cases of the same kind, when they afterwards occur. The following
                    particular directions, however, may be of some use.</p>
                <p part="N">1. In preparing the figure by drawing lines, let them be either parallel
                    or perpendicular to other lines in the figure, so as to form similar triangles.
                    And if an angle be given, it will be proper to let the perpendicular be opposite
                    to that angle, and to fall from one end of a given line, if possible.</p>
                <p part="N">2. In selecting the quantities for which symbols are to be substituted,
                    those are to be chosen, whether required or not, which lie nearest the known or
                    given parts of the figure, and by means of which the next adjacent parts may be

                    straight line and a conic section. In general, curves of the superior orders
                    include all the curves of the inferior orders, and what is demonstrated
                    generally of any one order is also true of the inferior orders. Thus, for
                    example, any general property of the conic sections holds true of two straight
                    lines as well as a conic section, particularly, that the rectangles of the
                    segments of parallels bounded by them will always be to one another in a given
                    ratio.</p>
                <p part="N">214. From the analogy which subsists between algebraic equations and
                    geometrical curves, it is easy to see that the properties of the former must
                    suggest corresponding properties of the latter. Hence the principles of algebra
                    admit of the most extensive application to the theory of curve lines. It may be
                    demonstrated, for example, that the <hi rend="italic">locus of</hi> every

                    inscribed in a circle, namely, that the rectangle contained by its diagonals is
                    equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by its opposite sides; which we
                    find in the writings of Ptolemy, and which was employed in the trigonometry of
                    the Greeks. In comparatively modern times we find the same propositions

                    printed in 1599; and probably they may be found in still earlier works.
                    Montucla, in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Mathématiques,</hi> says, “I do
                    not see that any one before the beginning of this century (the 18th) had thought
                    of seeking formulae proper to express the sines or cosines, tangents or
                    co-tangents, of the sum or difference of arcs of a circle, or their powers,
                    &amp;c. It seems to me to have been very natural; and that there must have been
                    frequently occasion to know what was the sine or cosine, the tangent or
                    co-tangent, of an arc, that was the sum or difference of two arcs of which the
                    sines or cosines, or tangents or cotangents, were known. The first theorems on
                    this subject appear to be the work of Frederic-Christian Mayer, one of the first
                    members of the Petersburg Academy^ Mon-tucla, however, seems to have overlooked
                    the trigonometry of Pitiscus, who, in problems 8 and 9 of his second book, gives
                    rules for finding the sines and cosines of the sum and difference of two arcs,
                    when the sines and cosines of the arcs are given. These are in the edition of
                    1612. The formula which expresses the tangent of the sum of several arcs by the
                    tangent of the arcs themselves, was given, for the first time, we believe, by
                    John Bernoulli, in the Leipsic Acts for July <hi rend="italic">1722.</hi> Both
                    these are prior to Mayer’s Memoir, which is in the Petersburg Commentaries with
                    the date 1727. It was probably here, however, that the first essay of analytical
                    trigonometry was given. Euler, who stands pre-eminent in every branch of the

                <p part="N">217. The calculus of sines is of great importance as a branch of
                    analysis. It enables us in a great measure to dispense with the complicated
                    diagrams which the earlier writers on geometry, and on the physico-mathematical
                    theories, employed in their investigations and demonstrations. In geometry, when
                    combined with the modern analysis, it gives the power of expressing the most
                    complicated relations of figure, and magnitude, and position, almost without the
                    help of graphic representations. As an example, we may give the fine discovery
                    by Gauss, of formulae by which a regular polygon of seventeen sides may be
                    inscribed in a circle by a geometrical construction. In algebra it has served to
                    extend greatly the theory of equations; in astronomy, when applied to the
                    theories of the planets and comets, it gives elegant and convenient expressions
                    for their angular motions, and compact formulae for computing the elements of
                    their orbits, and their true and apparent positions; and in statics and
                    dynamics, it gives, without diagrams, the relations of forces which produce rest
                    or motion, and the laws of the motions. The precious invention of logarithms
                    abridged the irksome <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036127?mode=fullsize"

                    applications of 'geometry; but this, combined with the trigonometrical tables,
                    and the theory of the calculus of sines, affords a still more powerful
                    instrument for abridging labour; just as two mechanical inventions, which apart
                    can overcome considerable resistance, yet are vastly more potent when
                    united.</p>
                <p part="N">218. In the calculus of sines, as well as in other applications of
                    algebra to geometry, all quantities, whether lines or angles, are considered as
                    expressed by numbers; some line or angle is assumed as a <hi rend="italic"
                        >unit,</hi> and the number of times that unit is contained in the line or
                    angle is its numerical value.</p>
                <p part="N">The magnitude of the unit is altogether arbitrary; and since, in
                    general, the magnitude to be expressed in numbers may not contain the unit an
                    exact number of times, it ought to be so small, that the remainders may, in
                    respect of the wholes, be rejected.</p>
                <p part="N">219. The primary unit, by which angles are expressed in numbers, is one
                    ninetieth part of a right angle, that is, one 360th part of four right angles.
                    Each of these is called a <hi rend="italic">degree,</hi> and is conceived to
                    contain 60 units of a lower order, called <hi rend="italic">minutes</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and each minute, again, 60 units of the next lower
                    order, called <hi rend="italic">seconds</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and so on
                    to <hi rend="italic">thirds,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">The degrees, minutes, &amp;c. in an angle, are usually written thus: 12°
                    15' 10" 25'". This means an angle of 12 degrees, 15 minutes, 10 seconds, and 25
                    thirds. It is not common to estimate angles to a greater degree of accuracy than
                    seconds and tenths of a second: thus 3*4" means three seconds and four tenths of
                    a second.</p>
                <p part="N">The French mathematicians attempted, in the time of the Revolution, to
                    introduce a new unit for angles. They supposed a right angle to be divided into
                    100 equal parts, called degrees; and each degree to be subdivided into 100
                    minutes; and each minute into 100 seconds; and so on. This division, however,
                    was not adopted out of France. Unfortunately, Laplace had employed it in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic">Celeste,</hi> to the
                    inconvenience of its readers; but now the French mathematicians themselves have
                    almost all returned to the old sexagenary division.</p>
                <p part="N">220. Although an angle and a circle are not necessarily related, because
                    we can form a distinct notion of each independently of the other; yet there is
                    such an analogy between them, as to make it convenient to consider them
                    together. Therefore (Plate XVIII. fig. 23), let PO, QO, be straight lines which
                    contain an angle whose vertex is O. Let OQ, one of the lines, be given in
                    position, and let OE, a segment of the other line adjacent to O, be an <hi
                        rend="italic">invariable magnitude.</hi> Let us now suppose the line PO to
                    coincide at first with QO, and, departing from that position, to turn about O as
                    a centre: the line PO will now generate an angle POQ, and E, the extremity of
                    the constant radius, will describe an arc AE. When the line has made a complete
                    revolution about the centre O, it will have generated four right angles, and the
                    point E will have described a complete circle; and it is manifest that any angle
                    POQ will have the same ratio to four right angles that the arc AE has to the
                    whole circumference. Hence it follows that the arc may conveniently serve as a
                        <hi rend="italic">geometrical measure</hi> of the angle; and if we suppose
                    the circumference to be divided into 360 equal parts, called degrees, and each
                    of these to be subdivided into 60 minutes, and so on, then the angle and arc
                    will be expressed by the same number of degrees, minutes, &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">221. Let the diameters AC, BD, be perpendicular to each other. These
                    divide the circumference into four <hi rend="italic">quadrants,</hi> and the
                    circle into four regions AOB, BOC,</p>
                <p part="N">COD, DOA. The difference between an angle and a right angle, or between
                    an arc and a quadrant, is called the <hi rend="italic">complement</hi> of the
                    angle or arc; and the difference between an angle and two right angles, or
                    between an arc and a semicircle, is called the <hi rend="italic">supplement</hi>
                    of the angle or arc. Thus, the angle POB is the complement of POQ, and POC is
                    its supplement; and the arc BE is the complement of AE, and CE its
                    supplement.</p>
                <p part="N">222. Assuming A as the origin of the variable arc AE, a straight line
                    EF, drawn from its extremity E, perpendicular to the diameter AC, is called the
                        <hi rend="italic">sine</hi> of the arc AE; and a straight line EG, drawn
                    perpendicular to BD (which is the sine of the arc EB, the complement of AE), is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">cosine</hi> of the arc AE. Hence it appears that
                    the cosine of an arc is equal to the distance of the sine from the centre of the
                    circle.</p>
                <p part="N">223. Supposing now the arc AE to increase continually by the revolving
                    of the radius OE, departing from the position OA, and moving in the direction
                    ABCD, &amp;c. the sine EF, which at first is =0, will increase until the arc
                    become a quadrant; afterwards, while the arc increases from one to two
                    quadrants, the sine E'F' will decrease, and at last again become =0. The arc
                    continuing to increase, the sine will be reproduced; but its direction F"E" will
                    now be the opposite to its first direction FE. It will increase in magnitude,
                    until the arc become three quadrants AB CD; and it will again decrease, while
                    the arc is increasing from three to four quadrants: and when the radius has made
                    a complete revolution, the sine will have decreased to <hi rend="italic"
                        >zero.</hi> We may, however, suppose the revolving radius OE still to
                    proceed: there will thus be generated an arc, ABCDAE, greater than a complete
                    circumference, of which EF will be the sine; and, in the second and every
                    succeeding revolution, the sine will pass through the same changes as in the
                    first.</p>
                <p part="N">224. We may trace the changes in the magnitude and direction of the
                    cosine just in the same way. While the arc AE increases from zero to a quadrant,
                    the cosine OF, at first equal to the radius OA, decreases, and at last vanishes;
                    and while the arc continues to increase, and has any value ABE' between one and
                    two quadrants, the cosine OF' is reproduced, with a direction the opposite to
                    the first. When the arc is exactly two quadrants, the cosine becomes in
                    magnitude OC, equal to OA, but opposite in direction. The arc still increasing
                    to ACE", the cosine decreases to OF"; and when the arc becomes ABCD, three
                    quadrants, the cosine again becomes =0: between three and four quadrants the
                    cosine OF'" re-appears in its original direction; and when the revolution is
                    completed, the cosine acquires its first value OA. In a second revolution the
                    same changes are repeated, and so on continually.</p>
                <p part="N">We may suppose the radius to turn round O in the contrary direction ADC,
                    and the very same changes will be produced on the direction and magnitude of the
                    sine and cosine of the generated arc AE'".</p>
                <p part="N">225. In conformity to the principles of analytic geometry, the contrary
                    position of the arcs AE, AE', and the sines EF, E'F', in respect of the position
                    of the arcs AE", AE'", and the sines E"F", E'"F'", may be indicated by the signs
                    + and —; and the same is true of the cosines OF, OF'", which are opposed in
                    direction to the cosines OF', OF", the arcs and sines on opposite sides of the

                    being supposed in the cosines on opposite sides of the diameter BD, which is
                    perpendicular to AC. The arc AE being regarded as positive, it does not signify
                    whether we reckon the sines and cosines positive or negative in the beginning,

                    secant change their signs, after having become infinite, the tangent being now
                    negative, and the secant positive. When the circumference is completed, the

                    terms would be required to give the length of the quadrant true to twenty

                    of all methods, namely, the inscription and circumscription of polygons in and
                    about a circle. He so highly estimated this effort, that he directed the number
                    to be inscribed on his sepulchre, in imitation of the tomb of Archimedes, which
                    was inscribed with a sphere and cylinder; but, by methods which have been here
                    explained, it might have been accomplished with no great labour. De Lagny, a
                    Frenchman, carried the calculation, by an easier method, to 128 figures; and
                    Euler ascertained that his result could be verified with 80 hours’ labour. It is
                    said that the same important number has even been carried as far as 150 figures,

                    fast; for the tangent of the half of an arc being less than half the tangent of
                    the whole arc, as is easily proved, each term is less than one fourth of the
                    term before it. As, however, the series proceeds, the ratio of any two
                    consecutive terms approaches continually to that of 4 to 1; and hence any term
                    somewhat advanced in the series will be nearly three times the sum of all that
                    follow it; and, by this property, as soon as a term is found to be nearly one
                    fourth of that before it, one third of that term will give the sum of all that

                <p part="N">(sect. 238), we shall have 2 P cos. p</p>

                <p part="N">But since 17p = &lt;r, therefore cos. 2 <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = cos.
                    (w— 15p) = — cos. 15 p; cos. 4 <hi rend="italic">φ =</hi> cos. (w—13 p) = — cos.

                <p part="N">2Pcos. p=1—2 cos. 15p—2 cos.13p...—2 cos.3p-cos.p; or 2 P cos. p =1+cos.
                    p — 2 P, or 2 P (1 + cos. p)=1-J-cos. p, hence P=1-.</p>
                <p part="N">This being proved, we now divide the terms which compose P into two

                <p part="N">We have therefore <hi rend="italic">x-}-y = ⅛.</hi> We next multiply the

                        >y,</hi> and changing the products of cosines into the cosines of simple
                    arcs, we obtain, all reductions being made, <hi rend="italic">xy—</hi> 2 (cos.

                <p part="N">By these equations we obtain x=1 + ⅛√17, ^=⅜-⅛√17.</p>
                <p part="N">Now, if we divide anew the sums <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi

                <p part="N">Lastly, knowing cos.p + cos. 13 p = w, and cos. p cos. 13 p =∣(cos. 12p+
                    cos. 14p)= —⅜(cos.3p+cos. 5 p)=—∣s, we may obtain by a fourth equation of the
                    second degree the value of cos. p, and thence the side of the polygon, which is

                <p part="N">As to the method which has guided us in forming these equations, it
                    depends on a very delicate theory, founded on the Indeterminate Analysis. For
                    this we must refer to the work of Gauss, <hi rend="italic">Disquisitiones
