                    Mahomet, and one of his first converts. His original name was Abdulcaaba,
                    signifying <hi rend="italic">servant of the caaba</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >temple,</hi> which, after his conversion to Mahometanism, was changed to
                    Abdallah, <hi rend="italic">servant of God</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and on
                    the marriage of the prophet with his daughter Ayesha, he received the
                    appellation of Abu-Beer, <hi rend="italic">Father of the virgin.</hi>
                    Illustrious by his family, and possessed of immense wealth, his influence and
                    example were powerful means of propagating the faith he had adopted, and in
                    gaining converts to the new religion. Abubeker was a sound believer; and
                    although he lived in the greatest familiarity with Mahomet, he had always the
                    highest veneration for his character. He vouched for the truth of his
                    revelations after his nightly visits to heaven, and thus obtained the
                    appellation of the <hi rend="italic">faithful.</hi> He was employed in every
                    mission of trust or importance, was the constant friend of the prophet, and when
                    he was forced to fly from Mecca, was his only companion. But notwithstanding his
                    blind devotion to Mahometanism, his moderation and prudence were conspicuous in
                    checking the fanatical zeal of the disciples of the new religion on the death of
                    Mahomet. This event threatened destruction to the doctrines of Islamism. Its
                    followers could not doubt that it had taken place, and they were afraid to
                    believe it. In this uncertainty and fluctuation of belief, Omar drew his sword,
                    and threatened to cut in pieces all who dared to assert that the prophet was
                    dead. Abubeker, with more coolness and wisdom, addressed the people, <hi
                        rend="italic">Is it,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">Mahomet wham you adore,
                        or the God whom he has revealed to you</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Know that this God is alone immortal, and that all those whom
                        he has created are subject to death.</hi> Appeased and reconciled by this
                    speech, they elected him successor to Mahomet, and ţie assumed the modest title
                    of caliph, which has continued with all his successors. Ali, the son-in-law of
                    the prophet, regarding the elevation of Λbubeker as a violation of his legal
                    rights to the succession, refused at first to recognise the appointment, till he
                    was forced by threats into compliance and submission. His partisans, however,
                    still considered him as the legitimate successor, and their opinion has
                    prevailed among many Mussulmans, who believe that the sovereign authority, both
                    spiritual and temporal, remains with his descendants.</p>
                <p part="N">Abubeker first collected and digested the revelations of Mahomet, which
                    had hitherto been preserved in detached fragments, or in the memories of the
                    believers; and to this the Arabians gave the appellation <hi rend="italic"
                        >Almoshaf,</hi> or the Book. He died in the 13th year of the Hegira,
                    respected as a prudent and equitable ruler.</p>
