                    formed by the Almighty on the sixth day of the creation. His body was made of
                    the dust of the earth; after which, God animated or gave it life, and Adam then
                    became a rational creature. His heavenly Parent did not leave his offspring in a
                    destitute state to shift for himself, but planted a garden, in which he caused
                    to grow not only every tree that was proper for producing food, but likewise
                    such as were agreeable to the eye, or merely ornamental. In this garden were
                    assembled all the brute creation, and, by their Maker, caused to pass before
                    Adam, who gave all of them names, which were judged proper by the Deity
                    himself.</p>
                <p part="N">In this review Adam found none for a companion to himself. This solitary
                    state was seen by the Deity to be attended with some degree of unhappiness, and
                    therefore he threw Adam into a deep sleep, in which condition he took a rib from
                    his side, and, healing up the wound, formed a woman of the rib he had taken out.
                    On Adam’s awaking, the woman was brought to him; and he immediately knew her to
                    be one of his own species, calling her his bone and his flesh, and giving her
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">woman,</hi> because she was taken out of man.</p>
                <p part="N">The first pair being thus created, God gave them authority over the
                    inferior creation, commanding them to subdue the earth, also to increase and
                    multiply, and fill it They were informed of the proper food for the beasts and
                    for them; the grass or green herbs being appointed for beasts, and fruits or
                    seeds for man. Their proper employment also was assigned them; namely, <hi
                        rend="italic">to dress the garden and to keep it.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Though Adam was thus highly favoured and instructed by his Maker, there
                    was a single tree, which grew in the middle of the garden, of the fruit of which
                    they were not allowed to eat; being told that they should surely die in the day
                    they ate of it. This tree was named the <hi rend="italic">Tree oj tlιe Knowledge
                        of Good and Evil.</hi> This prohibition, however, they soon broke through.
                    The woman having entered into conversation with <hi rend="italic">the
                        Serpent,</hi> was by him persuaded, that by eating of the tree she should
                    become as wise as God himself; and accordingly, being invited by the beauty of
                    the fruit, and its desirable property of imparting wisdom, she plucked and ate;
                    giving her husband of it at the same time, who did likewise eat.</p>
                <p part="N">Before this transgression of the divine command, Adam and his wife had
                    no occasion for clothes, neither had they any sense of shame; but immediately on
                    eating the forbidden fruit, they were ashamed of being naked, and made aprons of
                    fig-leaves for themselves. On hearing the voice of God in the garden, they were
                    terrified, and hid themselves: but being questioned by the Deity, they confessed
                    what they had done, and received sentence accordingly; the man being condemned
                    to labour, the woman to subjection to her husband, and to pain in childbearing.
                    They were now driven out of the garden, and their access to it prevented by a
                    terrible apparition.</p>
                <p part="N">They had clothes given them by the Deity, made of the skins of beasts.
                    In this state Adam had several children: the names of only three of whom we are
                    acquainted with, viz. Cain, Abel, and Seth. He died at the age of 930 years.</p>
                <p part="N">These are all the particulars concerning Adam that we have on divine
                    authority; but there is a vast multitude oí others, all of them conjectural,
                    part of them downright falsehoods or absurdities. The curiosity of our readers,
                    it is presumed, will be sufficiently gratified by the few which are here
                    subjoined.</p>
                <p part="N">According to the Talmudists, when Adam was created, his body was of
                    immense magnitude. When he sinned, his stature was reduced to <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> hundred ells, according tc some; to nine hundred, cubits, according
                    to others; whc think this was done at the request of the angels, who were afraid
                    of so gigantic a creature.</p>
                <p part="N">According to the <hi rend="italic">revelations</hi> of the famous Madame
                    Bourignon, Adam before his fall possessed in himself the principles of both
                    sexes, and the virtue or power of producing his like without the concurrent
                    assistance of woman. The division into two sexes, she imagined,<note

                    Adam before he fell, with the manner how, by himself, he was capable of
                    procreating other men. “God,” says she, “represented to my mind the beauty of
                    the first world, and the manner how he had drawn it from the chaos: every thing
                    was bright, transparent, and darted forth life and ineffable glory. The body of
                    Adam was purer and more transparent than crystal, and vastly fleet; through his
                    body were seen vessels and rivulets of light, which penetrated from the inward
                    to the outward parts, through all his pores. In some vessels ran fluids of all
                    kinds and colours, vastly bright, and quite diaphanous. The most ravishing
                    harmony arose from every motion, and nothing, resisted or could annoy him. His
                    stature was taller than the present race of men; his hair was short, curled, and
                    of a colour inclining to black; his upper lip covered with short hair; and
                    instead of the bestial parts which modesty will not allow us to name, he was
                    fashioned as our bodies will be in the eternal life, which I know not whether I
                    dare reveal. In that <hi rend="italic">region</hi> his nose was formed after the
                    manner of a <hi rend="italic">face,</hi> which diffused the most delicious
                    fragrancy and perfumes; whence also men were to issue, all whose principles were
                    inherent in him; there being in his belly a vessel where little eggs were
                    formed, and a second vessel filled with a fluid which impregnated those eggs;
                    and when man heated himself in the love of God, the desire he had that other
                    creatures should exist beside himself, to praise and love God, caused the fluid
                    above mentioned (by means of the fire of the love of God) to drop on one or more
                    of these eggs, with inexpressible delight; which being thus impregnated, issued,
                    some time after, out of man by this canal,<note anchored="true" place="margin"

                    shape of an egg,, whence a perfect man was hatched by insensible degrees. Woman
                    was formed by taking out of Adam’s side the vessels that contained the eggs;
                    which she still possesses, as is discovered by anatomists.”</p>
                <p part="N">Many others have believed that Adam at his first creation was both male
                    and female; others, that he had two bodies joined together at the shoulders, and
                    their faces looking opposite ways, like those of Janus. Hence, say these, when
                    God created Eve, he had no more to do than to separate the two bodies from one
                    another. Of all others, however, the opinion of Paracelsus seems the most
                        ridiculous.<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                <p part="N">Extravagant things are asserted concerning Adam’s knowledge. Some
                    rabbis, indeed, have contented themselves with equalling it to that of Moses and
                    Solomon; but others have maintained that he excelled the angels themselves.
                    Several Christians seem to be little behind these Jews in the degree of
                    knowledge they ascribe to Adam; nothing being hid from him, according to them,
                    except contingent events relating to futurity. One writer indeed (Pinedo)
                    excepts politics; but a Carthusian friar, lιaving exhausted in favour of
                    Aristotle every image and comparison he could think of, at last asserted that
                    Aristotle’s knowledge was as extensive as that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adam.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In eonsequence of this surprising knowledge with which Adam was endued,
                    he is supposed to have been a considerable author. The Jews pretend that he
                    wrote a book on the Creation, and another on the Deity. Some rabbis ascribe the
                    92d psalm to him; and in some manuscripts the Chaldee title of this psalm
                    expressly declares that this is the song of praise which the first man repeated
                    for the Sabbath-day.</p>
                <p part="N">Strange stories are told concerning Adam’s children. That he had none in
                    the state of innocence, is certain from Scripture; but that his marriage with
                    Eve was not consummated till after the fall, cannot be proved from thence. Some
                    imagine, that, for many years after the fall, Adam denied himself the connubial
                    joys by way of penance; others, that he cohabited with another woman, whose name
                    was <hi rend="smallcaps">Lillith.</hi> The Mahometans tell us, that our first
                    parents having been thrown headlong from the celestial paradise, Adam fell upon
                    the isle of Ser-endib, or Ceylon, in the East Indies; and Eve on Iodda, a port
                    of the Red Sea, not far from Mecca. After a separation of upwards of 200 years,
                    they met in Ceylon, where they multiplied: according to some Eve had twenty,
                    according to others only eight deliveries; bringing forth at each time twins, a
                    male and a female, who afterwards married. The rabbis imagine that Eve brought
                    forth Cain and Abel at a birth; that Adam wept for Abel a hundred years in the
                    valley of tears near Hebron, during which time he did not cohabit with his wife;
                    and that this separation would probably have continued longer, had it not been
                    forbid by the angel Gabriel. The inhabitants of Ceylon affirm, that the salt
                    lake on the mountain of Colombo consists wholly of the tears which Eve for one
                    hundred years together shed because of Abel’s death.</p>
                <p part="N">Some of the Arabians tell us, that Adam was buried near Mecca, on Mount
                    Abukobeis; others, that Noah having laid his body in the ark, caused it to be
                    carried after the deluge to Jerusalem, by Melchizedek, the son of Shem: of this
                    opinion are the eastern Christians; but the Persians affirm that he was.interred
                    in the isle of Seren-dib, where his corpse was guarded by lions at the time the
                    giants warred upon one another. Some are of opinion that he was buried at
                    Jerusalem, on the place where Christ suffered, that so his bones might be
                    sprinkled with the Saviour’s blood.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Adam,</hi><hi rend="italic">Alexander,</hi> Rector
                    of the High School, Edinburgh, and author of several valuable works connected
                    with Roman literature, was born on the 24th of June 1741, on a small farm which
                    his father rented, not far from Forres, in Morayshire. He does not appear to
                    have received any powerful direction to literary pursuits, either from the
                    attainments of his parents or the ability of the parochial schoolmaster; but is
                    referable to a class of men, of which Scotland can produce a very honourable
                    list, whom the secret workings of a naturally active mind have raised above the
                    level of their associates, and urged on to distinction and usefulness under the
                    severest pressure of difficulties. The gentle treatment of an old schoolmistress
                    first taught him to like his book; and this propensity induced his parents to
                    consent that he should learn Latin. To the imperfect instruction which he
                    received at the parish school, he joined indefatigable study at home,
                    notwithstanding the scanty means and poor accommodation of his father’s house.
                    Before he was sixteen, he had read the whole of Livy, in a copy of the small
                    Elzevir edition, which he had borrowed from a neighbouring clergyman; omitting
                    for the present all such passages as his own sagacity and Cole’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> did not enable him to construe. It was before
                    day-break, during the mornings of winter, and by the light of splinters of
                    boxwood dug out of an adjoining moss, that he prosecuted the perusal of this
                    difficult classic; for, as the whole family were collected round the only fire
                    in the evening, he was prevented by the noise from reading with any advantage;
                    and the day-light was spent at school.</p>
                <p part="N">In the autumn of 1757, he was a competitor for one of those bursaries,
                    or small exhibitions, which are given by the university of Aberdeen to young men
                    who distinguish themselves for their classical attainments; but as the prize was
                    awarded to the best written exercises, and as Adam, with all his reading, had
                    not yet been accustomed to write <pb break="no"

                    foiled by some youth who had been more fortunate in his means of instruction.
                    About the same time Mr Watson, a relation of his mother’s, and one of the
                    ministers of the Canongate, sent him a tardy invitation to come to Edinburgh,
                    “provided he was prepared to endure every hardship for a season,”—a condition
                    not likely to appal one who yet knew nothing of life but its hardships. The
                    interest of Mr Watson procured him free admission to the lectures of the
                    different professors; and as he had now also access to books in the College
                    Library, his literary ardour made him submit with cheerfulness to the greatest
                    personal privations. Eighteen months of assiduous application enabled him to
                    repair the defects of his early tuition, and to obtain, after a. comparative
                    trial of candidates, the head mastership of the foundation known by the name of
                    Watson’s Hospital. At this period he was only nineteen, on which account the
                    governors of the institution limited the appointment to half a year; but his
                    steadiness and ability speedily removed their scruples. After holding the
                    situation for three years, he was induced, by the prospect of having more
                    leisure for the prosecution of his studies, to resign it, and become private
                    tutor to the son of Mr Kincaid, a wealthy citizen, and afterwards Lord Provost
                    of Edinburgh; and it was in consequence of this connection that he was
                    afterwards raised to the office for which he was so eminently qualified. He
                    taught in the High School, for the first time, in April 1765, as substitute for
                    Mr Matheson the rector; in consequence of whose growing infirmities, an
                    arrangement was made, by which he retired on a small annuity, to be paid from
                    the profits of the class; and Mr Adam was confirmed in the rectorship on the 8th
                    of June 1768.</p>
                <p part="N">From this period the history of his life is little more than the history
                    of his professional labours and of his literary productions. No sooner was he
                    invested with the office, than he gave himself up with entire devotion to the
                    business of his class, and the pursuits connected with it. For forty years his
                    day was divided with singular regularity between the public duties of teaching
                    and that unwearied research and industry in private which enabled him, amidst
                    the incessant occupation of a High School master’s life, to give to the world
                    such a number of accurate and laborious compilations. So entirely did these
                    objects of public utility engross his mind, that he mixed but little with
                    society, and considered every moment as lost that was not dedicated in some way
                    or other to the improvement of youth. Few men certainly could adopt, with more

                <p part="N">The rector’s class, which in the High School is the most advanced of
                    five, consisted of no more than between thirty and forty boys when Dr Adam was
                    appointed. His celebrity as a classical teacher, joined to the progress of the
                    country in wealth and population, continued to increase this number up to the
                    year of his death. His class-list for that year contained 167 names,—the largest
                    number that had ever been collected in one class, and, what is remarkable, equal
                    to the amount of the whole five classes during the year when he first taught in
                    the school.</p>
                <p part="N">He performed an essential service to the literature of his country by
                    introducing, in his own class, an additional hour of teaching for Greek and
                    Geography; neither of which branches seems to have been contemplated in the
                    original formation of the school. The introduction of Greek, which he effected a
                    year or two after his election,' was regarded by some professors of the
                    university as a dangerous innovation, and an unwarrantable encroachment on the
                    province of the Greek chair; and the measure was accordingly resisted (though,
                    it is satisfactory to think, unsuccessfully) by the united efforts of the
                    Senatus Academicus, in a petition and representation to the towncouncil, drawn
                    up and proposed by the celebrated Principal of the university, Dr Robertson.
                    This happened in 1772.</p>
                <p part="N">It is not possible for a man of principle and ordinary affections to be
                    occupied in training a large portion of the youth of his country to knowledge
                    and virtue, without feeling a deep responsibility, and a paramount interest in
                    their progress and welldoing. That such were Dr Adam's feelings is proved, not
                    less by the whole tenor of his life, than by his mode of conducting the business
                    of his class; by the free scope and decided support he gave to talent,
                    particularly when the possessor of it was poor and friendless; by the tender
                    concern with which he followed his pupils into life; and by a test not the least
                    unequivocal, the enthusiastic attachment and veneration which they entertain for
                    his memory. In his class-room, his manner, while it imposed respect, was kindly
                    and conciliating. He was fond of relieving the irksomeness of continued
                    attention by narrating curious facts and amusing anecdotes. In the latter part
                    of his life, he was perhaps too often the hero of his own tale; but there was
                    something amiable even in this weakness, which arose from the vanity of having
                    done much good, and was totally unmixed with any alloy of selfishness.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Adam’s first publication was his <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi>
                    which appeared in 1772. He had two principal objects in compiling it;—to combine
                    the study of English and Latin grammar, so that they might mutually illustrate
                    each other; and to supersede the preposterous method of teaching Latin by a
                    grammar composed in that language, and of overloading ţhe memory with rules in
                    Latin hexameters, for almost every fact and every anomaly in its grammatical
                    structure. The change he proposed, reasonable as it was, could not be effected
                    without running counter to confirmed prejudices, and interfering with
                    established books. Although, therefore, the grammar met with the approbation of
                    some eminently good judges, particularly of Bishop Lowth, the author had no
                    sooner adopted it in his own class, and recommended it to others, than a host of
                    enemies rose up against him, and he was involved in much altercation and
                    vexatious hostility with the towncouncil and the four under masters. Dr George
                    Stewart, then professor of humanity, was related to Ruddiman, whose grammar Dr
                    Adam’s was intended to supersede; and to this cause may be traced the
                    commencement of the determined opposition that was long made to any change. In
                    these squabbles, the acrimony displayed by some of his adversaries now and then
                    altered the natural suavity of Dr Adam’s temper; and his high notions of
                    independence, and contempt of presumptuous ignorance, led him perhaps to neglect
                    too much those easy arts of conciliation, which enable a man, without the
                    slightest compromise of his integrity, “to win his way by yielding to the
                    tide.”</p>
                <p part="N">His work on <hi rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</hi> was published in
                    1791, and has contributed, more than any of his other productions, to give him a
                    name as a classical scholar. Ţhe vast variety of matter, the minuteness and
                    accuracy of the details, the number and fidelity of the references, the constant
                    bearing the work has upon the classics, and the light it throws on them at every
                    step, were soon perceived and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031590?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0702-1590-0137"/>appreciated over the whole island. These solid
                    excellencies abundantly compensate for a eertain air of heaviness, and the
                    absence of the lighter graces of interesting style and manner. His reader
                    follows him as he would do a faithful guide, through a strange and difficult
                    country, with a feeling of perfect assurance that he will arrive at the end of
                    his journey, if not by the pleasantest road, at least by the most direct and
                    secure. The <hi rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</hi> is now adopted as a
                    elass-book in many of the English schools; and, even in those where the
                    influence of custom opposes innovation, iťis found in every master’s library,
                    and recommended by him to his advanced pupils for private reading and
                    reference.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1794 he published his <hi rend="italic">Summary of Geography and
                        History,</hi> in one thick 8vo volume of 900 pages, whieh had grown in his
                    hands to this size from a small treatise on the same subjeet, printed for the
                    use of his pupils in 1784. The object of this work was to connect the study of
                    the classics with that of general knowledge; and it accordingly contains a
                    curious compound of interesting matter, unwieldy as a school-book, and not
                    always arranged in the most luminous or engaging order, but valuable to the
                    young student for its succinet aceount of the first principles of astronomical,
                    mathematical, and physical science, and for the mass it eontains of geographical
                    and historical information, especially with regard to the fabulous ages of
                    antiquity.</p>
                <p part="N">His <hi rend="italic">Classical Biography,</hi> published in 1800, is
                    the least in request of all his works; a circumstance owing, perhaps, to the
                    more comprehensive and popular plan of Lempriere’s <hi rend="italic">Classical
                        Dictionary.</hi> It exhibits, however, ample proofs of well-directed
                    industry; and in the number and unfailing aecuraey of the references, furnishes
                    an excellent index to the best sources of information, even where the book
                    itself may be thought meagre and seanty.</p>
                <p part="N">His last work was his <hi rend="italic">Latin Dictionary,</hi> which
                    appeared in 1805, printed, like every other production of his pen, in the most
                    unassuming form, and with the utmost anxiety to condense the greatest quantity
                    of useful knowledge into the smallest bulk, and tifford it to the student at the
                    cheapest rate. It was intended chiefly for the use of schools, and to be
                    followed by a larger work, containing copious illustrations of every word in the
                    language. The character which he had aequired by his former works for patient
                    researeh and eorrect detail stamped a high and deserved authority on this book.
                    The clear aceount of the different meanings of words, the explanation of idioms,
                    and happy translation of difficult passages, which abound, particularly in the
                    latter half, are admirably well adapted to remove the difficulties of the
                    younger student, and render the work, notwithstanding the modesty of its
                    pretensions, equally valuable to the more advanced. It is much to be regretted
                    he did not live to complete his larger work on the extended scale on whieh the
                    latter part of the small one is executed. He had proeeeded as far as the word
                        <hi rend="italic">Comburo,</hi> with a plenitude of illustration that would
                    have made the work a treasure of Latinity, when he was seized in sehool with an
                    apoplectic affection; occasioned, perhaps, by the intenseness of his
                    applieation, and the small portion of sleep he allowed himself,—certainly not by
                    his mode of living, which was simple and abstemious to an extreme degree. He
                    lingered five days under the disease. Amidst the wanderings of mind that
                    accompanied it, he was constantly reverting to the business of the class, and
                    addressing his boys; and in the last hour of his life, as he faneied himself
                    examining on the lesson of the day, he stopped short, and said, “But it grows
                    dark, you may go and almost immediately expired. He died on the 18th of December
                    1809, at the age of 68.</p>
                <p part="N">The magistrates of Edinburgh, whose predecessors had not always been
                    alive to his merits, showed their respeeť for his memory by a public funeral. A
                    short time before his death, he was solicited by some of his old pupils to sit
                    to Mr Raeburn for his portrait, which was executed in the best style of that
                    eminent artist, and placed, as a memorial of their gratitude and respect, in the

                    where he became a firm Protestant, and was enabled to pursue his studies by the
                    liberality of a person of quality, who had left several exhibitions for young
                    students. He was appointed reetor of a college at Heidelberg, where he
                    published, in the year 1615, the first volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vitae</hi><hi rend="italic">Germanorum Philosophorum,</hi> &amp;c. This
                    volume, which treated of philosophers, poets, writers on polite literature, and
                    historians, &amp;e. was followed by three others: that whieh treated of divines
                    was printed in 1619; that of the lawyers came next; and, finally, that of the
                    physicians: the last two were published in 1620. All the learned men whose lives
                    are contained in these four volumes lived in the sixteenth or beginning of the
                    seventeenth eentury, and are either Germans or Flemings; but he published in
                    1618 the lives of twenty divines of other countries in a separate volume,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Decades duae,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    partial, and will not allow his work to be a proper standard of the learning of
                    Germany. He was the author of some other works of less consequenee than his
                    Lives. His industry as a biographer is eommended by Bayle, who acknowledges his
                    obligations to his labours. He died in 1622.</p>

                    architeet, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1728. He was the seeond son of
                    William Adam, Esq. of Maryburgh, in the eounty of Fife, who has also left some
                    respectable speeimens of his genius and abilities as an architect in
                    Hopetoun-house and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which were ereeted from
                    designs exeeuted by him. And it was perhaps owing to the fortunate eircumstanee
                    of his father’s example that young Adam first direeted his attention to those
                    studies, in the proseeution of whieh he afterwards rose to such distinguished
                    eelebrity. He received his education at the university of Edinburgh, where he
                    had an opportunity of improving and enlarging his mind, by the conversation and
                    acquaintance of some of the first literary characters of the age, who were then
                    rising into reputation, or have sinee established their fame as historians and
                    philosophers. Among these were Mr Hume, Dr Robertson, Dr Smith, and Dr Ferguson,
                    who were the friends and eompanions of the father, and who continued through
                    life their friendship and attachment to the son.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1754, Mr Adam travelled to the Continent, with a view to
                    extend his knowledge and improve his taste in architecture, and resided in Italy
                    for three years. Here he surveyed and studied those noble specimens of aneient
                    grandeur which the magnificent public edifiees of the Romans, even in ruins,
                    still exhibit. In tracing the progress of arehiteeture and the other fine arts
                    among the Romans, Mr Adam observed that they had visibly deelined <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193031603?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1603-0138"/>previously
                    to the time of Dioclesian; but he was also convinced that the liberal patronage
                    and munifieence of that emperor had revived, during his reign, a better taste
                    for architecture, and had formed artists who were capable of imitating the more
                    elegant style of a purer age. He had seen this remarkably exemplified in the
                    public baths at Rome, which were erected by him, the most entire and the noblest
                    of the aneient buildings. Admiring the extent and fertility of genius of the
                    artists from whose designs sueh magnificent structures had been executed, he was
                    anxious to see and study any remains that yet existed of those masters whose
                    works were striking monuments of an elegant and improved taste, but whose names,
                    amid the wrecks of time, have sunk into oblivion. It was with this view that he
                    undertook a voyage to Spalatro, in Dalmatia, to visit and examine the private
                    palaee of Dioele-sian, in which that emperor resided for nine years previous to
                    his death, and to which he retired in the year 305, when he resigned the
                    government of the empire. Mr Adam sailed from Veniee in July 1754, accompanied
                    by Μ. Clerisseau, a Freneh artist and antiquary, and two experienced
                    draughtsmen. On their arrival at Spalatro, they found, that though the palace
                    had suffered mueh from the injuries of time, yet it had sustained no less from
                    the dilapidations of the inhabitants to procure materials for building; and even
                    the foundations of the aneient structure were covered with modern houses. With
                    high expectations of suecess they commenced their labours, but were soon
                    interrupted by the jealous vigilanee of the government. Suspecting that their
                    objeet was to view and make plans of the fortifications, an immediate and
                    peremptory order was issued by the governor, commanding them to desist. This
                    order, however, was soon counteracted through the mediation of General Graeme,
                    the eonιmander-in-chief of the Venetian forces; and they were permitted to
                    proceed in their undertaking. They resumed their labours with double ardour, and
                    in five weeks finished plans and views of the fragments whieh remain, from which
                    they were enabled to execute perfect designs of the entire building.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Adam now returned to England, and soon rose to very considerable
                    professional eminenee. In 1762 he was appointed arehitect to the king; and the
                    year following he presented to the public the fruit of his voyage to Spalatro,
                    in a splendid work, containing engravings and descriptions of the ruins of the
                    palace. “For the account of Diocle-sian’s palace,” says Mr Gibbon, “we are
                    indebted to an ingenious artist of our own time and eountry, whom a very liberal
                    euriosity had carried into the heart of Dalmatia. But there is room to suspect
                    that the elegance of his designs and engravings has somewhat flattered the
                    objects which it was their purpose to represent. We are informed by a more
                    reeent and very judicious traveller, the Abbé Fortis, that the awful ruins of
                    Spalatro are not less expressive of the deeline of the arts than of the
                    greatness of the Roman empire in the time of Dioelesian.” Upon this we may
                    observe, that Mr Adam allows, that previously to this period of the Roman empire
                    the arts had visibly declined: and only contends, that the buildings erected in
                    the reign of Dioelesian exhibit convincing proofs of the style and manner of a
                    purer age.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1768, Mr Adam obtained a seat in parliament. He was ehosen
                    to represent the eounty of Kinross; and about the same time he resigned his
                    offiee of architect to the king. But he continued his professional career with
                    increasing reputation; and about the year 1773, in conjunction with his brother
                    James, who also rose to considerable eminence as an architect, he published
                    another splendid work, consisting of plans and elevations of public and private
                    buildings which were erected from their designs. Among these are, Lord
                    Mansfield's house at Caenwood; Luton-house in Bedfordshire, belonging to Lord
                    Bute; the new Gateway of the Admiralty' Office; the Register Office at
                    Edinburgh, &amp;c.; which are universally admired as precious monuments of
                    elegant design and eorreet taste. The Adelphi buildings at London, which are
                    also striking examples of the inventive genius of the Messrs Adam, proved an
                    unsuccessful speculation. The wealth and power of a nation only were equal to so
                    extensive an undertaking; it was too great to be attempted by private
                    citizens.</p>
                <p part="N">The buildings more lately ereeted from the designs of Mr Adam afford
                    additional proofs of his invention and skill. We may mention in particular the
                    Infirmary of Glasgow, as exhibiting the most perfect symmetry and useful
                    disposition of parts, combined with great beauty and lightness.</p>
                <p part="N">To the last period of his life Mr Adam displayed an increasing vigour of
                    genius and refinement of taste; for, in the space of one year preceding his
                    death, he designed eight great public works, besides twenty-five private
                    buildings, so various in their style and beautiful in their composition, that
                    they have been allowed, by the best judges, sufficient of themselves to
                    establish his fame. The improved taste whieh now pretty generally prevails in
                    our public and private edifices, undoubtedly owes much to the elegant and
                    correct style introduced by this distinguished artist.</p>
                <p part="N">He died on the 3d of March 1792, by the bursting of a blood-vessel, in
                    the 64th year of his age, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The natural
                    suavity of his manners, joined to the excellence of his moral charaeter, secured
                    to him the affectionate regard of his friends,« and the esteem of all who
                    enjoyed his acquaintance. James Adam, already mentioned as associated with his
                    brother in many of his labours, died on the 20th October 1794.</p>
