                    of the house of Al Abbas, succeeded his brother Abul Abbas Al Saffah in the year
                    753, of the Hegira 136, and in the following year was inaugurated at Al
                    Hashemiyah. Although Al Saffah had declared him presumptive heir of the crown,
                    and he had been proclaimed caliph in the imperial city of Anbar, yet immediately
                    upon his inauguration his uncle Abdallah ebn Ali had sufficient interest to
                    cause himself to be proclaimed caliph at Damascus. In Arabia, Syria, and
                    Mesopotamia, he collected a numerous army, and arrived at the banks of the
                    Masius, near Nisibis, where he encamped, ready to dispute his royal accession by
                    arms. Almansor collected an immense army in Persia, Chorasan, and Irak, and gave
                    the command of it to Abu Moslem, who harassed his uncle’s troops for five
                    months, and at last totally defeated him, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 754.
                    Notwithstanding the services which Abu Moslem had rendered to the family of Al
                    Abbas, after this victory he became an object of jealousy, and was assassinated
                    in the presence of Al-mansor himself, by his express order. After the death of
                    Abu Moslem, the standard of rebellion was raised by Simon, a Magian, who seized
                    on the treasures of the deceased governor of Chorasan, and excited the people of
                    that country to a general revolt; but this insurrection was suddenly quelled by
                    the general of Almansor, Jamhur ebn Morad. The caliph avariciously seized the
                    spoils of this victory, which so incensed Jamhur that he immediately turned his
                    arms against his royal master; but he was soon defeated by the caliph’s forces.
                    The patriarch of Antioch was about this time detected in an illicit
                    correspondence with the Grecian emperor, and consequently was banished into an
                    obscure part of Palestine; and in the mean time the Christians in the dominions
                    of the caliph were prohibited from building or repairing any churches, and also
                    were laid under several other severe restraints.</p>
                <p part="N">Almansor sent a large army into Cappadocia in the year 757, fortified
                    the city of Malatia or Melitene, and deposited in it a great part of his
                    treasures. But in this year he was attacked by a sect of believers in the
                    metempsychosis, called the <hi rend="italic">Rawandians.</hi> This sect
                    assembled at Al Hashemiyah, the residence of the caliph, and, by the ceremony of
                    going in procession round his palace, intimated their purpose of invoking him as
                    a deity, and paying him divine homage. Incensed by their impiety, the caliph
                    ordered several of these sectaries to be imprisoned, which roused their
                    resentment, and led them to form the design of his assassination. The generous
                    interposition of Maan ebn Zaidet, an Ommiyan chief, who had been under the
                    necessity of concealing himself from the caliph’s resentment, however, defeated
                    their intention. This insult, received in his capital, induced him to build the
                    city of Bagdad, and to fix his residence there, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi>
                    762. In the preceding year a plan was formed to dethrone him; but it being
                    discovered, he severely punished all who were either directly or indirectly
                    concerned in it. He set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca in the year 774, and being
                    seized on the road with a dangerous disease, he sent for his son and intended
                    successor Al Mohdi, and gave him some salutary advice. “I command you,” said he,
                    « to treat publicly your relations with the greatest marks of distinction, since
                    this conduct will reflect no small degree of honour and glory upon yourself.
                    Increase the number of your freedmen, and treat them with all kindness, as they
                    will be of great service to you in your adversity; but neither this nor the
                    other injunction will you fulfil. Enlarge not that part of your capital erected
                    on the eastern bank of the Tigris, as you will never be able to finish it; but
                    this work I know you will attempt. Never permit any of your women to
                    intermed'dle in affairs of state, or to have any influence over your councils;
                    but this advice I know you will not take. These are my last commands; or, if you
                    please, my dying advice; and to God I now recommend you.” In parting they both
                    gave vent to their feelings in a flood of tears. He pursued his journey to
                    Bir-Maimun, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the well of Maimun, where he died in
                    the 63d year of his age and 20th of his reign. His remains were interred at
                    Mecca.</p>
