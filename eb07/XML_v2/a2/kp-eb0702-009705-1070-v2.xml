                        rend="italic">Telescopes</hi> are telescopes contrived to remedy the
                    aberrations in colours. The invention of the telescope, by which the powers of
                    vision are extended to the utmost boundaries of space, forms an epoch in the
                    history of science. The human intellect had at last emerged from the long night
                    of error, and begun to shine with unclouded lustre. The age of erudition, which
                    arose on the revival of letters, had been succeeded by the age of science and
                    philosophy. The study of the ancient classics had infused some portion of taste
                    and vigour. But men did not long remain passive admirers; they began to feel
                    their native strength, and hastened to exert it. A new impulsion was given to
                    the whole frame of society; the bolder spirits, bursting from the trammels of
                    authority, ventured to question inveterate opinions, and to explore, with a
                    fearless yet discerning eye, the wide fields of human knowledge. Copernicus had
                    partly restored the true system of the world; Stevinus had extended the
                    principles of mechanics; the fine genius of Galileo had detected and applied the
                    laws of motion; the bold excursive imagination of Kepler had, by the aid of
                    immense labour, nearly completed his discovery of the great laws which control
                    the revolutions of the heavenly bodies; and our countryman Napier had just
                    rendered himself immortal by the sublime discovery of logarithms. At this
                    eventful period, amidst the fermentation of talents, the refracting telescope
                    was produced by an obscure glassgrinder in Holland,—a country then fresh from
                    the struggle against foreign oppression, and become the busy seat of commerce
                    and of the useful arts. Yet the very name of that meritorious person, and the
                    details connected with his invention, are involved in much obscurity. On a
                    question of such peculiar interest we shall afterwards endeavour to throw some
                    light, by comparing together such incidental notices as have been transmitted by
                    contemporary writers. In the mean time, we may rest assured that the
                    construction of the telescope was not, as certain authors would insinuate, the
                    mere offspring of chance, but was, like other scientific discoveries, the fruit
                    of close and patient observation of facts, directed with skill, and incited by
                    an ardent curiosity. A new and perhaps incidental <pb break="no"

                    which would pass unheeded by the ordinary spectator, arrests the glance of
                    genius, and sets all the powers of fancy to work. But the inventor of the
                    telescope, we are informed, was acquainted besides with the elements of
                    geometry, which enabled him to prosecute his views, and to combine the results
                    with unerring success. No sooner was this fine discovery—admirable for the very
                    simplicity of its principle—whispered abroad, than it fixed the attention of the
                    chief mathematicians over Europe. Kepler, with his usual fertility'of mind,
                    produced a treatise on <hi rend="italic">Dioptrics,</hi> in which he
                    investigated at large the distinct effects of the combinations of different
                        lenses.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >Kepler explained the construction of the astronomical telescope with
                            two convex lenses; he likewise proposed a third glass to restore the
                            inverted image. But Scheiner first employed the astronomical telescope,
                            and described his observations with it in 1630. Father Rheita placed the
                            third lens of Kepler near the primary focus, and thus enlarged the field
                            of view. Such is the arrangement in the common spy-glass, which he gave
                            in 1665.</p></note> Galileo, from some very obscure hints, not only
                    divined the composition of the telescope, but actually constructed one, with a
                    concave eye-glass, which still bears his name. This telescope is shorter, but
                    gives less light than another one proposed by Kepler, and called the
                    astronomical telescope, which inverts the objects, and consists likewise of only
                    two lenses, that next the eye being convex. With such an imperfect
                    instrument—the same, indeed, though of rather higher magnifying power, with our
                    modern opera-glass—did the Tuscan artist, as our great poet quaintly styles the
                    philosopher, venture to explore the heavens.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    moon, observed the successive phases of the planet Venus, and discovered the
                    more conspicuous of Jupiter’s satellites. The truths thus revealed shook the
                    inveterate prejudices of the learned, and furnished the most triumphant evidence
                    to the true theory of the universe.</p>
                <p part="N">It is painful to remark, that the application of the first telescope in
                    the country which had given it birth was directed to a very different purpose.
                    The maker, after having finished one, judging it of singular use in the military
                    profession, was naturally induced, by the hope of patronage, to present it to
                    the younger Prince Maurice, whose bravery and conduct had so beneficially
                    contributed to the independence of the United Provinces. But at this moment a
                    bloody tragedy was acting in Holland. The chief of the republic, not content
                    with that high station which the gratitude of his fellow-citizens had conferred
                    upon him, sought to aggrandize his power by crushing all opposition. In the
                    prosecution of his ambitions designs, he artfully gained the favour of the
                    undiscerning populace, and joining his intrigues ťo the violence of the
                    Calvinistic clergy, he succeeded in preferring the charge of a plot against the
                    more strenuous supporters of the commonwealth, which involved them in ruin. Not
                    only was the celebrated Grotius condemned to the gloom of perpetual
                    imprisonment, but the aged senator Bameveldt, whose wise and upright counsels
                    had guided the state amidst all the troubles of a long revolutionary conflict,
                    was led to the scaffold, on the 14th of May 1619, while his persecutor, ashamed
                    to approach the spectacle of his sufferings, beheld at a distance, with the
                    coolness of a tyrant, from the windows of his palace, and <hi rend="italic">by

                            the telescope, from the mystery at first practised, iş involved in
                            considerable uncertainty. The most probable statement, however, ascribes
                            the invention so early as 1590 to Zachary Jansen, an intelligent
                            spectacle-maker at Middleburg. This intelligent person, led by accident
                            to exercise his ingenuity on the subject, appears to have in private
                            matured the execution of that wonderful though simple instrument. In a
                            short time, however, the secret had transpired; and Laprey or
                            Lippersheim, a townsman of the same profession, produced telescopes for
                            sale between the years 1600 and 1610. But, in 1608, Jansen likewise
                            constructed the compound microscope; and both instruments, by the
                            activity of trade, were now spread quickly over Europe. The telescope
                            was copied, and perhaps improved, by Adrian Metius, son of the
                            celebrated mathematician. It was publicly sold at Frankfort in 1608, and
                            in the following year the instruments were brought by Drebbel for sale
                            to London.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">The skill and ingenuity of artists and mathematicians were now exerted
                    in attempts to improve the construction of an instrument so fortunately
                    contrived. The perfection of the telescope would require the union, as far as
                    they are capable of being conjoined, of three differ ent qualities,—
                    distinctness of vision, depth of magnifying power, and extent of field. Of these
                    requisites, the first two are evidently the most important, and to attain them
                    was an object of persevering research. For the condition of amplitude and
                    clearness, it was necessary that the principal image, or the one formed by the
                    eye-glass, should be large, bright, and well defined. On the supposition then
                    generally received, that, in the passage of light through the same media, the
                    angle of incidence bears a constant, ratio to the angle of refraction, which is
                    very nearly true in the case of small angles, it followed, as a geometrical
                    consequence, that the spherical figure would accurately collect all the rays
                    into a focus. To obtain the desired improvement of the telescope, therefore,
                    nothing seemed to be wanting but to enlarge sufficiently its aperture, or to
                    employ for the eye-glass a more considerable segment of the sphere. On trial,
                    however, the results appeared to be at variance with the hasty deductions of
                    theory, and every sensible enlargement of aperture was found to occasion a
                    corresponding glare and indistinctness of vision. But a discovery made soon
                    afterwards in optics led to more accurate conclusions. Willebrord Snell, a very
                    ingenious Dutch mathematician, who was snatched away at an early age, traced out
                    by experiment, about the year 1629, the true law that connects the angles of
                    incidence and of refraction; which the famous Descartes, who had about this time
                    chosen Holland for his place of residence, published, in 1637, in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Dioptrics,</hi> under its simplest form, establishing, that
                    the sines of those angles, and not the angles themselves, bore a constant ratio
                    in the transit of light between the same diaphanous media. It hence followed,
                    that the lateral rays of the light which enter a denser medium, bounded by a
                    spherical surface, in the direction of the axis, will not meet this axis
                    precisely in the same point, but will cross it somewhat nearer the surface. In
                    short, the constant ratio or index of refraction will be that of the distances
                    of the actual focus from the centre of the sphere, and from the point of
                    external impact. Since an arc differs from its sine by a quantity nearly
                    proportioned to its cube, the deviation of the extreme rays from the correct
                    focus, or what is called the spherical aberration, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193031096?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1096-0099"/>must
                    likewise proceed in that ratio, and consequently will increase with extreme
                    rapidity, as the aperture of the <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> telescope is
                    enlarged. It was now attempted to modify the figure of the object-glass, and to
                    give it those curved surfaces which an intricate geometrical investigation marks
                    out as fitted to procure a perfect concentration of all the refracted rays.
                    Various contrivances were accordingly proposed for assisting the artist in
                    working the lenses into a parabolic or spheroidal shape, and thus obtaining the
                    exact surfaces generated by the revolution of the different conic sections. All
                    those expedients and directions, however, were found utterly to fail in
                    practice, and nature seemed, in this instance, to oppose insurmountable barriers
                    to human curiosity and research. Philosophers began to despair of effecting any
                    capital improvement in dioptrical instruments, and turned their views to the
                    construction of those depending on the principles of catoptrics, or formed by
                    certain combinations o,f reflecting specula. In 1663, the famous James Gregory,
                    who in many respects may be regarded as the precursor, and in some things even
                    the rival of Newton, published his <hi rend="italic">Optica</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Promota</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a work distinguished by
                    its originality, and containing much ingenious research and fine speculation. In
                    this treatise, a complete description is given of the reflecting telescope now
                    almost universally adopted, consisting of a large perforated concave reflector
                    combined with another very small and deep speculum placed before the principal
                    focus. But such was still the low state of the mechanical arts in England, that
                    no person was found capable of casting and polishing the metallic specula with
                    any tolerable delicacy, and the great inventor never enjoyed the satisfaction
                    and transport of witnessing the magic of his admirable contrivance. It was after
                    the lapse of more than half a century, that Hadley—to whom we likewise owe
                    another instrument scarcely less valuable, the quadrant, or sextant, known by
                    his name—at last succeeded in executing the reflecting telescope. In the first
                    attempt, silvered mirrors had been substituted for the specula; nor did the
                    reflectors come to obtain much estimation, till, about the year 1733, the
                    ingenious Mr Short distinguished himself by constructing them in a style of very
                    superior excellence.</p>
                <p part="N">But though thus late in guiding the efforts of artists, the optical
                    treatise of Gregory proved the harbinger of that bright day which soon arose to
                    illumine the recesses of physical science. The capacious mind of Newton, nursed
                    in the calm of retirement and seclusion, was then teeming with philosophical
                    projects. In 1665, when the tremendous visitation of the plague raged in London,
                    and threatened Cambridge and other places communicating with the capital, this
                    sublime genius withdrew from the routine of the university to his rural farm
                    near Grantham, and devoted himself to most profound meditation. Amidst his
                    speculations in abstruse mathematics and theoretical astronomy, Newton was
                    induced to examine the opinions entertained by the learned on the subject of
                    light and colours. With this view he had recently procured from the Continent
                    some prisms of glass, to exhibit the phenomena of refraction. Having placed the
                    axis of the prism or glass wedge at right angles to a pencil of light from the
                    sun, admitted through a small hole of the window-shutter in a darkened room, he
                    contemplated the glowing image or spectrum now formed on the opposite wall or
                    screen. This illuminated space was not round, however, as the young philosopher
                    had been taught to expect, but appeared very much elongated, stretching out five
                    times more than its breadth, and marked by a series of pure and brilliant
                    colours. It was therefore obvious that the colours were not confined to the
                    margin of the spectrum, nor could proceed from any varied intermixture of light
                    and shade; and the conclusion seemed hence irresistible, that the white pencil,
                    or solar beam, is really a collection of distinct rays, essentially coloured and
                    differently refracted; that the ray, for instance, which gives us the sensation
                    of the violet, is always more bent aside from its course by refraction than the
                    ray which we term green,—and that this green ray again is more refracted than
                    the red. When the spectrum was divided, by interposing partially a small screen,
                    and each separate parcel of rays made to pass through a second prism, they,
                    still retained their peculiar colour and refractive property, but now emerged in
                    parallel, and not in diverging lines as at first. The sun’s light is thus
                    decomposed by the action of the prism into a set of primary coloured rays; and
                    these rays, if they be afterwards recombined in the same proportions, will
                    always form a white pencil. It was hence easy to discern the real cause of the
                    imperfection of dioptrical instruments, which is comparatively little influenced
                    by the figure of the object-glass or spherical aberration, but proceeds mainly
                    from the unequal refraction of light itself. The focal distance of the red ray
                    being, in the most favourable case, about one fortieth part shorter than that of
                    the violet ray, the principal image is necessarily affected with mistiness, and
                    its margin always encircled by a coloured ring; for each point of the remote
                    object from which the light arrives is not represented by a corresponding point
                    in the image, but by a small circle composed of graduating colours, the centre
                    being violet and the circumference red. This radical defect seemed at that time
                    to be altogether irremediable. Newton had recourse, therefore, to the aid of
                    catoptrics, and contrived his very simple though rather incommodious reflecting
                    telescope, consisting of a concave speculum, with a small plane one placed
                    obliquely before it, to throw the image towards the side of the tube. This
                    instrument he actually constructed; and with all its rudeness, it promised
                    essential advantages to astronomy. The Newtonian reflector, after having been
                    long neglected, was lately revived by Dr Herschel; and from its great simplicity
                    and moderate dissipation of light, it is perhaps on the whole not ill calculated
                    for celestial observations.</p>
                <p part="N">These unexpected and very important discoveries, which entirely changed
                    the face of optics, were soon communicated to the Royal Society, and published
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1672. They were not
                    received however by the learned with that admiration to which they were justly
                    entitled, but gave occasion to so much ignorant opposition and obstinate
                    controversy, that the illustrious author, thoroughly disgusted at such unmerited
                    reception, henceforth, pursuing his experimental researches in silence, made no
                    disclosure of them to the world till more than thirty years afterwards, when his
                    fame being mature, and his authority commanding respect, he suffered his <hi
                        rend="italic">Treatise on Optics</hi> to appear abroad. This celebrated
                    production has long been regarded as a model of pure inductive science. The
                    experiments which it relates appear ingeniously · devised; the conclusions from
                    them are drawn with acuteness, and pursued with exquisite skill; and the whole
                    discourse proceeds in a style of measured and elegant simplicity. Though the
                    researches were conducted by a process of strict analysis, the composition of
                    the work itself is cast into the synthetical or didactic form, after the manner
                    followed in the elementary treatises of the ancient mathematicians. But with all
                    its beauty and undisputed excellence, it must be confessed that the treatise of
                    optics is not exempt from faults, and even material errors. We should betray the
                    interests of science, if we ever yielded implicit confidence even to the highest
                    master. It is the glory of Newton to have led the way in sublime discovery, and
                    to have impressed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031109?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0702-1109-0100"/> whatever he touched with the stamp of
                    profound and original genius. The philosopher paid the debt of human infirmity,
                    by imbibing some tincture of the mystical spirit of the age, and taking a slight
                    bias from the character of his studies. The difficult art of experimenting was
                    still in its infancy, and inquirers had not attained that delicacy and
                    circumspection which, in practice, are indispensable for obtaining accurate
                    results. Most of the speculations in the second and third books of Newton’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Optics,</hi> as we shall afterwards have occasion to observe,
                    are built on mistaken or imperfect views of some facts, which the admixture of
                    extraneous circumstances had accidentally disguised. The very ingenious, but
                    hasty, and often untenable hypotheses, which are subjoined, under the modest and
                    seemingly hesitating title of <hi rend="italic">Queries,</hi> have, on the
                    whole, been productive of real harm to the cause oí science, by the splendid
                    example thus held forth to tempt the rashness of loose experimenters, and of
                    superficial reasoners. Even in the first book of <hi rend="italic">Optics,</hi>
                    some of the capital propositions are affected by hasty and imperfect statements.
                    The term <hi rend="italic">τefrangibility,</hi> applied to the rays of light, is
                    at least unguarded; it conveys an indistinct conception, and leads to inaccurate
                    conclusions. The different refractions which the primary rays undergo are not
                    absolute properties inherent in these rays themselves, but depend on the mutual
                    relation subsisting between them and the particular diaphanous medium. When the
                    medium is changed, the refraction of one set of rays cannot be safely inferred
                    from that of another. Nay, in the passage among certain media, those rays which
                    are designated as the most refrangible will sometimes be the least refracted. To
                    ascertain correctly, therefore, the index of refraction, it becomes necessary,
                    in each distinct case, to examine the bearing or disposition of the particular
                    species of rays; since the principle, that the refraction of the extreme rays is
                    always proportioned to that of the mean rays, involves a very false
                    conclusion.</p>
                <p part="N">When Newton attempted to reckon up the rays of light decomposed by the
                    prism, and ventured to assign the famous number <hi rend="italic">seven,</hi> he
                    was apparently influenced by some lurking disposition towards mysticism. If any
                    unprejudiced person will fairly repeat the experiment, he must soon be
                    convinced, that the various coloured spaces which paint the spectrum slide into
                    each other by indefinite shadings; he may name four or five principal colours,
                    but the subordinate divisions are evidently so multiplied as to be incapable of
                    enumeration. The same illustrious mathematician, we can hardly doubt,’ was
                    betrayed by a passion for analogy, when he imagined, that the primary colours
                    are distributed over the spectrum after the proportions of the diatonic scale of
                    music, since those intermediate spaces have really no precise and defined
                    limits. Had prisms of a different kind of glass been used, the distribution of
                    the coloured spaces would have been materially changed. The fact is, that all
                    Newton’s prisms being manufactured abroad, consisted of plate or crown glass,
                    formed by the combination of soda, or the mineral alkali, with silicious sand.
                    The refined art of glass-making had only been lately introduced into England,
                    and that beautiful variety called crystal, or flint-glass, which has so long
                    distinguished this country, being produced by the union of a silicious material
                    with the oxyde of lead, was then scarcely known. The original experimenter had
                    not the advantage, therefore, of witnessing the varied effects occasioned by
                    different prisms, which demonstrate, that the power of refraction is not less a
                    property of the peculiar medium than of the species of light itself. He
                    mentions, indeed, prisms formed with water confined by plates of glass; but the
                    few trials which he made with them had evidently been performed with no
                    sufficient attention. In spite of his habitual circumspection, he could not
                    always restrain the propensity so natural to genius, that of hastening to the
                    result, and of trusting to' general principles more than to any particular
                    details. But the same indulgent apology will not be conceded to some later
                    authors. It is truly astonishing that systematic writers on optics, in obvious
                    contradiction to the most undoubted discoveries related by themselves, should
                    yet repeat with complacency the fanciful idea of the harmonical composition of
                    light.</p>
                <p part="N">Admitting the general conclusion which Newton conceived himself entitled
                    to draw from analogy and concurring experiment, that “the sine of incidence of
                    every ray considered apart, is to the sine of refraction in a given ratio it was
                    strictly demonstrable, that no contrary refractions whatever, unless they
                    absolutely restored the pencil to its first direction, could collect again the
                    extreme rays, and produce, by their union, a white light. Thus, let the ratios
                    of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction of the violet rays in
                    their transit from air to other two denser mediums, be expressed by 1: <hi
                        rend="italic">M</hi> and 1: w; and the like ratios of the red rays under the
                    same circumstances, by 1: <hi rend="italic">N</hi> and 1: <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi>; where <hi rend="italic">M</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">N n</hi> respectively denote the refracting indices of those
                    extreme rays. It is manifest that the refracting indices, corresponding to the
                    passage of the violet and red rays from the first to the second medium, will be
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">M-N,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rn-η.</hi> But
                    by hypothesis, <hi rend="italic">M</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >m</hi><hi rend="italic">::</hi><hi rend="italic">N</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        >:</hi><hi rend="italic">m-n</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that the
                    extreme rays would not be still separated and dispersed in proportion to the
                    mean extent of the final refraction. The great philosopher appears to have
                    contemplated with regret the result of his optical principle; and he had the
                    penetration to remark, that if a different law had obtained, the proper
                    combination of distinct refracting media would have corrected the spherical
                    aberration. With this view, he would propose for the objectglass of a telescope,
                    a compound lens, consisting of two exterior meniscuses of glass, their outsides
                    being equally convex, and their insides of similar but greater concavity, and
                    having the interior space filled with pure water, as in the figure annexed. He
                    gives a rule, though without demonstration, and evidently disfigured or im
                    perfect, for determining the curvature of the two surfaces: “And by this means,”
                    he subjoins, “might telescopes be brought to sufficient perfection, were it not
                    for the different refrangibility of several sorts of rays. But, by reason of
                    this different refrangibility, I do not see any other means of improving
                    telescopes by refractions alone, than that of increasing their lengths.”</p>
                <p part="N">These remarks appeared to preclude all attempts to improve the
                    construction of the refracting telescope. Brightness and range of sight were
                    sacrificed to distinctness. Instead of enlarging the aperture, recourse was had
                    to the expedient of increasing the length of the focus. For nice astronomical
                    observations, telescopes were sought of the highest magnifying powers, and their
                    tubes had by degrees been extended to a most enormous and inconvenient size. But
                    the famous Dutch mathematician Huygens contrived to supersede the use of these
                    in certain cases, by a method which required, however, some address. Many years
                    afterwards the reflecting, or rather catadioptric telescope, of the Gregorian
                    construction, was executed with tolerable perfection. But a long period of
                    languor succeeded the brilliant age of discovery. Not a single advance was made
                    in the science of light and colours, till thirty years after the death of <pb

                            to this remark. It belongs more to astronomy than to optics, and is
                            indeed merely the result, however important, of the progressive motion
                            of light, detected near sixty years before by the Danish philosopher
                            Roemer, combined with the revolution of the earth in her

                    acquiescence. This memorable fact not only evinces the danger of yielding, in
                    matters of science, implicit confidence even to the highest authority, but
                    shows, amidst all the apparent bustle of research, how very few original
                    experiments are made, and how seldom these are repeated with the due care and
                    attention.</p>
                <p part="N">The impossibility of correcting the colours in objectglasses of
                    telescopes was therefore a principle generally adopted; though some vague hopes,
                    grounded chiefly on the consideration of final causes, were still at times
                    entertained of removing that defect. As the eye consists of two distinct
                    humours, with a horny lens or cornea interposed, it was naturally imagined that
                    such a perfect structure should be imitated in the composition of glasses. This
                    inviting idea is concisely mentioned by David Gregory, the nephew of James, in
                    his little tract on <hi rend="italic">Dioptrics.</hi> It has also been stated
                    that a country gentleman, Mr Hall of Chesterhall, in Worcestershire, discovered,
                    about the year 1729, the proper composition of lenses by the united segments of
                    crown and flint-glass, and caused a London artist, in 1733, to make a telescope
                    under his directions, which was found on trial to answer extremely well. But
                    whatever might be the fact, no notice was taken of it at the time, nor indeed
                    till very long after, when circumstances had occurred to call forth public
                    attention.</p>
                <p part="N">The Newtonian principle was first openly rejected, and a discussion
                    excited, which eventually led to a most valuable discovery in optics, by a
                    foreign mathematician of great celebrity and transcendent talents. Leonard Euler
                    was one of those rare mortals who arise, at distant intervals, to shed unfading
                    lustre on our species. ∙ Endowed with a penetrating genius and profound
                    capacity, he was capable of pursuing his abstruse investigations with
                    unremitting ardour and unwearied perseverance. To him the modern analysis stands
                    chiefly indebted for its prodigious extension; and he continued to enrich it in
                    all its departments with innumerable improvements and fine discoveries, during
                    the whole course of a most active, laborious, ιnd protracted life. Unfortunately
                    the philosophical character of Euler did not correspond to his superlative
                    emi-aence as a geometer. Bred in the school of Leibnitz, he had imbibed the
                    specious but delusive metaphysics of the <hi rend="italic">sufficient
                        reason,</hi> and of the necessary and absolute constitution of the laws of
                    nature. He was hence disposed in all cases to prefer the mode of investigating
                        <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> md never appeared to hold in due estimation
                    the humbler fet only safe road to physical science, by the method of experiment
                    and induction. Euler expressed the indices ĵf refraction by the powers of a
                    certain invariable root, ιnd fancied that the exponents of those powers are
                    proportional for the several rays in different media. Instead )f making, in
                    short, the numbers themselves proportional, is Newton had done, he assigned this
                    property to their ogarithms. In the <hi rend="italic">Berlin Memoirs</hi> for
                    1747, he inserted I short paper, in which he deducted from his optical
                    principle, by a clear analytical process, conducted with his ιsual skill, the
                    composition of a lens formed after certain emportions with glass and water,
                    which should remove entirely all extraneous colours, whether occasioned by the
                    rnequal refraction of the several rays, or by spherical aberration; and in
                    concluding, he remarked, with high satisfaction, the general conformity of his
                    results with the wonderful structure of the eye.</p>
                <p part="N">But this paper met with opposition in a quarter where it could have been
                    least expected. John Dolland, who had afterwards the honour of completing one of
                    the finest and most valuable discoveries in the science of optics, was born in
                    1706, in Spitalfields, of French parents, whom the revocation of the edict of
                    Nantes had compelled tc take refuge in England, from the cruel persecution of a
                    bigoted and tyrannical court. Following his father’s occupation, that of a
                    silk-weaver, he married at an early age; and being fond of reading, he dedicated
                    his leisure moments to the acquisition of knowledge. By dint of solitary
                    application, he made some progress in the learned languages; but he devoted his
                    main attention to the study of geometry and algebra, and the more attractive
                    parts oi mixed or practical mathematics. He gave instructions in these branches
                    to his son Peter, who, though bred to the hereditary profession, soon quitted
                    that employment, and commenced the business of optician, in which he was
                    afterwards joined by his father. Aþout this time the volume of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Berlin Memoirs,</hi> containing Euler’s paper, fell into the
                    hands of the elder Dolland, who examined it with care, and repeated the
                    calculations. His report was communicated by Mr Short to the Royal Society in
                    1752, and published in their Transactions for that year. Dolland, as might well
                    be expected, could detect no mistake in the investigation itself, but
                    strenuously contested the principle on which it was built, as differing from the
                    one laid down by Newton, which he held to be irrefragable. “It is, therefore,”
                    says he, rather uncourteously, and certainly with little of the prophetic
                    spirit, “it is, therefore, somewhat strange that any body now-a-days should
                    attempt to do that which so long ago has been demonstrated impossible.” The
                    great Euler replied with becoming temper, but persisted in maintaining that his
                    optical principle was a true and necessary law of nature, though he frankly
                    confessed that he had not been able to reduce it yet to practice. The dispute
                    now began to provoke attention on the Continent. In 1754, Klingenstier-na, an
                    eminent Swedish geometer, demonstrated that the Newtonian principle is in some
                    extreme cases incompatible with the phenomena, and therefore ought not to be
                    received as an undoubted law of nature. Thus pressed on all sides, Dolland at
                    length had recourse to that appeal which should have been made from the
                    beginning,— to the test of actual experiment. He constructed a hollow wedge with
                    two plates of glass, ground parallel, in which he laid inverted a common glass
                    prism, and filled up the space with clear water, as in the annexed figure.</p>
                <p part="N">He now continued to enlarge the angle of the wedge, till the refraction
                    produced by the water came to counterbalance exactly the opposite refraction of
                    the glass, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031135?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0702-1135-0102"/>must obtain whenever an object is seen through
                    the compound prism, without change of direction, in its true place. But,
                    contrary to what he so firmly expected, the external objects appeared glaringly
                    bordered with coloured fringes; as much, indeed, as if they had been viewed
                    through a glass prism with an angle of thirty degrees. It was therefore quite
                    decisive that Newton had not performed his experiment with scrupulous accuracy,
                    and had trusted rather too hastily to mere analogical inference. But to remove
                    every shadow of doubt from the subject, Mr Dolland, finding that large angles
                    were inconvenient for observation, ground a prism to the very acute angle of
                    nine degrees, and adjusted, by careful trials, a wedge of water to the same
                    precise measure of refraction. Combining the opposite refractions as before, he
                    beheld, on looking through the apparatus (as here represented), their various
                    objects real position, but distinctly marked with the prismatic colours. In
                    these experiments, although the mean ray pursues the same undeviating course,
                    the extreme rays which enter parallel with it emerge from the compound prism,
                    spreading out on both sides.</p>
                <p part="N">The capital point being completely ascertained, Holland next tried so to
                    adapt the opposite refractions as to destroy all extraneous colour. This effect
                    he found to take place when the angle of the wedge had been further increased,
                    till the refracting power of the water was to that of the glass in the ratio of
                    five to four. His conclusive experiments were made in 1757, and he lost no time
                    in applying their results to the improvement of the objectglasses of telescopes.
                    Following the proportion just ascertained, he conjoined a very deep convex lens
                    of water with a concave one of glass. In this way he succeeded in removing the
                    colours occasioned by the unequal refraction of light; but the images formed in
                    the foci of the telescopes so constructed, still wanted the distinctness which
                    might have been expected. The defect now proceeded, it was evident, merely from
                    spherical aberration; for the excess of refraction in the compound lens being
                    very small, the surfaces were necessarily formed to a deep curvature.</p>
                <p part="N">But this partial success only stimulated the ingenious artist to make
                    further trials. Having proved that the separation of the extreme rays, or what
                    has been since termed the <hi rend="italic">dispersive power,</hi> is not
                    proportioned to the mean refraction in the case of glass and water, he might
                    fairly presume that like discrepancies must exist among other diaphanous
                    substances, and even among the different kinds of glass itself. The charm of
                    uniformity being once dispelled, he was encouraged to proceed, with the
                    confident hope of ultimately achieving his purpose. His new researches, however,
                    were postponed for some time by the pressure of business. But on resuming the
                    inquiry, he found the English crown-glass and the foreign yellow or
                    straw-coloured, commonly called the Venice glass, to disperse the extreme rays
                    almost alike, while the crystal, or white flint-glass, gave a much greater
                    measure of dispersion. On this quarter, therefore, he centred his attention. A
                    wedge of crown and another of flint-glass were ground till they refracted
                    equally, which took place when their angles were respectively 29 and 25 degrees,
                    or the indices of refraction were nearly as 22 to 19; but on being joined in an
                    inverted position, they produced, without changing the general direction of the
                    pencil, a very different divergence of the compound rays of light. He now
                    reversed the experiment, and formed wedges of crown and flint-glass to such
                    angles as might destroy all irregularity of colour by their opposite
                    dispersions.</p>
                <p part="N">When this condition was obtained, the refractive powers of those wedges
                    of crown and flint-glass were nearly in the ratio of three to two, and
                    consequently the sines of half their angles, or the angles themselves, if small,
                    were as 33 to 19, or nearly as 7 to 4. The rays which enter parallel now escape
                    likewise parallel, but all of them deflected equally from their course.</p>
                <p part="N">The appearance was rendered still more conspicuous by repeating the
                    combination of the glass wedges, as in the figure here adjoined. It will be
                    perceived that the pencils of rays which enter at equal distances on both sides
                    of the common junction, must nearly meet in the same point of the axis; for in
                    small arcs the chords are almost proportional to the arcs themselves. This
                    arrangement, indeed, with the projecting wedge of crown-glass in front,
                    represents actually the composition of an object-glass formed of two distinct
                    and opposing lenses, which would produce a similar effect. It was only required
                    to apply a semi-convex lens of crown-glass before a semi-concave one of
                    flint-glass, such that the curvature of the former be to that of the latter
                    nearly as 7 to 4; but with some modifications in this ratio, according to the
                    peculiar qualities of the glass. [The figure annexed represents this
                    combination^ But the depth of the lenses might be diminished, by giving them
                    curvature on both sides. Thus, if a double convex of crown-glass were
                    substituted, of the same power, and consequently with only half the curvature on
                    each side; the lens of flint-glass adapted to it having, therefore, their common
                    surface of an equal concavity, would need, in order to produce the former
                    quantity of refraction, and consequently to maintain the balance of opposite
                    dispersions, a concavity eight times less than before on the other surface. Or
                    if a double concave of flint-glass with half its first depth were used, the
                    front convexity of the lens of crown-glass would be five-sevenths of the former
                    curvature, as here represented. The surface where the two lenses are united may
                    hence have its curvature changed at pleasure; but every alteration of this must
                    occasion corresponding changes in the exterior surfaces.</p>
                <p part="N">In all these cases, the refraction of the convex pieces being reduced to
                    one-third by the contrary refraction of the concave piece, the focal distance of
                    the compound glass must be triple of that which it would have had singly. But a
                    most important advantage results from the facility of varying the adaptation of
                    the lenses; for, by rightly proportioning the conspiring and counteracting
                    curvatures, it was possible to remove almost entirely the errors arising from
                    spherical aberration. This delicate problem Mr Dolland was the better prepared
                    to encounter, as he had already, in 1753, improved the telescope materially, by
                    introducing no fewer than six eye-glasses, disposed at proper distances, to
                    divide the refraction. The research itself, and the execution of the compound
                    lens, presented peculiar difficulties; but the ingenuity and toilsome exertions
                    of the artist were at length, in 1758, rewarded with complete success.
                    “Notwithstanding,” says he, in concluding <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193031148?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1148-0103"/>his paper,
                    “so many difficulties as I have enumerated, I have, after numerous trials, and a
                    resolute perseverance, brought the matter at last to such an issue, that I can
                    construct refracting telescopes, with such apertures and magnifying powers,
                    under limited lengths, as, in the opinion <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the best and
                    undeniable judges, who have experienced them, far exceed any thing that has been
                    produced, as representing objects with great distinctness, and in their true
                    colours.”</p>
                <p part="N">The Royal Society voted to Mr Dolland, for his valuable discovery, the
                    honour of the Copley medal. To this new construction of the telescope Dr Bevis
                    gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Achromatic</hi> (from <hi rend="italic"
                        >α</hi> privative, and <hi rend="italic">χj&gt;ωμα, colour^),</hi> which was
                    soon universally adopted, and is still retained. The inventor took out a patent,
                    but did not live to reap the fruits of his ingenious labours. He died in the
                    year 1761, leaving the prosecution of the business to his son and associate
                    Pcter Dolland, who realized a very large fortune by the exclusive manufacture,
                    for many years, of achromatic glasses, less secured to him by the invidious and
                    disputed provisions of legal monopoly, than by superior skill, experience, and
                    sedulous attention. In 1765, the younger Dolland made another and final
                    improvement, to which his father had before advanced some steps. To correct more
                    effectually the spherical aberration, he formed the objectglass of three instead
                    of two lenses, by dividing the convex piece; or he inclosed a concave lens of
                    flint-glass between two convex lenses of crown-glass, as exactly represented in
                    the figure here annexed. He showed a telescope of this improved construction,
                    having a focal length of three feet and a half, with an aperture of three inches
                    and three quarters, to the celebrated Mr Short, who tried it with a magnifying
                    power of one hundred and fifty times, and who, superior to the jealousy of
                    rivalship, and disposed to patronise rising merit, most warmly recommended it,
                    and declared that he found “the image distinct, bright, and free from
                    colours.”</p>
                <p part="N">What were the curvatures of those distinct component lenses, Dolland has
                    not mentioned, and perhaps he rather wished to conceal them. The Duke de
                    Chaulnes was enabled, however, by means of a sort of micrometer, to ascertain
                    the radii of the several surfaces, in the case of one object-glass of the best
                    composition. He found these radii, beginning with the front lens, to be
                    respectively 311½, 392; 214, 294; 294 and 322½, in French lines, which
                    corresponded, in English inches, to 32∙4, 40*8; 22∙2, 30∙6; 30∙6 and 33∙5. If
                    these measures were correct, however, it would follow, that the middle lens of
                    flint-glass was not perfectly adapted to the curvature of the lens of
                    crown-glass placed immediately before it. Similar admeasurements have been
                    repeated by others, but the results differ considerably, and no general
                    conclusion can be safely drawn. There is no doubt that the artist varied his
                    practice, according to the nature of the glass which he was obliged to use. The
                    more ordinary proportions for the curvatures of the component lenses would be
                    represented by a truncated prism, formed with a double cluster of wedges, the
                    outer ones having angles of 25° 53', and 14° 27', and consisting of crown-glass,
                    and the inner one made of flint-glass, with an inverted angle of 27° 3'. These
                    two wedges of crown-glass would produce the same refraction, it might be shown,
                    as a single one having an angle of 40° 54∖∙ wherefore this refraction will be
                    diminished, by the opposite influence of the wedge of flint glass, in the ratio
                    of 49 to 16, or reduced to nearly one-third..</p>
                <p part="N">Thus was achieved, and fully carried into practical operation, the
                    finest and most important detection made in optics since the great discovery of
                    the unequal refraction of the several rays of light. It was drawn forth by a
                    long series of trials, directed with judgment and ingenuity, but certainly very
                    little aided by the powers of calculation. Such a slow tentative procedure was
                    perhaps the best suited, however, to the habits of an artist, and it had at
                    least the advantage of leaving no doubt or hesitation behind it. On this
                    occasion, we cannot help being struck with a remark, that most of those who have
                    ever distinguished themselves in the philosophical arts by their original
                    improvements, were seldom regularly bred to the profession. Both the Dollands,
                    we have seen, began life with plying at the loom; Short had a liberal education,
                    being designed for the Scotish church, but, indulging a taste for practical
                    optics, he afterwards followed it as a trade, in which he rose to pre-eminence;
                    Ramsden, whose ingenuity and exquisite skill were quite unrivalled, was bred a
                    clothier in Yorkshire; Tassie, who revived or created among us the nice art of
                    casting gems, was originally a stone-mason at Glasgow; and Watt, who, by his
                    very happy applications of mechanics, and his vast improve-ménts on the
                    steam-engine, has, more than any other individual perhaps, contributed to the
                    great national advancement, was early an ivory-turner in that same city,, and
                    still found pleasure, in his declining years, with the amusement of the lathe.
                    We might easily enlarge this catalogue; but enough has been said to prove the
                    justness of the observation, and it suggests reflections which are not
                    favourable to fixed and systematic plans of education.</p>
                <p part="N">The theory of achromatic telescopes, embraced in all its extent, opened
                    a field of abstruse and difficult investigation. But the English mathematicians
                    at that period, though they might appear to be especially invited to the
                    discussion, very generally neglected so fine an opportunity for the exercise of
                    their genius. They coldly suffered the artists to grope their devious way,
                    without offering to guide their efforts by the lights of science. On the
                    Continent the geometers of the first order were all eager to attempt the
                    solution of problems at once so curious and important. For several years
                    subsequent to 1758, the Transactions of the foreign academies were filled with
                    memoirs on the combination of achromatic lenses, displaying the resources and
                    refinements of the modern analysis, by Euler, Clairaut, and D’Alembert,—by
                    Boscovich, Klingenstierna, Kaestner, and Hennert. On this, as on other
                    occasions, however, we have to regret the want of close union between artists
                    and men of science. Those profound investigations are generally too speculative
                    for any real use; they often involve imperfect or inaccurate data; and the
                    results appear wrapped in such comprehensive and intricate formulae, as to deter
                    the artist from endeavouring to reduce them into practice. Wc should have
                    thought it preferable, on the whole, not to load the solution of the main
                    problem with minute conditions, but to aim at a few general rules, which could
                    afterwards be modified in their application according to circumstances. All this
                    might have been accomplished, without scarcely travelling beyond the limits of
                    elementary geometry.</p>
                <p part="N">Euler and his adherents at Berlin were still not disposed to abandon his
                    favourite optical hypothesis. It was even pretended that Dolland must have owed
                    his success to a nice correction of spherical aberration, and not to any really
                    superior dispersive power belonging to the <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193031161?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1161-0104"
                    />flint-glass. But that candid philosopher afterwards yielded to the force of
                    reason and testimony; and, collecting his various optical papers, he published,
                    in the successive years 1769, 1770, and 1771, a complete treatise, on <hi
                        rend="italic">Dioptrics,</hi> occupying three quarto volumes, which contain
                    a store of ingenious and elegant disquisitions.</p>
                <p part="N">The last memoir which Clairaut ever wrote related to achromatic glasses.
                    D’Alembert prosecuted the subject with diligence and ardour; and the volumes of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Opuscules,</hi> published between the years
                    1761 and 1767, contain some elaborate dioptrical investigations. Among other
                    conclusions which he deduced from his multiplied researches, he proposed a new
                    composition for the object-glass of a telescope, to consist of three lenses, the
                    outmost one being a meniscus of crown-glass, or having a convex and a concave
                    surface, then a meniscus of flint-glass in the middle, and adapted to this, on
                    the inside, a double convex of crown-glass. Of all the continental works,
                    however, which treat of achromatic combinations, the tracts of Boscovich, who
                    possessed a very fine taste for geometry, may be held as the simplest and
                    clearest. We cannot help noticing, by the way, a curious theorem of his
                    concerning the form and arrangement of eye-glasses, which would be free from
                    irregular colours. It is, that the correction will be produced by means of two
                    lenses of the same kind of glass, if separated from each other by an interval
                    equal to half the sum of their focal distances. This principle furnishes a very
                    simple construction for the common astronomical telescope, through which the
                    objects are seen inverted. In the annexed figure, the objectglass, as usual, is
                    achromatic, being composed of two convex lenses of crown-glass, with a concave
                    one of flint-glass fitted between them; but the eye-glass consists of two
                    distinct lenses of crown-glass, both of them convex, and exactly similar, the
                    first having every dimension triple that of the other, and their mutual distance
                    double the focal length of the smaller.</p>
                <p part="N">Supposing, however, that the errors occasioned by spherical aberration
                    were completely removed, the principle of achromatic combination is yet far from
                    being so perfect as it has often been represented. Although the opposite
                    dispersions of the flint and of the crown-glass should bring together the
                    extreme rays, we are not, from this coincidence, warranted to infer that the
                    several intermediate rays would likewise be accurately blended. In fact, a wedge
                    of flint-glass not only separates all the rays much more than a similar one of
                    crown-glass, but divides the coloured spaces after different proportions. While
                    the combined lenses formed of those two kinds of glass give an image entirely
                    free from the red and violet borders, they may still introduce secondary shades
                    of green or yellow, sufficient to cause a certain degree of indistinctness. The
                    mode of correcting this defect would be, to produce a counterbalance of colours,
                    by conjoining several media endued with different refractive and dispersive
                    powers. In these qualities, crown-glass itself admits of some variation, owing
                    to the measure of saline ingredient; but flint-glass differs widely with regard
                    to its optical properties, owing chiefly to the diversified proportion of minium
                    or oxyde of lead which enters into its composition, and partly to the variable
                    admixture of manganese employed to discharge the yellow tint occasioned by the
                    lead. Manifest advantages, therefore, would result from a choice combination of
                    three or more varieties of glass, since both the primary and the secondary
                    deviations of colour would be corrected. Without pretending to any theoretical
                    perfection, every thing really wanted in practice would be thus attained. A
                    series of nice experiments on the optical relations of glass could not fail, by
                    their results, to reward the assiduity of the ingenious artist He would trace
                    and determine the separate influence exerted on the refractive and dispersive
                    powers by soda in the crown-glass, and by minium and manganese in the
                    flint-glass. It is highly probable, that with perseverance he might discover a
                    vitreous composition better adapted than any yet known for achromatic purposes.
                    It is very generally believed, that the achromatic telescopes now manufactured
                    in London are not of the same excellence with those first made by Peter Dolland.
                    This declension of such a beautiful art has frequently been imputed to the
                    baneful operation of a severe and oppressive system of excise. Whether the new
                    mode of charging the duty on glass at the annealing arch has produced any
                    beneficial effects, we are still to leam.</p>
                <p part="N">An extensive and ingenious set of experiments on the dispersive powers
                    of different liquids, was undertaken, about the year 1787, and successfully
                    prosecuted for some time afterwards, by Dr Robert Blair, for whom there had been
                    recently created,· under royal patronage, the chair of practical astronomy in
                    the University of Edinburgh; one of the very few professorships in that
                    distinguished seminary which have been suffered to remain inefficient and merely
                    nominal. Of these experiments, a judicious account was, in 1790, communicated by
                    their author to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in a paper drawn up with evident
                    ability, but rather too diffuse, and unnecessarily digressive. Dr Blair had a
                    very small brass prism perforated with a hole, which he filled with a few drops
                    of the liquid to be examined, and confined each end by a plate of glass with
                    parallel surfaces. He then applied, inverted to the prism in succession, a
                    number of glass wedges which he had provided of different angles, and observed,
                    when the bars of the window, seen through this compound prism, appeared
                    colourless, the angle of the wedge now expressed the relative dispersive power
                    of the liquid. This way of experimenting was sufficiently simple, but a more
                    accurate and expeditious method might have easily been devised. For instance, if
                    the prism, furnished with a graduated arch, had remained fixed, and a single
                    glass wedge made to turn upon it, and present successive. inclinations to the
                    observer, the refracting angle at which the irregular colours were united could
                    be deduced by an easy calculation. Dr Blair found, by his trials, that muriatic
                    acid, in all its combinations, but particularly with antimony and mercury, shows
                    a very great dispersive power. The essential oils stood the next with regard to
                    that property, though differing considerably among themselves. In Dr Blair’s
                    first attempts to improve the achromatic telescope, he conjoined two compound
                    lenses; the one formed with a double concave of crown-glass and a semi-convex of
                    essential oil, and the other composed of a double convex filled with essential
                    oil, of great dispersive power, and of a semi-concave, likewise containing
                    essential oil, but less apt for dispersion. This very complex arrangement
                    seemed, however, to produce the desired effect, not only discharging from the
                    image the extreme fringes of red and violet, but excluding also the intermediate
                    shades of green or yellow. A simpler combination was afterwards used, requiring
                    merely one liquid, composed of muriatic acid joined with antimony, or the triple
                    salt of that acid united in certain proportions to ammonia and mercury. This
                    liquid, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031174?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0702-1174-0105"/>being accurately prepared, was inclosed
                    between two thin glass shells, to form a double convex lens: on the front was
                    applied a semi-convex of crown-glass, and a meniscus of the same material
                    behind, the whole being secured by a glass ring. An object-glass so constructed
                    seemed to perform its office with great perfection, effectually correcting both
                    the primary and the secondary admixture of colours. This kind of eye-glass Dr
                    Blair proposed to denominate <hi rend="italic">aplanatic</hi> (from <hi
                        rend="italic">α</hi> privative, and πλ <hi rend="italic">ανα</hi> ω, to <hi
                        rend="italic">err</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wander),</hi> and he obtained a
                    patent for his invention. The late George Adams, optician in Fleet Street, was
                    intrusted with the fabrication and sale of the telescopes thus constructed. Some
                    of them were said to answer extremely well; but, whether from want of activity
                    on the part of the tradesman, or from defect of temper in the patentee, these
                    instruments never acquired much circulation. It was alleged that the liquid by
                    degrees lost its transparency. Indeed wc suspect that there is no combination in
                    which liquids are concerned, which can be judged sufficiently permanent for
                    optical purposes. It seems hardly possible to preclude absolutely the impression
                    of the external air; the liquid must, therefore, have a tendency both to
                    evaporate and to crystallize; and, in the course of time, it will probably, by
                    its activity, corrode the surfaces of the glass.</p>
                <p part="N">The manufacture of achromatic telescopes in England furnished, for a
                    long period, a very profitable article of exportation. Even after the
                    introduction of those instruments was prohibited by several foreign governments,
                    the object-glasses themselves, in a more compendious form, were smuggled abroad
                    to a large amount. In fact, no flint-glass of a good quality was then made on
                    the Continent. A very material alteration, however, in that respect, has taken
                    place, at least in France, where the stimulus impressed by the revolution has
                    worked so many changes, and where ingenuity and science, in most of the
                    mechanical arts, have so visibly supplied the scantiness of capital. The French
                    now construct achromatic telescopes, equal, if not superior, to any that are
                    made in England. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.)</hi></p>
