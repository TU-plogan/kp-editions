                            Bourguignon</hi></label><hi rend="smallcaps">d’,</hi> a French
                    geographer of the highest eminence, and perhaps the most celebrated in modern
                    times. He was born at Paris on the Hth of July 1697. His passion for
                    geographical research displayed itself from his earliest years. At the age of
                    12, while reading the Latin authors at college, he amused himself with drawing
                    maps of the countries which they described. While he was thus busily employing
                    himself one day in the class, his master observed and was about to punish him;
                    but upon casting his eye upon the performance, he immediately judged him to be
                    rather deserving of encouragement. D’Anville from this time devoted himself
                    entirely to geography, particularly that of the ancient world; and at the age of
                    22 he began to delineate maps which attracted the attention of the most eminent
                    geographers.</p>
                <p part="N">There are two modes by which problems in geography may be solved; one
                    mathematically, by astronomical observation or geometrical measurement; the
                    other historically, by the distances of places inferred from the narrative of
                    historians and travellers. The former is certainly the most satisfactory, and
                    would supersede every other, could it be extended over the whole surface of the
                    globe. But, notwithstanding the splendid progress made since the era of
                    D’Anville, it is still far from such a degree of perfection. In all countries
                    the bulk of the positions must be filled up, and in some the whole must be
                    constructed from mere historical materials. Perhaps there is no department of
                    science which requires greater extent of knowledge and accuracy of judgment. The
                    variety of sources out of which the materials must be drawn is almost infinite;
                    and their application is equally nice and difficult. It must be regulated by a
                    complete acquaintance with all the modes of measurement used by all nations; by
                    a careful notice of those errors and contradictions which naturally arise from a
                    partial and limited observation; and by the marking of certain delicate
                    processes in the human mind, by which space and distance are sometimes
                    diminished, and more frequently exaggerated. In the skilful geographer, sound
                    natural judgment, enlightened by experience, creates, as it were, a new sense,
                    which enables him to see consistency amid a labyrinth of contradictions, and to
                    elicit truth from a multitude of statements that are all erroneous. This art may
                    be said to have originated with D’Anville, and to have been brought by him to
                    its highest perfection.</p>
                <p part="N">The course of study on which D’Anville entered was truly immense. Works
                    professedly geographical formed the least part of it; those of all the ancient
                    and modern historians, travellers, narrators of every description, were
                    assiduously examined. He studied, but only for the sake of the occasional
                    geographical lights which they afforded, the philosophers, orators, and poets;
                    for it was remarked that, in perusing these masterpieces of human genius, he was
                    totally indifferent to every thing which did not tend to fix a geographical
                    position. The object of this immense labour was to effect a complete reform in
                    the science of geography; to banish the system of copying blindly from preceding
                    maps, and never to fix a single position without a careful examination of all
                    the authorities upon which it rested. By this process he detected many and great
                    errors in the works of his most celebrated predecessors, while his own accuracy
                    was soon attested on all sides by the travellers and mariners who had taken his
                    works as their guide. His principles led him also to another innovation, which
                    was that of omitting every name for which there existed no sufficient authority.
                    The public were at first amazed at seeing vast spaces, which had before been
                    covered with countries and cities, suddenly reduced to a perfect blank; but they
                    soon recognised that this was the only accurate course, and that the defect lay
                    in the science, not in the geographer.</p>
                <p part="N">D’Anville was at first employed in the humbler task of illustrating by
                    maps the works of different travellers, such as Marchais, Charlevoix, Labat, and
                    Duhalde. The question respecting the figure of the earth coming to be much
                    agitated, he published, in 1735 and 1736, two treatises, with a view to
                    illustrate it. But this attempt to solve a geometrical problem by historical
                    materials was eminently unsuccessful. Maupertuis having gone to measure a degree
                    within the polar circle, the result λvas found directly opposite to our
                    geographer’s prediction. This, however, was considered by the intelligent public
                    rather as fixing limits to his mode of investigation, than as implying any want
                    of diligence and ability in its employment.</p>
                <p part="N">Any loss of reputation which this failure might occasion was completely
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> retrieved by his map of Italy, published in
                    1743. It was marked by a species of investigation, often employed by D’Anville
                    with peculiar success. This consisted in the application of ancient materials to
                    correct the existing geography. By the diligent study of the Latin authors, he
                    was enabled to trace numerous errors which had crept into the delineation of
                    this interesting country. A trigonometrical survey which Pope Benedict XIV.
                    almost immediately after caused to be made in the Ecclesiastical States,
                    confirmed, in a surprising degree, all these alterations. On this occasion he
                    first set the example, which cannot be too much applauded, of accompanying the
                    map with a memoir, exhibiting a view of the data on which it had been
                    constructed.</p>
                <p part="N">He now applied himself to ancient geography, always his favourite
                    department, and the aspect of which, under his hands, was soon completely
                    changed. He illustrated successively, by maps, all the countries known to the
                    ancients, among which Egypt attracted his peculiar attention. To render these
                    labours more extensively useful, he published in 1768 an <hi rend="italic"
                        >Abridgement of Ancient Geography.</hi> His attention was finally turned to
                    the middle ages, which were illustrated by his <hi rend="italic">States formed
                        in Eurορt after the Fall of the Western Empire,</hi> and by some othe works
                    equally learned. Entirely devoted to geographica inquiries, the appearance of
                    his successive publications formed the only events, by which his life was
                    diversified. From causes which are not explained, he was late m being admitted
                    into the literary societies. In 1754, at the age of 60, he became a member of
                    the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, whose Transactions he enriched
                    with many papers. In 1775 he received the only place in the Academy of Sciences
                    which is allotted to geography; and in the same year he was appointed, without
                    solicitation, first geographer to the king. But these honours came too late to
                    illustrate a life which was now drawing to its utmost verge. His last employment
                    consisted in arranging his collection of maps, plans, and geographical
                    materials. It was the most extensive in Europe, and had been purchased by the
                    king, who, however, left him the use of it during his life. This task performed,
                    he sunk into a total imbecility, both of mind and <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193099188?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-9188-0279"/>bodv, which
                    continued for two years, and ended only with 'his death in January 1782, when he
                    had nearly reached the great age of 85.</p>
                <p part="N">D’Anville, with the qualities which form the great geographer, united
                    all the essentials of an honourable and worthy character. The advancement of the
                    science to which he had devoted himself formed almost the sole passion of his
                    life; and, mingling little with society, he contracted peculiarities which
                    solitary study is but too apt to engender. He talked with little interest on any
                    subject except geography. This topic necessarily led to that of his own
                    discoveries, on which he was never weary of expatiating. He boasted without any
                    reserve of the services whieh he had rendered to that science, using not
                    unſrequently the expression of Augustus, “I found it of brick, and left it of
                    marble.” He, however, did full justice to the merit of those who excelled in
                    other branches of knowledge; and to such as furnished him with materials for his
                    researches, his gratitude was unbounded.</p>

                    composed by D’Anville, of whieh some were published separately, and others in
