                    oγ'Anah</hi></label>, a town of Arabian Irac, or pachalic of Bagdad, which
                    extends five or six miles along the western bank of the Euphrates. It consists
                    of a single street built on both sides. The houses are of stone, two stories
                    high, and separated from each other, as in other eastern towns, by beautiful
                    gardens, filled with fruit-trees, bearing lemons, oranges, citrons, quinces,
                    figs, dates, pomegranates, and olives. It is an open and defenceless place; and
                    in 1807 it was attacked by the Wahabees,.who gave it up to plunder, and
                    perpetrated the most horrible cruelties, massacring the greater part of the
                    inhabitants, and setting the town on fire; after which they retreated with their
                    plunder, carrying into captivity many women and children. The inhabitants are
                    said, previous to this calamity, to have been more polished than those in the
                    neighbourhood, and to have consisted chiefly of Arabians, who were, however,
                    addicted to their usual vocation of robbery when any opportunity offered.
                    Population about 3000. 260 miles east of Damascus; 220 south-east of Aleppo.

                    of the emperor Alexius Comnenus I., was not less distinguished by her elevated
                    rank than by her mental qualifications. Her superiority of mind began early to
                    display itself. Despising the effeminacy and voluptuousness of the court in
                    which she was educated, she directed her attention to literary pursuits.
                    Indulging her favourite studies, she solicited the acquaintance of the more
                    eminent philosophers of that period.</p>
                <p part="N">But the pursuits of literature did not induce her entirely to abandon
                    society; she gave her hand to Nicephorus Briennius, a young nobleman of a
                    respectable family. This accomplished woman was, however, actuated with
                    unjustifiable ambition; and, during the last illness of her father, she united
                    with the empress Irene in attempting to prevail upon that monarch to disinherit
                    his own son, and give the crown to her husband. The affection and virtue of the
                    father prevailed over female address and intrigue. But the ambition of Comnena
                    was not diminished; for she entered into a conspiracy to depose her brother; and
                    when her husband displayed a timidity and hesitation in this unjust enterprise,
                    she exclaimed that “nature had mistaken their sexes, for he ought to have been
                    the woman.”</p>
                <p part="N">Either through the vigilance of her brother, or the timidity of her
                    husband, the treasonable plot was discovered, and Anna punished with the
                    confiscation of all her property. But generosity has an opportunity of
                    displaying its real nature when an enemy is vanquished; thus was the -generosity
                    of her brother displayed on the present occasion, by returning all her property.
                    Ashamed, however, of her base conduct, she retired from court, and never more
                    possessed any influence there. Disappointed ambition took shelter among the
                    walks of literature, and she employed herself in her solitude in writing the
                    history of her father’s reign. This production of her pen is still extant, and
                    composes a part of the celebrated collection of the <hi rend="italic">Byzantine
                        Historians.</hi> The stores of rhetoric are ransacked to embellish this
                    work, and every effort made to enrich it with science; but the general
                    complexion of it is rather like an apology than an impartial narrative. It must,
                    however, be acknowledged that she is not more partial than many other Latin
                    historians, and that her history contains many valuable facts and
                    observations.</p>
