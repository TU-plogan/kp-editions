                    plain song; and this consideration induced him to labour after some
                    amendment,—some method that might facilitate instruction, and enable those
                    employed in the choral office to perform the duties of it in a correct and
                    decent manner. Were we to credit those legendary accounts that are extant in old
                    monkish manuscripts, we should believe he was assisted in his pious intention by
                    immediate communications from heaven. Some speak of the invention of the
                    syllables as the effect of inspiration; and Guido himself seems to have been of
                    the same opinion, by his saying it was revealed to him by the Lord, or, as some
                    interpret his words, in a dream. Graver historians say, that being at vespers in
                    the chapel of his monastery, it happened that one of the offices appointed for
                    that day was the hymn to St John,—</p>

                    the mind a lasting idea of their congruity; and immediately conceived a thought
                    of applying these six syllables to perfect an improvement either then actually
                    made by him, or under consideration, viz. that of converting the ancient
                    tetrachords into hexachords.</p>
                <p part="N">Struck with the discovery, he retired to his study, and having perfected
                    his system, began to introduce it into practice. The persons to whom fie
                    communicated it were the brethren of his own monastery, from whom it met with
                    but a cold reception, which he ascribed to envy. However, his interest with the
                    abbot, and his employment in the chapel, gave him an opportunity of trying the
                    efficacy of his method on the boys who were training up for the choral service,
                    and it exceeded the most sanguine expectation. “To the admiration of all,” says
                    Cardinal Baronius, “a boy thereby learnt, in a few months, what no man, though
                    of great ingenuity, could before that attain in several years.”</p>
                <p part="N">The fame of Guido’s invention soon spread abroad, and his method of
                    instruction was adopted by the clergy of other countries. We are told by
                    Kircher, that Herman-nus, bishop of Hamburg, and Elvirĩcus, bishop of Osnaburg,
                    made use of it; and by the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Histoire Littéraire
                        de la France,</hi> that it was received in that country, and taught in all
                    the monasteries in the kingdom. It is certain that the reputation of his great
                    skill in music had excited in the pope a desire to see and converse with him; of
                    which, and of his going to Rome for that purpose, and the reception he met with
                    from the pontiff, he himself has given a circumstantial account in the epistle
                    hereafter mentioned.</p>
                <p part="N">It seems that John XX., or, as some writers compute, the nineteenth,
                    pope of that name, having heard of the fame of Guido s school, and conceiving a
                    desire to see him, sent three messengers to invite him to Rome. Upon their
                    arrival, it was resolved by the brethren of the monastery that he should go
                    thither attended by Grimaldo the abbot, and Peter the chief of the canons of the
                    church of Arezzo. Arriving at Rome, he was presented to the holy father, and by
                    him received with great kindness. The pope had several conversations with him,
                    in all which he interrogated him as to his knowledge in music; and upon sight of
                    an antiphonary which Guido had brought with him, marked with the syllables
                    agreeable to his new invention, the pope looked upon it as a kind of prodigy,
                    and ruminating on the doctrines delivered by Guido, would not stir from his seat
                    till he had learned perfectly to sing off a verse; upon which he declared that
                    he could not have believed the efficacy of the method, if he had not been
                    convinced by the experiment he had himself made of it. The pope would have
                    detained him at Rome; but labouring under a bodily disorder, and fearing an
                    injury to his health from the air of the place, and the heats of the summer,
                    which was then approaching, Guido left that city upon a promise to revisit it,
                    and explain to his holiness the principles of his new system. On his return
                    homewards he made a visit to the abbot of Pomposa, a town in the duchy of
                    Ferrara, who was very earnest to have Guido settle in the monastery of that
                    place; to which invitation, it seems, he yielded, being, as he says, desirous of
                    rendering so great a monastery still more famous by his studies there.</p>
                <p part="N">Here it was that he composed a tract on music, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Mierologus,</hi> i. e. a short discourse, which he dedicated
                    to Theobald, bishop of Arezzo; and finished, as he himself at the end of it
                    tells us, under the pontificate of John XX., and in the 34th year of his age.
                    Vossius speaks also of another musical treatise written by him, and dedicated to
                    the same person.</p>
                <p part="N">Most of the authors who have taken occasion to mention Guido, speak of
                    the Micrologus as containing the sum of his doctrine; but it is in a small
                    tract, entitled <hi rend="italic">Argumentum</hi><hi rend="italic">novi
                        Cantus</hi><hi rend="italic">inveniendi,</hi> that his declaration of his
                    use of the syllables, with their several mutations, and in short his whole
                    doctrine of solmisation, is to be found. This tract makes part of an epistle to
                    a very dear and intimate friend of Guido, whom he addresses thus, “Beatissimo
                    atque dulcissimo fratri Michaeli,” at whose request the tract itself seems to
                    have been composed.</p>
                <p part="N">Whether Guido was the author of any other tracts is not easy to
                    determine. It nowhere appears that any of his works were ever printed, except
                    that Baronins, in his <hi rend="italic">Annales Ecclesiastici,</hi> tom. xi. p.
                    73, has given at length the epistle from him to his friend Michael of Pomposa,
                    and that to Theobald, bishop of Arezzo, prefixed to the Micrologus; and yet the
                    writers on music speak of the Micrologus as of a book in the hands of every one.
                    Martini cites several manuscripts of Guido; namely, two in the Ambrosian library
                    at Milan, the one written about the twelfth century, the other less ancient;
                    another among the archives of the chapter of Pistoja, a city in Tuscany; and a
                    third in the Medico-Laurenziano library at Florence, of the fifteenth century:
                    these are clearly the Micrologus. Of the epistle to Michael of Pomposa, together
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Argumentum</hi><hi rend="italic">novi Cantus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">inveniendi,</hi> he mentions only one, which, he says, is
                    somewhere at Ratisbon. Of the several tracts above mentioned, the last excepted,
                    a manuscript is extant in the library of Baliol college in Oxford.</p>

                    of Arezzo, who lived in the 16th century. He was famous for his satirical
                    writings; and was so bold as to carry his invectives even against sovereigns,
                    and from thence got the title of the <hi rend="italic">Scourge of Princes.</hi>
                    Francis I., the emperor Charles V., most of the princes of Italy, several
                    cardinals, and many noblemen, courted his friendship by presents, either because
                    they liked his compositions, or perhaps from an apprehension of falling under
                    the lash of his satire. Aretin became so insolent, that he is said to have got a
                    medal struck, on one side of which he is represented, with these words, <hi
                        rend="italic">Il</hi><hi rend="italic">divino</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Aretino</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and on the reverse, sitting upon a
                    throne, receiving the presents of princes, with these words, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Iprin-cipi tributati da popoli, tributano</hi><hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">servidor loro.</hi> Some imagine that he gave himself the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Divine,</hi> signifying thereby that he performed the
                    functions of a god upon earth, by the thunderbolts with which he struck the
                    heads of the highest personages. He used to boast that his lampoons did more
                    service to the world than sermons; and it was said of him, that he had subjected
                    more princes by his pen than the greatest had ever done by their arms. Aretin
                    wrote many irreligious and obscene pieces; such are his dialogues, called <hi
                        rend="italic">Bagionamenti.</hi> There is likewise imputed to him another
                    very obscene performance, <hi rend="italic">De omnibus Veneris</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">schematibus.</hi> “It was about the year 1525 (says Μ.

                        rend="italic">Imprimerie</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paris,</hi> p. 224) that
                    Julio Romano, the most famous painter of Italy, instigated by the enemy of the
                    salvation of mankind, invented drawings to engrave 20 plates; the subjects are
                    so immodest that I dare only name them. Peter Aretin composed sonnets for each
                    figure. George Vasari, who relates this in his <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                        Painters,</hi> says he does not know which would be the greatest impurity,
                    to cast one’s eyes upon the drawings of Julio, or to dip into the verses of
                    Aretin.” Some saý that Aretin changed his libertine principles; but however this
                    may be, it is certain that he composed several theological or pious pieces. He
                    wrote a paraphrase on the penitential psalms, and another on Genesis; the Life
                    of the Virgin Mary, and that of St Catharine of Sienna, and of St Thomas
                    Aquinas. His familiar Letters have been collected, and published in 6 vols. 8vo,
                    Paris, 1609. He was author likewise of various poetical pieces, among which is a
                    tragedy on the subject of the Horatii, possessed of considerable merit. He died
                    in the year 1556, at the age of 65.</p>
