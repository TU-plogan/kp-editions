                        History,</hi> were magistrates appointed after the death of Codrus. They
                    were chosen from the most illustrious families till the time of Aristides, who
                    got a law passed, by which it was enacted, that, in electing these magistrates,
                    less regard should be paid to birth than to merit.</p>
                <p part="N">The tribunal of the archons was composed of nine officers. The first was
                    properly the <hi rend="italic">archon,</hi> by whose name the year of his
                    administration was distinguished. The title of the second was <hi rend="italic"
                        >hing,</hi> that of the third <hi rend="italic">polemar-chus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> to these were added six <hi rend="italic"
                        >thosmothetce.</hi> These magistrates, elected by the scrutiny of beans,
                    were obliged to prove before their respective tribes that they had sprung, both
                    in their father’s and their mother’s side, for three descents, from citizens of
                    Athens. They were likewise to prove that they were attached to the worship of
                    Apollo, the tutelary god of their country; that they had in their house an altar
                    consecrated to Apollo; and that they had been respectfully obedient to their
                    parents,—an important and sacred part of their character, which promised that
                    they would be faithful servants to their country. They were likewise to prove
                    that they had served in a military capacity the number of years which the
                    republic required of every citizen; and this qualification gave the state
                    experienced officers, for they were not allowed to quit the army till they were
                    40 years old. Their fortune, too, of which they were to inform those before whom
                    they were examined, was a warrant for their fidelity.</p>
                <p part="N">After the commissioners who were appointed to inquire into their
                    character and other requisites had made a report cf them, they were then to
                    swear that they would maintain the laws, which obligation if they neglected,
                    they engaged to send to Delphi a statue of the weight of their bodies. According
                    to a law of Solon, if an archon got drunk, he was condemned to pay a heavy fine,
                    and sometimes even punished with death. Such magistrates as the Athenian archons
                    were well entitled to respect. Hence it was eternal infamy to insult them; and
                    hence Demosthenes observed, that to treat the thesmothetae with disrespect, was
                    to show disrespect to the public.</p>
                <p part="N">Another qualification indispensably required of the second officer of
                    this tribunal, who was called the <hi rend="italic">hing,</hi> was, that he had
                    married the daughter of an Athenian citizen, and that he had espoused her a
                    virgin. This was exacted of him, says Demosthenes, because part cf his duty was
                    to sacrifice to the gods jointly with his wife, who, instead of appeasing, would
                    have irritated them, if she had not possessed both these honours.</p>
                <p part="N">When any obscurity occurred in the laws relative to religion and the
                    worship of the gods, the interpretation was submitted to the tribunal of the
                    archons. They were the principal officers, not only in civil, but likewise in
                    sacred matters, and especially in the mysteries of Bacchus. The archons,
                    however, who were surnamed <hi rend="italic">eponymi,</hi> were chiefly employed
                    in civil affairs; yet they presided at the great feasts, and held the first rank
                    there. Hence they are sometimes styled <hi rend="italic">priests.</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Archon</hi> is also applied by some authors to divers
                    officers, both civil and religious, under the eastern or Greek empire.</p>
