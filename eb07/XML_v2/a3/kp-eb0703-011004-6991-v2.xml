                    These islands, which are situated on the eastern side of the Bay of Bengal, are
                    a continuation of the archipelago which extends from Cape Negrais to Atchein
                    Head, stretching from lat. 10° 32' to 13° 40 ’ N., and from long. 90° 6' to 92°
                    59' E. They are called the Great and the Little Andaman. The Great Andaman,
                    which is the northern island, is 140 miles in length, and only 20 broad. It was
                    formerly supposed to be one island; but two straits have been discovered, which
                    open a clear passage into the Bay of Bengal, and divide the Great Andaman into
                    three islands. The Little Andaman, which lies 30 miles south <hi rend="italic"
                        >of</hi> the Great Andaman, is 28 miles long and 17 broad. It does not
                    afford any good harbour, though tolerably safe anchorage maybe found near its
                    shores. These islands have an extremely moist temperature. They are situated in
                    the direct current of the south-west monsoon; and the central mountains, some of
                    the lofty peaks of which, as Saddle Peak in the large Andaman, rise to the
                    height of 2400 feet, intercept the clouds, which, for about eight months in the
                    year, descend in incessant torrents of rain on the plains below. According to a
                    meteorological table kept by an officer resident on the island, 98 inches of
                    water appear to have fallen in the course of seven months. On the whole,
                    however, the temperature is milder than in Bengal, and the heats not so
                    intolerable.</p>
                <p part="N">. The island is totally uncultivated, and the savage inhabitants glean a
                    miserable subsistence from the spontaneous produce of the woods, in which the
                    researches of the Europeans have hitherto found little that is either palatable
                    or nutritious. The principal trees are the banyantree, the almond-tree, the
                    oil-tree, which grows to a great height and yields a very useful oil; the poon,
                    the dämmer, the red wood, which for furniture is little inferior to fine
                    mahogany; the ebony, the cotton-tree, the soonđry, chingry, and beady; the
                    Alexandrian laurel, the poplar, a tree resembling satin-wood, bamboos, cutch,
                    the melon, aloes; the iron-tree, of stupendous size, whose timber almost bids
                    defiance to the axe of the wood-cutter. There are many other trees well adapted
                    for the construction of ships; and, as in all the equatorial forests, there are
                    numberless creepers and ratans, which surround the stems of the trees, and are
                    so firmly interlaced together, that the forests are impervious, except a road be
                    previously cut through them.</p>
                <p part="N">The only quadrupeds seen on the island are hogs, rats, and the
                    ichneumon; also the guana, of the lizard tribe; all which are very destructive
                    to poultry. There are several species of snakes and scorpions, by which the
                    labourers employed by the British in clearing away the underwood were frequently
                    bitten; but in no instance did the bite prove mortal. The patient was frequently
                    affected with violent convulsions, which gradually yielded to the operation of
                    opium and eau-de-luce.</p>
                <p part="N">Fish abound on the shores, and are caught in great numbers during the
                    prevalence of the north-east monsoon, when the weather is mild: grey mullet,
                    rock cod, skate, and soles, arc among the best. There are, besides, various
                    other species, such as guanas, sardinas, roe-balls, sable, shad, prawns,
                    shrimps, cray-fish, a species of whale, and sharks of an enormous size.
                    Shell-fish are in great plenty, and oysters of an excellent quality. The shores
                    abound in a variety of beautiful shells, such as gorgonias, madreporas, murex,
                    and cowries, with many other sorts equally beautiful.</p>
                <p part="N">Birds are not numerous, and they are extremely shy. Doves, parroquets,
                    and the Indian crow, are the most common. Hawks from the neighbouring continent
                    are sometimes seen hovering over the tops of trees; and a few aquatic birds,
                    such as the king-fisher, a sort of curlew, and the small sea-gull, frequent the
                    shores. Within the caverns and recesses of the rocks are found the edible birds’
                    nests so highly prized among the Chinese for their supposed medicinal and
                    restorative qualities.</p>
                <p part="N">The whole population of the islands does not exceed 2000 or 2500, and
                    they are probably the most savage people on the face of the whole earth. They
                    are far below the ordinary scale of barbarism; and in their modes of
                    subsistence, and in their dwellings, they rise very little above the brute
                    creation. They wear no clothes, and seem insensible to any feeling of shame from
                    the exposure of their persons. The woods supply them with little in the way of
                    food. They are provided with no pot or vessel that can bear the action of fire,
                    and they cannot therefore derive much advantage from such esculent herbs as the
                    forests may contain. The cocoa nut, which thrives so well in the neighbouring
                    islands, is not found in the Andamans, though the natives are extremely fond of
                    it. The fruit of the mangrove is principally used by them. Their principal food
                    consists of fish, in quest of a precarious meal of which they climb over the
                    rocks, or rove along the margin of the sea, often without success during the
                    tempestuous season; but they eagerly seize on whatever else presents itself,
                    such as lizards, guanas, rats, and snakes. From their diseased and extenuated
                    figures, it is plain that they have no abundant or wholesome nourishment. In
                    stature the inhabitants of the Great Andaman seldom exceed five feet; their
                    limbs are disproportionably slender, their bellies protuberant, with high
                    shoulders and large heads; and, what is singular and unaccountable, they have
                    all the characteristic marks of a degenerate race of negroes, with woolly hair,
                    flat noses, and thick lips; their eyes are small and red, their skin of a deep
                    sooty black, while their countenances exhibit a mixed exprès-síon<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193097004?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7004-0111"/> of famine
                    and ferocity. Lieutenant Alexander describes the inhabitants of Little Andaman
                    as far from be- ⅛c∙ a puny race. When he landed in a boat he counted sixteen
                    strong and able-bodied men, many of them very lusty. The ingenuity of these
                    savages is principally seen in the fabrication of a few simple weapons on which
                    they depend for their subsistence. These are a bow from four to five feet long,
                    with arrows of reed, headed with fish-bone or wood hardened in the fire, a spear
                    of heavy wood sharply pointed, and a shield made of bark. With these implements
                    they shoot and spear the fish, which abound in their bays and creeks, with
                    surprising dexterity. Their habitations display little more art than the dens of
                    wild beasts. Their canoes are hollowed out of the trunks of trees by fire and
                    instruments of stone, as they have no iron among them. Being much incommoded by
                    insects, their first occupation in the morning is to plaster their bodies all
                    over with mud, which, hardening in the sun, forms an effectual defence. They
                    paint their woolly heads with a mixture of ochre and water; and, when completely
                    dressed, it is observed by Mr Symes, who visited the island in his voyage to
                    Ava, that a more hideous appearance is not to be found in human form. Their
                    language does not possess the slightest affinity to any spoken either on the
                    continent of India or on the islands. It is not harsh to the ear. Their songs
                    are wildly melodious, and their gesticulations when singing extremely
                    impassioned. The men have all the cunning and vindictive dispositions of
                    savages; and they showa marked hatred to all strangers. They have little idea of
                    a future state, but they adore the sun and the moon, and the genii of the woods,
                    waters, and mountains as inferior agents. During the south-west monsoon, when
                    tempests prevail with unusual violence, they deprecate the wrath of the
                    malignant being who, according to their notions, has occasioned the storm, by
                    chanting wild choruses in small congregations assembled on the beach or on some
                    rock that overhangs the ocean. These islanders have occasionally been persuaded
                    to come on board British ships; but though they were well fed and kindly
                    treated, no persuasion could induce them to remain. The settlement of these
                    islands, with their negro inhabitants, so widely different in their appearance
                    not only from all those of the Asiatic continent, in which the Andamans are
                    embayed, but also from the natives of the Nicobar islands, presents a curious
                    problem, which has never been satisfactorily explained. It is supposed, however,
                    by Symes, that the original stock must have been settled on the island by the
                    accidental shipwreck of some Arab slave-ship. The English made a settlement on
                    the larger Andaman in the year 1791. Their object was to procure a commodious
                    harbour on the east side of the Bay of Bengal, to receive and shelter ships of
                    war during the continuance of the north-east monsoon; also to provide a place of
                    reception for convicts sentenced to transportation from Bengal. But the
                    settlement, proving unhealthy, has been since abandoned. These islands have been
                    frequently visited by British ships, but the barbarous natives reject all
                    friendly intercourse. Lieutenant Alexander states that they presented a hostile
                    aspect to the party who landed in search of fresh water, assailed them with
                    volleys of arrows, and testified, by the most ferocious signs, their determined
                    aversion to them. In April 1824 the British armament destined against the
                    Burmese touched at the great island, when the natives persevered in their
                    hostility, discharging flights of arrows at their boats, and then flying into
                    the woods. Ihese islands, together with the Nicobar and other smaller islands,
                    were included by Ptolemy in the general appellation of <hi rend="italic">Insulae
                        Bonae Fortunes,</hi> and were supposed by him to be inhabited by a race of
                    anthropophagi, though there are no proofs of the modern inhabitants being
                    addicted to this practice. (Symes’ <hi rend="italic">Embassy to Ava</hi><hi
