                    although the quantity thus produced may bear but a small proportion to the
                    whole, yet the advancement of science requisite to separate the metal from its
                    ore sufficiently accounts for the precedence whieh these have taken over all

                <p part="N">The metal called brass, in sacred and profane history, and whieh was
                    employed for the purpose of money, was, in fact, the copper of modern times;
                    whilst the brass of the present day is an alloy of copper, mixed according to

                <p part="N">The ancients, at a very early period, discovered the benefit derivable
                    from the mixture of copper with other metals, as the alloy constantly produced a
                    harder and a more durable substance, and at the same time was no disadvantage to
                    the material in melting or casting. It was employed in many of the illustrious
                    works which the ancients left for the admiration of succeeding times. The
                    enormous statue of the Sun, known by the name of the Colossus of Rhodes, erected
                    by Chares of Lyndus, an elève of Lysippus, was composed entirely of this metal:
                    and many others are m ntioned, which prove that the ancients were at least as
                    well acquainted with the difficult art of working in brass as we are at the
                    present time.</p>
                <p part="N">In a pure state, copper is a very brilliant metal, and susceptible of a
                    high polish. It is of a fine red colour, differing from every other metal except
                    titanium. Its specific gravity varies according to its density, from 8 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 58-I to 8*9. According to Brard, the cubic foot
                    of melted copper weighs 54∙5 lbs.</p>
                <p part="N">Of native metal 600 lbs.</p>
                <p part="N">Of copper medals 620 lbs.</p>
                <p part="N">In a native state, it is not an uncommon mineral. It occurs in
                    arborescent groups, very beautifully crystallized, in Siberia, imbedded in
                    limestone, and in very considerable masses. In the cabinet of Ajuda, near
                    Lisbon, a mass of native copper is said to be preserved, of the enormous weight
                    of 2617 pounds (Brand). In Cornwall it occurs in many of the mines, and also in
                    the island of Anglesea; and in the island of Nalsoc, one of the Faroe group, it
                    occurs very beautifully crystallized, along with zeolite, imbedded in
                    amygdaloidal trap.</p>
                <p part="N">Great as the use to which copper was applied by the ancients, it was
                    very limited compared with the uses it has been put to in modern times.</p>
                <p part="N">Metallic copper is used for culinary vessels in many parts of Europe;
                    but for this purpose the inner surface of the vessel should be tinned. Large
                    vessels for distilling, brewing, dyeing, and the like processes, are made of
                    copper. The making of these vessels constitutes the ordinary business of the
                    coppersmith.</p>
                <p part="N">Copper rolled into sheets is employed for covering the wooden work of
                    the roofs of churches and large edifices in Germany, Sweden, and other
                    countries. It is a costly covering, and does not possess any notable advantage
                    over lead.</p>
                <p part="N">A modern, and now a very extensive use of sheet-copper, is for the
                    sheathing of ships. That part of the hull of the ship that is in the water is
                    covered with sheet-copper. This'covering preserves the wood from the attacks of
                    the worm, and thereby gives the ship the advantage of passing more rapidly
                    through the water, as the copper bottom remains always smooth; for sea-weed and
                    shells will not take root and attach themselves to copper, as they do to the
                    bare planks, owing to the galvanic effect produced by the action of the sea
                    water. As this action, however, produces a rapid decay of copper, it was
                    proposed by Sir Humphry Davy to neutralize it hy applying metallic protectors,
                    an object which he accomplished; but as this also deprived the copper of the
                    effect it was intended to produce, and allowed the molluscous tribes to attach
                    themselves, the protecting process was abandoned.</p>
                <p part="N">Its malleability and ductility are very considerable. A wireofOO78 of an
                    inch diameter will support 302 pounds avoirdupois.</p>
                <p part="N">Copper bolts are used for fastening the planks and timbers of ships.
                    This is a modern improvement in ship-building. A copper-fastened ship or boat is
                    preferable to one with iron fastenings, because the copper baits remain
                    unaltered by rust, and endure longer than the wood which they hold together,
                    particularly when used in the state of alloy, which preserves it from waste by
                    neutralizing the galvanic action.</p>
                <p part="N">For the frames of delicate dipping needles and magnetic compasses,
                    copper is employed; as it has been found that the brass generally used in
                    philosophical instruments sometimes contains iron, which of course might affect
                    the magnetic needle.</p>
                <p part="N">Copper is drawn into wire, used for the communication with the bells in
                    houses, and for other purposes.</p>
                <p part="N">Small pipes for conveying the pit-coal gas from the level of the street
                    to the aperture by which the gas issues, were made of copper or of brass till
                    superseded by tin. These pipes were fitted· on an iron cylindrical mandril, and
                    a cylindrical ring is drawn over the outside. By this means copper and brass
                    tubes are drawn out. The brass tubes for telescopes are drawn out in the same
                    manner.</p>
                <p part="N">The mixture, consisting of a large proportion of copper and a small
                    proportion of silver, called billon in France, is used for coins of small value
                    in that country, in Germany, and in other parts of Europe. In Britain this alloy
                    is not now used; all coins being made either of standard gold, of standard
                    silver, or of copper. The use of billon is objectionable, as it renders the
                    value of the coins uncertain.</p>
                <p part="N">Copper may be plated; that is, its surface may be covered with a layer
                    of silver, by rubbing the surface with a mixture of nitrate of silver, muriate
                    of soda, and acidulous tartrate of potass (cream of tartar). But the method
                    practised at Birmingham is the most peemanent and effectual. A plate of copper,
                    with a plate of silver applied to it, and borax placed in the interstice, is
                    heated to a particular degree, which it requires the skill of the workman to
                    know; a degree of heat, in short, near that at which copper and silver melt. The
                    two metals thus heated, and in contact, are then taken out of the furnace and
                    passed through rollers. There is a fusion and combination of the adjacent
                    surfaces; and their adhesion is perfected by the pressure of the rollers. Copper
                    thus plated is manufactured at Birmingham into candlesticks, teapots, buttons,
                    buckles, and a variety of other articles.</p>
                <p part="N">Standard silver coins contain a small proportion of copper, for the
                    purpose of giving them hardness. This proportion is regulated by each government
                    in Europe, and varies a little in different countries. The combination of gold
                    and copper in various proportions is used for making rings and other
                    trinkets.</p>
                <p part="N">Copper is gilded hy applying on its surface an amalgam of gold with
                    mercury. Bronze ornaments are gilded in the same way.</p>
                <p part="N">Copper united with tin forms bronze. This combination is hard and
                    brittle if the proportion of tin be great; but when the proportion of tin is
                    small, the bronze is soft, and possesses tenacity so as not to be easily broken.
                    The ancients employed hard bronze, containing much tin, in making sword blades,
                    spear heads, hatchets, and cutting instruments. Bronze cramps are found in
                    ancient buildings in Egypt. Statues and bas-reliefs, various culinary vessels,
                    and different kinds of instruments of soft bronze, are seen in the collections
                    of antiquities. In modern times soft bronze is used for easting cannon and
                    statues.</p>
                <p part="N">Copper melted with a large proportion of tin constitutes bell metal,
                    which is hard and brittle. The metal of which the Chinese gongs are made is
                    composed of the same ingredients; and it has the property of being in some
                    degree malleable at a certain stage of its cooling, for the gongs are covered
                    with marks of the hammer.</p>
                <p part="N">To obtain copper from the yellow sulphuret or copper pyrites, which is
                    the most common copper ore, it is necessary to smelt the ore several times
                    before the metallic copper is obtained free from sulphur. The slag or scoriae
                        <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751328?mode=fullsize"

                    large bricks, used in building and coping walls in Wales and some other parts of
                    Britain, in the vicinity of which the smelting of copper is carried on.</p>
                <p part="N">The chief use made of the native combinations of copper found in the
                    earth is to extract the metallic copper from them. Sulphur is sometimes
                    manufactured in treating the copper pyrites.</p>
                <p part="N">Oxide of copper obtained from the annealing that copper and brass wire
                    undergoes, is used in dyeing.</p>
                <p part="N">In enamel colouring, oxide of copper, at a low degree of oxidation,
                    produces an opaque-red or brownish-red enamel, called porporino. When the
                    copper∙is more oxidated, it gives a green colour in enamelling upon earthenware
                    and porcelain, and in stained glass.</p>
                <p part="N">Sulphate of copper, when concentrated or crystallized, is transparent
                    and blue. It is manufactured for the use of the dyer and calico-printer.</p>
                <p part="N">Nitrate of copper is also blue. If fragments of soft wood, such as
                    poplar or fir, be impregnated with a solution of this salt, these sticks, when
                    dried, burn gradually to the end, and may serve as quick-match for firing
                    cannon.</p>
                <p part="N">Muriate of copper is green; that which is formed by direct solution of
                    copper in muriatic acid is transparent, and soluble in water; but the native
                    muriate of copper, with excess of oxide, is insoluble. This is found in Peru in
                    the form of green sand, and has got the name of atacamite, from the district of
                    country in which it occurs. Being opaque, it is used in painting.</p>
                <p part="N">Verdigris <hi rend="italic">(Verdlt-gris)</hi> is an acetate of copper
                    with excess of oxide. It is prepared in the wine districts of the south of
                    France, by laying copper plates in strata alternately with the grape stalksand
                    husks from which the juice has been pressed. The fermentation of the husks
                    produces vinegar, which acts upon the copper. Verdigris is used in painting,
                    because it possesses, on account of its excess of oxide, the opacity necessary
                    for making a coloured paste with oil; it is also used in dyeing. Crystallized
                    acetate of copper is the acetate without excess of oxide: it is in green
                    crystals, and is also used in dyeing.</p>
                <p part="N">Scheele’s green is an opaque precipitate, of a grass-green colour,
                    composed of copper and arsenic. It is used in oil-painting.</p>
                <p part="N">Prussiate of copper is an opaque-brown precipitate, formed by adding
                    prussiate of potash to a solution of sulphate of copper, and may be used in
                    painting. The colour, however, wants durability.</p>
