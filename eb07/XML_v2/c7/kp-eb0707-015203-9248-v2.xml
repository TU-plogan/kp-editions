                <p part="N"><label type="entry">COMITIA</label>, in Roman antiquity, were general
                    assemblies of the people, lawfully called by some magistrate for the enactment
                    or prohibition of any thing by their votes.</p>
                <p part="N">The proper comitia were of three sorts, <hi rend="italic">curiata,
                        centuriata,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tributa,</hi> with reference to the
                    three grand divisions of the city and people into <hi rend="italic">curiae,
                        centuriae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tribes:</hi> for by comitia <hi
                        rend="italic">calata</hi> were meant all the comitia in general, the term
                        <hi rend="italic">calata,</hi> from %αλsω, or <hi rend="italic">calo,</hi>
                    being their common epithet, though it was at last restricted to assemblies for
                    the creation of priests, and the regulation of last wills and testaments.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi> owed its origin to the
                    division which Romulus made of the people into thirty curiae, ten being
                    contained in every tribe. The curiae answ ered in most respects to the parishes
                    in our cities, being not only separated by proper bounds and limits, but
                    distinguished too by the différent places set apart in each for the celebration
                    oťdivine service, which was performed by particular priests, one to every curia,
                    called <hi rend="italic">curiones.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Before the institution of the comitia centuriata, all the great concerns
                    of the state were transacted in the assembly of the curiae; as the election of
                    kings and other chief officers, the making and abrogating of laws, and the
                    judging of capital crimes. After the expulsion of the kings, when the commons
                    had obtained the privilege of having tribunes and aediĩes, they were for some
                    time elected at these assemblies; but that ceremony being at length transferred
                    to the comitia tributa, the curiae were never convened to give their votes,
                    excepting upon occasion of making some particular law, relating to adoptions,
                    wills, and testaments, or the creation of officers for an expedition, or for
                    electing some of the priests, as the <hi rend="italic">flamines,</hi> and the
                        <hi rend="italic">curio</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus,</hi> who were
                    themselves chosen by every particular curia. The power of calling these
                    assemblies belonged at first only to the kings; but on the establishment of the
                    democracy, this privilege was allowed to most of the magistrates, and sometimes
                    to the pontifiees.</p>
                <p part="N">The persons who had the liberty of voting were such Roman citizens as
                    belonged to the curiae, or actually lived in the city, and conformed to the
                    customs and rites of their proper curiae; and all were excluded who dwelt
                    without the bounds of the city, or retained the ceremonies of their own country,
                    even although they had been honoured with theyŉs <hi rend="italic"
                        >civitatis.</hi> The place w here the curiae met was the <hi rend="italic"
                        >comitium,</hi> a part of the forum. No fixed time was appointed for holding
                    any of the comitia, but they were convened only as business required.</p>
                <p part="N">The people being met together, and confirmed by the report of good omens
                    from the augurs, which was necessary in all the assemblies, the <hi
                        rend="italic">rogatio</hi> or business to be proposed to them was publicly
                    read. After this, if none of the magistrates interposed, upon the order of him
                    who presided in the comitia, the people divided into their proper curiae, and
                    consulted of the matter; and then the curiae being called out, as it happened by
                    lot, gave their <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749261?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-9261-0153"/> votes man by man, in ancient times <hi
                        rend="italic">viva voce,</hi> and afterwards by tablets; the most votes in
                    every curia going for the voice of the whole curia, and the most curiae For the
                    general consent of the people.</p>
                <p part="N">In the time of Cicero, the comitia curiata were so much out of fashion
                    that they were formed only by thirty lictors representing the thirty curiae;
                    whence, in his second oration against Rullus, he calls them <hi rend="italic"
                        >comitia adumbrata.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata</hi> were instituted by Servius
                    Tullius, who had obliged every one to give a true account of what he was worth,
                    and divided the people, according to the returns, into six ranks or classes,
                    which he subdivided into a hundred and ninety-three centuries. The first
                    classis, containing the equites and richest citizens, consisted of ninety-eight
                    centuries. The second, including the tradesmen and mechanics, consisted of
                    twenty-two centuries; the third of twenty; the fourth of twenty-two; the fifth
                    of thirty; and the sixth, composed of the poorer sort, of only one century; but
                    this, though it had the same name with the rest, yet was seldom regarded, and
                    scarcely allowed any power in public matters. ITence it is common with the Roman
                    authors, when they speak of the classes, to reckon no more than five, the sixth
                    not being worth their notice. This last classis or order was divided into two
                    parts or orders, the <hi rend="italic">proletarii</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >capite censi.</hi> The former, as their name implies, were designed purely
                    to stock the republic with men, since they could supply it with so little money;
                    and the latter, who paid the lowest tax of all, were rather counted and
                    marshalled by their heads than by their estates.</p>
                <p part="N">Persons of the first rank, by reason of their pre-eminence, had the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">classici</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the name of
                        <hi rend="italic">classici auctores</hi> came to signify the most approved
                    writers. All others, of what classis soever, were said to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >infra</hi><hi rend="italic">classem.</hi> The assembly <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 7</hi> of the people by centuries was held for the
                    election of consuls, censors, and praetors; as also for the judging of persons
                    accused of what was called <hi rend="italic">crimen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >perduellionis,</hi> or actions by which the party had showed himself an
                    enemy to the state, and for the confirmation of all such laws as were proposed
                    by the chief magistrates, who had the privilege of calling these assemblies.</p>
                <p part="N">The place appointed for their meeting was the <hi rend="italic">campus
                        martius</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> because, in the primitive times of the
                    commonwealth, when they were under continual apprehensions of enemies, the
                    people, to prevent any sudden assault, went armed, in martial order, to
                    hold"these assemblies, and were for that reason forbidden by the laws to meet in
                    the city, because an army was upon no account to be marshalled within the walls;
                    yet, in later ages, it was thought sufficient to place a body of soldiers as <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> guard in the Janiculum, where an imperial standard was
                    erected, the taking down of which denoted the conclusion of the comitia.</p>
                <p part="N">Though the time of holding these comitia for other matters was
                    undetermined, yet the magistrates, after the year of the city 601, when they
                    began to enter upon office on the kalends of January, were constantly <hi
                        rend="italic">designed</hi><hi rend="italic">(designati)</hi> about the end
                    of July and the beginning of August.</p>
                <p part="N">All the time between their election and confirmation they continued as
                    private persons, that inquisition might be made into the election, and that the
                    other candidates might have time to enter objections, if they thought fit to do
                    so. Yet, at the election of the censors, this custom did not hold; for as soon
                    as they were elected they were immediately invested with the honour.</p>
                <p part="N">By the institution of these comitia, Servius Tullius secretly conveyed
                    the whole of the power from the commons; for the centuries of the first and
                    richest class, who were called out first, being more numerous by three than all
                    the rest put together, if they agreed, as they generally did, the business was
                    already decided, and the other classes were needless and insignificant. However,
                    the three last scarcely ever came to vote.</p>
                <p part="N">In the time of freedom, the commons, in order to remedy this
                    disadvantage, obtained that, before the centuries proceeded to vote any matter
                    at these comitia, that century should give its suffrages first upon which it
                    fell by lot to do so, with the name of <hi rend="italic">centuria</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">prerogativa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while the rest were
                    to follow according to the order of their classes. After the constitution of the
                    thirty-five tribes into which the classes and their centuries were divided, the
                    tribes cast lots, in the first place, which should be the <hi rend="italic"
                        >prerogative tribe,</hi> and then the centuries of the tribes also cast lots
                    for the honour of being a prerogative century. All the other tribes and
                    centuries had the appellation of <hi rend="italic">jure vocatae,</hi> because
                    they were called out according to their proper places.</p>
                <p part="N">The prerogative century being chosen by lot, the chief magistrate,
                    sitting in a tent in the middle of the campus martius, ordered that century to
                    come out and give their voices; upon which they presently separated from the
                    rest of the multitude, and came into an inclosed apartment, which they termed
                        <hi rend="italic">septa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ovilia,</hi> passing over
                    the <hi rend="italic">pontes</hi> or narrow boards laid there for the occasion;
                    on which account <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">pontibus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">dęįici</hi> signifies to be denied the privilege of voting,
                    and persons thus dealt with were called <hi rend="italic">depon-tani.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">At the farther end of the pontes stood the <hi rend="italic"
                        >diribitores</hi> (a sort of under officers, so called from their
                    marshalling the people), who delivered to every man, in the election of
                    magistrates, as many tablets as there appeared candidates, and one of these
                    names was written upon every tablet. A proper number of great chests were set
                    ready in the <hi rend="italic">septa,</hi> and every voter threw in which tablet
                    he pleased.</p>
                <p part="N">Close by the chests were stationed some of the public servants, who,
                    taking out the tablets of every century, for every tablet made a prick or a
                    point in another tablet, which was kept for the purpose. Thus, the business
                    being decided by most points, gave occasion to the phrase <hi rend="italic">omne
                        tulit punctum,</hi> and the like.</p>
                <p part="N">The same method was observed in the justiciary process at these comitia,
                    and also in the confirmation of laws, except that, in both these cases, only two
                    tablets were offered to every person, on one of which was written U. R. and on
                    the other A. in capital letters; the two first standing for <hi rend="italic"
                        >ιdi</hi><hi rend="italic">rogas,</hi> “be it as you desire,” relating to
                    the magistrate who proposed the question; and the last for <hi rend="italic"
                        >antiquo,</hi> or “I forbid it.”</p>
                <p part="N">It is remarkable, that though in the election of magistrates, and in the
                    ratification of laws, the votes of that century whose tablets were equally
                    divided signified nothing; yet in the trials of life and death, if the tablets
                    for and against were the same in number, the person was actually acquitted.</p>
                <p part="N">The division of people into <hi rend="italic">tribes</hi> was an
                    invention of Romulus after he had admitted the Sabines into Rome; and though he
                    constituted at that time only three, yet as the state increased in power, and
                    the city in number of inhabitants, they rose by degrees to thirty-five. For a
                    long time after this institution, a <hi rend="italic">tribe</hi> signified no
                    more than a certain space of ground with its inhabitants. But at last the matter
                    was quite altered, and a tribe was no longer <hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">urbis,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >civitatis,</hi> not a quarter of the city, but a company of citizens living
                    wherever they pleased. This change was chiefly occasioned by the original
                    difference between the tribes in point of honour; for Romulus having committed
                    all mechanic arts to the care of strangers, slaves, and libertines, and reserved
                    the labour of agriculture to the freemen and citizens, who by this active course
                    of life might be prepared for martial service, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >tribus</hi><hi rend="italic">τus~</hi><pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194749274?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9274-0154"/><hi
                        rend="italic">ticae</hi> were for this reason esteemed as more honourable
                    than the <hi rend="italic">tribus urbanoe.</hi> And now all persons being
                    desirous of getting into the more creditable division, and there being several
                    ways of accomplishing their wishes, as by adoption, by the power of censors, or
                    the like, that rustic tribe which had the most worthy names in its roll had the
                    preference to all others, though of the same general denomination. Hence all of
                    the same great family bringing themselves by degrees into the same tribe, gave
                    the name of their family to the tribe which they honoured; whereas at first the
                    generality of the tribes did not receive their names from persons, but from
                    places.</p>
                <p part="N">The first assembly of the tribes we meet with is about the year of Rome
                    263, having been convened by Sp. Sici-nius, tribune of the commons, upon account
                    of the trial of Coriolanus. Soon after the tribunes of the commons were ordered
                    to be elected here, and at last all the inferior magistrates and the collegiate
                    priests. The same comitia served for enacting laws relating to war and peace,
                    and all others proposed by the tribunes and plebeian officers, though they had
                    not properly the name of <hi rend="italic">leges,</hi> but only that of <hi
                        rend="italic">plebiscita.</hi> They were generally convened by the tribunes
                    of the commons; but the same privilege was allowed to all the chief magistrates.
                    They were confined to no place; and therefore we sometimes find them held in the
                    comitium, sometimes in the campus martius, and now and then in the capitol. The
                    proceedings were in most respects conformable to those already described in the
                    account of the other comitia, and therefore need not be insisted on. We may only
                    observe further of the comitia in general, that when any candidate was found to
                    have most tablets for a magistracy, he was declared to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >designed</hi> or elected by the president of the assembly, and this they
                    termed <hi rend="italic">renuneiari consul, preetor,</hi> or the like; and that
                    the last sort of the comitia only could be held without the consent or
                    approbation of the senate, which was necessary to the convening of the other
                    two.</p>
