                    much strengthened by the constant habit of getting by heart, and it does not
                    appear that the judgment is at all impaired by it. He afterwards pursued his
                    studies under Father Brisson, and in 1717 supported a thesis on the Cartesian
                    philosophy, which the Jesuits were then beginning to introduce into their
                    seminaries, while it was elsewhere giving way to the Newtonian. In 1719, after
                    he had left college, he entered the army, and accompanied his uncle, the
                    Chevalier de Chources, to the siege of Rosas, as a volunteer; and both on this
                    and other occasions he exhibited sufficient proofs of the contempt of danger and
                    the spirit <hi rend="italic">of</hi> enterprise which were so much required in
                    those pursuits that afterwards occupied a considerable portion of his life.
                    Notwithstanding the dissipations in which military men are very commonly
                    involved, he was moderate in the pursuit of pleasure; and lie used to consider
                    the distortion which the small-pox had left in his features as having afforded
                    him some compensation for the injury done to his vanity, by diminishing the
                    temptations to which his sensibility might otherwise have exposed him.</p>
                <p part="N">Having no prospect of speedy advancement in the army, and having
                    suffered considerably in his fortune from a participation in the extravagant
                    speculations of Law, he quitted the service, in hopes of finding a more
                    advantageous employment in science. He distinguished himself as an active member
                    of a society of arts, then recently established at Paris by the Count de
                    Clermont; and, in 1730, he obtained a situation in the Academy of Sciences, as
                    adjunct of the class of chemistry, having previously presented to the academy a
                    memoir on the mathematical and mechanical properties of the lathe, which
                    obtained him considerable credit. Soon afterwards he embarked in the squadron of
                    Duguay Trouin, and made a voyage in different parts of the Mediterranean; he
                    passed several months at Constantinople, and visited the plain of Troy, and many
                    other parts of the Levant; after his return he gave an account of his tour to
                    the academy; and a servant, who had accompanied him, published also a separate
                    journal of his own.</p>
                <p part="N">Chemistry, as it was cultivated at that period, afforded' but little
                    scope for the employment of an active mind; and La Condamine, after the
                    publication of one chemical memoir only, was removed from the class of chemists
                    in the academy to that of astronomers. In this capacity he was the first to
                    propose the measurement of a degree of latitude in the neighbourhood of the
                    equator; and he seems to have felt the importance of the undertaking, not only
                    for the purpose of deciding a great question in science, but also for that of
                    attracting the attention of the public, and establishing the system of
                    gravitation in France by a grand operation, executed, with great labour and at a
                    great distance, by Frenchmen only. His ideas were readily seconded by Maurepas,
                    then prime minister; and he was appointed by the academy, together with Bouguer
                    and Godin, for carrying the proposal into effect.</p>
                <p part="N">In this expedition he was absent from his country for nearly ten years,
                    from 1735 to 1745; and he had to combat with difficulties of every kind. <hi

                    uninhabited country; impracticable roads; want of regular remittances; the
                    necessity of disposing of valuable articles disadvantageously, in order to
                    procure a temporary supply; a malicious prosecution upon the pretence of a
                    contraband traffic, founded only on this circumstance; and the still more
                    violent attacks of a fanatical mob, who murdered the surgeon of the expedition:
                    all these tilings, to say nothing of the awful appearance of an eruption of
                    Cotopaxi, and the no less formidable operations of the hostile squadron of Lord
                    Anson, required nothing less than the dauntless spirit and energy of character
                    which he possessed, to bear him up against them; and at last the little
                    jealousies, which will often arise among persons of science employed in the same
                    pursuits, embarrassed and embittered the conclusion of his enterprise. The
                    activity and fluency of La Condamine made the public disposed to imagine that
                    Bouguer had been only his humble attendant; and Bouguer was too conscious of his
                    own superiority as a mathematician to bear this injustice with patience. He
                    complained, but the laugh was against him; and he revenged himself by refusing
                    all communication in the statement of the results of the operations; so that
                    each observer gave ultimately a separate account of his own measurements and
                    calculations.</p>
                <p part="N">In consequence of all the fatigues and vicissitudes to which La
                    Ċondamine had been exposed, he became extremely deaf, and partially paralytic,
                    after his return; but the powers of his mind appear to have remained
                    unimpaired.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1748 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of London;
                    and he afterwards exerted himself with great zeal and success in promoting,
                    among his countrymen, the general introduction of the variolous inoculation,
                    which had long been practised in England, and in some other parts of Europe. In
                    1757 he took a journey to Italy, and spent a considerable time at Rome, partly
                    with a view to the improvement of his health, and to the observation of a
                    variety of facts connected with his scientific pursuits; but principally,
                    perhaps, in order to obtain a dispensation from the pope for a marriage with his
                    niece, who seems to have had a high respect for his talents, and even a sincere
                    attachment to his person, notwithstanding the disparity of their ages, and the
                    caprices of a temper not a little impatient and irritable. He became, in 1760,
                    one of the forty members of the French Academy, and contributed considerably to
                    an improved edition of their dictionary. In 1763 he paid a short visit to
                    England, which was rendered less agreeable to him on account of the difficulty

                    retaining only the amusement of making some light attempts in poetry, and
                    occasionally inserting in the periodical works of the day a few tales in verse,
                    besides a poetical translation of a part of Virgil’s <hi rend="italic"

                    Domingo more than three months, and they took advantage of the delay in order to
                    ascertain the length of the pendulum in that latitude. Mr de la Condaιniue
                    employed a ball of brass, suspended by a thread of the aloe, and attached to it
                    by means of a piece of ' sticking plaster; the pendulum making a vibration in
                    about two seconds, he observed in how many vibrations a second was lost or
                    gained. The length thus determined was thirty-six French inches seven and a
                    quarter lines, or 39Ό125 English inches. Messrs Godin and Bouguer made it one
                    twelfth of a line longer, or 39∙020; and a calculation from the best modern
                    observations for the latitude, which was 18° 27', gives us 39∙029. The thread
                    was fixed by a clip, and it was probably very flexible, since its rigidity must
                    necessarily have tended to increase the curvature of the path of the ball, and
                    to give a measure somewhat too long. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    of more than 2000 miles, which he performed partly by land, but principally on a
                    raft, he had an opportunity of making a multitude of interesting observations of
                    various kinds. He found in several places a singular agreement of traditions
                    respecting the former existence of a republic of women only, in the
                    neighbourhood of the river which has received its most usual denomination from
                    them. He observed the effect of the tides at Pauxis, a point 600 miles from the
                    mouth of the river, but not much elevated above it; and he was informed that
                    there were always a number of alternations at high and low water at the same
                    time between this point and the mouth of the river; in some places, where the
                    water was shallow, he encountered the tide rising in the form of a bore, called
                    by the French a <hi rend="italic">barre</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mascaret,</hi>

                    of the pendulum there, and found that the force of gravitation was about -ŗŋðļ,
                    greater than at the summit of Pichincha. He next proceeded to Cayenne, and was
                    obliged, on account of the war, to return to Europe by a Dutch ship, which
                    sailed from Surinam.</p>

                    the various superstitious and interested motives which retarded the practice in
                    France, while it had become universally prevalent in England; although, in more
                    recent times, the public spirit in this country appears to be somewhat less
                    favourably disposed to the admission of beneficial innovations; for scarcely in
                    any part of the world has vaccination become less universal than it is at this
                    time in Great Britain.</p>

                    1757, p. 336, H. P. 6. From an examination of several ancient standards, and
                    from a comparison of the remains of buildings supposed to have occupied a
                    certain round number of feet, Mr de la Condamine concludes that the old Roman
                    foot was equal to 130 ’ 9 French lines; that is, to 969 thousandths of an
                    English foot. Mr Folkes had before made it 966; but Mr Raper has shown, in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1760, by a very
                    careful comparison of a multitude of documents, that, before the reign of Titus,
                    it somewhat exceeded 970, and under Severus and Diocletian it was less than 965;
                    the original standard in the temple of Juno Moneta having probably been
                    destroyed by fire. Mr de la Condamine also viewed the races on the Corso with an
                    eye equally mathematical, and observeďthat the Barbary horses ran at the rate of
                    about forty English feet in a second; but his correspondents in England
                    furnished him with unexceptionable evidence that the horse <hi rend="italic"
                        >Childers</hi> ran the four mile course at Newmarket at the rate of very
                    nearly fifty English feet in a second, while no other horse exceeded
                    forty-eight; and he observes that, in this instance, truth far outruns
                    probability; a remark which has been somewhat misrepresented in this country,
                    and converted, by the lovers of the amusements of the turf, into a laugh against
                    the lovers of the amusements of science; the story being told as if the French
                    mathematicians had demonstrated the absolute maximum of a horse’s utmost
                    possible speed, and, a bet having been made on the occasion, an English horse
                    had been found that actually exceeded the maximum. Our author also notices the
                    awkward effect of the Roman mode of beginning the day at sunset, which renders
                    it necessary to make continual alterations in the clocks, directions being given
                    in the almanacks for putting them forwards or backwards a quarter of an hour at
                    a time; and the precise time of noon happening in summer at sixteen o’clock, and
                    in winter not till nineteen. He observes that a single signal, properly placed
                    on the Apennines, would be visible at once near Trieste and near Monaco, giving
                    a difference of longitude of not less than five degrees.</p>

                    which several of them repeated with success. In fact, there was scarcely any one
                    of the sciences to which he did not occasionally render some service, although
                    he wanted patience and perseverance to make any very important discoveries or
                    improvements by his individual exertions only. But his knowledge was universal;
                    he understood and wrote all languages; he corresponded with men of celebrity in
                    all countries; he published upon all subjects; he contributed to all the
                    literary and scientific journals of the day; he answered all criticisms, and he
                    accepted all compliments, even from persons whom he despised; for he delighted
                    in the parade of a pre-eminent reputation. His style was simple and natural,
                    somewhat negligent, but still elegant and lively; his manner was animated and
                    somewhat singular; his temper was warm and restless; he sighed for repose, and
                    was incapable of enjoying it; thinking nothing that occurred indifferent to him,
                    and allowing none about him'to be idle. He obtained the rank of chevalier in
                    several orders, and was a member of several foreign academies; he had also the
                    appointment of honorary secretary to the Duke of Orleans. At the age of
                    sixty-eight he addressed to his wife an account of his education, and of the
                    earlier progress of his mental faculties, as a practical illustration of his
                    opinions respecting the cultivation of the mind. The memoir was not published;
                    but it is perhaps unfortunate for mankind that men of celebrity seldom find a
                    sufficient motive for communicating candidly to the world the results of such a
                    self-examination. A few years before his death he printed a memorial in behalf
                    of Mr Godin, who had been reduced to indigent circumstances; and he had the
                    pleasure of obtaining for him the assistance which he required. He suffered
                    occasionally from a hernia, and having read of the marvellous cures which some
                    empiric professed to have performed by the application of a caustic, he
                    determined to make the experiment on himself, without the knowledge of his
                    family, and without much hope of success; but he fell a victim to the courage or
                    the curiosity that prompted him to submit to the operation. In the course of the
                    six weeks that he survived, he was still employed in writing or dictating a
                    memoir containing answers to some questions respecting the manners of the
                    Americans. He died on the 4th February 1774, leaving many of his books and
                    instruments by will to the Academy of Sciences. <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Acad.
