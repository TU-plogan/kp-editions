                            >Marie-Anne-Charlotte</hi></label>, was born in 1768, at St Saturnin,
                    near Séez, in Normandy, and descended of a noble family. After the events of the
                    31st May 1793, the heads of the republican party of the convention, Guadet,
                    Gensonné, Pétion, and others, having been proscribed by Robespierre, sought
                    refuge in the departments of the Eure and the Calvados, where they hoped to stir
                    up in their favour the numerous population of Normandy. At this time the works
                    of certain popular writers, and particularly those of the Abbé.Raynal, her
                    favourite author, had obliterated from the mind of Charlotte Çorday those
                    lessons of gentleness and resignation which she had imbibed in the peaceful
                    convent where she had been educated; whilst the cause of the refugees, which she
                    now accounted alike honourable and patriotic, the energy and charm of their
                    conversation, and the interest which a generous nature always feels in behalf of
                    men of merit unjustly persecuted, excited beyond measure her ardent imagination.
                    Accordingly, observing that those around her manifested but little desire to
                    inflict vengeance upon the oppressors <hi rend="italic">of</hi> her country, she
                    resolved singly to strike a blow which should spread terror and dismay among the
                    ranks of the .triumphant faction. She thcrefore ’ repaired to Paris, where she
                    at first occupied herself in endeavouring to ascertain the temper of the public
                    mind; and she then managed to get introduced to the gallery of the convention by
                    the Abbé Fauchet, to whom she applied for the purpose, and who soon afterwards
                    ex piated on the scaffold this simple act of complaisance towards an unknown
                    female stranger. At that time the convention resounded with the most violent
                    declamations against the proscribed patriots, and the only question was who
                    should propose to adopt the most furious measures against them. Such vehement
                    invectives against men whose cause she had embraced, redoubled the indignation
                    of Charlotte Corday, and she hesitated no longer about executing the project she
                    had formed. Marat, who of all the conventional deputies had contributed the most
                    publicly to the revolution of the 31st May, had not for several days made his
                    appearance in the assembly. But this extraordinary woman, whose purpose nothing
                    could shake, having discovered his lodging, wrote to him in these terms:—
                    “Citizen, I have just arrived from Caen. Your love for your native place
                    doubtless makes you desirous to learn the events which have occurred in that
                    part of the republic. I shall call at your residence in about an hour;— have the
                    goodness to receive me ;—I will put you in a condition to render a great service
                    to France.” This letter, and a second of a similar description, having remained
                    unanswered, she wrote a third, on the 15th July 1793, in which she spoke of
                    great secrets which she had to reveal, and of personal misfortunes to which she
                    hoped the generous soul of Marat would not be insensible. She followed the
                    bearer of this last billet, and arrived almost as soon as he at the door of the
                    deputy. Two women, who were in the antichamber, refused at first to allow her to
                    enter; but Marat, having gathered from their conversation that it was the person
                    who had repeatedly written to him, ordered her to be admitted. He was then in a
                    bathingtub, being afflicted with a disgusting malady, which had reduced him
                    almost to a state of putrefaction. The conversation commenced as to what was
                    passing in the Calvados, when Marat inquired of his unknown visitor the names of
                    the deputies and administrators who were then at Caen and at Evreux, wrote them
                    down from her dictation, and ended by saying, that in a few days he would cause
                    them all to be guillotined at Paris. This was enough. Without waiting to hear
                    more, she drew a knife which she had concealed under her gown, and buried it to
                    the hilt in the breast of Marat, who, having exclaimed “A moi, ma chère amie !”
                    almost instantly expired. The two women, alarmed by the noise, rushed into the
                    apartment just as the wretch was breathing his last, whilst Corday, still
                    holding the bloody knife in her hand, endeavoured to make her escape. Not daring
                    to lay hold of her, the women overturned some articles of furniture in her way,
                    and shouted out murder. The guard arrived, and the heroic assassin being seized,
                    was immediately handed over to the revolutionary tribunal. But her firmness did
                    not for an instant forsake her. Fouquicr-Tinville attempting to pronounce an
                    eulogy on the murdered terrorist, she interrupted him sharply, declaring that
                    Marat was a monster, w ho well merited his fate. The offence and all its
                    circumstances being not only confessed, but defended by the accused as a
                    meritorious and patriotic act, her doom could not for a moment be doubtful.
                    Still this bloody tribunal, which had so often condemned without evidence or
                    against it, affected to exhaust all the ordinary judicial formalities before
                    pronouncing sentence, and appointed Chauveau-Lagarde to defend the accused. The
                    defence consisted merely of a repetition of the confession which the prisoner
                    herself had previously made, with a striking allusion to the imperturbable
                    tranquillity and sublime abnegation of every personal or selfish consideration
                    exhibited by her almost in the presence of death itsélf, and a hint, which,
                    however, was wholly thrown away, that she might have acted under the influence
                    of some strong mental hallucination. The prisoner gracefully thanked <pb

                    hcr counsel for the few words he had uttered in her defence, declaring at the
                    same time that the only plea worthy of her was an avowal of the act in which she
                    gloried; and she heard sentence of death pronounced with the same unequalled
                    serenity, and without the least perceptible change either in the colour or the
                    expression of her countenance. The same extraordinary force of character or
                    strength of enthusiasm sustained her in her last moments, and rendered her at
                    once an object of interest, astonishment, and terror. On her way to the
                    guillotine she was assailed, without being in the slightest degree affected, by
                    the bootings of the rabble; and, in presence of the apparatus of death, she
                    stood unmoved, whilst her fine and noble figure seemed to assume a more
                    dignified and imposing attitude. When the executioner proceeded to remove part
                    of her dress, the sentiment of offended mo-. desty was strongly expressed by her
                    features; but as to the life of which she was about to be deprived, it seemed
                    not to cost her a thought, nor to give her an instant’s concern. She was
                    decapitated on the 17th July 1793, at the age of twenty-five. (Couet de
