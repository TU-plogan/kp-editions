                <p part="N"><label type="entry">CONGELATION</label></p>
                <p part="N">Is the passage of any substance from the liquid to the so-∣ lid form, in
                    consequence of the abstraction of heat. The conversion of water into ice could
                    not fail to draw the notice of men in all ages. The minute and divided fragments
                    of the same production^ which descend from the clouds in the shape of snow or
                    hail, displayed the various powers of nature. The ancients imagined that water
                    which has lain for ages in a frozen state acquires at last a permanent
                    consolidation. They extended accordingly the name of ice <hi rend="italic"
                        >(%gυ&lt;fraλλoi or crystal}</hi> to the pure and pellucid kind of quartz
                    which often occurs on the sides of lofty mountains, near the boundary of
                    perpetual congelation.</p>
                <p part="N">It was early remarked that melted ice has the lightness and quality of
                    boiled water. In fact, the portion of air combined with ordinary water is
                    discharged in the act of freezing, as well as in that of boiling. Water thus
                    deprived of its air is therefore prepared for a readier congelation. The
                    ancients accordingly, we have seen, always boiled the water which they designed
                    afterwards to cool. Aristotle relates, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Metcorotogy,</hi> that the fishermen who cast their nets in the Pontine
                    Lake, used to carry in close vessels boiled water, for the purpose of sprinkling
                    the reeds, that these might quickly freeze together, and cease to disturb the
                    fish by their rustling noise. The expulsion of air from water during the
                    progress of congelation, was afterwards fully proved by Mariotte, one of the
                    earliest members of the French Academy of Sciences. If two wine glasses, filled,
                    the one with water from the well, and the other with water recently boiled, be
                    exposed to the frost, the ice of the latter will seem almost uniformly pellucid,
                    while the ice of the former will appear charged with small air-bubbles crowding
                    towards the centre of the mass, to which they arc driven by the advance of the
                    congelation.</p>
                <p part="N">That congelation shoots at angles of 120 degrees, was first observed in
                    the beginning of the seventeenth century by the great Kepler; and this ardent
                    and inventive genius, in an elaborate dissertation, which he printed as a new
                    year’s present, investigated the various forms and modifications of the icy
                    crystals. The subject was next discussed by Des Cartes and Bartholinus, and
                    about a century afterwards resumed by Mairan, and may be considered as a step
                    towards the general theory of crystallography, which has been since reared by
                    the patience and ingenuity of Haüy.</p>
                <p part="N">Other liquids, such as vinegar, dilute mineral acids, weak spirits, and
                    saline solutions, are likewise capable of&lt; being frozen; but they yield an
                    ice distinctly different' from that of pure water, resembling an aggregation
                    rather than an uniform solid, and wanting consistency, strength, and clearness.
                    The frost appears to seize on the water only, and to fill the compound liquid
                    with close spicular shoots, entangling the stronger acid or brine in their
                    interstices. It was a mistake, therefore, to assert that the ice of sea-water is
                    really fresh. In the process of melting, some portion of the brine may probably
                    flow off, but the residue still is always brackish. This fact is even positively
                    stated by the missionary Crantz, in his accurate account of Greenland. The Very
                    intelligent and enterprising navigator Mr Scoresby reckons the specific gra~</p>

                <p part="N">vity of the spongy salt-water ice to be *873, while that of fresh-water
                    ice amounted to ∙937.</p>
                <p part="N">The ancients were altogether unacquainted with artificial congelation,
                    and with any cold, indeed, below that of freezing. The application of nitre to
                    the cooling of water seems, before the close of the sixteenth century, to have
                    suggested to the Italians the experiment of mixing it with snow. A very intense
                    degree of cold was thus generated, capable of converting speedily into solid ice
                    a body of water contained in a smaller vessel immersed in the dissolving
                    mixture. Sanctorio, who may be regarded as the father of modern physics,
                    mentions, in his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Avicenna,</hi> that he produced
                    the same effect by employing common salt instead of nitre, in the proportion of
                    the third part of the snow, and had repeatedly performed the experiment in the
                    presence of a numerous auditory.</p>
                <p part="N">From Italy this discovery was gradually communicated over the rest of
                    Europe. In the course of the seventeenth century iced creams, fruits, and
                    various confitures, were first produced on the tables of the luxurious. The
                    famous coffeehouse, <hi rend="italic">Procope,</hi> was founded at Paris in
                    1G6O, by a Florentine of that name, a vender of lemonade, who was very
                    successful in the art of preparing rich ices. Thirty years afterwards the use of
                    such artificial delicacies in that city had become quite common.</p>
                <p part="N">The cold resulting from the addition of saline powders to snow or
                    pounded ice, depends on the powerful attraction of those salts, which restores
                    the frozen mass to its liquid form, and therefore augments its capacity for
                    heat. Fahrenheit fixed the commencement of his thermometrical scale at the
                    temperature of the compound of salt and snow, conceiving it to be the lowest
                    possible; but much lower degrees of cold are now produced. One part of the
                    muriate of soda, or purified common salt, being added to two parts of dry snow
                    or pounded ice, will sink the thermometer five degrees below zero. One part of
                    sal-ammoniac, and two of common salt, joined to five parts of snow, will bring
                    it seven degrees lower; but equal parts of the nitrate of ammonia and common
                    salt, joined to two parts and a half of snow, will depress the thermometer
                    twenty-five degrees below the freezing point.</p>
                <p part="N">Still more intense cold might be produced, if the ingredients were,
                    before their mixture, cooled down to congelation. Thus* five parts of the
                    muriate of lime, added to four parts of snow, will sink the thermometer to forty
                    degrees below the beginning of the scale, or the limit of freezing mercury; and
                    if the muriate of lime were crystallized, the effect would be ten degrees more.
                    The same extreme energy is exerted on adding four parts of dry caustic potash to
                    three parts of snow.</p>
                <p part="N">The mineral acids likewise, in a diluted state, produce similar effects.
                    Two parts of weak sulphuric acid, joined to three of snow, will sink the
                    thermometer to twentythree degrees below zero. The muriatic and nitric acids, in
                    nearly the same proportions, will depress it from four to seven degrees more.’
                    By repeating the applications, therefore, a most intense cold may be created;
                    yet, to succeed completely, a skilful manipulation is required. The saline
                    matters should be reduced to a fine powder, and the freezing mixtures should be
                    made in very thin vessels, not larger than will barely hold them. In this way,
                    by successive stages of cooling, Mr Walker once obtained the enormous cold of
                    ninety-one degrees below the commencement of Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>
                <p part="N">The mere evaporation of some very volatile liquids is sufficient to
                    produce excessive cold. Thus, if a thermometer, having its bulb covered with
                    lint, be dipped in the common or sulphuric ether, it will, on exposure to the
                    air, sink perhaps thirty or forty degrees. This effect is augmented under the
                    receiver of an air-pump. If a nar row thin tube of glass, filled with water, and
                    cased on the outside with lint soaked in ether, be suspended above the pump, and
                    the exhaustion quickly made, a cylinder of ice will be formed.</p>
                <p part="N">The same property is manifested in a higher degree by a singular liquid,
                    discovered by Lampadius in 1796, by distilling a mixture of pyrites and
                    charcoal. It was called at first the <hi rend="italic">alcohol of sulphur,</hi>
                    but now more appropriately the <hi rend="italic">sulphuret of carbon.</hi>
                    According to Dr Marcet, who has completed the investigation of its properties, a
                    thermometer having its bulb covered with lint wetted by this liquid, and held in
                    the open air, will sink not fewer than sixty degrees; but if the same experiment
                    be performed within the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, the alcohol of the
                    barometer will even descend to eighty-two degrees below zero. It must be
                    observed, however, that these effects produced by the evaporation of ether, and
                    of the sulphuret of carbon, are quite evanescent, and that the receiver becomes
                    soon charged with their fumes, which then prevent any farther action. Those
                    fumes likewise corrode the valves of the pump, and soon render it quite useless.
                    Neither ether, therefore, nor the sulphuret of carbon, could be applied in
                    practice with any sort of advantage to the production of ice, even on the
                    smallest scale.</p>
                <p part="N">We have now to relate a discovery which will enable human skill to
                    command the refrigerating powers of nature, and, by the help of an adequate
                    machinery, to create cold and produce ice, on a large scale, at all seasons, and
                    in the hottest climates of the globe; but to explain this interesting subject
                    with greater clearness and accuracy, it is requisite to trace the successive
                    advances which conducted to the result. Where a conclusion appears simple, the
                    careless observer is apt to suppose it easily attained; yet, though sound
                    philosophy tends always to simplification, the rare quality of simplicity is
                    scarcely ever the flash of intuition, but the slow fruit of close and patient
                    investigation. In pursuing the researches with his hygrometer, Professor Leslie
                    was early induced to inquire into the condition of the higher atmosphere, and
                    its relations to humidity. He thus detected a fact of great importance in
                    meteorology, and pointing at various ulterior views.</p>
                <p part="N">’ As rarefaction enlarges the capacity of air for heat, so it likewise
                    augments the disposition to hold moisture; at the same time that the removal of
                    the ordinary pressure facilitates the expansion of the liquid matter, and its
                    conversion into a gaseous form. Accordingly, if the hygrometer be suspended
                    within a large receiver, from which a certain portion of air is quickly
                    abstracted, it will sink with rapidity. In summer, the additional dryness thus
                    produced amounts to about fifty hygrometric degrees each time the air has its
                    rarefaction doubled; so that, supposing the operation of exhausting to be
                    performed with expedition, and the residuum reduced to a sixty-fourth part, the
                    hygrometer would mark a descent of 300°. But this effect is only momentary, for
                    the thin air very soon becomes charged with moisture, and, consequently, ceases
                    to act on the wet ball of the hygrometer. The cold, however, excited on the
                    surface of that ball, by such intense evaporation, will have previously frozen
                    the coating.</p>
                <p part="N">The increased power of aqueous solution which air acquires as it grows
                    thinner, being ascertained and carefully investigated, the object was to combine
                    the action of absorbent with the transient dryness produced within a receiver by
                    rarefaction. The sentient ball of the hygrometer being covered with dry salt of
                    tartar, the instrument first indicated increasing dryness, and afterwards, as
                    the rarefaction proceeded, it changed its course, and marked humidity. The same
                    variation of effect nearly was observed<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194748091?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-8091-0063"/> when the
                    hygrometer had been wetted as usual with pure water, and a broad saucer
                    containing the mild vegetable alkali was plaecd on the plate of the air-pump. It
                    was thus proved that the action of this impel feet absorbent is soon overpowered
                    by the tendency to vaporization in attenuated air, and that, beyond a certain
                    limit, it surrenders its latent moisture.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Leslie resolved, therefore, to try the effect of sulphuric acid,
                    whose peculiar energy as an absorbent he had, under other circumstances, already
                    ascertained; but various incidents prevented him, for a considerable time, from
                    resuming his philosophical inquiries. At last he began those projected
                    experiments, and was almost immediately rewarded by the disclosure of a
                    property, the application of which blazed on his fancy. In the month of June
                    1810, having introduced a surface of sulphuric acid under the receiver of an
                    air-pump, he perceived with pleasure that this substance only superadded its
                    peculiar attraction for moisture to the ordinary effects resulting from the
                    progress of exhaustion; and, what was still more important, that it continued to
                    support with undiminished energy the dryness thus created. The attenuated air
                    was not suffered as before to grow charged with humidity; but each portion of
                    that medium, as fast as it became saturated by touching the wet ball of the
                    hygrometer, transported its vapour to the acid, and was thence sent back denuded
                    of the load, and fitted again to renew its attack with fresh vigour. By this
                    perpetual circulation, therefore, between the exhaling and the absorbing
                    surface, the diffuse residuum of air is maintained constantly at the same state
                    of dryness. The sentient ball of the hygrometer, which had been covered with
                    several folds of wetted tissue paper, was observed, at an early stage of the
                    operation, suddenly to lose its blue tint and assume a dull white, while the
                    coloured liquor sprung upwards in the stem, where it continued for the space of
                    a minute stationary, and again slowly subsided. The act of congelation had
                    therefore at this moment taken place, and the paper remained frozen several
                    minutes, till its congealed moisture was entirely dispersed. Pursuing this
                    decisive intimation, the hygrometer was removed, and a watch-glass filled with
                    water substituted in its place. By a few strokes of the pump the whole was
                    converted into a solid cake of ice, which being left in the rare medium,
                    continued to evaporate, and, after the interval of perhaps an hour, totally
                    disappeared. A small cup for holding the water was next adopted, and the whole
                    apparatus gradually enlarged.</p>
                <p part="N">The powers both of vaporization and of absorption be- .ing greatly
                    augmented in the higher temperatures, the; same limit of cold nearly is in all
                    cases attained by a certain measure of exhaustion. When the air has been
                    rarefied 250 times, the utmost that, under such circumstances, can perhaps be
                    effected, the surface of evaporation is cooled down 120 degrees of Fahrenheit in
                    winter, and would probably sink near 200 in summer. Nay, a far less tenuity of
                    the medium, when combined with the action of sulphuric acid, is capable of
                    producing and supporting a very intense cold. If the air be rarefied only 50
                    times, a depression of temperature will be produced, amounting to 80 or even 100
                    degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>
                <p part="N">We are thus enabled, in the hottest weather, to freeze ŗ.a mass of
                    water, and to keep it frozen, till it gradually wastes away, by a continued but
                    invisible process of evaporation. The only thing required is, that the surface
                    of the acid should approach tolerably near to that of the water, and should have
                    a greater extent; for otherwise the moisture would exhale more copiously than it
                    could be transferred and absorbed; and, consequently, the dryness ol the
                    rarefied medium would become reduced, and its evaporating energy essentially
                    impaired. The acid should be poured to the depth perhaps of half an inch, in a
                    broad flat dish, which is covered by a receiver of a form nearly hemispherical;
                    the water exposed to congelation may be contained in a shallow cup, about half
                    the width of the dish, and having its rim supported by a narrow porcelain ring,
                    upheld above the surface of the acid by three slender feet. (See fig. 1 and 2,
                    Plate CLXXIII.) It is of consequence that the water should be insulated as much
                    as possible, or should present only a humid surface to the contact of the
                    surrounding medium; for the dry sides of the cup might receive, from
                    communication with the external air, such accessions of heat as greatly to
                    diminish, if not to counteract, the refrigerating effects of evaporation. This
                    inconvenience, however, is in a great measure obviated, by investing the cup
                    with an outer case at the interval of about half an inch. If both the cup and
                    its case consist of glass, the process of congelation is viewed most completely;
                    yet when they are formed of a bright metal, the effect appears on the whole more
                    striking. But the preferable mode, and that which prevents any waste of the
                    powers of refrigeration, is to expose the water in a pan of porous earthenware.
                    If common w ater be used, it will evolve air bubbles very copiously as the
                    exhaustion proceeds; in a few minutes, and long before the limit of rarefaction
                    has been attained, the icy spiculae will shoot beautifully through the liquid
                    mass, and entwine it with a reticulated contexture. As the process of
                    congelation goes forward, a new discharge of air from the substance of the water
                    takes place, and marks the regular advances of consolidation; but after the
                    water has all become solid ice, w hich, unless it exceed the depth of an inch,
                    may generally be effected in less than half an hour, the circle of evaporation
                    and subsequent absorption is still maintained. A minute film of ice, abstracting
                    from the internal mass a redoubled share of heat, passes, by invisible
                    transitions, successively into the state of water and of steam, which,
                    dissolving in the thin ambient air, is conveyed to the acid, where it again
                    assuiŉes the liquid form, and, in the act of combination, likewise surrenders
                    its heat.</p>
                <p part="N">In performing this experiment, the object is generally to seek at first
                    to push the rarefaction as far as the circumstances will admit. But the
                    disposition of the water to fill the receiver with vapour being only in part
                    subdued by the action of the sulphuric acid, a limit is soon opposed to the
                    progress of exhaustion; and the included air can seldom be rarefied above a
                    hundred times, or till its elasticity can support no more than a column of
                    mercury about three tenths of an inch in height. A smaller rarefaction, perhaps
                    from ten times to twenty times, will be found sufficient to support congelation
                    after it has once taken place. The ice then becomes rounded by degrees at the
                    edges, and wastes away insensibly, its surface being incessantly corroded by the
                    play of the ambient air, and the minute exhalations conveyed by an invisible
                    process to the sulphuric acid, which, from its absorbing the vapour, is all the
                    time maintained above the temperature of the apartment. The ice, kept in this
                    way, suffers a very slow consumption; for a lump of it, about a pound in w eight
                    and two inches thick, is sometimes not entirely gone in the space of eight or
                    ten days. During the whole progress of its wasting, the ice still commonly
                    retains an uniform transparent consistence; but, in a more advanced stage, it
                    occasionally betrays a sort of honeycombed appearance, owing to the minute
                    cavities formed by globules of air, set loose in the act of freezing, yet
                    entangled in the mass, and which are afterwards enlarged by the erosion of the
                    solvent medium.</p>

                    frozen, by leaving it, perhaps for the space of an hour, to the slow action of
                    air that has been rarefied only in a very moderate degree. This process meets
                    with less impediment; and the ice formed by it appears likewise more compact,
                    when the water has been already purged of the greater part of its combined air,
                    either by distillation or by long-continued boiling. The water which has
                    undergone such operation should be introduced as quickly as possible into a
                    decanter, and filled up close to the stopper, else it will attract air most
                    greedily, and return nearly to its former state in the course of a few
                    hours.</p>
                <p part="N">The most elegant and instructive mode of effecting artificial
                    congelation, is to perform the process under the transferrer of an air-pump. A
                    thick but clear glass cup being selected, of about two or three inches in
                    diameter, has its lips ground flat, and covered occasionally, though not
                    absolutely shut, with a broad circular lid of plate glass, which is suspended
                    horizontally from a rod passing through a collar of leather (see fig. 6, Plate
                    CLXXIII.) This cup is nearly filled with fresh distilled water, and supported by
                    a slender metallic ring, with glass feet, about an inch above the surface of a
                    body of sulphuric acid, perhaps three quarters of an inch in thickness, and
                    occupying the bottom of a deep glass basin that has a diameter of nearly seven
                    inches. In this state the receiver being adapted, and the lid pressed down to
                    cover the mouth of the cup, the transferrer is screwed to the air-pump, and the
                    rarefaction, under those circumstances, pushed so far as to leave only about the
                    hundred and fiftieth part of a residuum; and the cock being turned to secure
                    that exhaustion, the compound apparatus is then detached from the pump, and
                    removed to some convenient apartment. As long as the cup is covered, the water
                    will remain quite unaltered; but on drawing up the rod half an inch or more, to
                    admit the play of the rare medium, a bundle of spicular ice will, after the
                    lapse perhaps of five minutes, dart suddenly through the whole of the liquid
                    mass; and the consolidation will afterwards descend regularly, thickening the
                    horizontal stratum by insensible gradations, and forming in its progress a
                    beautiful transparent cake. On letting down the cover again, the process of
                    evaporation being now checked or almost entirely stopped, the ice returns slowly
                    into its former liquid condition. In this way the same portion of water may,
                    even at distant intervals of time, be repeatedly congealed and thawed
                    successively twenty or thirty times. During the first operations of freezing,
                    some air is liberated; but this extrication diminishes at each subsequent act;
                    and the ice, free from the smallest specks, resembles a piece of the purest
                    crystal.</p>
                <p part="N">This artificial freezing of water in a cup of glass or metal affords the
                    best opportunity of examining the progress of crystallization. The appearance
                    presented, however, is extremely various. When the frigorifie action is most
                    intense, the congelation sweeps at once over the whole surface of the water,
                    obscuring it like a cloud: but, in general, the process advances more slowly;
                    bundles of spiculae, from different points, sometimes from the centre, though
                    commonly from the sides of the cup, stretching out and spreading by degrees with
                    a sort of feathered texture (see fig. 4). By this combined operation, the
                    surface of the water soon becomes an uniform sheet of ice. Yet the effect is at
                    times singularly varied; the spicular shoots, advancing in different directions,
                    come to inclose, near the middle of the cup, a rectilineal space, which, by
                    unequal though continued encroachment, is reduced to a triangle; and the mass
                    below, being partly frozen, and therefore expanded, the water is gradually
                    squeezed up through the orifice, and forms by congelation a regular pyramid,
                    rising by successive steps; or, if the projecting force be greater, and the hole
                    more contracted, it will dart off like a pillar. The radiating or feathered
                    lines which at first mark the frozen surface are only the edges of very thin
                    plates of ice, implanted at determinate angles, but each parcel composed of
                    parallel planes. This internal formation appears very conspicuous in the
                    congealed mass which has been removed from a metallic cup, before it is entirely
                    consolidated. Sea-water will freeze with almost equal ease, but it forms an
                    incompact ice, like congealed syrup, or what is commonly called <hi
                        rend="italic">water-ice.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">When cups of glass or metal are used, the cold excited at the open
                    surface of the liquid extends its influence gradually downwards. But if the
                    water be exposed in a po-' rous vessel, the process of evaporation, then taking
                    effect on all sides, proceeds with a nearly regular consolidation towards the
                    centre of the mass, thickening rather faster at the bottom, from its proximity
                    to the action of the absorbent, and leaving sometimes a reticulated space near
                    the middle of the upper surface, through which the air, disengage d by the
                    progress of congelation, makes its escape.</p>
                <p part="N">When very feeble powers of refrigeration are employed, a most singular
                    and beautiful appearance is, in course of time, slowly produced. If a pan of
                    porous earthenware, from four to six inches wide, be filled to the utmost with
                    common water till it rise above the lips, and planted above a dish of ten or
                    twelve inches diameter, containing a body of sulphuric acid, and then a broad
                    round receiver placed over it; on reducing the included air to some limit
                    between the twentieth and the fifth part-of its usual density, according to the
                    coldness of the apartment, the liquid mass will, in the space of an hour or two,
                    become entwined with icy shoots, which gradually enlarge and acquire more
                    solidity, but always leave the fabric loose and unfrozen below. The icy crust
                    which covers the rim, now receiving continual accessions from beneath, rises
                    perpendicularly by insensible degrees. From each point on the rough surface of
                    the vessel, filaments of ice, like bundles of spun glass, are protruded, fed by
                    the humidity conveyed through its substance, and forming in their aggregation a
                    fine silvery surface, analogous to that of fibrous gypsum or satin-spar. At the
                    same time, another similar growth, though of less extent, takes place on the
                    under side of the pan, so that continuous icy threads might appear vertically to
                    transpierce the ware. The whole of the bottom becomes likewise covered over with
                    elegant icy foliations (see fig. 5). Twenty or thirty hours may be required to
                    produce those singular effects; but the upper body of ice continues to rise for
                    the space of several days, till it forms a circular wall of near three inches in
                    height, leaving an interior grotto lined with fantastic groups of icicles. In
                    the meanwhile, the exfoliations have disappeared from the under side, and the
                    outer incrustation is reduced, by the absorbing process, to a narrow ring. The
                    icy wall now suffers a regular waste from external erosion, and its fibrous
                    structure becomes rounded and less apparent. Of its altitude, however, it loses
                    but little for some time; and even a deposition of congealed films along its
                    coping or upper edge seems to take place at a certain stage of the process. This
                    curious effect is owing to a circumstance which, as it serves to explain some of
                    the grand productions of nature, particularly the <hi rend="italic">icebergs
                        of</hi> the arctic circle, merits particular attention. The circular margin
                    of the ice, being nearer the action of the sulphuric acid than its inner cavity,
                    must suffer, by direct evaporation, a greater loss of heat; and, consequently,
                    each portion of thin air that rises from the low cavity, being chilled in
                    passing over the colder ledge, must deposit a minute corresponding share of its
                    moisture, which instantly attaches itself and incrusts the ring. Whatever
                    inequalities existed at first in the surface of the ice, will hence continually
                    increase.</p>

                <p part="N">Artificial congelation is always most commodιously performed on a large
                    scale. Since the extreme of rarefaction is not wanted, the air-pump employed in
                    the process admits of being considerably simplified, and rendered vastly more
                    expeditious in its operation. Two or three minutes at most will be sufficient
                    for procuring the degree of exhaustion required, and the combined powers of
                    evaporation and absorption will afterwards gradually produce their capital
                    effect. In general, plates of about a foot in diameter should be preferred,
                    which can be connected at pleasure with the main body of the pump. The dish
                    holding the sulphuric acid is nearly as wide as the flat receiver; and a set of
                    evaporating pans belongs to it, of different sizes, from seven to three inches
                    in diameter, which are severally to be used aceording to circumstances. The
                    largest pan is employed in the cold season, and the smaller ones may be
                    successively taken as the season becomes sultry. On the whole, it is better not
                    to overstrain the operation, and rather to divide the water under different
                    receivers, if unusual powers of refrigeration should be required. As soon as the
                    air is partly extracted from one receiver, the communication is immediately
                    stopped with the barrel of the pump, and the process of exhaustion is repeated
                    on another. In this way, any number of receivers, it is evident, may be
                    connected with the same machine. If we suppose but six of these tobe used, the
                    labour of a quarter of an hour will set as many evaporating pans in full action,
                    and may, therefore, in less than an hour afterwards, produce nearly six pounds
                    of solid ice. The waste which the water sustains during this conversion is
                    extremely small, seldom indeed amounting to the fiftieth part of the whole. Nor,
                    till after multiplied repetitions, is the action of the sulphuric acid
                    considerably enfeebled by its aqueous absorption. At first that diminution is
                    hardly perceptible, not being the hundredth part when the acid has acquired as
                    much as the tenth of its weight of water. But such influence gains rapidly, and
                    rises with accelerated progression. When the quantity of moisture absorbed
                    amounts to the fourth part by weight of the acid, the power of supporting cold
                    is diminished by a twentieth; and, after the weights of both these come to be
                    equal, the refrigerating energy is reduced to less than the half. Sulphuric acid
                    is hence capable of effecting the congelation of more than twenty times its
                    weight of water, before it has imbibed near an equal bulk of the liquid, or has
                    lost about the eighth part of its refrigerating power. The acid should then be
                    removed, and concentrated anew by slow distillation.</p>
                <p part="N">When the exhaling and absorbing surfaces are rightly disposed and
                    apportioned, the moderate rarefaction, from twenty to forty times, which is
                    adequate to the freezing of water, may be readily procured by the condensation
                    of steam. In all manufactures where the steam-engine is employed, ice may,
                    therefore, at all times be formed in any quantity, and with very little
                    additional expense. It is only required to bring a narrow pipe from the
                    condensing vessel, and to direct it along a range of receivers, under each of
                    which the water and the acid are severally placed. These receivers, with which
                    the pipe communicates by distinct apertures, may, for the sake of economy, be
                    constructed of cast iron, and adapted with hinges to the rim of a broad shallow
                    dish of the same metal, but lined with lead to hold the acid.</p>
                <p part="N">The combined powers of rarefaction and absorption are capable of
                    generating much greater effects than the mere freezing of water. Such frigorifie
                    energy, however, is at all times sufficient for effecting the congelation of
                    mercury. Accordingly, if mercury, contained in a hollow pear-shaped piece of
                    ice, be suspended by cross threads near a broad surface of sulphuric acid under
                    a receiver; on urging the rarefaction, it will become frozen, and may remain in
                    that solid state for the space of several hours. But this very striking
                    experiment is easily performed without any foreign aid. Having introduced
                    mercury into the large bulb of a thermometer, and attached the tube to the rod
                    of a transferrer, let this be placed over the wide dish containing sulphuric
                    acid, in the midst of which is planted a very small tumbler nearly filled with
                    water. After the included air has been rarefied about fifty times, let the bulb
                    be dipped repeatedly into the very cold but unfrozen water, and again drawn up
                    about an inch; in this way it will become incrusted with successive coats of
                    ice, to the thickness perhaps of the twentieth part of an inch. The water being
                    now removed, the pendant icicle cut away from the bulb, and its surface smoothed
                    by the touch of a warm finger, the transferrer is again replaced, the bulb let
                    down within half an inch of the acid, and the exhaustion pushed to the utmost.
                    When the syphon-gage has come to stand under the tenth of an inch, the icy crust
                    starts into divided fissures, and the mercury, having gradually descended in the
                    tube till it reach its point of congelation, or 39 degrees below zero, sinks by
                    a sudden contraction almost into the cavity of the bulb; and the apparatus being
                    then removed and the ball broken, the metal appears a solid shining mass, that
                    will bear the stroke of a hammer.</p>
                <p part="N">But a still greater degree of cold may be created, by applying the same
                    process likewise to cool the atmosphere which encircles the apparatus itself. A
                    glass matrass was blown nearly of a hemispherical shape, its bottom quite flat,
                    and about three inches in diameter, and its neck about half an inch wide and cut
                    square over. The whole was covered with a coat of patent lint, which takes up
                    water very copiously. A portion of sulphuric acid was next introduced, forming a
                    layer of perhaps a quarter of an inch thick; and a spirit of wine thermometer,
                    having its bulb also cased with wetted lint, was then inserted within the
                    matrass, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> brass ring attached to the tube securing it in
                    the right position. Things being thus arranged, the matrass or flat bottle, with
                    its thermometer, was placed on a slender stool with glass feet, about an inch
                    above the sulphuric acid in the broad basin, and the large receiver luted over
                    it. The air was then partly extracted, till the gage came below one inch. In a
                    few minutes the lint was frozen entirely, and looked white. After an interval of
                    a quarter of an hour, to allow time for the evaporation of that icy coat to cool
                    down the interior apparatus, the pump was again urged, and the exhaustion pushed
                    to about three tenths of an inch. In a short while the inclosed thermometer sunk
                    not fewer than 180 degrees, and remained stationary till the ice had wasted
                    away.</p>
                <p part="N">It is obvious, therefore, that the refrigerating powers could be pushed
                    still further by a judicious combination of the apparatus. An idea of the mode
                    of proceeding may be formed from the inspection of figure 8. It would be easy to
                    show that the maximum effect is obtained, wdιen the dimensions of the successive
                    cases rise in a geometrical progression. The action, however, is not doubled for
                    each additional case, but increased rather more than one half.</p>
                <p part="N">» These plans are difficult in the execution, and, though they enlarge
                    our conceptions of the extent of the descending scale of heat, yet they furnish
                    merely speculative results. A very important practical improvement has been
                    lately made in the process of artificial congelation. Sulphuric acid is
                    certainly a cheap and most powerful agent of absorption; but the danger in using
                    such a corrosive liquid, especially by unskilful persons, formed always a
                    serious obstacle to its general adoption. Mr Leslie had <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194748130?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-8130-0066"/>early
                    noticed the remarkable absorbent quality of our mouldering whinstone or
                    porphyritic trap; andin April 1817 he substituted that material, grossly pounded
                    and dried before a kitchen fire, instead of sulphuric acid, and actually froze a
                    body of water with great facility. This earth will attract the fiftieth part of
                    its weight of moisture before its absorbent power is reduced to the one half,
                    and is hence capable of freezing the sixth part of its weight of water. It may
                    be repeatedly dried, and will, after each operation, act with the same energy as
                    at first.</p>
                <p part="N">But an absorbent still more convenient and powerful afterwards occurred
                    to Mr Leslie; namely, <hi rend="italic">parched oatmeal.</hi> With a body <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> oatmeal of a foot in diameter, and rather more than an
                    inch deep, he froze a pound and a quarter of water, contained in a hemispherical
                    porous cup. The meal is easily dried and restored again to its action. In a hot
                    climate the exposure to the sun alone might prove sufficient. By the help of
                    this simple material, therefore, ice may easily and safely be produced in any
                    climate, and even at sea.</p>
                <p part="N">Otlíer substances could no doubt be employed as absorbents. But, except
                    the muriate of lime, or what is called the <hi rend="italic">oil of salt</hi>
                    desiccated, none hold out any prospect of success. Dried common salt will barely
                    effect congelation; and stucco, or the sulphate of lime, deprived of its water
                    of crystallization, which might seem to promise a powerful absorption, has
                    scarcely any efficacy whatever. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.)</hi></p>
                <p part="N">EXPLANATION OF PLATE CLXXIΠ.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 1 represents a large air-pump intended for the purpose of freezing
                    water, consisting of six receivers, each of them having a broad glass saucer for
                    holding sulphuric acid, and a small porous earthen cup containing the water.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 2, a section of the above, showing the communication between the
                    receivers and the body of the pump.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 3, the lever key for opening and shutting the cocks.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 4, the more ordinary appearance of the surface of the water in the
                    porous cup, at the moment when the act of congelation begins.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 5, the very singular kind of ice, striated, columnar, and
                    cavernous, which, under a slight rarefaction, but in cold weather, rises slowly
                    and changes its form by degrees, while part of the remaining water is drawn
                    through the substance of the cup, and covers the outside with a thick icy collar
                    above those irregular foliations.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 6 represents an elegant mode of almost instantaneously freezing
                    within a transferrer. Above the saucer of the sulphuric acid is placed a glass
                    cup holding water, and the air having been previously exhausted, and the
                    instrument detached from the pump, on pulling up the rod, the water, now left
                    exposed to the most powerful evaporation, quickly runs into spicular ice, which
                    gradually increases and consolidates into a pure transparent mass. The lid being
                    let down again upon the glass cup, the action ceases, and the ice returns slowly
                    to the state of water.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 7, a refrigeratory for cooling water at all times to a moderate
                    degree, without the operation of an air-pump; a body of sulphuric acid lying at
                    the bottom of the pan, while a porous vessel containing water is set in the
                    centre of the refrigeratory, and the air is confined about it by replacing the
                    lid.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 8 exhibits a system of vessels for producing spontaneously great
                    cold. It consists of a series of leaden or pewter vessels, placed one within the
                    other, and whose surfaces form a descending geometrical progression, being
                    covered externally with soft wet lint, and holding each of them a portion of
                    sulphuric acid. The powerful evaporation maintained by this arrangement causes
                    the interior vessels to become successively colder, and thus augments by a
                    repeated multiplication the final effect. Placed under the receiver of the
                    air-pump, this system of evaporating vessels, with no very high degree of
                    exhaustion, and at all seasons, excites ultimately the most intense cold yet
                    produced, far exceeding what is required for the congelation of mercury.</p>
