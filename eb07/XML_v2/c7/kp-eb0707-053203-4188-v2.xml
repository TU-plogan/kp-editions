                    sea, and possesses a harbour, which, however, is of little use. The manufacture
                    and bleaching of linen goods are now carried on with considerable success, and
                    dried fish are exported to some extent. There is an annual fair held here on the
                    last Tuesday of September. In 1821 the population of the burgh and parish
                    amounted to 1452, and in 1831 to 1593.</p>

                    eminent physician and medical teacher, was born in Lanarkshire, in the west of
                    Scotland, on the 11th of December 1712. His father was for some time chief
                    magistrate of the town of Hamilton; but though a very respectable man, his
                    circumstances were not such as to permit him to expend much money on the
                    education of his son. William, therefore, after serving an apprenticeship to a
                    surgeon apothecary in Glasgow, went several voyages to the West Indies as a
                    surgeon in a trading vessel from London; but of this employment he soon became
                    tired, and settled himself, at an early period of life, as a country surgeon in
                    the parish of Şhòtts, where he resided a short time practising among the farmers
                    and country people, and then went to Hamilton with a view to practise as a
                    physician, having never been fond of operating as a surgeon.</p>
                <p part="N">Whilst he resided near Shotts, Archibald duke of Argyll, who at that
                    time bore the chief political sway in Scotland, chanced to pay a visit to a
                    gentleman of rank in that neighbourhood. The duke was fond of literary pursuits,
                    and was then particularly engaged in some chemical researches, which required to
                    be elucidated by experiment. Eager in these pursuits, his grace, while on his
                    visit, found himself much at a loss from the want of some small chemical
                    apparatus, which his landlord could not furnish; but the latter happily
                    recollecting young Cullen, mentioned him to the duke as a person who could
                    probably furnish what he wanted. Cullen was accordingly invited to dine, and
                    thus introduced to his grace, who was so much pleased with his knowledge,
                    politeness, and address, that he formed an acquaintance which laid the
                    foundation of Dr Cullen’s future advancement.</p>
                <p part="N">The name of Cullen had by this time become familiar at every table in
                    the neighbourhood, a circumstance which made him known by reputation to the Duke
                    of Hamilton, who then resided for a short time in that part of the country; and
                    his grace having been suddenly taken ill, the assistance of young Cullen was
                    called in. This proved a fortunate occurrence, as it served to promote his
                    advancement to a station in life more suited to his talents than that in which
                    he had hitherto moved.</p>
                <p part="N">The duke was highly delighted with the sprightly character and ingenious
                    conversation of his new acquaintance; and receiving instruction from the latter
                    in a much more pleasing and an infinitely easier way than he had ever before
                    obtained it, the conversation of Cullen proved highly interesting to the duke.
                    Accordingly his grace soon found means to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> his
                    favourite doctor, who was already the esteemed acquaintance of the man through
                    whose hands all preferments in Scotland were obliged to pass, appointed to a
                    place in the university of Glasgow, where his singular talents for discharging
                    the duties of teacher soon became very conspicuous.</p>
                <p part="N">During his residence in the country, however, several important
                    incidents occurred, which ought not to be passed over in silence. It was during
                    this time that a connection in business was formed in a very humble line between
                    two men, who became afterwards eminently conspicuous in much more exalted
                    stations. William, afterwards Dr Hunter, the celebrated lecturer on anatomy in
                    London, was a native of the same part of the country; and not being in affluent
                    circumstances any more than Cullen, these two young men, stimulated by the
                    impulse of genius to prosecute their medical studies with ardour, but thwarted
                    by the narrowness of their fortune, entered into a copartnery business as
                    surgeons and apothecaries in the country. The chief object of thcir contract
                    being to furnish the parties with the means of prosecuting their medical
                    studies, which they could not so well enjoy separately, it was stipulated that
                    one of them should alternately be allowed to study in whatever college he
                    inclined, during the winter, whilst the other should carry on the business in
                    the country for the common advantage. In consequence of this arrangement, Cullen
                    was first allowed to study in the university of Edinburgh for one winter; but
                    when it came to Hunter’s turn next winter, he preferred London to Edinburgh, and
                    accordingly proceeded to the former place. Here his singular neatness in
                    dissecting, and uncommon dexterity in making anatomical preparations, his
                    assiduity in study, his mildness of manner and pliability of temper, soon
                    recommended him to the notice of Dr Douglas, w ho then read lectures upon
                    anatomy and midwifery, and who engaged Hunter as an assistant in discharging the
                    duties of the chair which the latter afterwards filled with so much honour to
                    himself and satisfaction to the public.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus was dissolved, in a premature manner, a copartnership of as
                    singular a kind as is to be found in the annals of literature; nor was Cullen a
                    man of a disposition to let any engagement with him prove a bar to his partner’s
                    advancement in life. The articles were freely departed from by him; and Cullen
                    and Hunter ever afterwards kept up a very cordial and friendly correspondence,
                    though it is believed they never from that time had a personal interview.</p>
                <p part="N">During the period that Cullen practised as a country surgeon and
                    apothecary, he formed another connection of a more permanent kind, which,
                    happily for him, was not dissolved till a very late period of his life. With the
                    ardour of disposition which he possessed, it cannot be supposed that he beheld
                    the fair sex with indifference. Very early in life he formed a strong attachment
                    for an amiable woman, Miss Johnston, daughter of a clergyman in the
                    neighbourhood; and being nearly of his own age, she was prevailed on to unite
                    her fortune with his, at a time when lie had nothing else to recommend him to
                    her except his person and dispositions. After producing to him a numerous
                    family, and participating with him in the changes of fortune which he
                    experienced, she died in the summer of 1786.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1746, Cullen, who had now taken the degree of doctor in
                    physic, was appointed lecturer in chemistry in the university of Glasgow; and in
                    the month of October he began his lectures on that science. His singular<pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:194754201?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4201-0533"/>
                    talents for arrangement, his distinctness of enunciation, his vivacity of
                    manner, and his knowledge of the science which he taught, rendered his lectures
                    interesting to the students in a degree till then unknown at the university. He
                    became, therefore, in some measure, the idol ∣of the students. The former
                    professors were eclipsed by the brilliancy <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his
                    reputation; and he had to experience :all those little difficulties which envy
                    and disappointed am- !bition naturally threw in his wav. Regardless, however, of
                    these secret chagrins, he pressed forward with ardour in his literary career;
                    and, supported by the favour of the public, he consoled himsclf for the
                    contumely which he ιmet with from a few individuals. His practice as a physician
                    increased from day to day; and a vacancy having occurred in the year 1751, he
                    was then appointed by the iking professor of medicine in that university. This
                    new appointment served only to call forth his powers, and to bring to light
                    talents which he was not formerly known to possess; so that his fame continued
                    to increase.</p>
                <p part="N">About this period the patrons of the university of Edinburgh being
                    constantly on the watch for the most eminent medical men to support the rising
                    fame of their college, their attention was soon directed towards Cullen; and on
                    the death of Dr Plummer, professor of chemistry, he was, in 1756, unanimously
                    invited to fill the vacant chair. This invitation he accepted; and having
                    resigned his employments in Glasgow, he, in the month of October of that year,
                    commenced his academical career in Edinburgh, where he resided till his
                    death.</p>
                <p part="N">If the admission of Cullen into the university of Glasgow gave great
                    spirit to the exertions of the students, this was, if possible, still more
                    strongly felt in Edinburgh. Chemistry, which till that time had been of small
                    account in our university, and attended to by very few of the students,
                    instantly became a favourite study; and the lectures upon this science were more
                    frequented than any others in the university, anatomy alone ęxcepted. The
                    students in general spoke of Cullen with íhe rapturous ardour which is natural
                    to youth when they are highly pleased. But as these eulogiums appeared
                    extravagant to moderate men, and could not fail to prove disgusting to bis
                    colleagues, a party was formed among the students or opposing this new favourite
                    of the public; and, by misrepresenting the doctrines of Cullen to those who
                    could ιot have an opportunity of hearing those doctrines themselves, they
                    induced some even of the most intelligent nen in the university to think it
                    their duty publicly to oppose these imaginary tenets. The ferment was thus
                    augmented; and some time elapsed before the professors liscovered the arts by
                    which they had been imposed ιpon, and before harmony was restored.</p>
                <p part="N">During this ferment Cullen went steadily forward, with- &gt;ut taking
                    any part whatever in these disputes. He never ;ave ear to tales respecting his
                    colleagues, nor took noice of the doctrines which they taught; and although ome
                    of their unguarded strictures may at times have :ome to his knowledge, these
                    seemed to make no impres-ion whatever on his mind.</p>
                <p part="N">The attempts of a party of students to lower the cha-acter of Cullen at
                    his first outset in the university of Edinburgh having proved fruitless, his
                    fame as a profes-or, and his reputation as a physician, became more and nore
                    extensive every day. Nor could it well be other-rise. Cullen’s professional
                    knowledge was always great, nd his manner of lecturing singularly clear and
                    intelli-ible, lively and entertaining; whilst to his patients his eneral conduct
                    as a physician was so pleasing, his address o affable and engaging, and his
                    manner so open, kind, nd little regulated by pecuniary considerations, that it
                    as impossible for those who had occasion to avail themselves once of his medical
                    assistance, ever to be satisfied on any future occasion without it. He became
                    the friend and companion of every family he visited, and his future acquaintance
                    could not be dispensed with.</p>
                <p part="N">The general conduct of Cullen to his students waá excellent. With all
                    whom he observed to be attentive and diligent he formed an early acquaintance,
                    by inviting them in small parties at a time to sup with him, conversing with
                    them on these occasions with the most engaging ease, and freely entering with
                    them on the subject <hi rend="italic">of</hi> their studies, their amusements,
                    their difficulties, their hopes, and future prospects. In this way he usually
                    invited the whole of his numerous class, till he had made himself acquainted
                    with their abilities, their private character, and their particular objects of
                    pursuit. Those amongst them whom he found the most assiduous, the best disposed,
                    or the most friendless, he invited the most frequently, till an intimacy was
                    gradually formed, which proved highly beneficial to them. Their doubts with
                    regard to their objects of study he listened to with attention, and solved with
                    the most obliging condescension. His library, which consisted of an excellent
                    assortment of the best books, especially on medical subjects, was at all times
                    open for their accommodation; and his advice, in every case of difficulty to
                    them, they had it always in their power to obtain. They seemed to be his family;
                    and few persons of distinguished merit left the. university of Edinburgh in his
                    time, with whom he did not keep up a correspondence till they were fairly
                    established in business. By these means lie came to have a most accurate
                    knowledge of the state of every country, with respect to practitioners in the
                    medical line; and the only use he made of this knowledge was to direct students
                    in their choice of places, where they might have an opportunity of engaging in
                    business with a reasonable prospect of 'Success.</p>
                <p part="N">'Nor was it in this way only that he befriended the students <hi
                        rend="superscript"> s</hi> atthe university of Edinburgh. Possessing a
                    benevolence oSmind which made him ever think first of the wants of others, and
                    recollecting the difficulties which he had himself had to struggle with in his
                    younger days, he was at all times singularly attentive to their pecuniary
                    concerns. From his general acquaintance among the students, and the friendly
                    habits he cultivated with many of them, he found no difficulty in discovering
                    those among them who were in’ rather embarrassed circumstances, without being
                    obliged to hurt their delicacy in any degree. To such persons, when their habits
                    of study admitted of it, he was peculiarly attentive. They were more frequently
                    invited to his house than others; they were treated with more than usual
                    kindness and familiarity; they were conducted to his library, and encouraged by
                    the most delicate address to borrow from it freely whatever books he thought
                    they had occasion for ;—and as persons in these circumstances were usually more
                    backward in this respect than others, books were sometimes pressed upon them by
                    the doctor insisting on having their opinion of such or such passages they had
                    not read, and desiring them to carry the book home for that purpose. In short,
                    he behaved to them rather as if he courted their company, and stood in need of
                    their acquaintance, than otherwise; and he thus raised them in the opinion of
                    their acquaintance to a much higher degree of estimation than they could
                    otherwise have obtained; conduct which, to persons whose minds were depressed by
                    penury, and whose sense of honour was sharpened by the consciousness of an
                    iņferiority of a certain kind, proved singularly engaging. In this way they were
                    inspired with a secret sense of dignity, which elevated their minds, and excited
                    an uncommon ardour of pursuit, instead of that melancholy inactivity <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:194754214?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4214-0534"/>
                    which is so natural in such circumstances, and which too 1 often leads to
                    despair. Nor was he less delicate in the man- 1 ner of supplying their wants,
                    than attentive to discover them. He often found out some polite excuse for
                    refusing i to take payment for a first course, and never was at a loss for ∣ one
                    as to an after course. Before they could have an opportunity of applying for a
                    ticket, he would sometimes lead the conversation to a subject which had occurred
                    in the course of his lectures; and as his lectures were never put in writing by
                    himself, he would beg the favour to see their notes, if he knew they had been
                    taken with attention, under a pretext of assisting his memory. Sometimes he
                    expressed a wish to have their opinion of a particular part of his course, and
                    presented them with a ticket for that purpose; and sometimes he refused to take
                    payment, under the pretext that they had not received his full course the
                    preceding year, part of it having been necessarily omitted for want of time,
                    which he meant to include in this course. By such delicate address, in which he
                    greatly excelled, he took care to forerun their wants; and thus he not only gave
                    them the benefit of his own lectures, but by refusing to take their money, he
                    also enabled them to attend those of others which were necessary to complete
                    their course of studies. Such were the devices he adopted towards individuals to
                    whom economy was necessary; but it was a general rule with him, never to take
                    money from any student for more than two courses of the same set of lectures,
                    permitting him to attend these lectures gratis as many years longer as he
                    pleased.</p>
                <p part="N">The first lectures which Cullen delivered in Edinburgh were on
                    chemistry; and for many years he also gave clinical lectures on the cases which
                    occurred in the Royal Infirmary. In the month of February 1763, Dr Alston died,
                    after having begun his usual course of lectures on the materia medica; and the
                    magistrates of Edinburgh, as patrons of that professorship in the university,
                    appointed Dr Cullen to the chair, requesting that he would finish the course of
                    lectures which had been begun for that season. This he agreed to do; and though
                    he was under the necessity of going on with the course in a few days after he
                    was nominated, he did not once think of reading the lectures of his predecessor,
                    but resolved to deliver an entirely new course of his own. The popularity of
                    Cullen at this time may be guessed by the increase of students who came to
                    attend his course in addition to the eight or ten who had entered to Dr Alston.
                    The new students exceeded a hundred. An imperfect copy of these lectures, thus
                    fabricated in haste, having been published, the doctor thought it necessary to
                    give a more correct edition of them in the latter part of his life. But his
                    faculties being then much impaired, his friends looked in vain for those
                    striking beauties which had characterised his literary exertions in the prime of
                    life.</p>
                <p part="N">Some years afterwards, on the death of Dr White, the magistrates once
                    more appointed Dr Cullen to give lectures in his stead on the theory of physic;
                    and it was on this occasion that Dr Cullen thought it expedient to resign the
                    chemical chair in favour of Dr Black, his former pupil, whose talents in that
                    department of science were then well known, and who filled the chair till his
                    death with great satisfaction to the public. Soon afterwards, on the death of Dr
                    Rutherford, who for many years had given lectures with applause on the practice
                    of physic, Dr John Gregory having become a candidate for this situation along
                    with Dr Cullen, a sort of compromise took place between them, by which they
                    agreed each to give lectures alternately on the theory and on the practice of
                    physic during their joint lives, reserving to the survivor to hold either of the
                    classes he should prefer. In consequence of this agreement, Dr Cullen delivered
                    the first course of ectures on the practice of physic in the winter of 1766, and
                    )r Gregory succeeded him in that branch the following rear. Never perhaps was a
                    literary arrangement entered nto which could have proved' more beneficial to the
                    stillen ts than this. Both these men possessed great talents, hough of a kind
                    extremely dissimilar. Both of them had certain failings or defects, which the
                    other was aware of. md counteracted. Each of them knew and respected the talents
                    of the other. They co-operated, therefore, in the happiest manner, to enlarge
                    the understanding, and to forward the pursuits of their pupils. But
                    unfortunately this arrangement was soon put an end to by the unexpected death of
                    Dr Gregory, who was cut off in the flower of life by a sudden and unforeseen
                    event. After this time, Cullen continued to give lectures on the practice of
                    physic till a few months before his death, which happened on the 5th of February
                    1790, in the seventy-seventh year of his age.</p>
                <p part="N">In his prelections Dr Cullen never attempted to read. His lectures were
                    delivered <hi rend="italic">viva voce,</hi> without having been previously put
                    into writing, or thrown into any particular arrangement. The vigour of his mind
                    was such, that nothing more was necessary than a few short notes before him,
                    merely to prevent him from varying from the general order which he had been
                    accustomed to observe. This gave to his discourses an ease, a vivacity, a
                    variety, and a force, which are rarely to be met with in academical discourses.
                    His lectures upon the same subject, therefore, were never exactly the same.
                    Their general tenor indeed was not much varied; but the particular illustrations
                    were always new, well suited to the circumstances which attracted the general
                    attention of the day, and were delivered in the particular way which accorded
                    with the cast of mind the prelector found himself in at the time. To these
                    circumstances must be ascribed that energetic, artless elocution, which rendered
                    his lectures so generally captivating to his hearers. Even those who could not
                    follow him in the extensive views which his penetrating mind glanced at, or who
                    were not able to understand the apt allusions to collateral objects which he
                    could only point at rapidly as he went along, could not help being warmed in
                    some measure by the vivacity of his manner. But to those who followed him in his
                    rapid career, the ideas he suggested were so numerous, the views he laid open
                    were so extensive, and the objects to be attained were so important, that every
                    active faculty of the mind was roused; and such an ardour of enthusiasm was
                    excited in the prosecution of study, as appeared to be perfectly inexplicable to
                    those who were merely unconcerned spectators. In consequence of this unshackled
                    freedom in the composition and delivery of his lectures, every circumstance was
                    in the nicest unison with the tone of voice and expression of countenance which
                    the particular cast of his mind at the time inspired.</p>
                <p part="N">It would seem as if Dr Cullen had considered the proper business of a
                    preceptor to be that of putting his pupils into a proper train of study, so as
                    to enable them to prosecute those studies at a future period, and to carry them
                    on much farther than the short time allowed for academical prelections would
                    admit. He did not, therefore, strive so much to make those who attended his
                    lectures deeply versed in the particular details of a subject, as to give them a
                    general view of the whole; to show them what had already been attained
                    respecting it; to point out what remained yet to be discovered; and to put them
                    in a train of study which should enable them at a future period to remove those
                    difficulties which had hitherto obstructed our progress, and thus to advance to
                    higher degrees of perfection. And if these were his views, nothing could be more
                    happily adapted to them than the mode which he invariably pursued. He first
                    drew, with the striking touches<pb break="no" facs="nls:194754227?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-4227-0535"/> of a master, a rapid and general outline of
                    the subject, by which the whole figure was seen at once to start boldly from the
                    canvass, distinct in all its parts, and unmixeđ with any other object. He then
                    began anew to retrace the picture, to touch up the lesser parts, and to finish
                    the whole in as perfect a manner as the state of knowledge at the time would
                    permit. Where materials were wanting, the picture remained imperfect. The wants
                    were thus rendered obvious; and the means of supplying them were pointed out
                    with the most careful discrimination. The student, whenever he looked back to
                    the subject, perceived the defects; and his hopes being awakened, he felt an
                    irresistible impulse to explore that hitherto untrodden path which had been
                    pointed out to him, and to fill up the chasm which still yawned. Thus were the
                    active faculties of the mind most powerfully excited; and instead of labouring
                    himself to supply deficiencies which far exceeded the power of any one man to
                    accomplish, he set thousands at work to fulfil the task, and put them in a train
                    of going on with the work. Dr Cullen died on the 5th February 1790, in the
                    seventy-seventh year of his age. His external appearance, though striking, was
                    not elegant, but nevertheless pleasing. His countenance was expressive, and his
                    eye remarkably lively and penetrating. In his person he was tall and thin, but
                    he stooped very much. When he walked he had a contemplative look, and seemed
                    insensible to what was passing around him.*</p>
