                    of Beath, by Margaret, the eldest daughter of Lord Lindsay of Byres. It appears
                    highly probable, if not certain, that by the father’s side he derived his
                    lineage from Sir Robert Crichton of Sanquhar, ancestor of the earl of Dumfries;
                    and his maternal grandfather, ancestor of the earl of Moray, was the son of Lord
                    Avandalę, who was descended from Murdac duke of Albany, and through him from
                    Robert II. It is indeed to be recollected that the birth of the first Lord
                    Avandalę was illegitimate; but it is likewise to be recollected that he obtained
                    letters of legitimation under the great seal.<note anchored="true"

                    of Margaret Tudor, the relict of James IV. It is therefore sufficiently obvious
                    that he was entitled to speak of his high descent; but his extraordinary
                    endowments of mind conferred upon him much higher distinction than he could
                    derive from any accidental circumstances of birth. The place of his birth is
                    somewhat doubtful. According to one tradition, he was born in the castle of
                    Cluny, situated on a small lake bearing the same name; but as the father did not
                    acquire his estate in Perthshire till two years after the birth of James, his
                    eldest son, this may be considered as entitled to less attention than another
                    tradition, which represents him as having been born at Elliock in Dumfriesshire,
                    the more ancient seat of the family. The estate of Cluny, which belonged to the
                    bishopric of Dunkeld, was conveyed to the king’s advocate by Robert Crichton,
                    the last popish bishop of that wealthy see.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1570, when he had only attained the age of ten, he was sent
                    to the university of St Andrews, where he was entered at St Salvator’s College.
                    According to Aldus Manutius, his father placed him under the tuition of
                    Buchanan, Hepburn, Robertson, and Rutherford, who are all mentioned as very
                    eminent persons. John Rutherford, whose name is sufficiently known, was provost
                    of the college to which Crichton belonged. Buchanan, who was principal of St
                    Leonard’s College, resigned his office about the time when he became a student;
                    but, according to the statement of his Italian friend, he was partly educated
                    along with the young king of Scotland; and Buchanan was appointed to the office
                    of preceptor to the king when he quitted St Andrews, in the year 1570. On the
                    20th of March 1573, or, according to our present mode of computation, 1574,
                    Crichton took the degree of A. B. He proceeded A. Μ. in the year 1575, and thus
                    completed the regular course of study at the premature age of fifteen. In the
                    university of St Andrews, the candidates for the higher degree were then
                    distributed into <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753356?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-3356-0468"/>circles, according to the comparative
                    profieiency displayed in the eourse of their previous examinations. Eaeh eirele
                    was likewise formed on the same principle. Of the thirty-six masters who took
                    their degrees on this occasion, there were three circles; and the third name in
                    the first eirele is that of James Crichton. At the head of the list appears
                    David Monypenny. It is highly probable that Crichton was the youngest of all
                    those graduates; and as his proficiency was only exceeded by two out of
                    thirty-five, it is evident that he had already begun to distinguish himself by
                    his extraordinary aptitude in the acquisition of knowledge.</p>
                <p part="N">As the king was six years younger than Crichton, they could not well
                    participate in the same studies, although they could receive instructions from
                    the same tutors. Crichton must have continued to devote himself with intense
                    ardour to the pursuits of science as well as literature; for to a knowledge of
                    many languages he added a familiar acquaintance with the philosophy and even the
                    theology of the age. The power of genius is shewn in the use of the materials
                    whieh are placed within its reach; but there is no royal road to learning,
                    whieh, if acquired to any extent, must be acquired by much labour and
                    perseverance, although their particular degree must vary according to the
                    quickness of apprehension and tenacity of memory belonging to various
                    individuals.</p>
                <p part="N">Crichton may for some time have enjoyed the benefit of such able
                    instruction; for he appears to have been still residing in Scotland towards the
                    close of the year 1577. His subsequent movements are represented as being partly
                    influenced by some domestic disagreements. As the father embraced the reformed
                    doctrines, while the son adhered to the ancient superstition, disputesand
                    reproaches could scarcely fail to intervene at a erisis of si ch high and
                    general exeiteinent. The young scholar repaired to France, where he is said to
                    have distinguished himself equally by his skill in literature and in arms. Of a
                    marvellous disputation which he held in the university of Paris, there is an
                    account which passes very currently, although it is only stamped with the
                    authority of Sir Thomas Urquhart. According to this account, he affixed a
                    program in the most public places of the city, inviting all men of learning to
                    meet him, after an interval of six weeks, at the College of Navarre, where he
                    should “be ready to answer to what should be propounded to him concerning any
                    science, liberal art, discipline, or faculty, praetieal or theoretick, not
                    excluding the theological nor jurisprudential habits, though grounded but upon

                    baloon, or long-catch, and sometimes at the house-games of dice, cards, playing
                    at the chess, billiards, trou-madam, and other such like ehamber-sports,
                    singing, playing on the lute, and other musical instruments.” But when the
                    appointed hour arrived, he acquitted himself with stupendous learning and
                    ability, having for the space of nine hours maintained his ground against the
                    most eminent antagonists in all the faculties. The rector of the university
                    concluded the ceremony by presenting him with a diamond ring and a purse full of
                    gold. It would be a mere waste of criticism to enter into a minute examination
                    of the narrative to which we have now referred. The details are sufficiently
                    circumstantial, but they have much of the aspect of a downright romance; and
                    such details from the knight of Cromarty would have required the strong
                    confirmation of collateral evidence. It might perhaps be admitted with some
                    degree of safety that Crichton was engaged in a public disputation at Paris, and
                    that he acquitted himself with consummate ability; but as to his fluency in
                    twelve languages, and his maintaining so long and powerful a contest, not merely
                    with grammarians, rhetoricians, and philosophers, but even with theologians,
                    canonists, and civilians, all these particulars must be received with extreme
                    hesitation; and perhaps it may be considered as much more probable that such a
                    disputation never took place at Paris, but was merely fabricated from another,
                    which took placeat Venice.</p>
                <p part="N">The intellectual endowments of Crichton seem to have been equalled by
                    his personal accomplishments. He is highly celebrated for his martial prowess,
                    and as a complete master in the use of the sword and spear. Some degree of
                    military experience he must have acquired during his two years service in the
                    civil wars of France: but this term of service was apparently sufficient to
                    gratify his youthful inclination for the life of a soldier; and he next directed
                    his steps towards Italy, where be must have arrived in the year 1580. According
                    to Dr Mackenzie, he proceeded to Rome, and there gave another demonstration of
                    his talents for public disputation;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    other men of letters, particularly with Sperone Speroni, Lorenzo Massa, and
                    Giovanni Donati. An ode addressed to Massa, and another to Donati, are preserved
                    among his literary reliques. But the friendship of Manutius was distinguished by
                    a more than ordinary degree of zeal: he highly extolled Crichton when living,
                    and deeply bewailed' him when dead. To the notices which he has introduced into
                    his edition of Cicero, we are in a great measure indebted for our knowledge of
                    the young scholar’s proceedings in the territory of Venice. His edition of the

                    recital of some of those literary exploits which astonished the Italians. <hi

                <p part="N">An oration which Crichton pronounced before the Doge aud the nobility of
                    Venice excited the admiration of his audience, by the eloquence of the
                    composition, as well as by the gracefulness of the elocution, insomuch that the
                    young orator was regarded as a person of the most extraordinary endowments. He
                    afterwards engaged in various disputations on subjects of divinity, philosophy,
                    and the mathematical sciences; and such was the reputation which he now
                    acquired, that, during the remainder of his short career, he seems to have been
                    viewed as one of the wonders of Italy. It has been thought a circumstance worthy
                    of being recorded in the life of Mazzoni, celebrated among his countrymen for
                    his powers of literary debate, that he thrice encountered Crichton at Venice,
                    and overwhelmed him by the astonishing copiousness and subtilty of his
                    arguments. If it was reckoned an honour fora man of high reputation to sustain a
                    contest with so youthful an antagonist, we cannot fail to perceive the singular

                <p part="N">These intellectual exertions were succeeded by an infirm state of
                    health, which continued for upwards of four months; and before he had completely
                    recovered, he made an excursion to Padua, the seat of a flourishing university.
                    The professors in all the different faculties were invited to meet him in the
                    house of a person of rank; and there, in the midst of a numerous assembly, he
                    exhibited new and striking proofs of the versatility of his genius. He commenced
                    his performances with the recitation of an extemporaneous poem in celebration of
                    Padua; a subject which was only then proposed to him, and which he treated in a
                    manner that is described as very elegant. With much acuteness and learning, he
                    afterwards discussed various topics of science with the doctors who were there
                    assembled; and it is particularly mentioned that he exposed many of the errors
                    of Aristotle and his commentators. Having thus displayed his knowledge for the
                    space of six hours, the final theme proposed to him was the praise of ignorance;
                    and on this subject he pronounced an oration, which still further excited the
                    admiration of his learned auditors. A similar exhibition was announced to be
                    held in the bishop’s palace, but, for some reason which is not plainly stated,
                    it did not take place. The popular applause which attended such demonstrations
                    of intellectual superiority, had too natural a tendency to excite envy, and to
                    provoke detraction, nor did Crichton escape that lot which has been common to so
                    many others. On his return to Venice, he was induced by the malignity of certain
                    individuals, whom he does not mention by name, to publish a remarkable program,
                    which has been preserved by his friend Manutius. In order to expose the futility
                    of their cavils, he undertook to refute innumerable errors of Aristotle, and of
                    all the Latin philosophers, that is, all the schoolmen, both in their
                    expositions of his doctrines, and in their disquisitions on subjects of
                    theology, together with the errors of certain professors of mathematics, and to
                    answer suwh objections as might be urged against him. He further gave his
                    antagonists the option of selecting their topics of disputation from any other
                    branch of science, whether publicly taught in the schools, or privately
                    investigated by the most profound philosophers; and he undertook to return his
                    answers, as the proponents should themselves determine, either according to the
                    usual figures of logic, according to the secret doctrine of numbers, or
                    mathematical figures, or in any one out of a hundred different species of verse.
                    The challenge may appear sufficiently bold, if not arrogant; but unless it came
                    from a person who was conscious of possessing very extraordinary powers of
                    intellect, and who had repeatedly applied to them a severe and <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> unequivocal test, it could scarcely be viewed in
                    any other light than as an indication of insanity. He appealed to a community^
                    which included many competent judges of such pretensions, and therefore could
                    not hope to impose upon an unlearned multitude. The appointed place of meeting
                    was the church of St John and St Paul; and there, for the space of three days,
                    this young man sustained the arduous trial in a manner which fully justified his
                    confidence in his own intellectual resources. His friend Aldus Manutius was a
                    spectator of his triumphs upon this occasion; and though some allowances must
                    doubtless be made for the warmth of friendship, and for an Italian taste in
                    writing, it is still to be remembered that when he published his account, the
                    event to which it referred was altogether recent, and he necessarily appealed to
                    a cloud of living witnesses, who would have treated his panegyric with derision,
                    if Crichton bad obviously failed in supporting his own lofty pretensions.</p>
                <p part="N">After his departure from Venice, he betook himself to Mantua; and there,
                    according to Urquhart’s romantic narrative, he rendered himself very conspicuous
                    by his valiant encounter with a fierce Italian gentleman, who had recently slain
                    three antagonists. Crichton is said to have challenged this redoubtable
                    champion, and, after many efforts of mutual skill, to have brought the matter to
                    this conclusion: “His right foot did beat the cadence of the blow that pierced
                    the belly of this Italian; whose heart and throat being hit with the two former

                    learned knight had studied mathematics, and he seems to have been fully resolved
                    that his knowledge should be turned to some account. This combat he has
                    described in a very circumstantial manner; but, viewing his unsupported
                    authority with no small degree of suspicion, we feel no inclination to repeat
                    his martial details, which however are not a little curious in themselves. But
                    it is a fact confirmed by other evidence that Crichton was invited or attracted
                    to the court of Mantua, and that the duke appointed him tutor to his son
                    Vincenzo Gonzaga. Here, according to the knight of Cromarty, he displayed his
                    dramatic talents as conspicuously as he had formerly displayed his learning and
                    his prowess. In the space of five hours, he is said to have represented fifteen
                    different characters, and to have supported each of them with marvellous effect.
                    But his brilliant career was speedily to close. When he was one evening walking
                    in the streets of Mantua with his lute in his hand, he was unexpectedly assailed
                    by three individuals; and drawing his sword, he pressed upon them with so much
                    skill and resolution, that the; principal aggressor was impelled by his fears to
                    discover himself as young Gonzaga. Crichton fell upon his knees, and entreated
                    forgiveness for an act which evidently inferred no guilt, when the prince
                    instantly pierced him through the body, and terminated the mortal existence of
                    one of the most remarkable persons of the era to which he belonged.<note

                            are we in possession of any more specific information. With regard to
                            the date, there is some degree of uncertainty. In the month of November
                            1583, Manutius bewailed his young friend as already dead, and pointedly
                            referred to the fatal third of July. Imperiali likewise states that he
                            died on the third of July 1583. On the other hand, Serassi, in his <hi
                                rend="italic">Vita del Aſazzoni,</hi> p. 127, speaks of a poem
                            written by James Crichton on the death of Cardinal Borromeo, which did
                            not take place till the third of November 1584. But for such a fact as
                            this, the authority of Manutius cannot well be called in question; and
                            we must rather conclude that the poem was written by another James
                            Crichton, or by some person who thought proper to adopt his
                        name.</p></note> This act of base ferocity was perpetrated on the third of
                    July 1583, when Crichton had nearly completed the twenty-third yeąr of his
                    age.</p>
                <p part="N">The elegance of his person had procured him the admiration of those who
                    were unable to estimate the powers of his mind. His countenance is described as
                    beautiful; but his right eye was marked, if not somewhat disfigured, by a red
                    spot, or, as Manutius describes it, a red rose by which it was surrounded. His
                    reputation as a scholar did not render him indifferent to the more superficial
                    accomplishments of a gentleman: his address was courteous, and lie was a
                    proficient in dancing, as well as in the gymnastic and martial exercises to
                    which youths of his condition were then addicted.</p>
                <p part="N">The unrivalled fame of this young scholar is certainly allied to
                    romance; but, on the other hand, it is very difficult to imagine that it was not
                    originally founded on some qualities which eminently distinguished him from
                    other forward and aspiring youths, who at that period were sufficiently numerous
                    in the more learned countries of Europe. A reputation so splendid, and so
                    uniformly maintained, cannot reasonably be ascribed to a mere concurrence of
                    accidental circumstances. The specimens of his Latin poetry which have been
                    preserved do not indeed contain any thing very remarkable; but they are few in
                    number, and were not published by himself; nor does his reputation depend upon
                    one species of excellence. He is celebrated for the wonderful facility with
                    which he composed verses, for his knowledge of ten or twelve different
                    languages, for his acquaintance with the writings of the fathers, for his
                    uncommon powers of memory, and for his promptitude and acuteness in public
                    disputation. We must not therefore hastily conclude that he “was in Italy
                    considered as one of those literary mountebanks who were numerous in that age or
                    that his reputation chiefly depends on the romantic flights of Sir Thomas
                    Urquhart, who wrote about seventy years after his death. Joseph Scaliger, who
                    flourished at the same period with himself, who professes to have obtained his
                    information in Italy, and who besides was not too prone to admiration, mentions
                    Crichton as a prodigious genius, and indeed enumerates all the most essential
                    qualifications that are commonly ascribed to him.<note anchored="true"

                    Dr Kippis, who has written a copious account of this renowned youth, has
                    legitimately applied the test of criticism to several of the early notices; and
                    many of his strictures, particularly those on Urquhart and Mackenzie, every
                    person of a sober judgment must admit tobe too well founded. We have however
                    placed no reliance on such authorities, but have derived all our materials from
                    better sources. “He appears,” says this biographer, “to have had a fine person,
                    to have been adroit in his bodily exercises, to have possessed a peculiar
                    facility in learning languages, to have enjoyed a remarkably quick and retentive
                    memory, and to have excelled in a power of declamation, a fluency of speech, and

                    was probably very uncommon for his years; and this, in conjunction with his
                    other qualities, enabled him to shine in public disputation. But whether his
                    knowledge and learnihg were accurate or profound, may justly be questioned; and
                    it may equally be doubted whether he would have arisen to any extraordinary
                    degree of eminence in the literary world. It will always be reflected upon with
                    regret, that his early and untimely death prevented this matter from being

                    ascertain the real state of the question. In a youth of twenty-three, whatever
                    superiority of intellect he may possess, we do not expect to find the erudition
                    of Scaliger or Salmasius. Those who extol Crichton as a very extraordinary
                    person, do not necessarily suppose that his attainments exceeded the limits of
                    human genius: but they may reasonably believe that in various departments of
                    science and literature he arrived at a degree of proficiency wonderfully
                    premature; that he evinced great energy of application, with unusual powers of

                            tom. i. p. 941.) This is scarcely exceeded by the panegyric of
                            Imperiali: “Hic, est Critonius ille Scotus, transacti duodum saeculi
                            monstrum, prodigioso naturae opificis conatu editum, quo Parnassi spacia
                            stupendo et inusitato spectaculo illustrarentur. Hic est totius adhuc
                            orbis judicio Phoenix habitus ingeniorum, ¢ìivinae mentis igniculis
                            summi potius datoris referens majestatem, quam mortalem ad aemulandum
                            lacessens industriam.” (Musaeúm Historicum, p. 241.)</p></note>.
