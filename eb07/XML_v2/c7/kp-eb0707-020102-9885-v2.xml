                        Bourbon, Prince of,</hi> was born at Paris on the 8th of September 1621. He
                    was styled Duke d’Enghìen, till he succeeded to the title of Prince of Condé by
                    his father’s death in the year 1646. As he was of a tender and delicate
                    constitution, the prince sent him to the castle of Montrond, in Berri, that he

                <p part="N">With these attendants the Duke d’Enghien went to settle at Bourges,
                    where he frequented the college of Jesuits and, besides the ordinary studies,
                    was taught ancient and modern history, mathematics, geography, declamation, and
                    also riding and dancing, in which last he soon excelled. He made so great
                    progress in his studies, that before the age of thirteen he defended in public
                    some questions in philosophy with infinite applause. On his return from Mont
                    rond, he received as his tutor Μ. de Merille, a man deeply versed in the
                    knowledge of ancient and modern laws, of the holy scriptures, and of the
                    mathematics. Under the direction of this eminent person the duke went through a
                    new course with prodigious success, acquiring a critical taste in the arts and
                    sciences, which he retained during his whole life. His chief inclination,
                    however, lay towards the military art; and at the age of eighteen he obtained
                    permission to make his first campaign as a volunteer in the army commanded by Μ.
                    de la Meilleraye. This campaign proved unfortunate; and the Duke d’Enghien was
                    only a witness of the marshal’s imprudence and disgrace. Nevertheless, in this
                    campaign he laid the foundation of that renown which made him afterwards be
                    considered as the greatest general of his age.</p>
                <p part="N">On his return to Paris, the duke waited upon Cardinal Richelieu at Ruel.
                    The minister was so pleased with his conversation, that he soon afterwards made
                    proposals of an alliance with the Prince of Condé, by marrying the Duke
                    d’Enghien to Claire Clémence de Maillé Brezé, the cardinal’s niece. The duke
                    consented to this match in obedience to his father; but the force he put upon
                    himself by yielding to it was so great, that he fell dangerously ill, and it was
                    long before he recovered.</p>
                <p part="N">The duke served two more campaigns as a volunteer; one under the Marshal
                    de la Meilleraye, and the other in the army of Louis XIII. which conquered
                    Roussillon. In 1643, at the age of twenty-two, he obtained from the king, at the
                    persuasion of Cardinal Mazarin, the command of the army destined to cover
                    Champagne and Picardy; which command was confirmed to him after the king’s death
                    by the queen regent, Anne of Austria, to whose interest he was strongly devoted.
                    In this situation, although he had never been present at any battle, he soon
                    gave such a specimen of his abilities as crowned him with glory. The Spaniards,
                    who threatened France with an invasion, were defeated by him at Rocroi on 19th
                    May 1643, and their hitherto invincible infantry destroyed; a signal victory,
                    which made him from that time be considered as the guardian genius of his
                    country. He next formed the project of besieging Thionville, and proposed it to
                    the council of regency. The latter consented with fear and distrust; but the
                    duke carried it into execution with such skill, activity, and courage, that he
                    became the object of general admiration. In two months time Thionville
                    surrendered. At length, having covered Alsace and Lorrain from the Imperialists,
                    he returned to Paris, where he obtained the government of Champagne, and that of
                    the city of Stenai.</p>
                <p part="N">The three following years were little more than a series of military
                    operations. The battles of Fribourg, in which the Duke d’Enghien triumphed over
                    Field Marshal Count de Mercy, the greatest general in all Germany; the taking of
                    Philipsbourg, and a great number of other places, which rendered him master of
                    the Palatinate, and of the whole course of the Rhine; the victory of Nordlingen,
                    by which he revenged the Viscount de Turcnne’s defeat at Mariendal; the siege
                    and conquest of Dunkirk; the success of his arms in Catalonia, where, though he
                    was forced to raise the siege of Lerida, he kept the Spaniards in awe, and cut
                    to pieces their rear-guard; these are the principal events which distinguish the
                    campaigns of 1644, 1645, and 1646.</p>
                <p part="N">The victories of the Duke d’Enghien, his great reputation, and the
                    esteem with which the people regarded him, began now to give umbrage to Mazarin.
                    The cardinal’s dislike to him appeared on the death of the Duke de Brezé,
                    admiral of France. The Prince of Condé earnestly demanded for his sen the Duke
                    de Brezé’s places; but Mazarin, afraid of increasing the wealth and power of a
                    prince whom his victories and the confidence of the people and the army had
                    already rendered too formidable to him, evaded his request, by persuading the
                    queen to take the admiralty to herself. On the death of his father, the
                    minister’s dislike to the young Prince of Condé became still more apparent. By
                    the minister’s persuasion he had accepted of the command of the army in
                    Catalonia; but, on his arrival at Barcelona, he found neither troops, money,
                    artillery, provisions, nor ammunition. Enraged at this deception, he vented his
                    resentment in bitter complaints and severe animadversions; but by the resources
                    which he found in his own genius, the prince added new lustre to his glory.</p>
                <p part="N">The campaign of 1648 was as glorious to Condé as those which preceded it
                    had been. To disconcert the projects of the Archduke Leopold, the prince
                    resolved to attack him even in the heart of the Low Countries; and, in spite of
                    the difficulties which he had to surmount, he besieged the important city of
                    Ypres, and took it in sight of the enemy’s forces.</p>
                <p part="N">Notwithstanding this success, Condé saw himself on the point of
                    experiencing the greatest reverse of fortune. His army was a prey to scarcity,
                    to nakedness, contagious distempers, and desertion. For eight months it had
                    received no supply from the minister except half a muster. Every thing was
                    furnished by the prince himself, who expended what money he had, and borrowed
                    more, in order to supply his troops. When it was represented to him that he was
                    in danger of ruining himself by such an enormous expense, he replied, that since
                    he every day ventured his life for the service of his country, he could very
                    well sacrifice his fortune to it. Let but the government exist, added he, and I
                    shall want for nothing.</p>
                <p part="N">The French army having been reinforced by four thousand of the troops of
                    λVeimar, Condé attacked the Spaniards, who were advantageously encamped near
                    Lens, and gained a complete victory over them. He afterwards besieged Fumes, the
                    garrison of which, consisting of five hundred men, surrendered themselves
                    prisoners of war.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749898?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9898-0202"/>
                <p part="N">But the prince was wounded in the trenches there by a musket-shot, which
                    struck him above the right hip; and the contusion proved so great that he was
                    forced to submit to several incisions.</p>
                <p part="N">The French court, animated with the victory at Lens, thought this a
                    proper time to take vengeance on the factions which for some time had violently
                    agitated the kingdom; and accordingly imprisoned Broussel and Blanc-menil, two
                    of the principal leaders of the country party. This vigorous proceeding,
                    however, occasioned a general revolt. Two hundred thousand men took arms in
                    Paris, barricaded the streets, invested the Palais Royal, and demanded the
                    liberation of the prisoners. It was necessary to release them; but from that
                    time the regal authority was annihilated, the queen exposed to a thousand
                    insults, and Mazarin durst no longer venture out of the Palais Royal. In this
                    embarrassment the queen recalled the Prince of Condé, as the only person from
                    whom she could hope for support. He had retired to Ruel, whither the regent had
                    gone with the young king and Mazarin. Anne of Austria proposed to him the
                    reducing of Paris by force of arms; but he calmed the resentments <hi
                        rend="italic">of that</hi> princess, and instead of becoming accessory to
                    her vengeance, directed all his views to pacify the kingdom, and at length
                    brought about an accommodation between the parties, who all desired it with
                    equal ardour. But new incidents soon rekindled the combustion. The treachery of
                    Mazarin, and the artifices of the leaders of the country party, occasioned fresh
                    cabals and fresh troubles. Condé was caressed by the leaders of both parties;
                    but at last, enraged at the arrogance of the malcontents, who every day formed
                    new pretensions, he took part openly with the court, though he thought it
                    ungrateful, and protected the minister, though he did not esteem him.</p>
                <p part="N">The royal family, the Duke of Orleans, Condé, and Mazarin, left Paris
                    privately in the night between the 5th and 6th of January 1646, and went to St
                    Germains. The parliament sent deputies to learn from the queen herself the
                    reasons of her departure, and to beg her to name the citizens whom she
                    suspected, that they might be tried. Mazarin had the imprudence to dismiss the
                    envoys without any answer. Exasperated at this, the people again took up arms in
                    order to defend themselves against the court, which had determined to block up
                    and to starve the capital, in order to suppress the party of malcontents.
                    Accordingly, with seven or eight thousand men, the broken relics of the last
                    campaign, the Prince of Condé formed a design of reducing above five hundred
                    thousand intrenched behind walls. He had neither money nor magazines, and he had
                    to operate in the depth of a most severe winter; nevertheless he constantly
                    defeated the troops of the malcontents; prevailed on het army which marched to
                    their assistance under Turenne to abandon that general; stopped the progress of
                    the Duke de Longueville, who had caused an insurrection in Normandy; got the
                    start of the Spaniards, who were advancing to give him battle; and ultimately
                    reduced the refractory capital.</p>
                <p part="N">De Retz, coadjutor of Paris, and afterwards cardinal, was the life and
                    soul of the revolters, and directed all their motions. He had taken Catiline as
                    his model, and he was equally intrepid, and capable of the most daring actions,
                    of an exalted genius, but governed by ambition. He signalized his hatred to
                    Mazarin by arming the malcontents, and he himself raised at his own expense a
                    regiment which he called the regiment of Corinth. Peace was at length signed at
                    St Germains; but neither party carried its point, and scarcely any one but Condé
                    acquired glory in this war. After the conclusion of the treaty, the prince
                    repaired to the capital, and traversed the streets in his coach, without
                    attendants. All persons of any consequence paid their compliments to him, and
                    the parliament sent a solemn deputation to thank him for the peace to which he
                    had so powerfully contributed.</p>
                <p part="N">The important service which Condé had just rendered the court entitled
                    him to the acknowledgments of the queen, and especially of Mazarin; but the dark
                    soul of the cardinal only remembered it to punish a too fortunate and too
                    powerful protector. He privately vowed the prince’s destruction; at least
                    resolved that he should give the whole kingdom a pattern of submission to and
                    dependence on his will. However, not to excite public indignation, he still kept
                    up appearances with the prince, and deceived him, by making the most flattering
                    proposals, which he always found means to avoid fulfilling. On the other hand,
                    the enraged prince despised the minister, and treated him with disdain. After
                    this they were again reconciled only to be again at variance. Each in his turn
                    courted the country party'·, in order to make it subservient to his designs. At
                    length Mazarin thought of an expedient, which had but too frequently answered
                    his purpose, of creating an irreconcilable quarrel between that party and the
                    prince. Among the malcontents, the Marquis de la Boulaye, aman of an infamous
                    character, had obtained the confidence of the party by false appearances of
                    hatred to the cardinal, while he secretly kept up a correspondence with his
                    eminence. It is pretended that he made him an offer of killing Condé privately.
                    Mazarin was charmed with the proposal; but he only required Boulaye to exhibit
                    all the proofs of an assassination, and to act in such a manner that every thing
                    might concur to render the country party suspected of that crime. He was
                    punctually obeyed; the coach was stopped; some pistols were fired at it, by
                    which two of the footmen were dangerously wounded; and after this shameful
                    exploit, La Boulaye took refuge in the hotel of the Duke of Beaufort, who was
                    the hero of the party, in order no doubt to countenance the prince’s suspicion
                    of the malcontents. Luckily Condé was not in his coach when it was stopped; the
                    cardinal had spread the report of his intended assassination, and, in concert
                    with the queen and the prince, he had prevailed to have the coach sent away
                    empty, in order to prove the reality of the attempt. Mazarin counterfeited a
                    zeal for the prince’s safety; declaimed furiously against the malcontents, who,
                    he pretended, had made an attempt on a life so precious to the state; and
                    inflamed Condé’s resentment against the Duke of Beaufort and the coadjutor, whom
                    he supposed to be the∙authors of this heinous outrage. The prince was so
                    strongly prejudiced that he refused to heaY them when they appeared before him
                    to justify themselves. He demanded justice against them of the king, formally
                    accused them before the parliament, and remained inflexible in spite of the
                    pains which the leaders of the party took to demonstrate to him that he had been
                    imposed upon. The affair was brought before the parliament; the accused defended
                    themselves; and the coadjutor, who had discovered the cardinal’s secret,
                    unmasked him so well, that the prince agreed to a private negotiation with the
                    malcontents, requiring nothing more than the coadjutor’s leaving Paris, but with
                    the rank of ambassador to Rome or Vienna. That prelate would have consented to
                    this to satisfy Condé, if Mazarin, some days afterwards, had not given him the
                    choice of any recompense, in order to engage his concurrence in the prince’s
                    destruction. Master of the queen’s mind, which he guided as he pleased, and sure
                    of having inflamed against Condé the resentment of the malcontents, he sought
                    and obtained, by means of the Duchess of Chevreuse, the support of that powerful
                    faction, which connected itself the more readily with him, in the hope that the
                    prince’s fall would soon enable it without difficulty to crush the cardinal
                    himself. The coadjutor had private conferences with the queen and <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194749911?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9911-0203"/>the
                    minister. Condé had notice of it, and in order to dis- ' cover if it were true,
                    he endeavoured to extort by surprise an admission from Mazarin’s own mouth.
                    “Cardinal,” said he one day, “it is publicly reported that you have nightly
                    meetings with the coadjutor, disguised like a trooper,” accompanying this speech
                    with a quick and penetrating look. But the cardinal, who was a perfect master of
                    dissimulation, answered him in such a free and apparently artless manner, that
                    he entirely removed Conde’s apprehensions; and the latter slighted the
                    information he had received of the plot forming against him. Mazarin wanted
                    nothing but the support of the Duke of Orleans, and at last found means, through
                    the Duchess of Chevrcuse, to inflame the jealousy of that fickle and inconstant
                    prince, and to engage him to consent to the imprisonment of Condé. And having
                    thus united all parties, and fearing no other obstacle, this ungrateful and
                    perfidious minister made preparations for privately arresting the prince, the
                    order for which was signed on the 18th January 1650. Condé having that day
                    repaired as usual to the Palais Royal, to assist at council with the Prince of
                    Conti and the Duke of Longueville, the queen gave orders to arrest all the
                    three, and to convey them without any noise to the castle of Vincennes. She was
                    instantly obeyed, and the princes were strictly guarded in that prison.</p>
                <p part="N">In this unexpected reverse of fortune, the fortitude and greatness of
                    Conde’s mind were remarkable. Confined with the two other princes in the tower
                    of Vincennes, where neither supper, furniture, nor beds were provided, lie
                    contented himself with two new laid eggs, and threw himself, in his clothes, on
                    a truss of straw, where he slept twelve hours without waking. He still retained
                    his cheerfulness, and dedicated the greater part of his time to reading, and the
                    rest to conversation, playing at battledoor and shuttle-cock, to bodily
                    exercises, and the cultivation of flowers.</p>
                <p part="N">Mazarin triumphed in the disgrace of the princes, proscribed all those
                    who were attached to Condé, and behaved in the most insolent and arbitrary
                    manner possible. The prince’s friends, however, notwithstanding their being
                    stricfly watched, found means to keep up a regular correspondence with him, and
                    made various attempts to release him. In particular, troops were raised by the
                    Dukes of Bouillon and Rochefoucault, and the Viscount de Turenne; and the
                    Princess of Condé engaged the province of Guienne to declare in his favour. But
                    all those efforts would, perhaps, have been ineffectual, if other and more
                    powerful resources had not been employed.</p>
                <p part="N">In that gallant and warlike age, every thing was managed by the
                    intrigues of five or six women, who possessed the confidence of the leaders of
                    the state, and of the various parties. The Princess of Mantua, wife to one of
                    the sons of the Elector Palatine, king of Bohemia, who principally directed the
                    counsels in the party of the princes, found means to reconcile the Duke of
                    Orleans, the coadjutor, and the malcontents, with the friends of the prince, and
                    all united their efforts against the cardinal; while the parliament, on the
                    other side, loudly demanded the release of the prisoners. The different orders
                    of the state also united in soliciting it, insomuch that the queen was at last
                    prevailed on to give her consent. At this news Mazarin was so confounded that he
                    fled in the disguise of a trooper, and arrived at the gates of Richelieu, where
                    a body of horse waited for him. The parliament, informed by the king of his
                    flight, thundered forth an arrêt, by which he was obliged to leave the kingdom,
                    with his family and foreign servants, in the space of fifteen days, under the
                    penalty of being exposed to a criminal prosecution. The queen desired to follow
                    him with the king; but the nobles and burghers invested the Palais Royal, and
                    prevented the execution of this project, which would have kindled a civil war.
                    Mazarin, therefore, perceiving that it was impossible for the queen to join him,
                    determined to go himself to restore the princes to their liberty, and to get the
                    start of the deputies who were coming to acquaint them with their release. On
                    his arrival at Havre, he informed the princes that they were free, entreated
                    Conde’s friendship, and was so abject as to prostrate himself at the feet of the
                    man whom he had so basely oppressed. Condé gave him a polite reception, and
                    spoke to him in a free and cheerful tone; but, tired with the mean submissions
                    which the cardinal lavished upon him, left his eminence without making any
                    promise, and set out on his return to Paris, which he entered as it were in
                    triumph, amidst the acclamations of all’orders of men, and the demonstrations
                        <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a most sincere and general joy.</p>
                <p part="N">After this a civil war ensued, in which the Prince of Condé sided with
                    the malcontents. Being pressed by the king’s army, he retired into the faubourg
                    of St Antoine, where he behaved with the utmost bravery; upon which the citizens
                    opened their gates and received him, and a peace soon afterwards ensued. His
                    hatred of the cardinal, however, induced him to quit Paris, and take refuge
                    among the Spaniards, who made him generalissimo of their forces; and he captured
                    Rocroi. But the peace of the Pyrenees restored him to his country; and he again
                    signalized himself at the head of the king’s armies. Being afflicted with gout,
                    he refused the command of the army in 1676, and retired to Chantilly, where he
                    was as much esteemed for the virtues of peace as he had before been for his
                    military talents. He diedin 1686, at Fontainbleau.</p>
