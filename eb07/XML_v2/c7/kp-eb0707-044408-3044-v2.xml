                    the first Protestant archbishop of Canterbury, was deseended of an aneient
                    family, and was born on the 2d of July 1489, at Aslaeton in the county of
                    Nottingham, being the seeond son <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Thomas Cranmer and of
                    his wife Agnes Hatfield. He received what was then considered as a suitable
                    education for a gentleman; nor did he neglect the recreations of hunting and
                    hawking, and the use of the bow. After his father’s death, and when he himself
                    was only fourteen years of age, he was sent to Jesus College, Cambridge, and
                    about the year 1510 he was elected to a fellowship. Erasmus, one of the great
                    restorers of solid and elegant learning, had already contributed his powerful
                    aid in rescuing this university from scholastic jargon and monkish barbarism.
                    The rectitude of Cranmer’s understanding enabled him to give a beneficial
                    tendency to his academical studies: not satisfied with the antiquated course, he
                    likewise devoted a portion of his time to the acquisition of the Greek and
                    Hebrew languages; and if he never became celebrated for the purity or eleganee
                    of Latinity, it must be recollected that his chief attention was devoted to
                    higher objects. Before be had reached the twenty-third year of his age, he
                    vacated his fellowship by marriage. His wife, who in reality appears to have
                    been the daughter of a gentleman, some Catholie writers of his own time have
                    industriously represented as a woman of low condition; and were we even to admit
                    the aeeuracy of their representations, it is not easy to perceive that he would
                    thus be curtailed of any portion of his moral dignity. He was now employed as a
                    reader or leeturer in Magdalen, or, as it was then called, Buckingham College;
                    and, says John Fox, “for that he would with more diligenee apply that his office
                    of reading, placed his said wife in an inn called the Dolphin, the wife of the
                    house being of affinity to her. By reason whereof, and of his open resort unto
                    his wife at that inn, he was much marked of some Popish merchants; whereupon
                    rose the slanderous noise and report against him after he was preferred to the
                    arehbishoprie of Canterbury, raised up by the malieious disdain of eertain
                    malignant adversaries to Christ and his truth, bruiting abroad everywhere, that
                    he was but a hostler, and therefore without all good learning.” FIis wife died
                    about twelve months after their marriage; and it is an obvious proof of the
                    estimation in whieh he was held,* that he was immediately restored to the
                    fellowship which he had vaeated. He pursued his studies with renewed ardour; and
                    adhering to the plan of reading with a pen in his hand, he now prepared a stock
                    of materials which he found of no small value in his future controversies.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1524 be declined the offer of a fellowship in the college
                    whieh Wolsey had founded at Oxford. About the same period he took the degree <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> D. D., and was appointed to the lectureship in that
                    faculty by his own college. In 1526 he was nominated one of the public examiners
                    in divinity; and in this situation he appears to have been instrumental in
                    scattering the seeds of reformation. He had been entrusted with the education of
                    the two sons of a gentleman named Cressy, who resided in the parish of
                    Waltham-Abbey and county of Essex, and whose wife was related to Cranmer. Being
                    driven from Cambridge by an epidemic distemper, the preceptor and his pupils
                    retired to Cressy’s house; nor does it clearly appear that he afterwards resided
                    in the university. The king had made an excursion to the neighbourhood; and two
                    of his attendants, Dr Gardiner, afterwards bishop of Winchester, and Dr Fox,
                    afterwards bishop of Hereford, having met Cranmer at Waltham, began to discuss
                    with him the momentous question of the king’s divorce from Catherine of Aragon.
                    This princess had been married to Arthur, the elder brother of Henry, but,
                    according to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753057?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-3057-0445"/>her own solemn averment, their nuptials had
                    never been consummated. For the second marriage, a papal dispensation had been
                    obtained in due form; nor'does the king appear to have been accessible to any
                    compunctious visit-ings, till he found this nļarriage an impediment to his union
                    with Anne Boleyn. He then exerted all his influence with the pope to procure a
                    sentence, declaring the nullity of a marriage contracted with his brother’s
                    widow; but although his holiness might otherwise have been disposed to lend a
                    willing ear to such a suitor, he was restrained by the consideration that
                    Catherine was the aunt of the emperor Charles the Fifth. Many intrigues had been
                    employed, and much delay had intervened, when this casual discussion took place
                    at Waltham, and when Dr Cranmer suggested the expediency of “trying the question
                    out of the word of God, and thereupon to proceed to a final sentence.” He
                    strongly urged the propriety of continuing the appeal to canonists and divines,
                    for the faculties of various universities had already been solicited to deliver
                    a' formal opinion; but it is clear that the peculiar merit of his advice must be
                    resolved into a hint, more or less direct, respecting the necessity Of deciding
                    the question without the authority of the pope. This controversy, originating,
                    not in the king’s scruples of conscience, but in feelings of a very different
                    nature, contributed in no small degree to the elevation of Cranmer, and to the
                    downfall of the church. When Fox, who was then the royal almoner, communicated
                    this plan of effecting a divorce, Henry “swore by the Mother of God, that man
                    hath the right sow by the ear.” His attendance at court was immediately
                    required; and at their first interview, the king enjoined him to lay aside all
                    other avocations, and to bend his faculties to the furtherance of this important
                        <hi rend="italic">device.</hi> In the mean time he commended him to the
                    hospitality of the earl of Wiltshire, father to Anne Boleyn. It is evident that
                    Dr Lingard has very erroneously described him as “a dependant on the family of
                    the king’s mistress ;” for this appears to have been the true origin of his
                    connexion with the family, and his real dependence was first on the hopes, and
                    afterwardson the gratitude, of the king himself. Henry appointed him archdeacon
                    of Taunton, and one of his chaplains; he likewise bestowed upon him some
                    parochial benefice, of which the name is not ascertained.</p>
                <p part="N">Unwilling to hazard an open rupture with the visible head of the church,
                    the king again had recourse to negotiation, and Cranmer was conjoined in a
                    mission to the court of Rome, where he saw “many things contrary to God’s
                    honour.” During the following year, 1531, he was commissioned as sole ambassador
                    to the emperor. He resided for several months in Germany; and there, about the
                    beginning of the year 1532, he married Annc, a niece of the wife of Osiander, an
                    eminent pastor of Nürnberg. At the period of his first marriage he was a layman;
                    but as he was now in priest’s orders, he plainly disregarded the authority of
                    the church. His residence in this country is, with great probability, supposed
                    to have had the effect of bringing him much nearer to the sentiments of the
                    Protestants: here be must have enjoyed many opportunities of becoming acquainted
                    with their views and feelings; nor could his soundness <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    understanding and honesty of purpose be unprofitably exercised, in a situation
                    so well calculated to second the impulse which his mind had already received.
                    From the gross error of the real presence he only extricated himself by slow
                    degrees. The human understanding had for many centuries been so stultified by
                    this portentous doctrine, that it seemed incapable of regaining a sound and
                    healthful state; and, in this article of belief, the progress of Luther and his
                    followers was only from one absurdity to another; by rejecting <hi rend="italic"
                        >transubstantiation,</hi> and adopting <hi rend="italic"
                        >consuhstaìitiation,</hi> they introduced a change of scholastic and
                    unscriptural terms, leaving thcir ideas involved in the ancient maze of Popish
                    errors.</p>
                <p part="N">Archbishop Warham, the patron of Erasmus, died in the month of August
                    1532, arid Dr Cranmer was immediately recalled from Germany to fill the vacant
                    see of Canterbury. This sudden and high preferment he is said to have accepted
                    with no small reluctance; and one of the difficulties which presented
                    themselves, is supposed to have been connected with the peculiarity of his
                    situation as a married priest. During the preceding reign, it had been decided
                    by the courts of law that thb marriage of a priest was voidable, but not void;
                    and consequently that his issue, born in wedlock, was entitled to inherit. But
                    such a marriage was not reconcilable with the principles of the canon law, and
                    much was to be apprchcnded from the capricious ferocity of the king. His wife
                    was never publicly acknowledged; and, after the promulgation of the six articles
                    in 1539, he found it expedient to send her to her native country. When he was
                    afterwards charged with having thus entered into the state of matrimony, he
                    admitted the fact, but at the same time affirmed “that it was better for him to
                    have his own, than do like other priests, holding and keeping other men’s
                    wives.” Before he took the oath of episcopal obedience to the pope, hc adopted
                    the expedient of making a formal protest, that he only took it in such a sense
                    as was consistent with the laws of God, with the rights of the king and his
                    realm, and with the liberty of declaring his own sentiments in matters of
                    religion, even when they might be in opposition to the authority of the pope
                    himself. How far this protest was privately-interposed or publicly divulged, has
                    been much and eagerly disputed between Protestants and Catholics, but it appears
                    to be a question of very little importance. While we are ready to admit that his
                    latest biographer has refuted various allegations of the Popish historians, we
                    still retain a strong conviction that the character of Cranmer is not materially
                    benefited by his zealous defence. To entitle the archbishop elect to receive the
                    bulls from the pope, it was necessary for him to take a prescribed oath: the
                    authority which imposed this oath manifestly left no room for private
                    interpretation; nor can we regard such an expedient in any other light than that
                    of a mere subterfuge. “It was,” says Mr Todd, “the pleasure of his sovereign,
                    but his own aversion, we have seen, that these forms should yet bc followed. But
                    instead of engaging himsclf to the oath, he declared to the king, that without
                    the liberty of opposing it he would decline the honour that was proffered. Of
                    this conduct he never afterwards repented.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    and impotent conclusion? When swearing is not a mere act of profanity, it is in
                    its very essence the act of a man engaging himself by his oath; and if Cranmer
                    thus reserved to himself the liberty of <hi rend="italic">opposing</hi> an oath,
                    which hc yet consented to take, he was openly-swearing to perform what he
                    secretly considered as unlawful. What his biographer subjoins is not more
                    satisfactory. “Thus much for the notoriety of the protest. It has been wished
                    that he had taken the papal oath, as his predecessor Warham had taken it,
                    without reserve or explanation, and then proceeded quietly in opposition to the
                    pontiff, as that prelate is believed to have done by submitting, not long
                    before, to the rcgal supremacy, and thus <pb break="no"

                    decisive step towards a reformation. The clamour against Cranmer, as to
                    disingenuousness, might then, it has been thought, have been comparatively
                    little, or none. But Cranmer was sincere, and Warham the reverse.” Casuists may
                    suggest divers expedients and salvos, but an honest man has only one method of
                    taking an oath.</p>
                <p part="N">That Cranmer’s elevation is ehiefly to be referred to the aptitude which
                    he had discovered for promoting the dissolution of the royal marriage, is a faet
                    whieh eannot well be doubted. Soon after his consecration he addressed to the
                    king a letter, in whieh he zealously urged the necessity of bringing this
                    important question to a determination; and as the pious monarch had already been
                    declared the head of the ehurch of England, he had no hesitation in returning an
                    answer, which, says the biographer, “was in perfect accordance with the
                    primate’s suggestion; in which he forgot not to maintain <hi rend="italic">the

                    anomalous, and, we will venture to add, very absurd maxim, that the king is the
                    head of the church, this may be considered as rather a curious account; for in
                    what sense could Henry the Eighth be said to recover a right or prerogative
                    which had never been possessed by him or any of his predecessors?<note

                    The queen of England was cited to appear before the arehbishop at Dunstable,
                    within a few miles of Ampthill, the place of her residence; and on the 8th of
                    May 1533, he opened his new eourt, assisted by the bishop of Lineoln as his
                    assessor. Catherine having failed to make her appearanee before this irregular
                    tribunal, was, after the expiration of fifteen days, declared contumacious; and
                    the marriage was adjudged to be null and void from the beginning, as having been
                    contracted in defiance of the divine prohibition. In the month of January,
                    F1enry had privately married Anne Boleyn, after having cohabited with her for
                    several years; but it seems to have been asserted without foundation that
                    Cranmer was present at their scandalous nuptials. It is well known that she did
                    not long retain the king’s affections. Ardent love, in so ferocious a breast,
                    was easily converted into deadly hatred; and Anne, when supplanted by a new
                    favourite, was accused of various aets of infidelity, of which it is not eertain
                    that she was guilty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    faeulty. “The trial and condemnation of the queen,” says Mr Todd, “almost
                    immediately followed. Not eontent with this result, the king resolved on further
                    vengeance; and after two days more, the afflicted archbishop <hi rend="italic"
                        >was obliged</hi> judicially to declare her marriage invalid, and her
                    offspring illegitimate.” But how was the archbishop <hi rend="italic"
                        >obliged</hi> to perform an act which is tacitly admitted to have been
                    wrong? The reader must bear in mind that this sentence could have no reference
                    to the queen’s alleged adultery; for, aeeording to the canon law, marriage,
                    whieh is one of the seven sacraments, cannot be dissolved by any course of
                    judicial procedure; and we may here remark, in passing, that although the modern
                    law of England does not professedly adhere to this notion of a sacrament, it is
                    not completely disentangled from the ancient superstition: the ecclesiastical
                    courts may declare a marriage to have been invalid from the beginning, but they
                    eannot dissolve the sacred bond of matrimony. Cranmer was now <hi rend="italic"
                        >obliged</hi> to declare invalid from the beginning a marriage, whieh he had
                    formerly pronouneed good and valid; and there is too much justiee in the remark
                    of Dr Lingard, “nėver perhaps was there a more solemn moekery of the forms of
                    justice, than in the pretended trial of this extraordinary cause.” Nor is this
                    the last case of divorce to be mentioned. After the death of Jane Seymour, the
                    king married Anne of Cleves; and as he did not find her person agreeable tó his
                    taste, he again had recourse to the agency of the dutiful archbishop, and the
                    sentence of invalidity was confirmed by the seal of Cranmer. The next consort of
                    this atrocious tyrant, whom Cranmer has described as “a most godly prince of
                    famous memory,” was Catharine Howard, who was beheaded without being

                            for this among other reasons: “quoniam error circa virginitatem continet

                    advantage; nor is it easy to believe that he did not act against the clearest
                    conviction of his own conscience. All or most that can be urged in palliation of
                    his conduct is, that he had fallen on evil days, and that to resist the commands
                    of such a master was certain death. In other respects, he was too much tainted
                    with the errors of the time; but, if he was not exempted from the spirit of
                    persecution, he was subject to an error which, however hideous it may appear to
                    us, extended to nearly all his contemporaries. The execution of Servetus for his

                    is universally regarded as one of the mildest of the early reformers. Soon after
                    his elevation to the primacy, Cranmer acted as one of the inquisitors who
                    condemned John Frith for denying the doctrine of transubstantiation. “His said
                    opinion is of such nature,” he states in a private letter, “that he thought it
                    not necessary to be believed as an article of our faith, that there is the very
                    corporal presence of Christ within the host and saerament of the altar, and
                    holdeth of this point most after the opinion of OEeolampadius. And surely I
                    myself sent for him iij. or iiij. times to persuade him tojeave that his
                    imagination; but for all that we eould &lt;l&lt;&gt;therein, he would not apply

                    examinatioris; for my Lord of London hath given sentence, and delivered him to
                    the secular powers, where he looketh every day to go unto the fire. And there is
                    also condemned with him one Andrew, a tailor of London, for the said self-same
                    opinion. And thus fare you well. From my manor of Croydon.” Is not this a cool
                    contemplation of such an inhuman act as the burning of his fellow-creatures? It
                    was Andrew Hewet who, honouring Frith, and adhering to his doctrines, was thus
                    condemned to the same cruel death; and, after the lapse of a few years, Cranmer,
                    following the dictates oí common sense, adopted the very opinion for which his
                    brethren had been doomed “to go unto the fire.” These holy butcheries were
                    followed by many others. The persecutions which commenced in the reign of the
                    unrelenting father, were not discontinued in that of the milder son; but the

                    “That you believe that the Word was made flesh in the Virgin’s belly; but that
                    Christ took flesh of the Virgin you believe not, because the flesh of the Virgin
                    being the outward man, was sinfully gotten and born in sin; but the Word, by the
                    consent of the inward man of the Virgin, was made flesh.”<note anchored="true"

                    For persisting in her refusal to recant this unhappy jargon, the poor creature
                    was committed to the flames. When Cranmer excommunicated her as a heretic, and,
                    in the true inquisitorial style, ordered her to be delivered to the secular arm,
                    she exclaimed, “It was not long ago that you burned Anne Askew for a piece of
                    bread, and yet came yourself soon after to believe and profess the same doctrine
                    for which you burned her.” The young king was extremely reluctant to imbrue his
                    hands in the blood of such a victim, and a year elapsed before she was ordered
                    for execution. It is plainly stated by the martyrologist that his scruples were
                    at length overcome, or his resolution shaken, by the urgency of the archbishop.
                    About the same period, George Van Paris, a Dutch surgeon residing in London, was
                    burnt for denying the divinity of Christ; nor does it appear that, in any of the
                    various cases which have been recorded, the archbishop felt, or professed to
                    feel, the slightest doubt or misgiving as to the perfect propriety of committing
                    such atrocious murders under the sanction of law and religion.</p>
                <p part="N">Another unequivocal proof of his having deeply imbibed the spirit of
                    persecution, is to be found in the book entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Reformatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Legum Ecclesiasticarum.</hi> The plan of
                    this book had originated in the reign of Henry; and in that of his son, Cranmer
                    was placed at the head of eight commissioners, who were enjoined to prepare it
                    for the inspection of a much larger committee, and afterwards for that of the
                    privy council. It is supposed to have been translated into Latin by Sir John
                    Cheke, the king’s preceptor, and by Dr Haddon, master of Trinity Hall at
                    Cambridge, both of whom were eminent for their classical learning, but the
                    latter was a greater master of Latinity. It is not to be regretted that this
                    code of ecclesiastical law never obtained any public sanction. Much of the
                    re^nųpsibility evidently belongs to Cranmer; and his biograpb^ţţàs¾ures us that
                    an abler canonist was not easily to be'iς⅛⅛jσ*within the realm. The title
                    respecting the mode of proceeding in cases of heresy, contains a chapter on
                    obstinate heretics, which adjudges them, after all other remedies have been
                    attempted, to be delivered over to the civil magistrate in order to be punished.
                    “Consumptis .omnibus aliis remediis, ad extremum ad civiles magistratus

                    to the secular arm those unfortunate beings whom they describe as heretics?
                    Lancelottus expresses himself in the following terms: “Saecularis relinquentur

                    Gravina, a more recent writer, conveys the same meaning in these words:

                    phraseology it would not be difficult to add ninety-seven more; and the direful
                    import of such expressions in the mouth of a canonist, can only be doubtful to
                    those who are unacquainted with the history of the inquisition. In point of
                    form, the hands of churchmen must not be stained with blood; but the sentence of
                    the ecclesiastical judge, when it awards a cruel and ignominious death, or any
                    inferior degree of corporal punishment, must be inflicted under the sanction of
                    the civil power. Mr Hallam has remarked, that “infamy and civil disability seem
                    to be the only punishments intended to be kept up, except in case of the denial
                    of the Christian religion; for if a heretic were, as a matter of course, to be
                    burned, it seems needless to provide, as in this chapter, that he should be
                    incapable of being a witness, or of making a will.” But the Spanish inquisition
                    did not punish with fire and fagot every offence against the Catholic faith; and
                    when, in a subsequent chapter, Cranmer and his associates contemplate the
                    possibility of a heretic avoiding extreme punishment, they <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 7</hi> do not necessarily disown the fellowship of their
                    brother inquisitors. It is scarcely to be considered as a sufficient vindication
                    of the archbishop, that in a manuscript copy of the work, formerly in his
                    possession, the punishment of perpetual banishment or perpetual imprisonment is
                    specifically mentioned. This correction is not in the hand-writing of Cranmer,
                    but is supposed to be in that of Martyr;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">Todd’s Life of Archbishop Cranmer, vol. il. p.

                    of capital punishment is completely set at rest. Of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Reformatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Legum Ecclesiasticarum,</hi> the first
                    edition was published by John Fox, in the year 1571, from a copy which had been
                    transcribed by the archbishop’s secretary, and corrected by himself as well as
                    by Martyr. It is not therefore difficult to perceive where we must expect to
                    find the text as it was finally adjusted. This bloody text seems to admit of
                    another mode of illustration equally legitimate. The practice of the archbishop
                    was in perfect conformity with the principles which we have here explained. In
                    the reign of Henry, he was accessory to the death of several individuals who
                    denied the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation; and in the reign of Edward,
                    he was accessory to the death of others who denied articles of the creed to
                    which he then adhered. What meaning he himself attached to the expression of
                    delivering a heretic to the civil magistrate, we have already ascertained in the
                    case of Frith; in reference to whom he states, “my Lord of London hath given
                    sentence, and delivered him to the secular powers, where he looketh every day

                <p part="N">Such errors as these are too glaring to be easily concealed; but it is
                    equally certain that his character was adorned by many private virtues, and that
                    the great body of his countrymen cannot fail to regard him in the light of a
                    public benefactor. Under his influence, books of religious instruction were

                    nearly advanced to that point where it still rests. That this reformation should

                <p part="N">By the testament of King Henry, who died in the month of January 1647,
                    the archbishop was placed at the head of a regency, consisting of sixteen
                    individuals, of whom the greater part were favourably disposed to the reformed
                    doctrines. Edward, who was of a tender age, was anxious to promote the same
                    cause; and the seeds which had been sown during the late reign, now became much
                    more vigorous in their growth. The chief instrument of the reformation was
                    undoubtedly Cranmer, who promoted it by his talents and learning, as well as by
                    the influence necessarily connected with his high station. He was one of the
                    compilers of the service-book, and the author of at least three of the homilies,
                    those on salvation, faith, and good works. He was likewise the sole or principal
                    author of the first Articles of Religion, forty-two in number, which were
                    slightly altered in the reign of Elizabeth, and reduced to the number of
                    thirty-nine.</p>
                <p part="N">Edward died at a premature age in the year 1553, after having, at the
                    instigation of the duke of Northumberland, nominated as his successor Lady Jane
                    Grey, who had married the duke’s fourth son, and who was the daughter of the
                    duke of Suffolk, and grand-daughter of Mary, sister to Henry VIII. The king’s
                    two sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, were superseded on the ground of their
                    illegitimate birth. To this scheme the archbishop acceded with no small
                    reluctance. Jane was proclaimed queen, but, after a reign of a few days, was
                    committed to the Tower, and soon died by the hand of the executioner. On the
                    accession of Queen Mary, many of the Protestants were subjected to the extreme
                    tortures which they had felt too little compunction in applying to others.
                    Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, were first committed to the Tower, and were
                    afterwards removed to Oxford, w here they were confined in the common prison
                    called Bocardo, and were at length condemned as obstinate heretics. A long
                    interval elapsed before their execution. Ridley, who had been bishop of London,
                    and Latimer of Worcester, suffered with that noble resolution which became
                    martyrs of the truth, but the mind of Cranmer recoiled under so great a trial of
                    human fortitude; the vain and delusive hope of life impelling him to deny his
                    faith, and to sign no fewer than six recantations. The tender mercies of the
                    wicked are cruel: his offences were not to be pardoned by such a sovereign under
                    the influence of such counsellors; and on the 21st of May 1556, this learned,
                    venerable, and aged man was committed to the flames. Rejecting his unfortunate
                    recantations, he died in the pious profession of the Protestant faith, and
                    suffered the cruel torture of the fire with an undaunted resolution, which his
                    recent conduct had not encouraged his friends to expect. It is not for us, who
                    are placed beyond the reach of such fiery trials, to condemn the weakness for
                    which he made this atonement.</p>
                <p part="N">In the history of Cranmer’s persecution, we find no mention of his w
                    ife, or any of his near relations. He however left a widow and two children,
                    Thomas and Margaret. Another daughter, named Anne, had died before him. The
                    surviving children were restored in blood by an act of parliament, passed in the
                    year 1563, but it does not appear that they were reinstated in their property.
                    It is asserted by Ames, who however quotes no authority, that the widow married

                    archdeacon of Canterbury, but in the reign of Mary was deprived of his

                <p part="N">Cranmer was a person of a vigorous understanding, improved by extensive
                    learning. His travels and studies had rendered him as familiar with the French,
                    Italian, and German, as with the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages. In theology
                    and the canon law he appears to have been deeply skilled; and, possessing an
                    acute intellect and a clear head, he was capable of applying his various stores
                    of knowledge to the most useful and practical purposes. His works afford a very
                    favourable specimen of the English style of that period; and we are glad to be
                    informed that a complete edition is speedily to issue from the university press
                    of Oxford. With his intellectual endowments he united many of the amiable
                    virtues of private life: his natural disposition was mild and conciliating, and
                    he was distinguished by the engaging affability of his manners. He was however
                    capable of being roused to fierce indignation; for we learn from unquestionable
                    authority, that, on a certain occasion, he offered single combat to the duke of
                    Northumberland. He was a zealous encourager of learning, and eminently practised
                    the virtues of charity and hospitality. But his character, as we have already
                    seen, was not without glaring defects. His compliances with the unhallowed
                    wishes of the king, are partly to be ascribed to his want of that invincible
                    firmness which could alone have sustained him under the frowns of so unrelenting
                    a tyrant; and much influence must doubtless be ascribed to the prevailing notion
                    of the time, that the will of a sovereign prince is not to be resisted by any of
                    his subjects. Compliance in almost every possible case seems to have been
                    regarded as an act of duty; nor is it easy, on any other hypothesis, to account
                    for the long and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753109?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-3109-0449"/>abject submission of the English nobility and
                    gentry to the tyranny and caprice of the house of Tudor. Although this
                    consideration does not increase our respect for the archbishop’s character, it
                    is nevertheless obvious that the pliancy of his disposition, by enabling him to
                    retain the favour of the king, enabled him to become a more powerful instrument
                    in promoting the cause of learning and religion. For his deep participation in
                    the bloody persecutions of two successive reigns, we must likewise endeavour to
                    find some apology in the current maxims of the age to which he belonged. FIis
                    own nature was far from being ungentle; but his intellect was bewildered by the
                    doctrines, and his heart hardened by the practices, of the church in which he
                    had been educated. (x.)</p>
