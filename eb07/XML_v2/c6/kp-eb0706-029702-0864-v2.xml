                        >Melchior</hi></label>, an Italian poet, was born at Padua in the year 1730,
                    of a family of considerable rank but small fortune. He was educated at the
                    academy of Padua, where he early showed a strong inclination for literary
                    pursuits, and made such progress in study that he was raised to the chair of
                    rhetoric in the academy where he had been brought up,' at a period of life when
                    others were yet attending the lectures* Having been appointed to this charge, he
                    devoted himself with the utmost zeal to the duties of his situation. He
                    introduced several useful reforms into the system of education which was then
                    practised, and endeavoured by incessant study to render his instructions as
                    useful as possible to the youth committed to his care. The first fruits of his
                    studies were Italian translations of the Prometheus of AEschylus, and three
                    tragedies of Voltaire, the merit of which, and the reputation hc had acquired
                    for learning and persevering application, successively procured him a
                    distinguished employment at Venice, and the professorship of Greek and Hebrew in
                    the university of Padua. Cesarotti had held this situation for nearly thirty
                    years at the date of the first French invasion of Italy. This poct did not, like
                    Alfieri, scorn the pecuniary favours of the republican government, nor shun the
                    acquaintance of its chiefs. He published several political tracts and essays by
                    their order; and when the general of the invading army assumed the title of King
                    of Italy, he was rewarded with two pensions of considerable amount, and
                    distinguished by various honours. He continued to reside partly at Padua, and
                    partly at his country house of Selvaggiano, chiefly occupied with the
                    composition of laudatory poems in return for the favours he had received, and
                    with the superintendence of a complete edition of his works, when he was
                    suddenly arrested by the hand of death on the 3d of November 1808.</p>
                <p part="N">Though held by Sismondi to be the first in point of celebrity of the
                    modern Italian poets, Cesarotti is better known as a translator than as an
                    original author. The Italians have always been distinguished for the elegance
                    and spirit of thcir translations from the classics; the Lucretius of Marchetti,
                    the AEneid of Annibal Caro, and Anguillara’s free version of the Metamorphoses
                    of Ovid, have deservedly exalted their reputation to the utmost height in this
                    department of literature. Anguillara’s translation of Homer, however, had been
                    less popular and successful than his Metamorphoses, and there still remained
                    room in Italy for a translation of the prince of poets. The work of Cesa-roţti,
                    however, is far from being literal; he has modernized and accommodated the Iliad
                    to the prevailing taste of the age; he has abridged it in some places, and added
                    to it in others, according to his taste or fancy; and he has often been
                    reproached with having given to the Greek bard the style and language of his
                    favourite Ossian. In the late edition of the works of Cesarotti, the poetical
                    version is followed by a literal prose one, accompanied with critical notes and
                    dissertations, partly translated from Pope and Dacier.</p>
                <p part="N">Cesarottĩ acquired more fame by his version of Ossian than by that of
                    Homer; and certainly no translation had ever more appearance of originality and
                    inspiration. He has completely preserved the spirit of the supposed bard of
                    Morven—his gigantic and gloomy grandeur; and, at the same time, has given us
                    that harmony of versification which we desiderate in the work of Macpherson. The
                    Italian Ossian was first published at Padua in 1763, 2 vols. 8vo, at the expense
                    of an English traveller, with whom Cesarotti had contracted a friendship. This
                    edition was necessarily incomplete, as the translation of Macpherson at that
                    time was so also; but the whole poems were printed at the same place about ten
                    years afterwards, in 4 vols, small 8vo. The Poems of Ossian also occupy four
                    volumes in the recent complete edition of the works of Cesarotti, where they are
                    accompanied by an examination of the question so much agitated in this country
                    with regard to the authenticity of these celebrated productions. Their
                    appearance in this new form attracted much attention in Italy, and raised up
                    many imitators of the Ossianic style, so different from the warm and glowing
                    imagery of the earlier Italian poets.</p>
                <p part="N">His country was also indebted to Cesarottĩ for a number of valuable
                    prose works. The <hi rend="italic">Course of Greek Literature</hi> was his chief
                    undertaking; but the plan on which he had commenced was too vast to be
                    completed. His essays on the <hi rend="italic">Sources of the Pleasure derived
                        from Tragedy,</hi> and on the <hi rend="italic">Origin and Progress of the
                        Poetic Art,</hi> are distinguished by elegant and ingenious criticism; while
                    his treatises <hi rend="italic">Sulla Filosofiα</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >delle</hi><hi rend="italic">Lingue, et</hi><hi rend="italic">Sulla
                        Filosojia dc Gusto</hi> (the last of which is principally intended as an
                    apology for the peculiarities of his own style), show considerable acuteness and
                    strength of understanding. In 1797 an Academy of Sciences and Belles Lettres had
                    been established at Padua, of which Cesarottĩ was nominated perpetual secretary.
                    It was part of the duties of this situation to read, at the stated meetings of
                    the academy, the various essays which had been prepared by its members.
                    Frequently, however, these were of such extent that the secretary found it
                    expedient merely to give, in his own language, a general account of the object
                    of the author, and the result of his investigations. These readings produced his
                    reports, entitled <hi rend="italic">Pelazioni Academiche,</hi> each of which
                    reports is divided into three parts; the first containing the essays on
                    Experimental Philosophy, the second on Mathematics, and the third on Belles
                    Lettres. The whole, however, may be regarded as a literary composition, since
                    the departments of mathematics and philosophy exhibit only general views of the
                    subject of inquiry. Almost all the prose works of Cesarottĩ are distinguished by
                    extensive erudition and a philosophical spirit, while his style is for the most
                    part lively and forcible. But the Italian prose of the eighteenth century was
                    very different from that written by Giovanni Della Casa, Machiavel, and their
                    contemporaries in the sixteenth; and those critics who have deplored the recent
                    innovations on the ancient purity of the Tuscan tongue, chiefly attribute to
                    Cesarottĩ the introduction of those Gallicisms and new modes of expression which
                    have so greatly corrupted the language of the golden age of Leo.</p>
                <p part="N">All the works of Cesarottĩ above mentioned, including several volumes of
                    correspondence, have been published in a complete edition, which was commenced
                    at Padua in the year 1800, under the author’s own direction. It has been
                    continued since his death by Joseph Barbieri, who was his successor in the chair
                    of Greek and Hebrew at Padua, and who has also published Memoirs of the Life and
                    Writings of his deceased friend, printed at Padua, 1810, 8vo.</p>

                    higher or lower by their own age than by posterity. Cesarotti will probably
                    belong to the former class, who perhaps, after all, enjoy the pleasanter sort of
                    reputation. But, though the praise of great and original genius may in future
                    times be denied him, every age will admit his learning and talents, and the
                    meritorious assiduity of his literary researches. <hi rend="smallcaps"
