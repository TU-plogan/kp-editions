                    word formerly used to signify a learned man, or man of letters. The word eomes
                    from the Greek xXrçgo¢, used for <hi rend="italic">clergy,</hi> but more
                    properly signifying <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >heritage,</hi> beeause the lot or portion of clerks or eeelesiastics is to
                    serve God. Accordingly <hi rend="italic">clerus</hi> was at first used to
                    signify those who were particularly attached to the serviee of God. The origin
                    of the expression is derived from the Old Testament, where the tribe of Levi is
                    ealled the <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> or <hi rend="italic">heritage,
                        r.λr</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"> l</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ξος</hi>; and God is reeiproeally ealled <hi rend="italic"
                        >their portion,</hi> by reason of that tribe having been eon-seerated to the
                    serviee of God, and lived on the offerings made to God, without any other
                    settled provision. Thus Pasquier observes, that the officers of the counts, or
                        <hi rend="italic">comites,</hi> were anciently created under the title of
                        <hi rend="italic">clerks of accompts,</hi> and secretaries of state were
                    ealled <hi rend="italic">clerks of the secret.</hi> So <hi rend="italic"
