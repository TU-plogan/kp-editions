                    caves; which seems to have been the origin of catacombs. Caves long continued
                    the proper habitations of shepherds. Among the Romans, the <hi rend="italic"

                    a natural cave consecrated for the purpose by Zoroaster. The cave of the nymph

                    celebrated as the projector of the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman s Magazine</hi>
                    (the first publication of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193350370?mode=fullsize"

                    thousand more”), was born in .’691. His father being disappointed of some small
                    famil’ expectations, was reduced to follow the trade of a shoemaker at Rugby in
                    Warwickshire. The free school o <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> this place, in
                    which his son had, by the rules of its foundation, a right to be instructed, was
                    then in high reputation, under the reverend Mr Holyock, to whose care most of
                    the neighbouring families, even of the highest rank, intrusted their sons. He
                    had judgment to discover, and for some time generosity to encourage, the talents
                    of young Cave; and was so well pleased with his quick progress in the school,
                    that he declared his resolution to breed him for the university, and recommend
                    him as a servitor to some of his scholars of high rank. But prosperity which
                    depends upon the caprice of others, is of short duration. Cave’s superiority in
                    literature exalted him to an invidious familiarity with boys who were far above
                    him in rank and expectations; and, as always happens in unequal associations,
                    whatever unlucky prank was played was imputed to Cave. When any mischief, great
                    or small, was done, though perhaps others boasted of the stratagem when it was
                    successful, yet upon detection or miscarriage, the blame was certain to fall
                    upon poor Cave. The harsh treatment he experienced on this account, although he
                    bore it fora time <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> forced him at last to leave the
                    school and abandon the hope of a literary education, in order to seek some other
                    means of gaining a livelihood.</p>
                <p part="N">He was first placed under a collector of the excise; but the insolence
                    of his mistress, who employed him in servile drudgery, quickly disgusted him,
                    and he went up to London in quest of more suitable employment. He was
                    recommended to a timber merchant at the Bankside, and, while he was there on
                    trial, is said to have given promise of great mercantile abilities; but this
                    place he soon quitted and was bound apprentice to Mr Collins, a printer of some
                    reputation, and deputy-alderman. This was a trade for which men were formerly
                    qualified by a literary education, and which was pleasing to Cave, because it
                    furnished some employment for his scholastic attainments. Here, therefore, he
                    resolved to settle, though his master and mistress lived in perpetual discord,
                    and their house was therefore no comfortable habitation. From the inconveniences
                    of these domestic tumults he was soon released, having in two years attained so
                    much skill in his art, and gained so much the confidence of his master, that he
                    was sent without any superintendent to conduct a printing-house at Norwich, and
                    publish a weekly paper. In this undertaking he met with some opposition, which
                    produced a public controversy, and procured young Cave the reputation of a
                    writer.</p>
                <p part="N">His master died before his apprenticeship had expired, and he was not
                    able to bear the perverseness of his mistress; he therefore quitted her house
                    upon a stipulated allowance, and married a young widow, with whom he had lived
                    at Bow. When his apprenticeship terminated he worked as a journeyman at the
                    printing-house of Mr Barbar, a man much distinguished and employed by the
                    Tories, whose principles had at that time so much influence with Cave, that he
                    was for some years a writer in Mist’s Journal. He afterwards obtained by his
                    wife’s interest a small place in the post-office; but he still continued, during
                    the intervals of attendance, to exercise his trade, or to employ himself in some
                    typographical business. He corrected the <hi rend="italic">Gradus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Parnassum,</hi> and was liberally
                    rewarded by the Company of Stationers. He wrote an Account of the Criminals,
                    which had for some time a considerable sale; and published many little pamphlets
                    which accident brought into his hands, of which it would be difficult to recover
                    the titles. By the correspondence which his place in the post-office
                    facilitated, he procured country newspapers, and sold their intelligence to a
                    journalist in London for a guinea a week. He was afterwards raised to the office
                    of clerk of the franks, in which he acted with great spirit and firmness, and
                    often stopped franks which had been given by members of parliament to their
                    friends, because he thought such extension of a peculiar right illegal. This
                    raised many complaints; and the influence which was exerted against him procured
                    his ejectment from office. He had now, however, collected a sum sufficient for
                    the purchase of a small printing-office, and began the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gentleman</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">Magazine</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> an undertaking to which lie owed the affluence in which
                    he passed the last twenty years of his life, and the large fortune which he left
                    behind him. When he formed the project he was far from expecting the success
                    which he met with; and others had so little prospect of such a result, that
                    though he had for several years talked of his plan among printers and
                    booksellers, none of them thought it worth the trial. That they were not, says
                    Dr Johnson, restrained by their virtue from the execution of another man’s
                    design, was sufficiently apparent as soon as that design began to be gainful;
                    for in a few years a multitude of magazines arose and perished; and the London
                    Magazine, supported by a powerful association of booksellers, and circulated
                    with all the art and all the cunning of trade, alone exempted itself from the
                    general fate of Cave’s invaders, and obtained a considerable, though by no means
                    an equal sale.</p>
                <p part="N">Cave now began to aspire to popularity; and being a great lover of
                    poetry, he sometimes proposed subjects for poems, and offered prizes for the
                    best productions which might be thus elicited. The first prize was fifty pounds,
                    for which, being but newly acquainted with wealth, and thinking the influence of
                    fifty pounds extremely great, he expected the first authors of the kingdom to
                    appear as competitors, and accordingly offered the allotment of the prize to the
                    universities. But when the time of decision arrived, no name appeared in the
                    list of writers that had ever been seen before; while the universities and
                    several private individuals declined the task of awarding the prize. The
                    determination was then left to Dr Cromwell Mortimer and Dr Birch; and by the
                    latter the award was made, which may be seen in <hi rend="italic">Gent.
                        Mag.</hi> vol. vi. p. 59.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Cave continued to improve his magazine, and had the satisfaction of
                    seeing its success proportionate to his diligence, till 1751, when his wife died
                    of an asthma. He seemed at first not much affected by her death; but in a few
                    days he became feverish, and lost his appetite, which he never afterwards
                    recovered. After having lingered for about two years, experiencing many
                    vicissitudes of amendment and relapse, he was seized with a diarrhoea by
                    drinking acid liquors; and afterwards falling into a kind of lethargic
                    insensibility, he died on the 10th of January 1754, having just concluded the
                    twenty-third annual collection of his magazine.</p>
