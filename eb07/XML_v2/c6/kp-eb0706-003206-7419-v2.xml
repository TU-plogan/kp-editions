                <p part="N"><label type="entry">CAMBRIDGE</label>, the capital of the English county
                    of the same name, stands on the river Cam, which is navigable to the Ouse, and
                    communicates with the sea through the port of Lynn. It is situated on an
                    extensive and not very fertile plain, and is considered a very salubrious
                    situation. Neither the streets nor private buildings have any thing remarkable,
                    but the general appearance of the town has been much improved by the recent
                    additions and embellishments which the colleges have received. The town is
                    governed by a mayor, thirteen aldermen, and twenty-four common-council men. The
                    chief object of attention is its university, which is a corporation of itself,
                    and returns in that capacity two members to the House of Commons, who are chosen
                    by such students as have taken the degree of master of arts, and from whom no
                    landed qualification is required on taking their seat in that assembly. The
                    public library, the senate-house, the printing press, the observatory, and some
                    other establishments, belong to this corporation; and it also possesses power to
                    adopt rules and make regulations for the government of the whole body, as well
                    as to choose the several professors.</p>
                <p part="N">Each college is also a separate corporate body, holding the buildings
                    and libraries, and possessing large funds in money, in land, in houses, and in
                    advowsons, by which the expenses of the several establishments are defrayed, and
                    stipends allowed to the holders of fellowships. The constitutions of these
                    colleges are various, as well as the amount of their property, and the mode in
                    which the scholars, fellows, and masters are appointed and remunerated. Our
                    limits do not admit our describing the wealth,« the inducements to study, or the
                    mode of examination practised in the several colleges; but we may enumerate the
                    names of each of them, and the number of scholarships, fellowships, and
                    advowsons. Is/, St Peter’s was founded in 1257, contains a master, tutors, and
                    bursars, like the others, to be noticed in succession, with fourteen
                    fellowships, forty-eight scholarships, and eleven advowsons. 2√, Clare Hall was
                    founded in 1326; it has ten senior and seven junior fellowships, thirty-eight

                    separate chapel, library, and hall, with apartments for the members of the
                    college. They have also college tutors to superintend the morals and tuition of
                    the students, and to maintain the due discipline. There are in all of them
                    private tutors, of which benefit the more aspiring pupils commonly avail
                    themselves. In each house there are prizes distributed corresponding to the rank
                    which the students attain at the examinations.</p>
                <p part="N">As the increase of the value of land has augmented the funds of these
                    colleges, though some of the result of their economy has been applied to
                    the‘purchase of advowsons, other parts have been liberally made use of to
                    enlarge the accommodation for the pupils, or to beautify and adorn the edifices.
                    This has recently been the case in several of the corporations, to the great
                    improvement of the town. There has been a gradual increase in the number of
                    students, who in a few years have risen from 1500 to upwards of 3000; many of
                    whom are now under the necessity of procuring lodging in the town, though they
                    attend at meals and at daily worship in the colleges to which they belong. It is
                    impossible to reduce into a narrow compass the list of interesting objects in
                    this university; but Trinity College, King’s with its wonderful chapel, the
                    senate house, and the new part of St John’s, are all objects exciting great
                    admiration. The number of eminent men produced from this university may be
                    deemed the most convincing proof of the value of the system of education that

                    amounted in 1811 to 11,108, in 1821 to 14,142, and in 1831 to 20,917, including
