                    be intentionally made, in order to the reducing of it to the proper form and
                    shape.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> requisite acquired by the calendering
                    of cloth, is the compression of the yarn or threads of which the texture is
                    composed, which in some degree divests them of their cylindrical shape, and
                    reduces them to a degree of flatness, which, by bringing them more closely into
                    contact with each other, gives to the fabric a greater appearance of closeness
                    and strength than it would otherwise possess. The operation of the calender also
                    improves the superficial appearance, by flattening down all knots, lumps, and
                    other imperfections, from which no material from which cloth is fabricated can
                    ever be entirely freed during the previous processes of spinning and
                    weaving.</p>
                <p part="N">And, <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> in many fabrics it is desirable,
                    and esteemed a great addition to the effect and beauty of the superficial
                    appearance, that cloth should receive, by means of friction, an additional
                    lustre or polish, which is generally distinguished by the appellation of
                    glazing, and is chiefly required in those stuffs which are employed in the
                    ornamental descriptions of female attire.</p>
                <p part="N">Such, in a strictly limited sense, are the sole and exclusive effects
                    resulting from the mechanical operation of the calender; but, as other
                    operations besides smoothing or glazing are necessary for the proper preparation
                    of cloths for the market, these also are carried on by the same persons, and in
                    the same premises. Hence by a natural, although not strictly correct, extension
                    of its acceptation, the term calender, which really means only the chief
                    mechanical engine employed, gives the general name to the whole establishment
                    where all the varied operations of cloth-lapping are carried on; and it is as
                    usual to say that goods are <hi rend="italic">packed,</hi> as that goods are <hi
                        rend="italic">dressed,</hi> at a calender. In the illustration, therefore,
                    of those operations which the limits of this article will admit, the first
                    object will be to convey a distinct idea of the principles, construction, and
                    operation of the principal machinery employed; and then to add such general and
                    miscellaneous observations as may serve to elucidate how the business of
                    cloth-lapping is carried on in its present extended form.</p>
                <p part="N">For the purpose of smoothing both surfaces of a piece <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193347237?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7237-0018"/>of cloth,
                    it is necessary that they should be exposed to ’ universal contact and pressure
                    in every point, with some body of sufficient density to acquire the requisite
                    degree of superficial polish. Such equality of surface, however, as will produce
                    this effect, is not very easily attainable in large plane surfaces. Hence the
                    contact of cylinders in this operation has been found to be in all respects
                    infinitely preferable to that of planes, both in the speed and the effect of the
                    operation. The common domestic smoothing iron is the most simple of all
                    calendering utensils; but, even in the application of its small and limited
                    surface, it would be difficult to procure any table or board sufficiently level
                    to bring the whole cloth into equal contact with the iron, without the
                    intervention of a few folds of blanket, or some other thick and soft woollen
                    cloth.</p>
                <p part="N">The old and now almost entirely superseded machine termed a <hi
                        rend="italic">mangle</hi> gives the most simple and rude approximation
                    towards cylindrical calendering, and the substitution of circular for plane
                    surfaces. Its operation is that of a cylinder applied to a plane, upon which it
                    is rolled backward and forward, until some degree of smoothness is produced by
                    this reciprocating motion. It is, therefore, very analogous in principle to the
                    common gardener’s roller, with which land is resmoothed after having been dug up
                    for sowing or other agricultural purposes.</p>
                <p part="N">The smoothing calender completes the substitution of cylindrical for
                    plane surfaces, all the parts which operate upon the cloth being of that form.
                    This ingenious engine, which was introduced into Britain from Flanders and
                    Holland, during the persecution of the Huguenots, has, since its introduction
                    and adoption here, undergone no very material or important alteration or
                    improvement in point of theoretical principle; nor, until the extension of the
                    cotton manufacture had introduced a general spirit of mechanical improvement,
                    had it received any great amelioration in practical execution. Two very
                    important improvements have, however, since that period been introduced and
                    adopted. The first of these, which originated in Lancashire, is now almost
                    universally employed. The second was invented at Glasgow.</p>
                <p part="N">The scope of the former of these improvements consists in the
                    substitution of pasteboard in the place of wood, in constructing three out of
                    the five cylinders of which the engine is composed. These cylinders, when
                    previously composed of wood, were found to be liable to two serious and
                    important objections. Calenders employed in general business are necessarily
                    subjected to frequent alternations and vicissitudes of heat and cold. These are
                    entirely unavoidable, because, in smoothing or dressing cloths of the denser
                    fabrics, the effect, as in the common operation of ironing linens, is found to
                    be greatly heightened by the application of as great a degree of heat as can
                    safely be communicated without danger to the fabrics which are to be
                    smoothed.</p>
                <p part="N">The expansion of every thread which composes a given extent of cloth,
                    although individually indistinguishable, even with microscopic aid, produces
                    very considerable general effect, when exerted upon eight or ten thousand of
                    these minute cylindrical substances, all combined together in the space of one
                    single square yard. In this expanded state, the pressure of the calender divests
                    them more easily of their cylindrical form, and flattens them down until they
                    come more closely into contact than before. This effect, which is in exact
                    unison with the general theories of expansion and contraction, will at once
                    produce an apparent increase of closeness and density to the texture, as well as
                    of gloss to the surfaces; although the former is in fact deceptive, as no <hi
                        rend="italic">real</hi> acquisition of strength to the fabric can thus be
                    obtained. The apparent density of fabric, as well as a higher accession of
                    gloss, is also frequently obtained by impregnating and stiffening the cloth,
                    after ' it has been bleached, with a mucilage of starch; and this is ’ too
                    frequently carried to a very unfair height, for the purposes of deception, which
                    is not very easily detected, until the cloth be again exposed to moisture, when
                    the delusive appearance instantly vanishes. Hence, in all dense fabrics, the
                    calender is generally used in a heated state; whilst in flimsy fabrics, in which
                    transparency of appearance is more the requisite than strength, the operation is
                    conducted with the calender perfectly cold.</p>
                <p part="N">The effect of these frequent and sudden transitions upon wooden
                    cylinders was necessarily productive both of <hi rend="italic">fissure</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">warping</hi> or <hi rend="italic">twisting</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and no care in drying or seasoning the wood before
                    turning could entirely remove these defects. The substitution of pasteboard,
                    however, afforded a radical cure for both, as well as a collateral advantage
                    arising from its being susceptible of a much higher degree of superficial
                    polish, which is always transferred to the cloth.</p>
                <p part="N">The paper or pasteboard cylinder, besides total exemption from all
                    defects incidental to ligneous substances, from the immense density of which it
                    is susceptible by compression, presents a superficies capable of receiving and
                    retaining an almost unparalleled smoothness and polish.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to construct cylinders of this description, an axis of
                    malleable iron, and two circular plates of cast iron, are, in the first place,
                    provided. In these plates, which must be at least from one to two inches thick,
                    there are six equidistant perforations near to the circumference, each capable
                    of admitting a rod of malleable iron at least three fourths of an inch in
                    diameter. The entire space between the two iron plates is then to be filled with
                    circular pieces of the strongest pasteboard, exceeding by about one inch in
                    diameter the iron plates, and having each a correspondent perforation, through
                    which the six iron rods may pass parallel to the axis. A cylinder is thus
                    formed, the substance of which is of pasteboard locked together by plates of
                    iron at the extremities, and susceptible, by means of screws on the extremities
                    of the six connecting rods, of immense compression. After undergoing this
                    preparation, the cylinder is exposed to strong beat in a confined apartment;
                    and, as the pasteboard daily contracts, the screws are every day tightened for
                    the space of some weeks. The density of the cylinder is thus increased, whilst
                    it is contracted in length upon the axis, for which contraction adequate
                    allowance must be made in its original measure, and the operation is continued
                    until it has gradually acquired the requisite compression. It is then re-exposed
                    to the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere, and by its re-expansion presents
                    a body almost inconceivably compact, its specific gravity in this state being
                    greater than even that of silver. The only operation now required is that of
                    turning its superficies until correctly cylindrical; and this is a work of
                    immense labour and patience.</p>
                <p part="N">The rotatory motion in turning does not exceed forty or fifty
                    revolutions per minute; and the turner requires two or three assistants
                    constantly employed in sharpening his tools. When properly finished and
                    smoothed, a pasteboard cylinder, however, amply compensates, by its strength,
                    its gloss, and its durability, for the great labour and expense which its
                    construction has created.</p>
                <p part="N">A second practical improvement in calenders of the common description
                    consists in the substitution of cast iron for wood in the construction of the
                    connecting frames. This improvement is now common to almost every description of
                    machinery; and when applied to the calender, it is of more than usual advantage,
                    because, independently of the accession* of strength and diminution of space
                    occupied, the total exemption of iron from warping is of <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193347250?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7250-0019"/>peculiar
                    advantage in an engine so rapidly exposed to alteration of temperature as the
                    calender must be. The entire exemption of iron framing from combustion forms
                    also another advantage of some importance in an engine frequently heated by the
                    application of red-hot cylinders of iron. With this cursory outline of general
                    improvement, the next object of the present article is to afford a description
                    of the new glazing calender.</p>
                <p part="N">Previously to the introduction of this improvement, the operation of
                    glazing, although performed sufficiently well, was somewhat tedious, being
                    effected almost exclusively by the mere application of manual labour. It was
                    performed upon a table, the cover of which was oblique to the horizon, forming
                    with it an angle of 15° or 20°. The cloth being stretched on this, and a
                    quantity of wax being thinly spread on its surface, the glazing was effected by
                    the reciprocation of a smoothed flint, vibrating at the end of a rod, somewhat
                    similar to the oscillations of a pendulum. The centre of oscillation was also
                    movable on a spring, in order to reduce the arc of vibration to a plane, and
                    keep the flint in uniform contact with the cloth. But a man’s power was
                    competent to glaze only a few inches in breadth at once, and it was only by
                    successive shiftings that the whole breadth was successively brought under the
                    friction of the flint. The glazing calender produces the same effect, with
                    increased uniformity, simply by changing the relative velocities of the
                    cylinders to each other, and generating friction, as well as pressure, at the
                    points of contact. The process of flint glazing is still practised in
                    Manchester, but on a large scale, the operation being carried on by means of
                    steam power.</p>
                <p part="N">The following is a description of the new glazing calender. Fig. 1,
                    Plate CXLIII. is en elevation of a five-rollered calender for finishing cloth.
                    AA are two paper rollers, of twenty inches diameter each. BB are two cast-iron
                    cylinders, externally turned until perfectly smooth; their diameter is eight
                    inches, allowing the substance of iron to be two inches, and leaving a
                    perforation of four inches diameter. C is a paper roller of fourteen inches
                    diameter; DD is the framing of cast iron for containing the bushes in which the
                    journals of the rollers revolve; EE are two levers by which the rollers are
                    firmly pressed together while the cloth is passing through.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 2 is an end view of the same calender, with the wheels for glazing
                    cloth. The wheel on the upper cylinder is ten inches diameter, the wheel on the
                    under cylinder is thirteen inches diameter, both connected by the wheel F, which
                    communicates the speed of the upper cylinder, so that the wheel on the under
                    cylinder being nearly one third of an inch more in diameter, the difference of
                    their motions retards the centre paper roller, by which means the upper cylinder
                    passes over the cloth one third faster than the cloth passes through the
                    calender, and polishes it in consequence.</p>

                    eight inches diameter, working in the cylinder B, and kept water-tight by
                    passing through a collar of leather; D, a cast-iron plate raised by the piston
                    A, between which and the entablature EE the goods to be pressed arc laid; CCCC,
                    four malleable iron columns, 2f th inches diameter, having screwed ends, with

                    keeping the rod parallel.</p>
                <p part="N">For dressing muslins, gauzes, lawns, and other goods of the light and
                    transparent fabrics, a smaller species of calender is employed. It consists of
                    only three cylinders of equal diameters (generally about six inches), and is
                    easily moved by a common winch or handle. The middle cylinder is iron, and the
                    others are wood or pasteboard. They are of equal diameters, and are moved with
                    equal velocities by small wheels. This machine is always used in a cold
                    state.</p>
                <p part="N">The folding of cloth is so entirely regulated by fashion, that no
                    precise rules can be laid down for its regulation. In general, as all the
                    different manufactures of cloth have been imported from other countries, the
                    original foldings have been copied to complete the resemblance. In the infant
                    state of.imitation there was probably some policy in this, but the continuance
                    may be ascribed almost exclusively to the power of habit. Preservation and
                    portability are the main requisites to be attained by folding; and these are
                    attained by subjecting the cloth, when folded, to a very powerful
                    compression.</p>
                <p part="N">Water-presses upon the forcing principle of Mr Bramah, or acted upon by
                    the pressure of a column of water, arc now in general use in Glasgow and
                    Manchester. Besides the immense power thereby procured, the labour of pressing
                    is much lessened. No improvements that have taken place in calendering can
                    exceed the power and facility of the water-press; one of these presses is
                    generally wrought by two men, who can with great ease work the press so as to
                    produce a pressure of four hundred tons; and thereby the appearance and finish
                    of the goods, in consequence of such an immense weight acting on them, are
                    materially improved. Not only this, but the Bramah press is also used for the
                    purpose of packing, which has increased the method of packing in bales
                    considerably. The bale is commonly packed, roped, &amp;c. while in a compressed
                    state; the dimensions are therefore greatly diminished from what they would
                    otherwise be by any other method; for instance, the same quantity of goods
                    packed in a bale would be one third less in size than if they were packed in a
                    box.</p>
                <p part="N">To the mechanical art of calendering it is found expedient, in the
                    extended states of commerce, to add many of the operations of packing, sheeting,
                    and preparing goods for shipment; and these generally form a branch of the
                    establishment. In order to suit the great extent and va·« ricty of manufacture
                    practised in Britain, and to adapt these to the prevalent tastes and views of
                    the extensive range of consumers to be supplied, a multiplicity of foldings or
                    lappings has been necessarily adopted, few of which probably possess much claim
                    to entire originality. The high, and perhaps pre-eminent, station which the
                    productions of the British looms have gradually attained, seem to be rather the
                    effect of assiduous and enterprising industry, than of great originality of
                    invention, or precedence in mechanical improvement. Certainly she can, at the
                    utmost, boast of only one <hi rend="italic">raιv material,</hi> from which cloth
                    is manufactured, as peculiarly indigenous.</p>
                <p part="N">At an early period, no doubt, the British wool had attracted the
                    peculiar attention of economistsand statesmen as of paramount value; and the
                    prohibition of its exportation became an object of legislative enactment. That
                    manufacture, therefore, has long been the staple of England, as the linen trade,
                    at a later period, has become that of Ireland.</p>
                <p part="N">The attempts to introduce both of these branches of industry into
                    Scotland, although, during the latter part of <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193347263?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7263-0020"/>the last
                    century, they engrossed much of the attention both of public bodies and of
                    patriotic individuals, cannot be regarded as having proved eminently successful;
                    and the progress actually made has been almost entirely superseded and
                    extinguished by the more recent introduction of the cotton manufacture.</p>
                <p part="N">The latter branch of industry, since the splendid invention of spinning
                    by the aid of machinery, has indeed made most rapid advances in every part of
                    the united kingdom, and has attained to a height which has, perhaps, absorbed a
                    greater portion of national industry than consumers can easily be found to
                    employ. The extension of external commerce has constantly supplied the raw
                    material at easy and generally moderate rates; and even the India Company have
                    long ceased to oppose to it any very formidable competition in the market.</p>
                <p part="N">The silk manufactures of Britain formerly were not carried on to a very
                    great extent; they have now, however, increased considerably. Whatever may have,
                    directly or indirectly, tended to regulate the finishing, folding, and preparing
                    of British goods for the various markets of consumption, will chiefly refer to
                    the three former branches of manufacture.</p>
                <p part="N">Extensively as the woollen trade is carried on, it is in a great measure
                    absorbed either by internal or colonial consumption, and docs not, therefore,
                    enter so generally into actual competition with the cloths of other nations, as
                    to render it either peculiarly desirable that its marketable aspect should be
                    either servilely copied from those of other countries, or very peculiarly
                    distinguished from them. The chief object appears to have generally been, to
                    prevent the intrusion of foreign cloths and stuffs into our own markets; and
                    hence adopting their usual folds into such rolls as most effectually preserve
                    the dressed surface from acute cresses, is found to be most expedient and
                    convenient, the goods being distinguished by letters denoting them to be
                    “British manufacture” on the ends of the pieces.</p>
                <p part="N">In the Irish manufactures of cambrics and linens, the case is almost
                    entirely reversed. From the superiority of climate, the French flax is admitted
                    to be of finer appearance; and although the importation of manufactured cambrics
                    be strictly prohibited, the restraint during periods of peace has always been
                    considerably evaded, in consequence of the demand experienced, and the
                    reputation in which they are held. Indeed it was found generally most expedient,
                    by many retailers, to sell Irish cambrics under the title of French, and hence
                    the fold was correctly imitated. The pieces, after being folded into lengths of
                    about twelve inches, and twice laterally doubled, until the whole breadth of
                    thirty-four inches was reduced to about eight and a half inches, were subjected
                    to a powerful compression in the press until fully flattened. They were then
                    packed in purple coloured wrappers or papers, and a small engraved card or
                    ticket was attached to each piece, specifying the length, generally about eight
                    or eight and a half yards. The cards were attached by a silken string, so as to
                    be easily cut away with a penknife or pair of scissors, in order to avoid
                    seizure; and French or Irish goods were sold indiscriminately as “foreign
                    cambrics.” Custom has even carried this practice farther; and cotton cambrics,
                    which are avowedly <hi rend="italic">British manufacture,</hi> and subjected to
                    no risk whatever, because easily distinguishable from any cambric manufactured
                    from flax, are put up into the same folds, papered, and ticketed, in exactly the
                    same manner.</p>
                <p part="N">In linens, hollands, and sheetings, whether of foreign or Irish
                    manufacture, the same fold is also employed; and in cotton shirtings and
                    sheetings it is closely imitated. The form iş that of a cylindric roll, somewhat
                    flattened by subsequent compression; and, in general, all dense fabrics, whether
                    of linen or of cotton, are rolled up and compressed in a similar manner, the
                    object of which is evidently safety and diminution of space in land carriage or
                    exportation.</p>
                <p part="N">In others of the extensive varieties of cotton cloths of British
                    manufacture, some are avowed imitations of the manufactures of Hindustan, whilst
                    others profess no such imitation. Very few among the manufactures of Lancashire
                    are either distinguished by Indian names, or copied from Indian cloths, although
                    some of great extent are directly so. Calicoes, cossacs, and jaconets, for
                    printing, as well as Ballusore, Bandana, and Pullicate handkerchiefs, are
                    amongst the leading articles of the latter description; whilst among the former
                    may be classed the very extensive manufactures of corduroys, thicksetts,
                    velverctts, velveteens, &amp;c. although their origin is also probably Asiatic,
                    but because well known and manufactured by the Genoese, French, and other
                    European nations, even before the discoveries of De Gama and other mariners had
                    first laid open the maritime intercourse with India by the Cape of Good
                    Hope.</p>
                <p part="N">When, at a period infinitely more recent; the splendid invention of
                    spinning cotton by the agency of machinery to any degree of fineness afforded
                    new scope to the British weaver, the imitation of the lighter Indian fabrics
                    fell chiefly into the hands of the Scottish weavers, for executing which they
                    had been in a considerable degree previously prepared, by their habits of
                    weaving lawns in imitation of the French, as well as their lighter fabrics of
                    silk and thread gauzes. To their share, in consequence, fell the bouks, mulls,
                    and japuns, almost exclusively, as well as the lighter jaconets, designed for
                    ornament from the needle and tambour frame. And whilst they have made no
                    successful attempt to compete with their Lancashire brethren in the dense
                    fabrics of corduroys, quiltings, and other ponderous articles, they have shared
                    with them the manufacture of the middling textures of cambrics, Pullicates, and
                    ginghams.</p>
                <p part="N">Indeed, whatever prepossession may, at an early period, have existed in
                    favour of the real Indian fabrics, it has now so. entirely subsided as to
                    possess no influence whatever in swaying general opinion. The British
                    workmanship has proved itself long ago so decisively superior to the Indian,
                    both in spinning· and weaving, as to eradicate every doubt in the minds of all
                    who are really competent to decide the question of comparative superiority.
                    Still, however, candour will compel us to allow that the Indian possesses
                    advantages in the rich qualities of his cotton, and the brilliancy of some of
                    his dyes, which, in some degree, compensate for the immense superiority of the
                    British skill and machinery, and which, to those who examine superficially, may
                    appear to entitle him to the preference.</p>
                <p part="N">Nothing, therefore, exists in the cotton manufacture which could, in
                    general cases, prompt to a servile imitation of external appearance for the
                    purposes of deception; and the Indian mode of lapping their cloth is too rude
                    and laborious to admit of its being copied as a matter of convenience. Their
                    method consists merely in doubling a piece of twenty yards, to reduce its length
                    to ten yards, which is again doubled, in order to reduce it to five; and thus
                    they continue to redouble, until the piece be reduced to a moderate length,
                    capable of being contained in a chest or bale. Thus often redoubled, an Indian
                    piece cannot be examined throughout unless the whole piece be again unfolded;
                    and this, in large transactions, would be utterly impracticable.</p>
                <p part="N">British muslins are folded generally to a yard in length, with a small
                    allowance for extra measure; and as the folding is alternately from right to
                    left, every part can be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347276?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0706-7276-0021"/>instantly examined upon a table or counter,
                    every fold opening as easily as the leaves of a book in its uncut state. The
                    piece, when folded, is reduced by doubling it longitudinally to about nineteen
                    inches, and it is then folded across to the breadth of about thirteen inches. An
                    ordinary sized trunk, 39 × 19 inches, thus contains three layers of pieces, in
                    which package goods for exportation to the colonies are generally packed, the
                    trunk there forming an article of merchandise as much in general demand as the
                    muslins which it contains.</p>
                <p part="N">Even the Indian ornaments of gilt silver threads which were at first
                    woven into one end of each piece, although they did not exceed the value of
                    twopence each, have been either greatly curtailed, or totally given up upon
                    principles of economy. Even the cost of this trivial ornament has been computed
                    to have amounted annually in Glasgow and Paisley to about L.30,000.</p>
                <p part="N">Pullicate and other handkerchiefs are most commonly folded up in dozens.
                    For the African and some other foreign trades, pieces containing only eight
                    handkerchiefs are preferred. These are still imitations of Indian precedents,
                    confined to markets where competition continues to exist, not only with the
                    British Company, but with Americans and others trading to India. A species of
                    pale orange-coloured India handkerchiefs, distinguished by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Mudxus,</hi> being in extensive reputation in the Caraccas and
                    other Spanish settlements in South America at the period of the capture of
                    Trinidad in 1795, patterns were procured by some British traders, who ordered
                    very large quantities to be manufactured in Scotland of the same quality and
                    appearance. With such effect were these imitated in texture, in dye, in
                    finishing, and even in the packages, that some hundreds of pieces sent to London
                    for exportation were actually seized at the customhouse as India goods, either
                    illegally imported, or stolen from some of the Company’s ships in the river. A
                    scrutiny, however, clearly ascertained that these goods were not Indian, but
                    British, and that no trespass against either the privileges or the property of
                    the Company had been even attempted. The goods were of course released, and
                    permitted to proceed to their destination, where, after examination and trial,
                    it was found totally unnecessary longer to conceal their real origin; and a very
                    extensive trade, through direct channels, has been since carried on for similar
                    goods.</p>
                <p part="N">From the above general and cursory sketch, it will be obvious that the
                    management of an extensive calendering establishment will require, on the part
                    of its conductor, not only a competent knowledge and experience of the
                    mechanical operations and duties of his particular profession, but that a more
                    extensive mercantile acquaintance with the demands, habits, and tastes of
                    particular markets, will conduce equally to his own interests and those of his
                    employers. From the variations of markets, and fluctuations of mercantile
                    transactions, there can be no precise or definite limit to the extent of such
                    knowledge. It is only by constant attention and sedulous inquiry that he can
                    preserve accuracy in what is liable to almost daily change. His immediate
                    employers will no doubt be often both able and desirous to supply him with this.
                    But as even they must sometimes be liable to error or deception, he ought to
                    omit no opportunity of extending his inquiries, and arriving, as nearly as he
                    can, at the most comprehensive and unambiguous information.</p>
