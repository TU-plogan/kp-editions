                <p part="N"><label type="entry">CHRISTIANS</label>, those who profess the religion
                    of Jesus Christ. The name Christians, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles,
                    was first given at Antioch, in the year 42, to those who believed in Jesus
                    Christ. Till that time they were called <hi rend="italic">disciples.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The first Christians distinguished themselves in the most remarkable
                    manner by their conduct and their virtues. The faithful, whom the preaching of
                    St Peter had converted, hearkened attentively to the exhortations of the
                    apostles, who'failed not carefully to instruct them, as persons who were
                    entering upon an entirely new course of life. They went every day to the temple
                    with one heart and one mind, and continued in prayers; doing nothing different
                    from the other Jews, because the time had not yet come to separate from them.
                    But they made a still greater progress in virtue; for they sold all that they
                    possessed, and distributed their goods in proportion to the wants of their
                    brethren. They “ate their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising
                    God, and having favour with all the people.”</p>
                <p part="N">The Jews were the first and the most inveterate enemies of the
                    Christians, whom they put to death as often as they had it in their power; and
                    when they revolted against the Romans in the time of the emperor Adrian,
                    Barcochebas, the head of that revolt, employed against the Christians the most
                    barbarous punishments, in order to compel them to blaspheme and renounce Jesus
                    Christ. We find indeed that, even in the third century, they endeavoured to get
                    into their hands Christian women, in order to scourge and stone them in their
                    synagogues. They cursed the Christians solemnly three times a day in their
                    synagogues, and their rabbin would not suffer them to converse with Christians
                    upon any occasion. Nor were they contented merely to hate and detest them. They
                    dispatched emissaries all over the world in order to defame the Christians, and
                    to spread all sorts of calumnies against them; they accused them of many things
                    absurd or detestable, and, among these, of worshipping the sun and the head of
                    an ass; they reproached them with idleness, and with being a useless
                    unprofitable race; they charged them with treason, and with endeavouring to
                    erect a new monarchy in opposition to that of Rome; they affirmed, that, in
                    celebrating their mysteries, they used to kill a child and eat its flesh; and
                    they accused them of the most shocking incests, and of beastly intemperance in
                    their feasts of charity. But the lives and behaviour of the first Christians
                    were sufficient to refute all that was said against them, and evidently
                    demonstrated that these accusations were mere calumnies and the effect of
                    inveterate malice.</p>
                <p part="N">Pliny the Younger, who was governor of Pontus and Bithynia between the
                    years 103 and 105, gives a particular account of the Christians of that
                    province, in a letter which he wrote to the emperor Trajan, of which the
                    following is an extract t “I take the liberty to give you an account of every
                    difficulty which arises to me. 1 have never been present at the examination of
                    the Christians; for which reason 1 know not what questions have been put to
                    them, nor in what manner they have been punished. My behaviour towards those who
                    have been accused to me has been this. 1 have interrogated them in order to know
                    whether they were really Christians. When they have confessed it, 1 have
                    repeated the same question two or three times, threatening them with death if
                    they did not renounce this religion. Those who have persisted in their
                    confession, have been, by my order, led to punishment. I have even met with some
                    Roman citizens guilty of this phrenzy, whom, in regard to their quality, 1 have
                    set apart from the rest, in order to send them to Rome. These persons declare,
                    that their whole crime, if they are guilty, consists in this, that, on certain
                    days, they assemble before sunrise, to sing alternately the praises of Christ,
                    as of a God, and to oblige themselves, by the performance of their religious
                    rites, not to be guilty of theft or adultery, to observe inviolably their word,
                    and to be true to their trust. This· deposition has obliged me to endeavour to
                        inform<pb break="no" facs="nls:193355193?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0706-5193-0630"/> myself still further of this matter, by
                    putting to the torture two of their women servants, whom they call <hi
                        rend="italic">deaconesses</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but I could learn
                    nothing more from them than that the superstition of these people is as
                    ridiculous as their attachment to it is astonishing.”</p>
                <p part="N">There is still extant a justification, or rather panegyric, of the
                    Christians, pronounced by the mouth of a heathen prince. It is a letter of the
                    emperor Antoninus, written in the year 152, in answer to a charge by the states
                    of Asia, which had accused the Christians of being the cause of some earthquakes
                    which had happened in that part of the world. The emperor advises them to “take
                    care, lest, in torturing and punishing those whom they accused of Atheism
                    (meaning the Christians), they should render them more obstinate, instead of
                    prevailing upon them to change their opinion; since their religion taught them
                    to suffer with pleasure for the sake of God.” As to the earthquakes which had
                    happened, he put them in mind, that “they themselves are always discouraged, and
                    sink under such misfortunes; whereas the Christians never discovered more
                    cheerfulness and confidence in God than upon such occasions.” He tells them,
                    that “they pay no regard to religion, and neglect the worship of the Eternal;
                    and, because the Christians honour and adore Him, therefore they are jealous of
                    them, and persecute them even to death.” He concludes with these words: <hi
                        rend="superscript"> li</hi> Many of the governors of provinces have formerly
                    written to my father concerning them; and his answer always was, that they
                    should not be molested or disturbed, provided they quietly submitted to the
                    authority of the government. Many persons have likewise consulted me upon this
                    affair, and I have returned the same answer to them all; namely, that if any one
                    accuses a Christian merely on account of his religion, the accused person shall
                    be acquitted, and the accuser himself punished.” This ordinance, according to
                    Eusebius, was publicly displayed at Ephesus, in an assembly of the states.</p>
                <p part="N">It is not a difficult matter to discover the causes of the many
                    persecutions to which the Christians were exposed during the first three
                    centuries. The purity of the Christian morality, being in direct contrast with
                    the corruption of the heathens, was doubtless one of the most powerful motives
                    of the public aversion; and to this may be added the many calumnies unjustly
                    spread abroad concerning them by their enemies, particularly the Jews; a
                    circumstance which occasioned so strong a prejudice against them, that the
                    Pagans condemned them without inquiring into their doctrine, or permitting them
                    to defend themselves. Besides, their worshipping Jesus Christ as God was
                    contrary to one of the most ancient laws of the Roman empire, which expressly
                    forbade the acknowledging of any God who had not been approved as such by the
                    senate.</p>
                <p part="N">But notwithstanding the violent opposition made to the establishment of
                    the Christian religion, it gained ground daily, and very soon made a surprising
                    progress in the Roman empire. In the third century, there were Christians in the
                    camp, in the senate, in the palace, in short, everywhere but in the temples and
                    the theatres; they filled the towns, the country, the islands; men and women of
                    all ages and conditions, and even those of the first dignities, embraced the
                    faith; insomuch that the Pagans complained that the revenues of their temples
                    were ruined. They were in so great numbers in the empire, that, as Tertullian
                    expresses it, were they to have retired into another country, they would have
                    left the Romans only a frightful solitude.</p>
