                    Brie, near Meaux, the 25th August 1699, son of Stephen Camus, a surgeon of that
                    town, and Margaret Maillard.</p>
                <p part="N">FI is taste for practical mechanics was very early demonstrated by a
                    singular ingenuity in the construction of a variety of little machines, with
                    which he amused himself; and he soon felt so strongly the value of mathematical
                    studies, that he urged his parents to find the means of sending him to a school
                    where he might apply to them. In compliance with his wishes, he was placed, when
                    he was little more than ten years old, at the College de Navarre in Paris; and
                    in two years he acquired knowledge enough to become an instructor of others, and
                    to relieve his friends from all further expense in his education. He was
                    assisted, in the pursuit of the higher departments of the mathematics, by the
                    celebrated Μ. Varignon; and he particularly applied himself to civil and
                    military architecture, and to astronomy.</p>
                <p part="N">1. The first result of his studies that was destined for the public eye,
                    was an essay <hi rend="italic">On the Masts of Ships,</hi> a subject which had
                    been proposed in 1727 as a prize question by the Academy of Sciences. This essay
                    was received with considerable approbation, and was inserted in the second
                    volume of the <hi rend="italic">Collection of Prize Memoirs.</hi> Shortly after,
                    the author was made an adjunct or sub-associate of the academy, in the
                    department of mechanics.</p>
                <p part="N">2. In 1728 he brought forward a memoir on the <hi rend="italic">Living
                        Force</hi> of bodies in motion, in which he concludes, from considering the
                    actions of springs, and other similar powers, that its true measure is the
                    product of the mass into the square of the velocity, as Leibnitz maintained;
                    this product being also proportional to that of the force into the space through
                    which it acts, while the momentum is proportional to the force and the time
                    conjointly. In December 1730 Μ. Camus was appointed professor of geometry to the
                    Academy of Architecture, and a few years afterwards he became secretary to the
                    same body.</p>
                <p part="N">3. The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Academy</hi> for 1732 contain a
                    short paper on a <hi rend="italic">Problem proposed by Μ. Cramer,</hi>
                    respecting the determination of two curves bearing a particular relation to each
                    other. It was the custom of the age to consider exercises of this sort as trials
                    of strength, to which it was incumbent on all geometricians to submit, for the
                    honour of the countries in which they lived, and of the societies to which they
                    belonged. The author was elevated in 1733 to the rank of an associate of the
                    academy, together with Clairaut, over whom he even obtained some advantage in
                    the ballot.</p>
                <p part="N">4. He communicated to the academy, in the same year, a valuable paper on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Teeth of Wheels.</hi> La Hire had already laid the
                    foundation of the investigation on its true basis, and had pointed out the use
                    of different epicycloidal curves for the forms of the teeth of wheels in
                    different circumstances; and Μ. Camus in this essay enters into some further
                    inquiries, particularly with regard to the best proportions for the length of
                    the teeth, and the comparative diameters of the wheels; a discussion for which
                    his intimate acquaintance with the art of the clock-maker made him particularly
                    well qualified. In 1736 he accompanied Maupertuis and Clairaut in the expedition
                    to Lapland, for the measurement of a degree of the meridian; and he was enabled
                    to render them very essential service, not only as a geometrician and an
                    astronomer, but also by his skill in various departments of the mechanical arts,
                    which became particularly valuable in so remote a situation.</p>
                <p part="N">5. Μ. Camus directed his attention in 1738 to the well known but
                    interesting mechanical phenomenon of a <hi rend="italic">pistol baU piercing an
                        open door</hi> without causing any very sensible motion in the door, and
                    published a paper on the subject in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the
                        Academy.</hi> He justly observes, that the effect of any force depends, not
                    only on its magnitude, but also on the time for which it operates; and that
                    though the impulse of the ball must tend to carry the door before it, with a
                    force paramount to the resistance which it opposes to the ball, yet the time of
                    the action of this force is too short to produce a sensible effect on the whole
                    mass of the door. 6. 7. In 1739 he presented to the academy two hydraulic
                    memoirs, the one on <hi rend="italic">Water</hi><hi rend="italic">Sachets,</hi>
                    the other on <hi rend="italic">Pumps.</hi> In the latter he investigates the
                    diameter of a valve capable of transmitting the greatest quantity of water
                    within a given barrel; a valve which is too large not being at liberty to rise
                    to a sufficient height.</p>
                <p part="N">8. He inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> for 1740 a
                    confutation of a <hi rend="italic">Mechanical Fallacy,</hi> which has misled
                    many of the enthusiasts who have bewildered themselves in the search of a
                    perpetual motion; demonstrating, that when a number of weights are caused to
                    descend, in any imaginable paths, at a greater distance from the centre of a
                    wheel than they ascend, the number of the weights descending at any one time
                    must always be smaller than those of the weights ascending,, and in such a
                    proportion as perfectly to compensate for the mechanical advantage apparently
                    gained by the greater distance. In the following year he was received into the
                    number of the academicians in the department of geometry, on occasion of the
                    resignation of Μ. Fontenelle. 9. He published also, in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Memoirs</hi> for 1741, an account of a <hi rend="italic">Gauging Rule</hi>
                    for measuring barrels of different forms, by simple inspection of the
                    logarithmic scales engraved on it, observing only some easy rules for their
                    adjustment, according to the general nature of the solid. 10. In 1746 he
                    presented a report, in conjunction with Μ. Hellot, on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Length of the Standard Ell,</hi> which was thought worthy of being inserted
                    in the collection of the academy.</p>
                <p part="N">11. We find among the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> for 1747 an essay
                    of Μ. Camus on the <hi rend="italic">Tangents of Curves</hi> having several
                    branches crossing each other, which frequently require for their determination
                    the use of fluxions of the higher orders, the first fluxions of the absciss and
                    ordinate vanishing together. Μ. Saurin had before given a similar solution <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193347705?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7705-0054"
                    />of the problem, but had not attempted to explain the metaphysical ground upon
                    which the apparent paradox is reconciled to the general principles of the
                    differential method.</p>
                <p part="N">12. M. Camus also assisted in several determinations and reports which
                    were referred at various times to committees of the academy; and particularly in
                    the remeasurement of Μ. Picard’s base from Villejuif to Juvisy, which was
                    performed by eight members, and recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>
                    for 1754.</p>
                <p part="N">13. The latter years of his life were much occupied in various
                    engagements connected with the offices of examiner in the schools of the Royal
                    Engineers and in that of the Artillery, to which he was nominated by the king.
                    He undertook, for the advantage of the students in these schools, the laborious
                    task of reducing into a uniform system a complete course of mathematical study,
                    in which the geometrical method was as much as possible observed, and which is
                    considered as highly creditable to his talents and exertions; it was entitled

                    vols. 8vo. 14. He also published an <hi rend="italic">Elementary work on
                        Arithmetic.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In person M. Camus was tall; his countenance was agreeable; his manners
                    were firm, and occasionally somewhat warm; but lie was far from being either
                    morose or vindictive. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of
                    London in January 1764. He married, in 1733, Mademoiselle Μ. A. Μ. Fourrier, and
                    had four daughters, the eldest of whom was married to Μ. Pagin; the others died
                    young. His last illness was supposed to have originated from a cold, taken in a
                    professional journey during the hard winter of 1766, and to have been aggravated
                    by affliction for the loss of his surviving daughter. He died a few months after
                    her, on the 4th of May 1768. He left a variety of manuscripts, demonstrative of
                    his habitual diligence, and of the extent of his researches; but not deemed of
                    sufficient importance to meet the hazards of posthumous publication. <hi

                    amount of about two hundred volumes. His definition of politics is remarkable.

                    possessed a remarkable memory. He was also distinguished for his zeal, and the
                    fervour with which he attacked the abuses of his time. He died in 1652.</p>
