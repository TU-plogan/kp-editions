                    valleys where the cold is not severe, fruit is plentiful. Considerable numbers
                    of Peruvian sheep are fed here, and their wool forms the principal article of
                    traffic. The population amounts to about 7000. The capital of the province,
                    which bears the same name, is an insignificant town, situated on a lofty
                    mountain, and subjected to intense cold.</p>
