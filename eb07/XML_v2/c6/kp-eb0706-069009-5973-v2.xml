                        Tullius</hi></label>, the celebrated Roman orator, was born in the year of
                    Rome 647, or about 105 years before Christ. His father Marcus Tullius, who was
                    of the equestrian order, took great care of his education, which was directed
                    particularly with a view to the bar. On his first appearance in public, young
                    Tully declaimed with such vehemence against Sylla’s party, that it became
                    expedient for him to retire into Greece, where he attended the Athenian orators
                    and philosophers, and greatly improved both in eloquence and knowledge. Here he
                    met with his school-fellow Titus Pomponius, who, from his love of Athens, and
                    having spent a great part of his days in that city, obtained the surname of <hi
                        rend="italic">Atticus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and here they revived and
                    confirmed that noted friendship which subsisted between them through life with
                    unshaken constancy and affection. From Athens Tully passed into Asia, and after
                    an excursion of two years returned to Italy much improved by his travels.</p>
                <p part="N">Cicero had now established himself at Rome, where, after one year more
                    spent at the bar, he obtained the dignity of questor. Among the causes which hè
                    pleaded before his questorshiρ, was that of the famous comedian Roscius, whom
                    singular excellence in his art had recommended to the familiarity and friendship
                    of the greatest men in Rome. The questors were the general receivers or
                    treasurers of the republic,-and were sent annually into the provinces assigned
                    them by lot. The island of Sicily happened to fall to Cicero's share, including
                    that part of it,—for it was considerable enough to be divided into two
                    provinces,— which was called Lilybaeum. The office of questor he received, not
                    as a gift, but as a trust; and he acquitted himself<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193355986?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5986-0691"/> so well in
                    discharge of it, that he gained the love and admiration of all the Sicilians.
                    Before he left Sicily, he made the tour of the island, in order to visit every
                    thing curious, especially the city of Syracuse, at which place he pointed out
                    the tomb of Archimedes to the magistrates, who were showing him the curiosities
                    of the place; but, to his surprise, he found that they knew nothing either of
                    the tomb or of him whose ashes it contained.</p>
                <p part="N">We have no account of the precise time of Cicero’s marriage with
                    Terentia; but it is supposed to have been celebrated immediately after his
                    return from his travels to Italy, when he was about thirty. Being now disengaged
                    from his questorship in Sicily, by which first step in the legal gradation and
                    ascent of public honours he had gained an immediate right to the senate, and an
                    actual admission into it during life, he again settled in Rome, where he
                    employed himself constantly in defending the persons and properties of its
                    citizens, and indeed became a general patron of causes. Five years had scarcely
                    elapsed since Cicero’s election to the questorship (this being the proper
                    interval prescribed by law before he could hold the next office), when he was,
                    in his thirty-seventh year, elected aedile by the unanimous suffrages of the
                    tribes, and in preference to all his competitors. After Cicero’s election to the
                    aedileship, but before his entrance upon office, he undertook the famous
                    prosecution of Verres, the late praetor of Sicily, who was charged with many
                    flagrant acts of injustice, rapine, and cruelty, during his triennial government
                    of that island. This was one of the most memorable transactions of his life, one
                    for which he was greatly and justly celebrated by antiquity, and for which he
                    will, in all ages, be admired and esteemed by the friends of mankind. The result
                    was, that, by his diligence and address, he so confounded Hortensius, though the
                    reigning orator at the bar, and usually styled the king of the forum, that his
                    majesty had nothing to say for his client. Verres, despairing of all defence,
                    submitted immediately, without waiting the sentence, to a voluntary exile, in
                    which condition he lived many years, forgotten and deserted by all his friends.
                    He is said to have been relieved in this miserable situation by the generosity
                    of Cicero; but at length he was proscribed and murdered by Mark Antony, for the
                    sake of those fine statues and Corinthian vessels of which he had plundered the
                    Sicilians.</p>
                <p part="N">After the usual interval of two years from the time of his being chosen
                    aedile, Cicero offered himself as a candidate for the praetorship; and, in three
                    different assemblies convened for the choice of praetors, two of which were
                    dissolved without effect, he was every time declared the first praetor by the
                    suffrages of the centuries. He was now in the full career of his fortunes, and
                    in sight, as it were, of the consulship, the grand object of his ambition; and
                    therefore, when his praetorship terminated, he refused to accept any foreign
                    province, the usual reward of that magistracy, and the chief fruit which the
                    generality proposed from it. He had no particular love for money, and no genius
                    for war; so that those governments had no charms for him. The glory which he
                    pursued was to shine in the eyes of the city as the guardian of its laws; to
                    teach the magistrates how to execute, and the citizens how to obey them.</p>
                <p part="N">Being now in his forty-third year, the proper age required by law, he
                    declared himself a candidate for the consulship, along with six competitors, L.
                    Sulpicius Galba, L. Sergius Catilina, C. Antonius, L. Cassius Longinus, Q.
                    Cornificius, and C. Licinius Sacerdos. The first two were patricians; the next
                    two plebeians, yet noble; the last two the sons of fathers who had first
                    imported the public honours into their families; Cicero was the only <hi
                        rend="italic">new man,</hi> as he was called, among them, or person of the
                    equestrian rank. These were the competitors; and in the competition the practice
                    of bribing was carried on openly and shamefully by Antony and Catiline. However,
                    as the election approached, Cicero’s interest appeared to be superior to that of
                    all the candidates; for the nobles themselves, though always envious of and
                    desirous to depress him, yet, considering the dangers which threatened the city
                    from many quarters and seemed ready to burst out into a flame, they began to
                    think him the only man qualified to preserve the republic, and to quash the
                    cabals of the desperate, by the vigour and prudence of his administration. The
                    method of choosing consuls was not by an open vote, but by a kind of ballot, or
                    little tickets of wood distributed to the citizens, with the names of the
                    several candidates inscribed upon each. But in Cicero’s case the people were not
                    content with this secret and silent way. Before they came to any scrutiny, they
                    loudly and universally proclaimed Cicero the first consul; so that, as he
                    himself says, “he was not chosen by the votes of particular citizens, but by the
                    common suffrage of the city; not declared by the voice of the crier, but by that
                    of the whole Roman people.”</p>
                <p part="N">Cicero had no sooner entered upon his office than he had occasion to
                    exert himself against P. Servilius Rullus, one of the new tribunes, who had been
                    alarming the senate with the promulgation of an agrarian law; the purpose of
                    which was to create a decemvirate, or ten commissioners, with absolute power for
                    five years over all the revenues of the republic, to distribute them at pleasure
                    to the citizens, and to exercise other functions equally incompatible with the
                    existence of society. These laws used to be greedily received by the populace,
                    and were therefore proposed by factious magistrates as often as they had any
                    point to carry with the multitude against the public good; so that Cicero’s
                    first business was to quiet the apprehensions of the city, and to baffle, if
                    possible, the intrigues of the tribune. Accordingly, in an artful and elegant
                    speech from the rostra, he gave such a turn to the inclination of the people,
                    that they rejected this law with as much eagerness as they had ever received
                    one. But the affair which constituted the great glory of his consulship, and
                    which has transmitted his name with such lustre to posterity, was the skill he
                    showed, and the unwearied pains he took, in suppressing the conspiracy which had
                    been formed by Catiline and his accomplices for the subversion of the
                    commonwealth. For this great service he was honoured with the glorious title of
                        <hi rend="italic">Pater Patrice,</hi> or Father of his Country, a title
                    which he retained for a long time afterwards.</p>
                <p part="N">Cicero’s administration was now at an end; but he had no sooner quitted
                    his office than he began to feel the effects of that envy which is the certain
                    fruit of illustrious merit. He was now, therefore, the common mark, not only of
                    all the factious, against whom he had declared perpetual war, but of another
                    party not less dangerous, the envious, whose united malice never left him from
                    this moment till they had driven him out of the very city which he had so lately
                    preserved. Cicero, upon the expiration of his consulship, took care to send a
                    particular account of his whole administration to Pompey, then occupied with the
                    Mithridatic war in Asia; in hopes no doubt of preventing any wrong impressions
                    there from the calumnies of his enemies, and of drawing from that commander some
                    public declaration in favour of what had been done. But Pompey being informed by
                    Metellus and Caesar of the ill humour which was rising up against Cicero in
                    Rome, answered him with great coldness, and instead of paying him any
                    compliment, took no notice at all of what had passed in the affair of Catiline;
                    an omission in regard to which Cicero expostulates with him in a letter which is
                    still extant.</p>
                <p part="N">About this time Cicero bought a house of Marcus Crassus, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193355999?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5999-0692"/>on the
                    Palatine Hill, adjoining to that in which he had always lived with his father,
                    and which he is supposed to have given up to his brother Quintius. The house
                    cost him a very large sum, and seems to have been one of the noblest in Rome.
                    The purchase of so expensive a house led to some censure of his vanity,
                    especially as it was effected with borrowed money; a circumstance which he
                    himself does not dissemble, but observes jocosely, with reference to it, that
                    “he was now plunged so deeply in debt, as to be ready for a plot, only that the
                    conspirators would not trust him.”</p>
                <p part="N">The most remarkable event that happened in this year, which was the
                    forty-fifth of Cicero’s life, was the pollution of the mysteries of the Bona Dea
                    by Publius Clodius, a crime which, byan unhappy train of consequences, involved
                    Ciccro in a great, and unexpected calamity. Clodius had an intrigue with
                    Caesar’s wife Pompeia, who, according to annual custom, was now celebrating in
                    her house those awful sacrifices of the goddess, to which no male creature was
                    ever admitted, and where everything masculine was so scrupulously excluded, that
                    even pictures of that sort were covered during the ceremony. It flattered
                    Clodius’s imagination greatly to gain access to his mistress in the midst of her
                    holy ministry; and with this view he dressed himself in a woman’s habit, that by
                    the benefit of his smooth face, and the introduction of one of the female
                    servants, he might pass without discovery; but by some mistake between him and
                    his guide, he lost his way when he came within the house, and fell unluckily
                    among the other female servants. Here he was detected by his voice, and the
                    servants alarmed the whole company by their shrieks, to the great amazement of
                    the matrons, who threw a veil over their sacred mysteries, while Clodius found
                    means to escape. The story was presently spread abroad, and raised a general
                    scandal and horror throughout the city. The whole defence which Clodius made
                    when, by order of the senate, he was brought to trial, was to prove himself
                    absent at the time when the offence was committed; for which purpose he produced
                    two men to swear that he was then at Interamna, distant about two or three days’
                    journey from the city. But Cicero being called upon to give his testimony,
                    deposed that Clodius had been with him that very morning at his house in Rome.
                    Irritated by this, Clodius formed a scheme of revenge. This was to get himself
                    chosen tribune, and in that office to drive Cicero out of the city, by the
                    publication of a law, which, by some stratagem or other, he hoped to obtrude
                    upon the people. But as all patricians were incapable of the tribunate by its
                    original institution, so his first step was to make himself a plebeian, by the
                    pretence of an adoption into a plebeian house, which could not yet be done
                    without the suffrage of the people. The first triumvirate had now been formed,
                    being in reality nothing else but a traitorous conspiracy of three of the most
                    powerful citizens of Rome, to extort from their country by violence what they
                    could not obtain by law. Pompey’s chief motive was to get his acts confirmed by
                    Caesar in his consulship, which was now approaching; Caesar, by giving way to
                    Pompey’s glory, thought to advance his own; while Crassus hoped to gain that
                    ascendency by the authority of Pompey and Caesar which he could not sustain
                    alone. Cicero might have made what terms he pleased with the triumvirate, and
                    even been admitted a partner of their power, or a fourth in their league; but he
                    would not enter into any engagements with the three, whose union he and all
                    friends of the republic abhorred. Clodius, in the mean time, had been pushing on
                    the business of his adoption, which at last he effected, and began soon
                    afterwards to threaten Cicero with all the terrors of his tribunate, to which he
                    was now advanced without any opposition. Both Caesar and Pompey secretly
                    favoured his scheme; not that they intended to ruin Cicero, but only to keep him
                    under the lash; and if they could not draw him into their measures, or induce
                    him at least to remain quiet, to let Clodius loose upon him. Caesar, in
                    particular, wanted to distress him so far as to force him to a dependence on
                    himself; and hence, while he was privately encouraging Clodius to pursue him, he
                    was proposing expedients to Cicero for his security. But though his fortunes
                    seemed now to be in a tottering condition, and his enemies daily gained ground
                    upon him, yet hc was unwilling to owe an obligation for his safety to any man,
                    far less to Caesar, whose designs he had always suspected, and whose schemes he
                    never approved. This stiffness in Ciccro so exasperated Caesar, that he resolved
                    immediately to assist Clodius with his whole power to oppress him; while Pompey
                    was all the while giving him the strongest assurances that there was no danger,
                    and that he would sooner be killed himself than suffer him to be hurt.</p>
                <p part="N">Clodius, in the mean time, was obliging the people with several new
                    laws, contrived chiefly for their advantage; in the hope, no doubt, that he
                    might thereby introduce with a better grace the ground-plot of the plan for the
                    banishment of Cicero. In short, having caused a law to be enacted, importing,
                    that whoever had condemned a Roman citizen unheard should be banished, he soon
                    afterwards impeached Ciccro upon the enactment. It was in vain that the great
                    orator went up and down the city soliciting his cause in the habit of a
                    suppliant, and attended by many of the first young noblemen whom he had taught
                    the rules of eloquence; those powers of speaking which had so often been
                    successful in defending the cause of others, seemed totally to forsake him in
                    pleading his own. He was banished by the votes of the people four hundred miles
                    from Italy; his houses were ordered to bc demolished, and his goods set up to
                    sale. It cannot be denied that, in this great calamity, he did not behave
                    himself with that firmness which might have reasonably been expected in one who
                    had borne so glorious a part in the republic, conscious of his integrity, and
                    suffering in the cause of his country; and his letters are for the most part
                    filled with such lamentable expressions of grief and despair, that his friends,
                    and even his wife, were forced sometimes to admonish him to rouse his courage,
                    and to remember his former character. Atticus was constantly putting him in mind
                    of this, and sent him notice of a report which had been brought to Rome by one
                    of Cassius’s freed-mcn, that his affliction had disordered his senses. He was
                    now indeed attacked in his weakest part, the only place in which he was
                    vulnerable. To have been as great in affliction as he was in prosperity, would
                    have been to exhibit a perfection not given to man; yet his very weakness flowed
                    from a source which rendered him the more amiable in all the other relations of
                    his life; and the same tenderness of disposition which made him love his
                    friends, bis children, and his country, more passionately than other men, caused
                    him to feel the loss of them more sensibly. When he had been gone a little more
                    than two months, a motion was made in the senate by one of the tribunes, who was
                    his friend, to recal him, and repeal the laws of Clodius, to which the whole
                    house readily agreed. Many obstructions, as may be easily imagined, were given
                    to it by the Clodian faction; but this made the senate only more resolute to
                    effect the object proposed. They passed a vote, therefore, that no other
                    business should be done till Cicero’s return had been carried; which it at last
                    was, and in so splendid and triumphant a manner, that he had reason, he says, to
                    fear lest people should imagine that he himself had contrived his'late flight

                    last were rebuilt by himself with more magnificence than before. But about this
                    time he had domestic grievances which touched him very nearly, and which, as he
                    signifies obscurely to Atticus, were of too delicate a nature to be expressed in
                    a letter: They arose chiefly from the petulant humour of his wife, which began
                    to give him frequent occasions of chagrin; and, by a series of repeated
                    provocations, confirmed in him the settled disgust which at last ended in a
                    divorce.</p>
                <p part="N">In the fifty-sixth year of his age he was appointed proconsul of
                    Cilicia, and his administration there gained him great honour. About this time
                    the expectation of a breach between Caesar and Pompey engaged the general
                    attention. Crassus had been destroyed with his army some years before, in the
                    war with the Parthians; and Julia, the daughter of Caesar, whom Pompey had
                    married, and who, while she lived, formed the cement of their union, had also
                    died in childbed. Caesar had put an end to the Gallic war, and reduced the whole
                    province under the Roman yoke; but though his commission was near expiring, he
                    seemed to have no thoughts of giving up his command and returning to the
                    condition of a private subject. He pretended that he could not possibly be
                    safe-if he parted with his army, especially while Pompey held the province of
                    Spain, the government of which had been continued to him for five years. This
                    tendency towards a breach Cicero learned from his friends, as he was returning
                    from his province of Cilicia. But as he foresaw the consequences of a war more
                    clearly and fully than any of them, so his first resolution was to apply all his
                    endeavours and authority to the mediation of a peace; though, in the event of a
                    breach, he secretly determined to follow the fortunes <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    Pompey. He clearly foresaw, and indeed declared without scruple to his friends,
                    that which side soever proved victorious, the war must necessarily end in a
                    tyranny. The only difference, he said, was, that if their enemies conquered,
                    they should be proscribed; if their friends, they would be slaves.</p>
                <p part="N">He had no sooner arrived in the city, however, than he fell, as he tells
                    us, into the very flame <hi rend="italic">of</hi> civil discord, and found the
                    war in effect proclaimed; for the senate had just voted a decree that Caesar
                    should disband his army by a certain day, or be declared a public enemy; and his
                    sudden march towards Rome had effectually confirmed it. In the midst of all this
                    hurry and confusion, Caesar was extremely solicitous about Cicero; not so much
                    to gain him, for that was not to be expected, as to prevail with him to remain
                    neutral. He wrote to him several times to this effect, and employed all their
                    common friends to press him with letters on the subject, but in vain; for Cicero
                    was impatient to join Pompey. In the mean time these letters give us a most
                    sensible proof of the high esteem and credit in which Cicero was held at this
                    time in Rome; when, in a contest for empire, which force alone was to decide,
                    the chiefs on both sides were so solicitous to gain a man to their party who had
                    no peculiar skill in arms nor talents for war. Pursuing, however, the result of
                    all his deliberations, he at length embarked to join Pompey, who had been
                    obliged to quit Italy some time before, and was then at Dyrrachium; and he
                    arrived safely in the camp with his son, his brother, and his nephew, thus
                    committing the fortunes of his whole family to the issue of the cause. After the
                    battle of Pharsalia, in which Pompey was defeated, Cicero returned into Italy,
                    and was afterwards received into great favour by Caesar, who had now been
                    declared dictator the second time, with Mark Antony as his master of horse. We
                    may easily imagine, what indeed we find from his letters, that he was not a
                    little disconcerted at the thoughts of an interview with Caesar, and the
                    indignity of presenting himself before a conqueror against whom he had been in
                    arms; for although, upon many accounts, he had reason to expect a kind reception
                    from Caesar, yet he hardly thought his life, he says, worth begging, since what
                    was given by a master might always be taken away again at pleasure. But at their
                    meeting he had no occasion to say or do any thing below his dignity; for Caesar
                    no sooner saw him than he alighted, ran to embrace him, and walked with him
                    alone, conversing very familiarly, for several furlongs.</p>
                <p part="N">Cicero, now in his sixty-first year, was at length forced to part with
                    his wife Terentia, whose humour and conduct had long been disagreeable to him.
                    She was a woman of an imperious and turbulent spirit; and though he had borne
                    her perverseness in the vigour of health, and the prosperous state of his
                    fortunes, yet, in declining life, and soured by a continual succession of
                    mortifications from abroad, the want of ease and quiet at home became no longer
                    tolerable to him. But he was immediately oppressed by a new and most cruel
                    affliction, the death of his beloved daughter Tullia, who died in childbed soon
                    after her divorce from her third husband Dolabella. She was about thirty-two
                    years old at the time of her death; and, by the few hints which are left <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> her character, she appears to have been an excellent
                    and admirable woman. She was most affectionately and piously attentive to her
                    father, and, to the usual graces of her sex, added the more solid
                    accomplishments of knowledge and polite letters, which qualified her to be the
                    companion and delight of his age, and made her justly esteemed not only as one
                    of the best, but the most learned, <hi rend="italic">of</hi> thç Roman laxlies.
                    His affliction for the death of this daughter was so great, that to shun all
                    company as much as he could, he removed to Atticus’s house, where he lived
                    chiefly in his library, turning over every book he could meet with on the
                    subject of moderating grief. But finding his residence here too public, and
                    being exposed to more society than he was able to bear, he retired to Astura,
                    one of his seats near Antium; a little island on the Latian shore, at the mouth
                    of a river of the same name, and covered with wood and groves cut into shady
                    walks, forming a scene altogether the fittest to indulge melancholy, and to
                    afford a free vent, to affliction. “Here,” says he to Atticus, “1 live without
                    the speech of man. Every morning early I hide myself in the thickest of the
                    wood, and never come out till the evening. Next to yourself, nothing is so dear
                    to me as this solitude; and my whole conversation is with my books.” Indeed his
                    whole time was employed in little else than reading and writing, during Caesar’s
                    administration, which he could never cheerfully submit to; and it was within
                    this period that he drew up one of the gravest of those philosophical pieces
                    which are still extant in his works.</p>
                <p part="N">Upon the death of Caesar, Octavius, his nephew and heir, coming into
                    Italy, was presented to Cicero by Hirtius and Pansa, with the strongest
                    professions on the part of the young man that he would be governed entirely by
                    his direction. Indeed Cicero thought it necessary to cherish and encourage
                    Octavius, if for nothing else, to keep him at a distance from Antony; but he
                    could not yet be persuaded to enter heartily into his affairs. He suspected his
                    youth and want of experience, and that he had not strength enough to deal with
                    Antony; and, above all, that he had no good disposition towards the
                    conspirators. He thought it impossible he should ever be a friend to them; and
                    indeed he was persuaded, that if ever he obtained the ascendency, his uncle’s
                    acts would be more violently enforced, and his death more cruelly revenged, than
                    even by Antony himself. Accordingly, when Cicero at last consented to unite
                    himself to Octavius’s interests, it was with no other view than to arm him with
                    a power sufficient to control<pb break="no" facs="nls:193356025?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0706-6025-0694"/> Antony, yet so checked and limited, that he
                    should not be able to oppress the republic.</p>
                <p part="N">In the midst of all this political bustle he still prosecuted his
                    studies with his usual application; and, besides some philosophical pieces, now
                    finished his book of Offices, or the Duties of Man, for the use of his son.
                    However, he paid constant attention to public affairs, and missed no
                    opportunities, but on the contrary did every thing that human prudence could
                    suggest, for the restoration of the republic; indeed all the vigour with which
                    the last effort was made in its behalf, was entirely owing to his counsels and
                    authority. This appears from the memorable Philippics which from time to time he
                    published against Antony, as well as from other monuments of antiquity. But all
                    was in vain; for although Antony’s army was entirely defeated at the siege of
                    Modena, and many people were in consequence led to imagine that the war was at
                    an end, and the liberty of Rome established, yet the death of the consuls Pansa
                    and Hirtius in that action gave a fatal blow to all Cicero s schemes, and proved
                    the immediate cause of the ruin <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the republic.</p>
                <p part="N">Octavius having humbled the senate to his mind, marched towards Gaul to
                    meet Antony and Lepidus, who had already passed the Alps, and brought their
                    armies into Italy, in order to have a personal interview with him, which, in
                    fact, had been privately concerted for settling the terms of a triple league,
                    and dividing the power and provinces of Italy among themselves. The place
                    appointed for this interview was a small island about two miles from Bononia,
                    formed by the river Rhenus, which runs near that c∙ityt Here they met, and spent
                    three days in close conference, adjusting the plan of their accommodation; and
                    the last thing they settled was the list of a proscription of their common or
                    individual enemies. This, as the writers tell us, occasioned much difficulty and
                    warm contests among them, till each in his turn consented to sacrifice some of
                    his best friends to the revenge and resentment of his colleagues. Cicero was at
                    his Tusculan villa when he first received the news of the proscription, and of
                    his being included in it at the instigation and to satisfy the vengeance of
                    Antony. It was the design of the triumvirate to keep it a secret, if possible,
                    till the very moment of execution, in order to surprise those whom they had
                    destined to destruction, before they were aware of their danger, or had time to
                    effect their escape. But some of Cicero’s friends found means to give him early
                    notice of this infamous compact, upon which he set forward to the sea-coast,
                    with the design of transporting himself beyond reach of his enemies. There,
                    finding a vessel ready, he immediately embarked; but the winds being adverse,
                    and the sea uneasy to him, after he had sailed about two leagues along the
                    coast, he was obliged to land, and spend the night on shore. By the importunity
                    of his servants, however, he was forced on board again; but he soon afterwards
                    landed at a country-seat of his, a mile from the shore, weary of life, and
                    declaring he was resolved to die in that country which he had so often saved.
                    Here hc slept soundly for some time, till his servants once more forced him away
                    in a litter towards the ship, having heard that he was pursued by Antony’s
                    assassins. They had scarcely departed when the assassins arrived at his house,
                    and, perceiving that he had fled, immediately pursued and overtook him in a wood
                    near the shore. Their leader was one Popilius Lenas, a tribune of the army,
                    whose life Cicero had formerly defended and saved. As soon as the soldiers
                    appeared, the servants prepared to defend their master’s life at the hazard of
                    their own; but Cicero commanded them to set him down and make no resistance. The
                    assassins soon cut off his head and his hands, with which they returned to Rome
                    as the most agreeable present to their savage and remorseless employer. Antony,
                    who was then at Rome, received them with extreme joy, rewarded the murderers
                    with a large sum of money, and ordered the head to be fixed upon the rostra
                    between the two hands,—a sad spectacle to the city, and which drew tears from
                    every eye.</p>
                <p part="N">If wc take an impartial survey of Cicero’s conduct and principles,
                    avowed in his own epistolary correspondence, and trace him through all the
                    labyrinths of his contradictory letters, we shall perhaps find more to blame
                    than to admire; and discover that the desire of advancing his fortunes, and
                    making himself a namc, were, from his outset in life, the chief objects he had
                    in view. The good of his country, and the dictates of a steady unyielding
                    virtue, were not, as in Brutus and Cato, the constant springs of his actions.
                    The misfortunes which befel him after his consulship developed his character,
                    and showed him in his true colours: from that time to his death, pusillanimity,
                    irresolution, and unworthy repining, tainted his judgment, and perplexed every
                    step he attempted to take. He flattered Pompey and cringed to Caesar, while in
                    his private letters he abused both alternately and impartially. He acknowledges,
                    in a letter to his friend Atticus, that, although he was at present determined
                    to support the cause of Rome and liberty, and to bear misfortune like a
                    philosopher, there was one thing which would gain him over to the triumvirs, and
                    that was their procuring for him the vacant augurship; so pitiful was the bribe
                    to which he would have sacrificed his honour, his opinions, and the
                    commonwealth.</p>
                <p part="N">Cicero’s death happened on the 7th of December, in the sixty-fourth year
                    of his age, about ten days after the settlement of the first triumvirate. As an
                    orator he is thus characterized by a popular writer: “In all his orations his
                    art is conspicuous. He begins commonly with a regular exordium, and with much
                    address prepossesses the hearers, and studies to gain their affections. His
                    method is clear, and his arguments are arranged with exact propriety. In a
                    superior clearness of method, he has an advantage over Demosthenes. Every thing
                    appears in its proper place. He never tries to move till he has attempted to
                    convince; and in moving, particularly the softer passions, he is highly
                    successful. No one ever knew the force of words better than Cicero. He rolls
                    them along with the greatest beauty and magnificence; and in the structure of
                    his sentences is eminently curious and exact. He is always full and flowing,
                    never abrupt. He amplifies every thing; yet though his manner is generally
                    diffuse, it is often happily varied and accommodated to the subject. When an
                    important public object roused his mind, and demanded indignation and force, he
                    departs considerably from that loose and declamatory manner to which he at other
                    times is addicted, and becomes very forcible and vehement This great orator,
                    however, is not without his defects. In most of his orations there is too much
                    art, even carried to a degree of ostentation. He seems often desirous of
                    obtaining admiration rather than of operating conviction. He is sometimes,
                    therefore, showy rather than solid, and diffuse where he ought to have been
                    urgent. His sen-tenςcs are always round and sonorous. They cannot be accused of
                    monotony, since they possess variety of cadence; but from too great a fondness
                    for magnificence, lie is on some occasions deficient in strength. Though the
                    services which he had performed to his country <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>
                    were very considerable, yet he is too much his own panegyrist. Ancient manners,
                    which imposed fewer restraints on the side of decorum, may in some degree
                    excuse, but cannot entirely justify, his vanity.”</p>
                <p part="N">There have been many editions of all Cicero’s pieces, and many also of
                    his whole works. Their multiplicity is so great that we can only refer those who

                        rend="italic">in usum Delphini,</hi> in 2 vols. 4to, in 1687; of his
                    Letters, by Graevius, published in 1677, in 2 vols. 8vo; of his Orations, also
                    bv Graevius, published in 1699, in 6 vols. 8vo; and of his Philosophical Works,
                    by Rath, published in 1808, in 6 vols. 8vo. One of the best editions of his
                    whole works is that of Olivet, published at Paris in 1742, in 9 vols. 4to. The
                    beautiful edition published at Glasgow in 1749, in 20 vols. 12mo, is a reprint
                    of that of Olivet. Among the other editions of note, may be mentioned that of
                    Manutianus, which is the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps,</hi> Mediol. fol.
                    1498, 4 vols.; that of Paul Manutius, which is deservedly held in high
                    estimation, Venet. 1540-41, 10 vols.; that of R. Stephanus, Paris, 1543, 8
                    vols.; that of Elzevir, beautiful and correct, exhibiting the improved text of
                    Gruter, Lugd. Bat. 1642, 10 vols.; those of Enesti, Lipsiae, 1737, Hal. Sax.
                    1758-74, one in 5 vols, and the last in 8; and the Bipont edition, which
                    professes to be formed on the basis of the most popular ones, without the
                    introduction of either conjecture or novelty, 1780, 13 vols. In any future
                    edition of the whole works of Cicero must be included the recovered portions or
                    fragments of the celebrated treatise on government <hi rend="italic">(De
                        Iiepublica), for</hi> which the world is indebted to the patient labour and
                    sagacity of Signor Angelo Mai, librarian of the Vatican, formerly of the
                    Ambrosian library at Milan. In a palimpsest volume, containing various treatises
                    of St Augustin, this learned and ingenious person found that the prior writing,
                    of much greater antiquity, had consisted of the long-lost books of Cicero <hi
                        rend="italic">De Pepublica,</hi> of which nothing had been known in modern
                    times, except the few fragments which had been preserved in the writings of
                    Macrobius, Lactantius, Augustin, Nonius, and others. From these rescribed pages,
                    a very considerable part of the first and second books of this interesting
                    treatise was found so perfect as to be almost completely recovered by Signor
                    Mai; and this he was enabled to publish in 1821, with copious notes and
                    illustrations, with an accurate notice of all the chasms occurring from the loss
                    of original leaves, and with such a restoration of the four remaining books as
                    could be made from the less perfect fragments of the manuscript, and from the
                    remains collected by Ligonius and other critics. This is perhaps the most
                    valuable contribution which has been made to classical literature in modern
                    times; and it is sufficient to immortalize the learned, sagacious, and
                    indefatigable scholar to whom we are indebted for it; consisting, as it does, of
                    no inconsiderable portion of that treatise, which the contemporaries of the
                    Roman orator and statesman all agreed in regarding as his masterpiece.</p>
