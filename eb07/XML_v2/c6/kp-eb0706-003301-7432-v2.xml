                <p part="N"><label type="entry">CAMBRIDGESHIRE</label> is divided into two parts by
                    the river Ouse. Its most northerly division, which is principally composed of
                    the Isle of Ely, is bounded by rivers and their eommunieating branches. The
                    limits thus formed are so intermixed as with difficulty to be traced. The
                    southern half has an indented and undistinguished boundary-line on the adjaeent
                    counties. The form of Cambridgeshire bears some resemblanee to that of the human
                    ear, the eounty of Huntingdon eutting deeply into its western side by a circular
                    projection. The number of acres assigned to it by Dr Beeke is 530,000; but from
                    the agricultural report, and in the returns of the poor-rates in 1803, the
                    number is stated to be 443,300 and 439,040 respectively. When the original
                    agricultural report was made in 1794 by Mr Vancouver, he ealeulated that, of the
                    443,000 aeres, there were 132,000 open field, and 150,000 waste and unimproved
                    fen; but since that time both these· descriptions of land have been very
                    considerably reduced by inclosure and cultivation.</p>
                <p part="N">The surface of this county presents considerable variety. The northern
                    part, ineluding the Isle of Ely, is ehĩefly fen land, and perfectly level,
                    intersected with numerous eanals and ditehcs, and abounding with windmills, for
                    the purpose of carrying the water from the lands. This district is naturally a
                    bog, formed by the stagnation of the water from the overflowing rivers. It
                    comprises nearly half of that extensive traet ealled the Bedford Level, the
                    whole extent of whieh is 400,000 aeres. This great level has been from an early
                    period divided into three parts, the north level, the middle level, and the
                    south level. The largest portion of the middle level, and a considerable part of
                    the south level, are in Cambridgeshire, comprehending the Isle of Ely, and a few
                    parishes to the south-east of the isle. The principal of the drains by means of
                    whieh this immense fenny district has been in a great measure rendered either
                    rich meadow or arable land, are the Bedford Old and New Rivers, whieh are
                    navigable in a straight line upwards of twenty miles aeross the eounty, from the
                    Great to the Little Ouse. There are some rising grounds in this part of the
                    eounty, on the most considerable of whieh the eity of Ely stands. Those parts of
                    Cambridgeshire whieh lie adjacent to Suffolk, Essex, and Hertfordshire, have
                    their surface varied by gently rising hills and downs. The Gogmagog Hills, whieh
                    begin about four miles to the south-east of Cambridge, and whieh are one of the
                    terminations of the range of chalk hills that eommenee in the south-west of
                    England, are the highest in the eounty; but their height is very inconsiderable.
                    The district whieh extends from these hills to Newmarket is bleak and thinly
                    inhabited. This district is connected with that vast tract of land which,
                    extending southwards into Essex, and northwards through Suffolk into Norfolk,
                    forms one of the largest plains in the kingdom.</p>
                <p part="N">The substrata of this eounty are chalk, <hi rend="italic">clunch,</hi>
                    gravel, <hi rend="italic">gault,</hi> sand, <hi rend="italic">silt,</hi> and
                    peat-earth. The ehalk extends through the hilly part of the county from Royston
                    to Newmarket. The <hi rend="italic">clunch,</hi> an impure limestone, chiefly
                    abounds in the parishes of Burwell and Iselham. On the east and west sides of
                    the upland division of the county, <hi rend="italic">gault,</hi> a stiff blue
                    clay, chiefly prevails. The sand enters Cambridgeshire from Bedfordshire, in the
                    parish of Gam-lingay. In the northern extremity of the county <hi
                        rend="superscript"> r</hi>, near Wisbeach, <hi rend="italic">silt,</hi> a
                    fine sea-sand, is found. The peat-earth extends through the whole of the
                    fen-land.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal rivers are the Ouse, and Granta or Cam. The Ouse enters
                    the county between Fen Drayton and Erith, and thenee runs eastward through the
                    fens, till, at some distance above Denny Abbey, it takes a northerly eourse,
                    and, passing Streatham, Ely, and Littleport, flows into Norfolk. From this river
                    are many cuts, ealled <hi rend="italic">loads.</hi> The Cam enters the eounty to
                    the west of Gilden Morden, and thence flowing to the east, it receives several
                    rivulets. Near Grantchester its stream is enlarged by the united waters of
                    several rivulets from Essex. After their junction it takes a northerly
                    direction, and having passed Cambridge and several villages, it falls into the
                    Ouse in the parish of Streatham.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides the numerous canals in the fenny district, principally for the
                    purposes of draining the land, there are the Cambridgeshire Canal, which
                    commences in the Ouse at Harrimcre, and terminates at Cambridge. A cut of three
                    miles extends to Reche, and another of three and a half miles to Burwell; and
                    the Wisbeach Canal, whieh joins the Wisbeaeh river at the old sluiee in the
                    town, opening a communication with Norfolk, Suffolk, and other plaees.</p>
                <p part="N">The elimate of Cambridgeshire differs considerably in different parts.
                    In the south-east it is eold and bleak; in the fenny district damp and
                    unhealthy, though mueh less so than formerly; in the south and south-western
                    districts the climate is mild, agreeable, and healthy.</p>
                <p part="N">Estates vary much in size. There are many large ones, especially those
                    of the Earl of Hardwieke and the Dukes of Bedford and Rutland. College tenures
                    are numerous. There are some farms of a thousand acres or more, but the general
                    size is from a hundred to five hundred aeres.</p>
                <p part="N">Cambridgeshire is not celebrated as an agricultural county. It may be
                    considered as chiefly arable. Wheat is grown principally in some parts of the
                    fenny district, and in the south and south-western parts of the county. Barley
                    is cultivated in these parts, and in some of the more fertile portions of the
                    south-east district. Immense erops of oats, of good quality, are grown in the
                    fenny district, and also in most ether parts of the county. It is supposed that
                    about one fourth of the fen-lands is cropped with eole, whieh is principally
                    sown to be eaten green by sheep, very little being now cultivated for the seed.
                    The cultivation of hemp and flax is earried on to a considerable extent in that
                    part of the eounty whieh borders on Norfolk, particularly in the parishes of
                    Upwell and Wolney. Saffron has been very little, if at all cultivated, for
                    upwards of forty years. In some parts mustard is a favourite and valuable erop.
                    Sedge is cultivated near Chippenham; but the cultivation of the reed is rapidly
                    deereasing, in eonsequence of the improvement of the fens. White seed, or
                    fen-hay, is grown abundantly in several places. It increases the milk of eows.
                    Oziers are grown in the Wash, as well as in many parts of the fen, and are a
                    profitable crop in these districts. So great is the value of turf, that the land
                    producing it has been sold at from L.50 to L.80 per aere. At Ely, Soham,
                    Wisbeach, &amp;e. are many large gardens, producing ve∙ getables and common
                    kinds of fruit so abundantly, as to supply not only the neighbouring towns and
                    eounties, but even London. Great quantities of strawberries arc grown in the
                    vieinity of Ely, and are ehiefly conveyed in barges to Lynn, and earried thence
                    to Newcastle and other places in the north of England. There are numerous and
                    large orchards in the same districts as the gardens; and their ehief produce
                    consists of apples and cherries. Soham is remarkable for the latter.</p>

                <p part="N">That district of the county which by old authors is termed the <hi
                        rend="italic">Dairies,</hi> comprehends the parishes of Shengay, Wengy,
                    Whaddon, &amp;c.; but the dairy farms in this district are at present much less
                    considerable than those in the parishes of Chattris, Mepal, Sutton, Cottcnham,
                    Soham, Ely, and Strcatham. The whole number of cows kept in this district is
                    supposed to be between 9000 and 10,000; in the parish of Cottenham alone about
                    1500 are usually kept; in Willingham about 1200. These two parishes make the
                    chcesc, so much esteemed, which goes by the name of Cottenham cheese; the parish
                    of Soham is also esteemed for good cheese. Little cheese is made in other parts
                    of the county, the rearing of calves and making of butter being the chief dairy
                    management. The butter is sold, rolled up in pieces of a yard long, and about
                    two inches in circumference. This is done for the convenience of the colleges,
                    where it is cut into pieces called parts, and so sent to table. Its quality is
                    excellent. The cows kept on the dairy farms are mostly of the breed of the
                    county. Most of the calves that are suckled arc sent to the London market.
                    Immense numbers of sheep are pastured on the heaths and commons with which the
                    south and south-western districts of this county are intersected. The downs in
                    the vicinity of the Gogmagog Hills are also chiefly used as sheep-walks. The
                    principal breeds kept here are the Norfolk and west country; in the fens the
                    most prevalent sort is a cross between the Leicester and Lincoln. The
                    Cambridgeshire farmers think themselves unrivalled in cart-horses, which are of
                    the large black breed. In the fens they are a source of great profit. In
                    Cambridgeshire there is also a peculiar breed of hogs, some of which are so
                    large as to fatten to forty stones, fourteen pounds to the stone, at two years
                    old.</p>
                <p part="N">From the nature of the northern division of the county, great attention
                    has necessarily been paid to draining; and in some places advantage has been
                    taken of the numerous rivers to irrigate and warp land. The interior drainage of
                    the fens is performed principally by mills. One or two steam-engines have been
                    erected for that purpose, and will probably answer better. There is a large
                    tract of meadow land at Babraham, which has been irrigated from the time of
                    Queen Elizabeth, and is supposed to be one of the oldest instances of this mode
                    of improving land in the kingdom. It was first irrigated by Pallavicino, who was
                    collector of Peter’s Pence at the death of Queen Mary, and who, turning
                    Protestant, applied the money thus obtained to the purchase and irrigation of
                    this estate. The practice, however, though evidently beneficial, has extended
                    very little. Near Denver Sluice, on the Ouse, some land has been warped by
                    letting the muddy water of that river upon it, and then throwing it back by
                    means of a wind-mill.</p>
                <p part="N">This is by no means a manufacturing county. At Ely there is a pottery
                    for coarse ware; and at this city, Chatteris, and Cambridge, excellent white
                    bricks are made. Lime and chalk are a source of considerable trade and profit;
                    the lime in the greatest estimation is that which is burnt at Reach. At
                    Cherryhinton, at the foot of the Gogmagog Hills, are great chalk pits, noted for
                    the marine productions they contain, and for the many rare plants growing in
                    their vicinity. Elephants’ grinders, and other animal remains, have been found
                    in a gravel pit near ’ Chesterford, and a small tortoise in flint at Miltón. On
                    the borders of Norfolk a little yarn is spun for the Norwich weavers. Malt is
                    made to a considerable amount in the north-west part of the county. There'are"
                    ⅛veral mills for preparing oil from cole and rapc-seed at Wittïeş-ford, Şawston,
                    &amp;c., and a pretty extensιveφaper manufactory at the latter place. Near
                    Cambridge· isannualłý held one of the greatest fairs in England; it is called
                    Stourbridge or Sturbich Fair, and is under the jurisdiction of the university.
                    It begins on the 18th September, and lasts a fortnight; it has, however, been
                    declining for many years.</p>
                <p part="N">A very curious example, and unquestionably one of the oldest in the
                    kingdom, of Saxon architecture, occurs in the remains of the conventual church
                    of Ely. This building is undoubtedly of as early a date as the tenth century,
                    having been erected in the reign of King Edgar. The two transepts of Ely
                    Cathedral afford specimens of the more massive kind of architecture introduced
                    by the Normans. They were built towards the end of the eleventh century. St
                    Sepulchre’s Church at Cambridge affords a curious specimen of that species of
                    architecture which was introduced into this country in imitation of the church
                    of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem; it is supposed to be the oldest of this form
                    in England, and to have been built in the reign of Henry I. There are some
                    instances in this county of the pointed arch, enriched with Saxon mouldings; a
                    style which was the immediate forerunner of the Gothic. Soham Church, the south
                    doorway of St Giles in Cambridge, and the north and south doorways of St Mary’s
                    Church in Ely, are specimens of this species of architecture. One of the most
                    ancient buildings in the county, in which the pointed arch makes its appearance,
                    is the great Tower at the west end of Ely Cathedral, and the south transept
                    adjoining; they were erected between 1174 and 1189. Some traces of Saxon
                    architecture may be observed in this part of the cathedral. The early or simple
                    Gothic may be seen in the vestibule at the west end of Ely Cathedral, in Jesus
                    College Chapel, Cambridge, and in the chancels of Foxton, Kennett, and
                    Cherryhinton churches. Of the Gothic architecture of the fifteenth century,
                    especially in the reign of King Henry VII. which was distinguished by the
                    abundance of its rich tracery, the finest and most perfect example is found in
                    the magnificent chapel of King’s College in Cambridge.</p>
                <p part="N">There are not many remains of antiquity in this county. The most
                    remarkable are the ditches, which formerly extended from the woods on the east
                    side of the county to the fens. The most entire is called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >DevU</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Ditch,</hi> and extends from Wood-ditton or
                    Ditch-town to Reach. Near this latter place it is most perfect, the works
                    consisting of a deep ditch with an elevated <hi rend="italic">vallum,</hi> the
                    slope of which measures fifty-two feet on the west and twenty-six on the east
                    side. The whole of the works are about 100 feet in width. The origin and
                    intention of these ditches are not known; they are certainly very ancient, and
                    were probably formed for the purpose of defence.</p>
                <p part="N">By returns made to the Board of Agriculture in the year 1804, it appears
                    that the poors’ rates rose, between 1790 and 1803, from 4s. lid. to 5s. 8įd. in
                    the pound; while the expense of maintaining them from Easter 1802 to Easter 1803
                    amounted tö the sum of L.55,954. 14s. 1 Id. In the year ending the 25th of March
                    1815 the parochial rates in 131 parishes amounted to the sum of L.63,354. !3s.
                    1⅜d.; forty-four parishes had made no returns.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1377 the number of persons charged in this county to a poll
                    tax, from which the clergy, children, and paupers were exempted, was 27,350; but
                    it seems doubtful whether it was exclusive ’of the 'town of Cambridge and city
                    of Ely, in each of which 1722 persons were taxed. If they <hi rend="superscript"

                    under the act of parliament for ascertaining the population of the kingdom in
