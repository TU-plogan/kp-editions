                    denominated by the Europeans. It extends along the eastern coast of Hindustan
                    about 500 miles in length, and is from 50 to 100 miles in breadth. It is bounded
                    on the north by the Guntoor circar, the limit being the small river Gundezama,
                    which falls into the sea at Montapilly, and thence it stretches southward to
                    Cape Comorin. In this country is comprehended what lately formed the dominions
                    of the nabob of Arcot. It is divided into the Southern, Central, and Northern
                    Carnatic. The region south of the river Coleroon, which passes the town of
                    Trichinopoly, is called the Southern Carnatic. The principal towns of this
                    division are Tanjorc, Trichinopoly, Madura, Tranquebar, Negapatam, and
                    Tineyelly. The Central Carnatic extends from the Coleroon river on the south to
                    the river Pennar on the north; its chief towns are Madras, Pondicherry, Arcot,
                    Vellore, Cuddalore, Pullicat, Nelloor, &amp;c. The Northern Carnatic extends
                    from the river Pennar to the northern limit of the country, and the chief towns
                    are Ongole, Carwaree, and Samgaum. The soil is various; in a great part of the
                    country it is deep and rich, whilst in other tracts it is sandy, and, water
                    being scarce, unproductive. This defect is, however, supplied by artificial
                    means; and in such parts as are at too great a distance to have water conveyed
                    to them, tanks are formed, some of them of great extent, and formed by inclosing
                    the waters deposited in low situations with a strong mound of earth; while
                    others are of a smaller size, and of a quadrangular form, lined with stone, and
                    with a flight of steps descending to the bottom. In these reservoirs are
                    collected the periodical rains, which are afterwards distributed over the rice
                    fields, and are also used for the supply of the cattle in the dry season. The
                    climate, except on the sea-coast, where there arc sea and land breezes, is
                    liable to excessive heats, the thermometer standing in the coolest and shadiest
                    parts at 115 degrees. Occasional showers fall in May, June, and July, and
                    sometimes heavy rains which last for three or four days, but refresh the air,
                    and prepare the ground for cultivation. The principal rivers are the Pennar, the
                    Patar, and the Vaggaroo, which all rise in the high lands among the Ghauts, and
                    take an easterly course to the Bay of Bengal. The vegetable productions are
                    numerous, and similar to those found in most other parts of Hindustan. Famines
                    and scarcities, owing to drought, are much more frequent in the Carnatic than in
                    the Bengal provinces. This country has been from the earliest times the scene of
                    violence and strife between the numerous polygars or chieftains and petty
                    potentates, among whom it was formerly divided; and forts and fortresses
                    accordingly crown almost all the elevated points. They are built of a square
                    form, and, from the long period of internal tranquillity which the country has
                    enjoyed, they are rapidly falling into decay. Large temples and other public
                    monuments of civilization abound in <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193348927?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8927-0148"/>the
                    Carnatic. The temples are commonly built in the middle of a square area, and
                    inclosed by a wall fifteen or twenty feet high, which conceals them from the
                    public view, as they are never raised above it. Throughout this province the
                    lower classes use an ass of a small breed as a beast of burden. The higher
                    classes would disdain the use of so impure an animal. Every man has also a cow,
                    by which, being trained to act as a stalking horse, he approaches game, and
                    attacks it with arrows.</p>
                <p part="N">The population may be estimated at about 5,000,000, and consists chiefly
                    of Hindus of the Brahminical persuasion, the Mahommedans being but thinly
                    scattered over the country. There are about 20,000 native Christians of the
                    Roman Catholic sect; and there are other Christians of all descriptions, who are
                    estimated at about double that number. The Brahmins rent a great proportion of
                    the land in the country; they also fill different offices in the collection of
                    the revenue and the administration of justice. Their farms are chiefly
                    cultivated by slaves. Throughout the country they appropriate to themselves a
                    particular quarter in every town, generally the strongest part of it. The
                    Southern Carnatic, when it came into the possession of the British, was occupied
                    by military chieftains called polygars, who ruled over the country, and held
                    lands by doubtful tenures, as they were interpreted by the Company’s servants.
                    They were unquestionably a disorderly race; and the country, by their incessant
                    feuds and plunderings, was one continued scene of strife and violence. They were
                    transferred to the dominions of the British in the year 1732, in virtue of a
                    treaty concluded by Lord Cornwallis with the nabob of Arcot. But the conditions
                    of that treaty were variously understood; and it was found necessary, for the
                    peace of the country, to reduce these refractory polygars to obedience. In 1801
                    an insurrection took place, which was crushed by a military force; after which
                    their forts and military establishments were abolished, the country was searched
                    for arms, and all that were found were seized. Severe examples were also made of
                    some of the polygars, who were deprived ofthcir estates, and in some instances
                    put to death. The country has thus been reduced to tranquillity and
                    obedience.</p>
                <p part="N">Trade and manufactures are carried on to a considerable extent. Piece
                    goods, consisting mostly of blue cloths, coarse chintzes, and the like; also
                    rum, indigo, grain, and other commodities, are exported to Madras. The blue
                    cloths are re-exported, as well as the other goods, to eastern markets. The
                    imports are very inconsiderable.</p>
                <p part="N">The Carnatic was first invaded by the Mahommedans in A. D. 1310, when
                    they defeated the Hindu sovereign, and conquered the country. After this period
                    it was liable to an occasional tribute, first to the Deccany sovereign, and
                    subsequently to the Mogul emperors; and early in the eighteenth century it was
                    overrun by the armies of Aurungzebe. It was dismembered from the Mogul empire in
                    1717, when Nizamul Mulk obtained possession of the Deccan and the south of
                    India. In 1743 he appointed Anwar ud Deen nabob of the Carnatic and Arcot; in
                    1754 a competition for the government arose; and after a long and tedious war,
                    in which the English and the French took different sides, Mahommed Ali was left
                    in possession of that portion of the Carnatic which was the fruit of the
                    successes achieved by the British. The Carnatic was laid completely waste in its
                    central parts by Hyder Ali, but was again re-conquered by the British in 1783.
                    In 1801 all the possessions of the nabob of Arcot situated in the Carnatic were
                    transferred by treaty to the British, the conditions of which were, that a clear
                    revenue should be reserved to the nabob of two or three lacks of pagodas
                    annually; and that the British should undertake to support a sufficient civil
                    and military force for the pro tection of the country and the collection of the
                    revenue· A liberal establishment was also provided for the other branches of the
                    family of Mahommed Ali Khan. After* this the country was taken possession of by
                    the British collectors of revenue. It was subdivided into districts; and an
                    assessment was imposed, which has been since collected with little difficulty.
