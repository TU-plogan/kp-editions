                    of course was enlarged, the buildings naturally extendingalong the Delaware, and
                    now forms an oblong square reaching from the lower part of Southwark to the
                    upper part of Kensington, nearly four miles, and, as we have said, from the one
                    river to the other. It is noted for the regularity with which it is laid out.
                    The main streets, twenty-five in number, and running from north to south, are
                    intersected at right angles by others stretching east and west. There is an
                    immense number of squares, it is supposed above three hundred and fifty. Some of
                    the streets are a hundred feet and upwards in breadth; they are all well paved,
                    and kept remarkably clean, being mostly furnished with common sewers. The houses
                    altogether exhibit an appearance of neatness, uniformity, and commodiousness,
                    and most of them are ornamented with white marble steps and window-sills. The
                    most conspicuous buildings are some of the churches, the state-house, the United
                    States and Pennsylvania banks, the institution for the deaf and dumb, and the
                    Pennsylvania hospital. There are above a hundred places of public worship, but,
                    with the exception of the first Presbyterian church, and two or three
                    Episcopalian chapels, which are noblc edifices, they are neither remarkable for
                    their architecture nor their size. The front of Pennsylvania hospital is two
                    hundred and seventy-three feet in breadth; and in connection with it there is a
                    building sufficiently large to contain above fifty patients. There are a number
                    of other institutions for the sick and the destitute, the buildings of which,
                    together with the former, occupy an entire square, in the centre of which is a
                    leaden statue of the founder of the city. The building for the reception of the
                    deaf and dumb was erected in 1824, and is constructed of granite. It is of
                    considerable size, and, having received handsome donations<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193495546?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5546-0343"/> from
                    various quarters, the managers of the institution are enabled to receive pupils
                    from other states besides that in which it is situated. The object of this
                    school is to give a common education to the deaf and dumb, and to train them to
                    industrious habits, the course of instruction varying from four to six
                    years.</p>
                <p part="N">The bank of the United States was established in the year 1816, with a
                    capital of thirty-five millions of dollars. The banking-house is a splendid
                    structure, built on the plan of the Parthenon at Athens, and is considered as
                    the most finished specimen of pure Grecian architecture in America. It is
                    constructed of white marble, having in front eight fluted Doric columns, four
                    feet and a half in diameter. On each of the fronts is a portico projecting ten
                    feet and a half. The whole length of the edifice, including the portico, is a
                    hundred and sixty-one feet; its breadth being eighty-seven feet. The
                    banking-room, which occupies the centre of the building, is eighty-one feet in
                    length by fortyeight feet in breadth. The whole immense structure is arched, and
                    rendered bomb-proof from the cellar to the roof, which is covered with copper.
                    The bank of Pennsylvania is likewise a fine specimen of classical architecture,
                    and built of the same material as the former. The statehouse is a large brick
                    building, comprising a centre and two wings, and presenting altogether a
                    venerable appearance, never having been altered since its first erection. In the
                    eyes of the Americans it will remain a feature of great interest as long as it
                    lasts; for it was here the continental congress held its meetings, and from it
                    the declaration of independence was first promulgated. There are several
                    theatres, which are esteemed highly respectable buildings. The masonic hall,
                    built in the Gothic style, is a large edifice, but more remarkable for its size
                    than for its architectural beauty. The arcade is an imposing stone structure,
                    containing the best museum in America; and the academy of arts is likewise a
                    respectable edifice, enriched internally with a large number of paintings and
                    some very fine statues. The university of Pennsylvania is distinguished by the
                    celebrity of the medical school attached to it. The new halls, which were
                    erected in the year 1830, are spacious, and built in a handsome style of
                    architecture. The number of medical students who attend it vary from 400 to 500
                    annually. The hall of the Jefferson medical college is also a spacious building.
                    There are three prisons in Philadelphia, one of which is built in the style of
                    the castles of the middle ages, and is considered as a great ornament to the
                    city. It is called the New Penitentiary, and occupies ten acres of ground, being
                    designed to carry the principle of solitary confinement completely into
                    effect.</p>
                <p part="N">The United States mint was established in Philadelphia in the year 1791,
                    and by several successive acts of congress has been continued in the same place
                    ever since. The old buildings, however, have been supplanted by a spacious new
                    edifice, which was commenced in 1829. This splendid structure is faced with
                    marble, and presents a front of a hundred and twenty-two feet, divided into a
                    portico sixty-two feet long, and two wings each of thirty feet in length. The
                    building is of the Ionic order, taken from the celebrated Grecian temple on the
                    river Illisus, near Athens. The total value of the gold, silver, and copper
                    coinage struck at this mint during the year ending January 1837 was 7,764,900
                    dollars. The report for that year states that great and important improvements
                    had been introduced into every department of the mint. Changes have been made in
                    the arrangements for assaying, which place this part of the establishment upon a
                    footing with the most perfect in Europe. The marine asylum stands on the eastern
                    bank of the Schuylkill, a short distance south of the city line. It is three
                    hundred and eighty-six feet in length, consisting of a portico of ninety feet,
                    supported by eight Ionic columns, and two wings, each a hundred and forty eight
                    feet in extent. But of all the public works of Philadelphia there are none of
                    which its inhabitants are so justly proud as those at Fair Mount, by which the
                    city is supplied with water of the best quality, and in the greatest abundance.
                    Nothing of the kind has been executed on the American side of the Atlantic that
                    will bear any comparison with the arduous and expensive operation of introducing
                    the Schuylkill water. At two different times plans were adopted for the purpose
                    of supplying Philadelphia with water; but both having proved inefficient, the
                    present magnificent undertaking was commenced in 1819, and completed at an
                    expense of about one million and a half of dollars. Fair Mount is in the rear of
                    the city, upon the bank of the Schuylkill, the neighbourhood of which presents
                    some remarkably beautiful and romantic scenery. The reservoirs are situated on
                    the top of a hill rising from the river, a part of it perpendicular rock, to the
                    height of a hundred feet. They are calculated to contain thirty millions of
                    gallons of water, which is sufficient to supply the city for ten days. It was
                    formerly forced into the reservoirs by means of steam, which is no longer used;
                    it is now raised by machinery propelled by the river. There are five large
                    water-wheels turned, one of which, made of iron, weighs twenty-four tons. If all
                    are put in motion at once, they will raise seven millions of gallons in
                    twenty-four hours, which is more than double the quantity required even in
                    summer. To turn them, the Schuylkill has been dammed in its whole breadth, by
                    which the water is thrown back into a reservoir lock, whence it is admitted as
                    required to operate upon the wheels, and is discharged into the river below the
                    dam. The iron pipes through which the water is conveyed to the city and
                    districts are about sixty miles in extent. The water thus circulated so
                    abundantly through the city is of immense service in cases of fire, as it is
                    only necessary to screw the hose to hydrauts, which are placed at convenient
                    distances, to secure a constant stream of sufficient force to reach any ordinary
                    height. There are sixteen hose companies, and about thirty engine companies; in
                    short, the arrangements made in Philadelphia for the speedy extinction of
                    conflagrations are of the first order.</p>
                <p part="N">⅛⅛∙The city library is indebted for its origin to Benjamin Franklin. It
                    was commenced as early as 1731, and incorporated eleven years afterwards. In
                    1790 the present neat and ornamental edifice was erected opposite to the
                    state-house square; and over the front door is placed a fine marble statue of
                    its founder. In 1837 it contained 44,000 volumes. There are other institutions
                    of the kind, which contain upwards of ten thousand volumes. Opposite the
                    Philadelphia library is the Athenaeum, a valuable institution, established in
                    1814. Attached to it is a library, and a spacious reading-room, well supplied
                    with newspapers from Europe and other quarters of the world, besides nearly a
                    hundred from various parts of the United States. The university of Philadelphia
                    was founded in the year 1755, and is one of the most respectable and flourishing
                    institutions of the kind in the union. Academies and other seminaries of
                    education are numerous, and efficiently conducted. The city and &lt;county of
                    Philadelphia constitute a school district, under special regulations. By the
                    report for the year 1837, it appears that the schools in it were attended by
                    above eleven thousand children; and from the same document we learn that the
                    arrangements for the general diffusion of instruction are very extensive and
                    highly efficient. There are in this city a number of benevolent societies,
                    various institutions which have for their object the relief of the sick, the
                    helpless, the destitute, and other objects of compassion. In this respect it is
                    upon a level with any city of the same size in Europe.</p>

                    of New York and Baltimore; but otherwise it possesses perhaps as many natural
                    advantages as either of them. Its trade is very great, as will be seen in the

                    manufactures, paper-making, printing, and publishing establishments, and its
                    periodicals and journals of every description.</p>
                <p part="N">Philadelphia was founded by William Penn in the year 1682. On the 5th of
                    September 1774 the members of the first congress assembled here, and adopted
                    that celebrated declaration of rights, the preface to the declaration of
                    independence which was promulgated from the state-house about two years
                    afterwards. Congress continued to sit in this city until the approach of the
                    royalists in September 1777, when it fell into their hands, and was retained by
                    them until June following. During the remainder of the war it happily escaped
                    the ravages of hostile operations. It was also the seat of the state government
                    until the year 1800. For municipal purposes the legislature has from time to
                    time established corporate governments in different parts of the suburbs, so
                    that Philadelphia is now divided into several districts. The municipal
                    government of the city proper is vested in a mayor, a recorder, fifteen
                    aldermen, and a select and common council, besides subordinate executive
                    officers. The recorder and aldermen are appointed by the governor of the state;
                    and the mayor is chosen by the councils, from the body of the citizens. The
                    members of the select and common council are annually elected by the people.
                    They receive no compensation, sit in separate chambers, and each body has a
                    negative on the legislative acts of the other. The city proper sends seven
                    representatives and two senators to the state legislature. The population of
                    Philadelphia, according to the census of 1810, was 96,664, in 1820 it was
                    119,325, in 1830 it was 167,811, and at present (1838) it is estimated at about
                    2Q0,000 souls.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Philadelphia,</hi> the name of an ancient town of
                    Turkey, in Asia Minor, or Natolia, founded by Attalus Philadelphus, brother of
                    Eumenes. In the year 1097 it was taken by John Ducas, the Greek general; and, in
                    the year 1106, it was, without difficulty, reduced by the same individual. The
                    Turks marched from the East with a design to plunder this and the maritime
                    towns; and, in 1175, the Emperor Manuel retired thither for protection against
                    these invaders. In 1300, it fell by lot to Karaman. In 1306, it was besieged by
                    Alifaras, and considerably harassed, but not taken. In 1391, Philadelphia alone
                    refused to admit Bajazet; but it was at length forced to capitulate, from want
                    of provisions. It has been matter of surprise that this town was not totally
                    abandoned; and yet it has survived many cities less liable to inconveniences,
                    and is still an extensive place, though in its appearance it is poor and mean.
                    Some remnants of its walls are still standing.</p>

                    obscure and inconsiderable society of mystics. They were formed about the end of
                    the seventeenth century by an English female fanatic, whose name was Jane
                    Leadley. This woman seduced, by her visions, predictions, and doctrines, several
                    disciples, amongst whom were some persons of learning. She believed that all
                    dissensions amongst Christians would cease, and that the kingdom of the Redeemer
                    would become a scene of charity and felicity, if Christians, disregarding the
                    forms of doctrine or discipline in their several communions, would all join in
                    committing their souls to the care of the internal guide, to be instructed,
                    governed, and formed by his divine impulse and suggestions. She even went
                    farther than this, pretending a divine commission to proclaim the approach of
                    the communion of saints; and declaring that the society established by herself
                    was the true kingdom of Christ. One of her leading doctrines was that of the
                    final restoration of all intelligent beings to perfection and happiness.</p>
