                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PHOCION</label>, a very celebrated Athenian general,
                    was descended from a family which at no time had been particularly distinguished
                    in the political transactions of their country. He was born <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b. c.</hi> 402, and died <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 317, at the age of
                    eighty-five. His early years were spent under the direction of Plato and
                    Xenocrates, and his subsequent career showed that he had profited by their
                    instruction. His aspect was forbidding, though his disposition was mild and
                    gentle. It was remarked, that he was never seen to laugh or to weep. He
                    commenced his military career under Chabrias, and gained so much influence with
                    that general that he directed many of his proceedings. The victory at Naxos, B.
                    c. 376, was in a great measure due to his prudence and military talents; nor was
                    he less distinguished as a statesman and orator. He was quick in perception, and
                    ready in debate, so that Demosthenes feared him more than any other orator, and
                    is said to have called him the <hi rend="italic">Hatchet.</hi> Phocion was aware
                    of the true position of his country, knowing that she could no longer maintain
                    that predominating influence which she had possessed during the last century.
                    Peace was therefore the true policy of Athens, and he at all times advocated
                    such a course of conduct. Yet, though his sense of the true interests of his
                    country led him to be the promoter of peace, he was at all times ready to assist
                    with his military talents. He commanded in the expedition, B. c. 350, against
                    Euboea, and gained the battle of Jamynae. When Philip king of Macedonia laid
                    siege to Byzantium, and the cities along the coast, Phocion relieved these
                    cities from all danger, and compelled Philip to retire. At the head of his army
                    he endured all the fatigues of the lowest of his soldiers; and when he appeared
                    more warmly dressed than usual, the soldiers used to consider it the sign of a
                    severe winter. He was a man of the strictest integrity; and, at a time when few
                    of the orators and statesmen of Athens were able to resist the temptation of
