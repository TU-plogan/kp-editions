                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PHILOMELA</label>, in fabulous history, was the
                    daughter of Pandion king of Athens, and the sister of Procne, who had married
                    Tereus king of Thrace. Procne separated from Philomela, to whom she was much
                    attached, and spent her time in great melancholy, until she prevailed upon lier
                    husband to go to Athens and bring her sister to Thrace. Tereus obeyed; but he
                    had no sooner obtained Pandion’s permission to conduct Philomela to Thrace, than
                    he fell in love with her, and resolved to gratify his passion. He dismissed the
                    guards whom the suspicions of Pandion had appointed to watch him; offered
                    violence to Philomela; and afterwards cut out her tongue, that she might not
                    disclose the indignities she had suffered from his barbarity. He confined her in
                    a lonely castle; and having taken every precaution to prevent a discovery, he
                    returned to Thrace, and told Procne that Philomela had died by the way, and that
                    he had paid the last offices to her remains. At this sad intelligence Procnc put
                    on mourning for the loss of Philomela; but a year had scarcely elapsed before
                    she was secretly informed that her sister was not dead. Philomela, in her
                    captivity, described on a piece of tapestry her misfortunes and the brutality of
                    Tereus, and privately conveyed it to Procne. The latter was about to celebrate
                    the orgies of Bacchus when she received it, but she disguised her resentment;
                    and as during these festivals she was permitted to rove about the country, she
                    hastened to deliver her sister Philomela from her confinement, and concerted
                    with the latter the best measures for punishing the cruelty of Tcrcus. She
                    murdered her son Itylus, then in the sixth year of his age, and served him up as
                    food to her husband during the festival. Tereus, in the midst of his repast,
                    called for Itylus; but Procne immediately informed him that he was then feasting
                    on his flesh, when Philomela, by throwing upon the table the head of Itylus,
                    convinced the monarch of the cruelty of the scene. He drew his sword to punish
                    Procne and Philomela; but whilst about to stab them to the heart, he was changed
                    into a hoopoe, Philomela into a nightingale, Procne into a swallow, and Itylus
                    into a pheasant. This tragedy happened at Daulis, in Phocis; but Pausanias and
                    Strabo, who mention the whole of the story, are silent respecting the
                    transformation; and the former observes, that Tereus, after this bloody repast,
                    fled to Megara, where he laid violent hands on himself. The inhabitants of the
                    place raised a monument to his memory, where they offered yearly sacrifices, and
                    placed thereon small pebbles instead of barley. It was on this monument that the
                    birds called hoopoes were first seen, and hence the fable of his metamorphosis.
                    Procne and Philomela died of excessive grief and melancholy; and as the voice of
                    the nightingale and the swallow is peculiarly plaintive and mournful, the poets
                    have embellished the fable by supposing that the two unfortunate sisters were
                    changed into these birds.</p>
