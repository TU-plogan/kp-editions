                    the second Protestant archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Norwich in the year
                    1504, the 19th of Henry VII. His father, who was a man in trade, died when his
                    son was about twelve years of age; but his mother took especial care of his
                    education, and at the age of seventeen sent him to Corpus Christi College,
                    Cambridge, where, in 1523, he took his bachelor’s degree. In 1527 he was
                    ordained, created master of arts, and chosen fellow of the college. Having
                    obtained a license to preach, he frequently discoursed at St Paul’s cross in
                    London, and in other parts of the kingdom. In the year 1533 or 1534, he was made
                    chaplain to Anne Boleyn, who obtained for him the deanery of Stoke Clare in
                    Suffolk, where he founded a grammar-school. After the death of this unfortunate
                    woman, Henry made him his own chaplain, and in 1541 appointed him prebendary of
                    Ely. In 1544, he was, by the king’s command, elected master of Corpus Christi
                    College, and the following year appointed vice chancellor of the university. In
                    1547 he lost the deanery of Stoke, by the dissolution of that college. In the
                    same year he married the daughter of Mr Robert Harlestone, a Norfolk
                    gentleman.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1552 he was nominated by Edward VI. to the deanery of
                    Lincoln, which, with his other preferments, enabled him to live in great
                    affluence. But Mary had scarcely succeeded to the throne when he was deprived of
                    every office he held in the church, and obliged to live in obscurity, frequently
                    changing his place of abode to avoid the fate of the other reformers.</p>
                <p part="N">Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1558; and in the following year Parker
                    was at once raised from indigence and obscurity to the see of Canterbury, an
                    honour which he had neither solicited nor desired. In this high station he acted
                    with equal spirit and propriety. He founded several scholarships in Bennet or
                    Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and made large presents of plate to that and
                    to other colleges in this university. He gave a hundred volumes to the public
                    library; and, besides, founded a free school at Rochdale in Lancashire. He took
                    care to have the different sees filled with pious and learned men; and,
                    considering the great want of Bibles in many places, he, with the assistance of
                    other learned men, improved the English translation, which he caused to be
                    printed on large paper, and dispersed throughout the kingdom. This estimable
                    prelate died in the year 1575, aged seventy-two, and was buried in his own
                    chapel at Lambeth. He was pious without affectation or austerity, cheerful and
                    contented in the midst of adversity, moderate in the height of power, and
                    beneficent beyond example. He was the author of several works, and likewise
                    published four of our best historians; Matthew of Westminster, Matthew Paris,
                    Asset’s Life of King Alfred, and Thomas</p>
                <p part="N">Walsingham. The archbishop also translated the Psalter. This version was
                    printed, but without a name, and has been attributed to an obscure poet of the
                    name of Keeper. Such, at least, was Wood’s opinion, although it is more than
                    probable that he was wrong. But in the Gentleman’s Magazine for 1781 (p. 566),
                    Parker is proved to be the author of a version of the Psalms.</p>
