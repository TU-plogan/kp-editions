                        Guinea</hi></label>, a very large island, or, as some suppose, a cluster of
                    islands, the coast having never been explored, and extending from the south end
                    of Gilolo and the north coast of Ceram, in a south-west direction, about 1200
                    miles. It is indented by very deep bays, so that it resembles a chain of
                    peninsulas; and it is because none of these inlets have been explored that it is
                    uncertain whether it be all one island or a chain of islands. It is separated
                    from the neighbouring island of New Holland by a narrow strait, discovered by
                    Captain Flinders, in the Investigator. Viewed from the shore, Papua rises
                    gradually into hills of considerable elevation; but there are no mountains of
                    any great altitude. The country produces palm trees, and timber of a large size;
                    the cocoa-nut, and the two species of the bread-fruit tree; also pine-apples and
                    plantains, nutmeg trees in a wild state, and spice. The woods abound with wild
                    hogs, which are hunted and killed by the natives with spears,and bows and
                    arrows. The indigenous inhabitants of the interior practise gardening, and some
                    sort of agriculture, and supply the inhabitants on the coast with food, in
                    exchange for axes, knives, and other sorts of coarse cutlery. The Malays and
                    Chinese chiefly carry on this traffic, supplying the natives also with blue and
                    red cloths, and carrying back in return bark, slaves, ambergris, sea-slug,
                    tortoise-shell, small pearls, and black and red loories, birds of paradise, and
                    other birds, stuffed, in which art the Papuans are very dexterous. The island
                    has chiefly been seen by navigators from the sea. Captain Forrest, who landed on
                    the north-west coast, observed the structure of the Papuan dwellings, which was
                    extremely singular, being built upon posts fixed several yards below the
                    watermark, and a long stage supported by posts communicating with the land just
                    at high-water mark. The tenement contains many families, who live in cabins on
                    each side of a common hall that runs through the middle of it, and has two
                    doors, one opening to the land and the other to the water, for the purpose of
                    facilitating the escape of the inmates when they are attacked by their enemies.
                    The greater part of the inhabitants continue in their original state of
                    barbarity and nakedness, devoid of any fixed homes, and subsisting on the
                    precarious produce of the chase or of the forests. They are engaged in continual
                    wars with their neighbours; and about April and March they assemble in great
                    numbers, and make war on Gilolo, Ceram, Amboyna, and Ambloo. The British have
                    had as yet but little intercourse with these savages; and their ferocious habits
                    do not encourage any very close alliance. In 1791 they contrived to decoy the
                    surgeon of the Panther, a Bombay cruiser, into their boats, where he was
                    murdered; after which they had the audacity to make an attempt on the ship,
                    discharging on it a shower of arrows, and wounding several of the crew. They
                    were, however, soon dispersed by a discharge frotn the guns and small arms.</p>
