                    son of Jona (Matt. xvi. 17). Along with his brother Andrew, he followed the
                    occupation of a fisherman on the Sea of Galilee. It is probable that before they
                    became known to Christ they were both disciples of John the Baptist. That Andrew
                    was so, we are expressly informed by the evangelist John; and as his brother
                    seems to have been much of the same mind with him on religious matters, it is
                    extremely likely that he was so likewise. Their becoming known to Christ was
                    owing to John’s pointing him out on the day after his baptism to Andrew and
                    another disciple (probably the evangelist John), as “the Lamb of God,” on which
                    they immediately followed Christ, and spent some time in receiving his
                    instructions. Shortly after this, Andrew finding Simon, carried him to Christ,
                    who, on receiving him as his disciple, bestowed upon him that surname by which
                    he has since that time been most commonly designated: “When Jesus beheld him he
                    said, thou art Simon the son of Jona; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by
                    interpretation a stone <hi rend="italic">(yeετy&gt;ς)l</hi> ’ After this
                    interview the two brothers seem to have returned to their usual occupation for a
                    season, as we have an account in Matthew (iv. 18-20), of their being summoned
                    from that occupation by Christ on a subsequent occasion, posterior to his
                    temptation in the wilderness, and to the commencement of his public ministry as
                    a religious teacher. From this time forward they were his devoted and admiring
                    followers. In the course of the evangelical history several anecdotes of Peter
                    are incidentally recorded, for the purpose, doubtless, principally of
                    illustrating the character and teaching of our Lord, but which tend also to
                    throw light upon the history and character of his attached disciple. Such are
                    the accounts furnished by the evangelists of his walking upon the agitated
                    waters of the Sea of Galilee to meet his master (Matthew, xiv. 22, ff.; Mark,
                    vi. 45, ff.); of his bold and intelligent avowals of the undoubted Messiah-ship
                    of Jesus, notwithstanding the difficulties which he, along with the rest <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> the disciples, felt in reconciling what they saw in
                    him with what they had fondly expected the Christ to be (Matthew, xvi. 13-20);
                    of his rash but affectionate rebuke of his Lord for speaking of suffering and
                    death as in prospect for him, and as forming a necessary part of his mediatorial
                    work (Matthew, xvi. 21-23); of his conduct in first rejecting, with an
                    earnestness bordering on horror, the offer of Christ to wash his feet, and then,
                    when the symbolical nature of that act had been explained to him, his
                    over-ardent zeal that not his feet only, but also his hands and his head, might
                    be washed (John, xiii. 4, ff.); of his bold and somewhat vaunting avowal of
                    attachment to his Master, and his determination never to forsake him, followed
                    by his disgraceful denial of Jesus in the hour of trial (John, xiii. 36, 37;
                    Mark, xiv. 29, &amp;c.); of his deep and poignant contrition for this sin
                    (Matthew, xiv. 72); and of his Lord’s ample forgiveness of his offence, after he
                    had received from him a profession of attachment as strong and as frequently
                    repeated as his former denial of him (John, xxi. 15-18). From these notices it
                    is easy to gather a tolerably correct conception of the predominating features
                    of the apostle’s character up to this period. He seems to have been a man of
                    undoubted piety, of ardent attachment to his Master, and of great zeal for what
                    he deemed his Master’s honour, but at the same time with a mind rather quick
                    than accurate in its apprehensions, and with feelings rather hasty in their
                    impulse than determined and continuous in their exercise. Hence his readiness in
                    avowing his opinions, and his rashness in forming them; and hence also the
                    tendency which beset his honest openness to degenerate into bravado, and his
                    determinations of valour to evaporate into cowardice at appalling forms of
                    danger. His fall, however, and his subsequent restoration, connected as these
                    were with the mysterious events of his Master’s crucifixion and resurrection,
                    and with the new light which had by them been cast around his character and
                    work, produced a powerful change for the better upon the apostle’s mind. From
                    this time forward he comes before us under a new aspect. A sober dignity and
                    firmness of purpose have displaced his former hasty zeal; sagacity and prudence
                    characterize his conduct; and whilst his love to his Master shows no symptom of
                    abatement, it displays itself rather in active labour and much-enduring patience
                    in his service, than in loud protestations or extravagant exhibitions of
                    attachment. In the subsequent Scripture history he is presented to us as the
                    courageous herald of the kingdom of Christ, by whose mouth the first public
                    declaration of salvation through the crucified Jesus was made to the people; by
                    whose advice and counsel the early churches were planted and governed; and by
                    whom the prejudices of Judaism were first fairly surmounted, and the gospel
                    preached in all its universal freeness to the Gentile world.</p>

                <p part="N">The Acts of the Apostles contain recitals of many interesting incidents
                    which befell him whilst engaged in those efforts. Of these, the chief are his
                    imprisonment and trial before the Sanhedrim, for preaching Christ, and his bold
                    avowal of his determination to persist in that work (Acts, iv. 1-22); his
                    miraculously inflicting the punishment of death on the infatuated couple who had
                    dared to try an experiment upon the omniscience of the Holy Ghost (v. 1-11); his
                    visit to Samaria, and rebuke of Simon Magus, who deemed that the miracles of the
                    apostle were the work of some deep magic spell of which he had not yet become
                    possessed, and which consequently he was desirous of purchasing from Peter
                    (viii. 14-24); the vision by which he was taught that the ancient ritual
                    distinctions between clean and unclean had been abolished, and thereby prepared
                    to attend on the summons of Cornelius, to whom he preached the gospel (x. 1-48);
                    his apprehension by Herod Agrippa, and his deliverance by the interposition of
                    an angel, who opened for him the doors of his prison, and set him free (xii.
                    3-19); and his address to the council at Jerusalem, on the occasion of a request
                    for advice and direction being sent to the church there by the church in
                    Antioch, in which he advocated the exemption of Gentile converts from the
                    ceremonial institutes of the law of Moses (xv. 6-11). In all these incidents we
                    trace the evidences of his mind having undergone an entire change, both as to
                    its views of truth jmd impressions of duty, from what is displayed by the
                    earlier events of his history. On one occasion only do we detect something of
                    his former weakness, and that strangely enough in regard to a matter in which he
                    had been the first of the apostles to perceive, and the first to recommend and
                    follow, a correct course of procedure. The occasion referred to was his
                    withdrawing, through dread of the censures of his Jewish brethren, from the
                    Gentiles at Antioch, after having lived in free and friendly intercourse with
                    them, and his timidly dissembling his convictions as to the religious equality
                    of Jew and Gentile. For this Paul withstood him to the face, and rebuked him
                    sharply, because of the injury which his conduct was calculated to produce to
                    the cause of Christianity. With this single exception, however, his conduct
                    seems to have been in full accordance with the name which his Master had
                    prophetically bestowed on him when he called him Simon the Rock, and with the
                    position which Paul himself assigns to him, at the very time that he recounts
                    his temporary dereliction, as one of the “Pillars of the Church.”<note

                            The circumstance of Peter’s having submitted to a rebuke from Paul is so
                            fatal to the pretensions which have been urged in favour of his
                            supremacy over the other apostles, that from a very early age attempts
                            have been made to set aside its force, by the hypothesis that it is not
                            of Peter the apostle, but of another person of the same name, that Paul
                            speaks in the passage referred to; Conf. Euseb. H. E. i. 13. This
                            hypothesis, however, is so plainly contradicted by the words of Paul,
                            who explicitly ascribes apostleship to the Peter of whom he writes, that
                            it is astonishing how it could have been admitted even by the most
                            blinded zealot. See ver. 8, 9.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">Thus far we are enabled, from the inspired documents, to trace the
                    history of this apostle; but for what remains we must be indebted to evidence of
                    a less explicit and certain character. The testimony of several of the
                    ecclesiastical writers, corroborated by the phraseology employed by the apostle
                    himself in the salutation of his first epistle, makes it highly probable that at
                    some period of his official life he performed an extensive missionary tour
                    throughout those districts, to the converts in which his epistles were
                    addressed. “It appears,” says Origen, “that Peter preached to the Jews in the
                    dispersion, in Pontus, Galatia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, and Asia.”<note

                    certain tradition reports the apostle as having towards the close of his life
                    visited Rome, become bishop of the church in that city, and suffered martyrdom
                    in the persecution raised against the Christians by Nero. The importance of
                    these points in connection with the claims urged by the Catholics on behalf of
                    the supremacy of the pope, has led to a careful and sifting examination of the
                    accuracy of this tradition; the result of which seems to be, that whilst it is
                    admitted as certain that Peter suffered martyrdom, in all probability by
                        crucifixion,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    and as probable that this took place at Rome, it has, nevertheless, been made
                    pretty clear that he never was for any length of time resident in that city, and
                    morally certain that he never was bishop of the church there.<note

                    attempt has been made to obtain the support of the apostle’s own testimony in
                    favour of his having at one period resided at Rome, by interpreting the words,
                    “the church that is at <hi rend="italic">Babylon”</hi> the salutations of which
                    he sends to those to whom he wrote his first epistle, as applying to the church
                    at <hi rend="italic">Pome</hi>; an attempt which Dr Campbell justly stigmatizes
                    as “poor, not to call it ridiculous.” Even if we admit that at the time when
                    this epistle was written it was understood amongst the Christians that Babylon
                    was the prophetical name for Rome, an admission, however, which is entirely
                    unsupported by evidence, it would remain unexplained why the apostle, in such a
                    mere matter-of-fact affair as the communication of the friendly salutations of
                    one church to another, should have employed the obscure and symbolical language
                    of prophecy, when his meaning could have been so much more distinctly conveyed
                    by a simple statement. This would be the more inexplicable, that the style of
                    Peter is remarkably plain and perspicuous throughout the entire epistle. It
                    seems much more consistent, therefore, with rational principles of
                    interpretation, to understand the statement literally of Babylon in Egypt, in
                    which city, as we leam from Josephus, there was a great multitude of Jews <hi
                        rend="italic">{εν⅛α και trλη∂ος ην loυδαιuν, Ant. Jud.</hi> l.xv. c. ii.
                    sect. 2; see also c. iii. sect. 1), and to which, consequently, it is almost
                    certain, that at some period of his life, “the apostle of the circumcision”
                    (Gal. ii. 8) must have paid a visit.</p>
                <p part="N">The assertion that St Peter was bishop of Rome is connected with another
                    by which the claims of the papacy are sought to be established, namely, that to
                    him was conceded a right of supremacy over the other apostles. In support of
                    this, an appeal is made to those passages in the gospels, where declarations
                    supposed to imply the bestowal of peculiar honour and distinction on Peter are
                    recorded as having been addressed to him by our Lord. The most important of
                    these are, “Thou art Peter, and on this rock will I build my church” (Matt. xvi.
                    18); and, “Unto thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of heaven,” &amp;c.
                    (Matt, xvi. 19). At first sight these passages would seem to bear out the
                    assumption founded on them; but upon a more careful investigation it will be
                    seen that this is rather in appearance than in reality. The force of both is
                    greatly impaired for the purpose for which Catholics produce them, by the
                    circumstance, that whatever of power or authority they may be supposed to confer
                    upon Peter, must be regarded as shared by him with the other apostles, inasmuch
                    as to them also are ascribed in other passages the same qualities and powers
                    which are promised to Peter in those under consideration. If by the former of
                    these passages we are to understand that the church is built upon Peter, the
                    Apostle Paul informs us that it is not in him <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> that
                    it is built, but upon <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the apostles (Ephes, ii. 20);
                    and in the book of Revelation we are told, that on the twelve foundations of the
                    New Jerusalem (the Christian church), are inscribed <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193495143?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5143-0312"/>“the names

                        superscript"> n</hi> (ch. xxi. 14). As for the declaration in the latter of
                    these passages, it was in all its essential parts repeated by our Lord to the
                    other disciples immediately before his passion, as announcing a privilege which,
                    as his apostles, they were to possess in common (Matt, xviii. 18; John, xx. 23).
                    It is, moreover, uncertain in what sense our Lord used the language in question.
                    In both cases his words are metaphorical; and nothing can be more unsafe than to
                    build a theological dogma upon language of which the meaning is not clear, and
                    to which, from the earliest ages, different interpretations have been affixed.
                    And, finally, even granting the correctness of that interpretation which
                    Catholics put upon these verses, it will not bear out the conclusion they would
                    deduce from them, inasmuch as the judicial supremacy of Peter over the other
                    apostles does not necessarily follow from his possessing authority over the
                    church. On the other side it is certain, that there is no instance on record of
                    the apostle’s having ever claimed or exercised this supposed power; but, on the
                    contrary, he is oftener than once represented as submitting to an exercise of
                    power upon the part of others, as when, for instance, he went forth as a
                    messenger from the apostles assembled in Jerusalem to the Christians in Samaria
                    (Acts, viii. 14), and when he received a rebuke from St Paul, as already
                    noticed. Whilst, however, it is pretty well established that Peter enjoyed no
                    judicial supremacy over the other apostles, it would, perhaps, be going too far
                    to affirm that no dignity or primacy whatsoever was conceded to him on the part
                    of his brethren. His superiority in point of age, his distinguished personal
                    excellence, his reputation and success as a teacher of Christianity, and the
                    prominent part which he had ever taken in his Master’s affairs, both before his
                    death and after his ascension, furnished sufficient grounds for his being raised
                    to a position of respect and of moral influence in the church and amongst his
                    brother apostles. To this some countenance is given by the circumstances that he
                    is called “the first,” <hi rend="smallcaps">hjŭi-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >roς,</hi> by Matthew (ch. x. 2), and that apparently not merely as a
                    numerical, but as an honorary distinction; that when the apostles are mentioned
                    as a body, it is frequently by the phrase, “Peter and the eleven,” or, “Peter
                    and the rest of the apostles,” or something similar; and that when Paul went up
                    to Jerusalem by divine revelation, it was to Peter particularly that the visit
                    was paid. These circumstances, taken in connection with the prevalent voice of
                    Christian antiquity, would seem to authorize the opinion that Peter occupied
                    some such position as that of <hi rend="italic">ιrgoεσ-τuς, or</hi> president in
                    the apostolical college, but without any power or authority of a personal kind
                    over his brother apostles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    and analogies of style between the two epistles, which are seldom drawn with

                    were addressed were converted Jews scattered over the districts enumerated by
                    the apostle in the commencement of the first of them. The epistles themselves
                    are characterized by great vigour of conception, warmth of feeling, and force of
                    eloquence. The style is glowing and rapid, approaching at times to vehemence;
                    and the sentiments are of the most elevated description. The exhortation to
                    holiness with which the second chapter of the first epistle concludes, is
                    perhaps unequalled in the New Testament for the appropriateness of its
                    sentiments, the beauty of its appeals, and the concentred energy and rapid flow
                    of the style; nor would it be easy to find any passage, either in sacred or
                    profane literature, that should surpass in vividness of description and power of
                    expression the prophetic view of the end of the world with which, towards the
                    conclusion of the second epistle, he enforces his exhortation to holy
                    conversation and godliness. In both epistles we trace the characteristic ardour
                    and the elevated piety of their author, and of both we may justly say, in the
                    language of the excellent Leighton, that they are eminently adapted “to
                    establish Christians in believing, to direct them in doing, and to comfort them
                    in suffering, often setting before them the matchless example of the Lord Jesus,
                    and the greatness of their engagement to follow him.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(n.

                        Blois,</hi> a learned man of the twelfth century, was born about the year
                    1120, at the city of Blois, in France, from which he derived his name. His
                    parents being opulent, gave him a learned education. In his youth, when he
                    studied in the university of Paris, he was excessively fond of poetry; and when
                    he had advanced a little further in life, he became no less fond of rhetoric, to
                    the study of which he applied with the greatest ardour. From Paris he removed to
                    Bologna in Italy, to study the civil and the canon law, in the knowledge of
                    which he very much excelled. From his writings it appears that he cultivated
                    medicine, and several branches of the mathematics, with no little care and
                    success. But the study of theology formed the chief delight and business of his
                    life, and in it he not only spent the greatest part of his time, but made the
                    greatest progress. Unfortunately, however, the theology he studied was of that
                    scholastic kind, which consisted in vain attempts to explain and prove the many
                    absurd opinions which then prevailed, by the subtilties of the Aristotelian
                    logic. In attempting to explain the doctrine of the real presence, as held by
                    the Latin church, he was the first who employed the famous term <hi
                        rend="italic">transubstantiation,</hi> which was soon afterwards adopted by
                    the church, and has ever since been retained. Being appointed preceptor to
                    William II. king of Sicily, in 1167, he obtained the custody of the privy seal;
                    and, next to the Archbishop of Palermo, who was the prime minister, he had the
                    greatest influence in all affairs. His power, however, was not of long duration;
                    for the archbishop being banished in 1168, Peter soon afterwards left the court
                    of Sicily, and returned into France. But in a short time he found another royal
                    patron, having been invited into England by Henry II. who employed him as his
                    private secretary, made him Archdeacon of Bath, and gave him some other
                    benefices. Having spent a few years at court, however, he conceived a disgust at
                    that way of life, of which in one of his letters he has drawn a very unpleasing
                    picture, and retired into the family of Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, who
                    had made him his chancellor about the year 1176. In this station he continued
                    until the death of the archbishop in 1183, enjoying the highest degree of favour
                    with that prelate, though he used much freedom in reproving him for his
                    remissness in the government of the church. He continued in the same station in
                    the family of Archbishop Baldwin, who succeeded Richard, acting both as his
                    secretary and as his chancellor. In 1187, he was also sent by the latter prelate
                    upon an embassy to Rome, to plead his cause before Urban III. in the famous
                    controversy between him and the monks of Canterbury respecting the church of
                    Hackington. After the departure of his friend and patron Baldwin for the Holy
                    Land in the year 1190, our author was in his old age involved in various
                    troubles, the causes <pb break="no" facs="nls:193495156?mode=fullsize"

                    about the end of the twelfth century. He appears from his works, which may be
                    justly reckoned amongst the most valuable monuments of the age in which he
                    flourished, to have been a man of great integrity and sincere piety, as well as
                    of a lively, inventive genius, and uncommon erudition. His printed works consist
                    of a hundred and thirty-four letters, which he collected together at the desire
                    of Henry II.; of sixty-five sermons, delivered on various occasions; and of
                    seventeen tracts on different subjects.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi> I, czar or tsar, and afterwards emperor,
                    of Russia, was the founder of the Russian empire. That country was indeed well
                    known, and of great antiquity; but it had no extent of power, of political
                    influence, or of general commerce in Europe, until the time of Peter. He was
                    born in 1672, and proclaimed czar when only ten years of age, in exclusion of
                    John his eldest brother, who, being of a sickly constitution, was at the same
                    time equally deficient in understanding. The Princess Sophia, his sister by the
                    half-blood, raised an insurrection in favour of John; but, to put an end to the
                    civil war, it was at last agreed that the two brothers should jointly share the
                    imperial dignity. Peter had been very ill brought up, not only through the
                    general defects of education in Russia, but likewise through the arts of the
                    Princess Sophia, who surrounded him with every thing calculated to stifle his
                    natural desire of knowledge and to deprave his mind. But notwithstanding this,
                    his inclination for military exercises discovered itself in his tenderest years.
                    He formed a company of fifty men, commanded by foreign officers, and clothed and
                    exercised after the German manner. He himself entered into the lowest post, that
                    of a drummer, and never rose otherwise than as a soldier of fortune. His design
                    in this was to teach his nobility, that merit, and not birth, formed the only
                    solid title to military employments. He reinforced his company with several
                    others, until at last he had got together a considerable body of soldiers. As he
                    had then no war on his hands, he exercised them in all sorts of mock
                    engagements, and by this means secured to himself a body of well-disciplined
                    troops. The sight of a Dutch vessel, which he had met with upon a lake belonging
                    to one of his pleasure-houses, made such an impression on his mind, that he
                    conceived the almost impracticable design of forming a navy. His first care was
                    to get some Hollanders to build small vessels at Moscow; and he passed two
                    successive summers on board of English or Dutch ships, which sailed out from
                    Archangel, that he might instruct himself in every branch of nautical affairs.
                    In the year 1696, the Czar John died, and Peter now became sole master of the
                    empire. In 1698 he sent an embassy to Holland, and having gone <hi rend="italic"
                        >incognito</hi> in the retinue, he visited England as well as Holland, to
                    inform himself fully respecting the art of ship-building. At Amsterdam he worked
                    in the yard as a private ship-carpenter, under the name of Peter Michaelof; but
                    he has been often heard to say, that if he had never gone to England, he would
                    still have remained ignorant of the art of ship-building. In 1700 he had got
                    together a body of regular troops, amounting to thirty thousand infantry; and
                    now the vast project he had formed displayed itself in all its parts. He opened
                    his dominions, which till then had been closed, having first sent the principal
                    nobility of his empire into foreign countries to improve themselves in knowledge
                    and in learning. He invited to Russia all the foreigners he could meet with, who
                    were capable of instructing his subjects in any respect, and offered them great
                    encouragement to settle in his dominions. This raised many discontents; and the
                    despotical authority which he exerted on all such occasions was scarcely
                    sufficient to suppress them. In 1700, being strengthened by the alliance of
                    Augustus king of Poland, he made war on Charles XII. king of Sweden.</p>
                <p part="N">His ill success at first did not discourage him; for he used to say, “I
                    know that my armies must be overcome for a great while; but even this will at
                    last teach them to conquer.” He afterwards gained considerable advantages, and
                    founded St Petersburg in 1703. In 1709 he gained a complete victory over the
                    Swedes at Pultowa. In 1712 he was surrounded by the Tuιks on the banks of the
                    Pruth, and seemed inevitably lost, had not the Czarina Catherine bribed the
                    grand vizier, and the czar’s prudence completed his deliverance. In 1716 he made
                    a tour through Germany and Holland, and visited the Royal Academy of Sciences at
                    Paris. It would be endless to enumerate all the various establishments for which
                    the Russians are indebted to him. He formed an army according to the tactics of
                    the most experienced nations; he fitted out fleets in all the four seas which
                    border upon Russia; he caused many strong fortresses to be raised according to
                    the best plans, and made convenient harbours; he introduced arts and sciences
                    into his dominions, and freed religion from many superstitious abuses; he made
                    laws, built cities, cut canals, and executed many other works; he was generous
                    in rewarding, and impartial in punishing; faithful, laborious, and humble, yet
                    not free from a certain roughness of temper natural to his countrymen. He had
                    indeed cured himself of excess in drinking; but he has been branded with several
                    other vices, particularly cruelty. He published the unfortunate history of his
                    son Prince Alexis, towards λvhom some blame his severity, whilst others think it
                    no greater than was absolutely necessary. He perlect-ly knew the respect due to
                    persons of merit; and not only heaped honours upon them during their life, but
                    paid to their memory marks of esteem after their death. He died of the strangury
                    in 1725, and is said to have left the world with the magnanimity of a hero and
                    the piety of a Christian.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi><hi rend="italic">the Wild Boy-</hi> This
                    extraordinary creature at one time occasioned a great deal of speculation
                    amongst the learned; but we do not know that any satisfactory causes have been
                    assigned for the striking difference observed between him and other human
                    beings.</p>
                <p part="N">The following account of him is extracted from the parish register of
                    North Church, in the county of Hertford. “Peter, commonly known by the name of
                        <hi rend="italic">Peter the Wild Boy,</hi> lies buried in this church-yard,
                    opposite to the porch. In the year 1725 he was found in the woods near Hamelen,
                    a fortified town in the electorate of Hanover, when his majesty George I. with
                    his attendants, was hunting in the forest of Hertswold. He was supposed to be
                    then about twelve years of age, and had subsisted in those woods upon the bark
                    of trees, leaves, berries, &amp;c. for some considerable length of time. How
                    long he had continued in that wild state is altogether uncertain; but that he
                    had formerly been under the care of some person, was evident from the remains of
                    a shirt collar about his neck at the time when he was found. As Hamelen was a
                    town where criminals were confined to work upon the fortifications, it was then
                    conjectured at Hanover that Peter might be the issue of one of those criminals,
                    who had either wandered into the woods and could not find his way back again,
                    or, being discovered to be an idiot, was inhumanly turned out by his parents,
                    and left to perish, or shift for himself. In the following year, 1726, he was
                    brought over to England, by the order of Queen Caroline, then Princess of Wales,
                    and put under the care of Dr Arbuthnot, with proper masters to attend him. But
                    notwithstanding there appeared to be no natural defect in his organs of speech,
                    after all the pains that had been taken with him he could never be brought
                    distinctly to articulate a single syllable, and proved totally incapable of
                    receiving any instruction. He was afterwards intrusted to the care of Mrs
                    Titchbourn, one of the queen’s bedchamber <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193495169?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5169-0314"/>women, with
                    a handsome pension annexed to the charge. Mrs Titchbourn usually spending a few
                    weeks every summer at the house of Mr James Fenn, a yeoman farmer at Axter’s
                    End, in this parish, Peter was left to the care of the said Mr Fenn, who was
                    allowed thirty-five pounds a year for his support and maintenance. After the
                    death of James Fenn he was transferred to the care of his brother Thomas Fenn,
                    at another farm-house in this parish, called Broadway, where he lived with the
                    several successive tenants of that farm, and with the same provision allowed by
                    government, to the time of his death, 22d of February 1785, when he was supposed
                    to be about seventy-two years of age.”</p>

                    at the festival of St Peter. Ina the Saxon king, when he went in pilgrimage to
                    Rome about the year 740, paid this contribution to the pope, partly as alms and
                    partly in recompense of a house erected in Rome for English pilgrims; and the
                    same continued to be paid generally until the time of Henry VIII., when it was
                    enacted, that henceforth no person should pay any pensions, Peter’s pence, or
                    other impositions, for the use of the bishop or see of Rome.</p>
