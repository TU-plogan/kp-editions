                    beautiful counties in Scotland, being very compact and almost circular in form,
                    is situated nearly in the centre of the kingdom. Its extreme length from east to
                    west is about seventy-seven miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south
                    is about sixty-eight miles. Its area has been variously estimated; but the
                    nearest approximation to accuracy gives 2588 square miles of land and more than
                    fifty of water. Of the 1,656,320 acres forming its superficial contents, from
                    500,000 to 600,000 are, according to the most recent statements, under
                    cultivation; as many more are still uncultivated, though capable in part of
                    tillage; and the remainder is almost wholly barren and unproductive. On the east
                    Perthshire is bounded by the counties of Forfar, Fife, and Kinross; on the
                    north, by Inverness and Aberdeen; on the south, by Stirling and Clackmannan; and
                    on the west, by the shires of Argyle and Dumbarton. Its ancient and still
                    popularly known divisions are Monteith, Athole, Stratheam, Breadalbane, Rannoch,
                    Stormont, Perth proper, and Gowrie, to which some add Bal-quhidder and
                    Glenorchy. It is under the jurisdiction of a sheriff and two substitutes, one of
                    whom resides at Perth, and the other at Dumblane. There are within its
                    boundaries seventy-eight parishes, or portions of parishes, some of them running
                    into other adjacent counties.</p>
                <p part="N">Perthshire is distinguished amongst the counties of Scotland for the
                    rich, varied, and picturesque beauty of its surface. From the commanding range
                    of the Grampians, and numerous other secondary elevations, the country slopes
                    gently down into extensive tracts of rich and fertile land, •beautifully
                    diversified, and adorned with wood and water, hill and dale, in every possible
                    combination. Where the elevated ranges gradually disappear in the champaign
                    country, nothing can exceed the rich and undulating character of the scenery,
                    broken into noble and irregular valleys, or spreading out into extensive
                    alluvial tracts, watered by streams of almost every size and character. The
                    county of Perth is now generally divided into the highland and lowland
                    divisions, the surface of the former being far more extensive than that of the
                    latter. The fertile or lowland districts are chiefly, but by no means entirely,
                    situated towards the eastern and the southern boundaries of the county. The fine
                    valley of Stratheam, having the Grampian range on the north-west, with the
                    Ochils and Sidlaw hills on the east, traverses it from north-east to south-west,
                    and, including certain portions of the contiguous valleys of the Tay and the
                    Almond, forms one of the richest and most extensive tracts in the kingdom.
                    Besides the extensive valley of Strathearn, there are others of considerable
                    dimensions, studded with lakes, and enlivened with streams of every variety of
                    character. Such are those of the Tay, the Isla, and the' Almond, and the valley
                    of the Tummel, with its clear, soft, and beautiful lake, richly fringed on the
                    margin with wood of various kinds, rising boldly up on the south, into the steep
                    ridges of Schehallion and Faragon. Glenlycn and the val ley of the Brann are not
                    less rich and beautiful; and there are many others scarcely inferior to these in
                    size and picturesque variety of scenery.</p>
                <p part="N">Perthshire is distinguished for its noble ranges of mountains, as well
                    as for the great elevation to which some of them attain. The highest is
                    Benlawers, 4015 feet: Benmore is 3903; Cairn Gower, 3690; and Schehallion, 3564.
                    This last mountain is distinguished by its fine conoidal outline, as well as for
                    being the spot selected by Dr Maskelyne fçr making his experiments to-determine
                    the density of the earth. Benledi rises to the height of 3550 feet; Ben
                    Ard-lanach to that of 3500; and Ben Venu to that of 3000; besides many others of
                    considerable though inferior altitude. The principal lake is Loch Tay, fifteen
                    miles in length, and about two at its greatest breadth. The outline of this fine
                    lake is somewhat deficient in beauty, from the nearly straight and rigid
                    character of its shores, particularly on the north side. At Killin and Taymouth,
                    however, the scenery is varied and noble, presenting ample materials to the
                    pencil of the artist. Loch Ericht is about sixteen miles in length, but half of
                    it is included in the county of Inverness. The country around it is bare, wild,
                    and devoid of interest. Loch Rannoch, which is nearly twelve miles in length
                    from east to west, exhibits greater variety of outline, and its banks are
                    agreeably diversified with old birches, the remnants of the once extensive
                    forest of Rannoch. The finest view of Schehallion is obtained from the northern
                    bank of this lake, at a point about four miles above Kinloch Rannoch. Viewed
                    from the spot in question, the mountain presents a figure nearly conical,
                    appearing to rise out of the lower extremity of the loch, and show ing, in
                    contrast with the water, one of the most magnificent natural objects to be seen
                    in this or in any other country. Loch Earn, about six or seven miles in length,
                    is a beautiful lake, with a richly-wooded, and in many places a
                    highly-cultivated, but narrow strip of margin, from which the hills ascend
                    rapidly and steeply. On the south-west there is the noble chain of lakes, Loch
                    Ketterin, Loch Achray, and Loch Vennachar, which discharge their waters into the
                    Forth. The scenery of these lakes is so well known as the locality of Sir Walter
                    Scott’s poetical romance, the Lady of the Lake, that it is unnecessary to
                    describe its peculiar features. They are of the most varied and striking kind,
                    such indeed as require to be seen in order to be fully appreciated; and the
                    pencil rather than the pen must be employed to convey to those who have not
                    beheld them a just conception of their mingled beauty, wildness, and
                    magnificence. Divided from these by a ridge of elevated hills, we find Loch Ard,
                    Upper and Lower, and Loch Con, from which the Forth takes his rise. The
                    well-known lake of Monteith is in the vicinity of the latter. There are many
                    other lakes, such as Loch Tummel, Loch Garry, Loch Voíl, and Loch Lubnaig, all
                    of some extent, and some of them rich in picturesque beauty of situation and
                    outline. In the eastern quarter of the county is to be found another chain of
                    lakes extending from near Dunkeld towards Blairgowrie, which are less known than
                    they deserve to be. These are the three lochs of the Lowes, Marly, and Clunie.
                    An old mansion on the loch of Chmie is said to have been the birthplace of the
                    admirable Crichton.</p>
                <p part="N">The rivers of Perthshire are, the Tay, the largest stream in Scotland,
                    with a course about ninety miles in length; the Isla, with its tributary the
                    Ericht; and the Earn. The Tay and the Earn belong exclusively to this county,
                    their entire course being confined to it; the Isla in the early part of its
                    course sweeps through the western part of Forfarshire. The Tay is considered to
                    discharge more water into the sea than any other river in Great Britain; the
                    basin which it drains not only being very extensive in itself, and the seat of
                    elevated mountain ranges, but abounding in streams of considerable magnitude,
                    the principal of which it absorbs in its progress towards the German Ocean. Of
                    those minor streams, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494857?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0717-4857-0290"/>augment the volume of the Tay, the chief are
                    the Lyon, the Almond, the Isla, the Brann, the Garry, and the Tummel. Throughout
                    a considerable part of its course the scenery on the banks of the Tay is of the
                    grandest and most impressive character; particularly in the upper part of its
                    course, from Loch Tay, through the strath which takes its name from the river,
                    to the pass of Bimam, where its banks become more level, and the country around
                    assumes a softer character. But what is lost in boldness and grandeur is fully
                    compensated by the rich and varied beauties of a wooded and cultivated soil,
                    enriched with noble seats and stately mansions. The Earn passes through a rich
                    and picturesque country; in some places bold and alpine in its character, and in
                    others abounding in the mellow beauties of cultivation. On its banks, not far
                    from its confluence with the Frith of Tay, stands the village of Pitcaithley,
                    celebrated for its mineral waters, and now a favourite resort of fashionable
                    valetudinarians. The Tummel is one of the finest rivers in Scotland, and is
                    especially rich in wild and romantic scenery, from its source in Loch Rannoch,
                    to its confluence with the Tay, immediately below the village of Logierait. The
                    Earn and the Lyon, the Almond, the Brann, and the Airdle, besides other smaller
                    streams, we can only afford to notice generally. They all partake more or less
                    of the character <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the fine districts which they
                    traverse; imparting life and animation to many a mountain solitude, besides
                    draining and watering extensive tracts of country.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the temperature of a region differing so much in exposure and
                    elevation, nothing certain can safely be affirmed. In the upper and more
                    elevated districts, where the mountain ranges slope down into the level country,
                    and amongst the numerous glens which penetrate these in all directions, the
                    climate is charged with moisture in a higher degree, the winters are longer and
                    more severe, the snow frequently lies longer on the ground, and the spring is
                    generally later than in the lower districts of the county. The highest summer
                    temperature rarely exceeds sixty-five degrees, and the mean temperature, in
                    three different situations in the county (none of them, however, more than 150
                    feet above the sea), has been found to be forty-seven degrees. The cloudy
                    character of the atmosphere in the mountainous districts, by excluding the light
                    of the sun, retards the ripening of the crops, and accumulates moisture, which
                    tends to lower the average temperature. The district of Perth proper is said to
                    be the least humid, the average water being only twenty-three inches; but in the
                    Carse of Gowrie, on the shores of the Frith of Tay, the mean quantity of rain
                    for twelve years was twenty-four inches and a half; at Perth, for a period of
                    sixteen years, it was 26∙95 inches; and at Belmont, in Strathmore, for thirty
                    years, it was as high as 30∙40 inches. The extensive drainage, executed of late
                    years by various proprietors, has no doubt tended considerably to ameliorate the
                    climate.</p>
                <p part="N">As far as is yet known, the minerals of Perthshire, in a commercial or
                    economical point of view, are of no great public importance. Abundance of coal
                    is to be found at Culross on the Forth, where it has long been wrought; but the
                    situation renders it of no use to the inland and higher districts. Limestone is
                    plentiful, and is wrought in considerable quantities; but for want of proper
                    fuel it is not so generally used as it would be, peat, the only fuel in the
                    upper districts, not being strong enough for the purpose of calcination. Lord
                    Willoughby d’Eresby and Sir Niel Menzies have, however, lately devoted their
                    attention to the compression of peat; and the results which they have obtained
                    encourage the hope that that species of fuel may yet be rendered available to
                    the improvement of the barren districts in which it abounds. Marble of a pretty
                    good quality is found in Glentilt, and is now becoming an article of some
                    importance in commerce. Slate is wrought in various places, particularly in the
                    neighbourhood of Dunkeld; ironstone is found on the Devon, where it supplies the
                    extensive ironworks established there; and copper and lead mines are said to
                    have been at one time in operation, but have long since been abandoned. On the
                    east side of the county shell-marl is plentiful, and is freely used as a manure.
                    In the higher districts the general basis is granite, but in the lower sandstone
                    prevails. The sandstone, which is of the primitive kind, stretches from the
                    valley of Strathmore to the neighbourhood of Callander, with a dip varying from
                    15° to 25° towards the north-west. It seems to have received this position from
                    the action of the central force which elevated the range of trap hills
                    traversing the island from Montrose to Dumbarton.</p>
                <p part="N">In a county of so great extent, and possessing such a variety of
                    surface, considerable diversity must exist in the character of the soil. The
                    carse or alluvial lands on the shores of the Frith of Tay have long been
                    celebrated for their fertility. They are considered as the joint produce of
                    river and sea deposition for a series of ages. The general character of the soil
                    is that of a rich clay, very deep, in some places alternating with layers of
                    peat, and having sand and marine deposits at the bottom. This soil is not wholly
                    alluvial, being sometimes mixed with the debris of trap-rocks, and also of the
                    sandstone, which, as already mentioned, forms a geological characteristic of the
                    lowland districts of Perthshire. Considerable tracts of this inferior
                    description of alluvial soil are found accompanying the courses of the principal
                    rivers, and extend into the upper portions of Strath-Tay, Strath-Airdle, and
                    Strath-Tummel. A soil composed of clay and sand, and called by agriculturists a
                        <hi rend="italic">till,</hi> extends along a vast tract of this county from
                    east to west, and is supposed to be formed from the red sandstone prevalent in
                    that district. Peat is to be met with almost everywhere in Perthshire; that
                    known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Moss Flanders</hi> is said to extend over
                    ten thousand acres, and is amongst the largest continuous tracts of this
                    description in the united kingdom.</p>
                <p part="N">In the arable districts of this county, such as the Carse of Gowrie, and
                    the fertile lands skirting part of the course of its principal rivers, the modes
                    of agriculture and management of farms are much the same as in the other
                    agricultural counties of Scotland. But of late years a spirit of improvement has
                    been introduced, which has been much felt in this county, chiefly in the upper
                    districts, where the old “runrig” system long kept its ground tenaciously,-under
                    the modified form of joint farms. The arable farms vary in extent from fifty to
                    five hundred acres, and upwards; and in the Carse of Gowrie the rents are as
                    high as in any part of the kingdom. Wheat is raised on the best soils, and has
                    been attempted, not unsuccessfully, as high up in the county as Dunkeld. In the
                    wheat-growing soils this crop usually alternates with beans and peas, barley,
                    hay, and oats. Flax is more extensively raised in Perthshire than in any other
                    part of Scotland, arising most probably from its being the raw material of the
                    indigenous manufacture of the county. Potatoes and turnips are extensively
                    cultivated, and of late years on the most improved methods. The pasture-farms in
                    the higher parts of the county are large, and raise great numbers of sheep,
                    chiefly of the black-faced kind. Other descriptions of live stock are not so
                    much cultivated. Dairy farming does not form a prominent feature in the rural
                    economy of this county. In some favoured spots orchards succeed well, many of
                    them are very large, and their produce is highly celebrated. Perthshire is
                    remarkable for the great extent and beauty of its woods. Of these, many are of
                    natural wood, chiefly oak. But extensive plantations of various kinds of trees
                    have been made during the last fifty years by several proprietors, especially by
                    the late Duke of Atholl, whose planting operations have been carried on upon the
                    most extensive scale, at once beautifying and enriching one of the finest parts
                    of the county. To him Perthshire is indebted for the introduction of the larch,
                    which has been <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494870?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0717-4870-0291"/>found singularly adapted to the climate and
                    soil. The plantations of this tree have thriven amazingly, and are of great
                    extent and value. Larch has been used in ship-building, instead of oak; but
                    their relative value for such a purpose is not yet fully ascertained. In 1674
                    the valued rental of Perthshire was L.339,892 Scots; and in 1815 the annual
                    value of assessed property amounted to L.555,552 sterling.</p>
                <p part="N">This county is particularly rich in splendid seats and mansions
                    belonging to the great proprietors. Of these, the most remarkable are Dunira,
                    Taymouth Castle, Dunkeld House, the Palace of Scone, Kinfauns Castle, Murthly
                    House, Dupplin Castle, and Blair Castle. Castle Huntly and Blair Castle are fine
                    specimens of the old baronial and castellated habitations of the ancient lords
                    of the soil; and Doune Castle is considered as one of the finest ruins of its
                    kind in Scotland. Perthshire is not remarkable for antiquities, secular or
                    ecclesiastical. Druidical circles and Roman remains are found in various places.
                    Of the former, one circle almost entire, called by the country people Standing
                    Stanes, formerly existed at Craigmakerran, the property, we believe, of the
                    guildry of Perth; but about twenty-five years ago it was barbarously destroyed,
                    and the stones blasted for the purpose of being employed in the erection of a
                    farm-steading. Before this act of Vandalism was committed, the circle in
                    question, which stood on a projecting crag, about six miles from Perth, on the
                    Isla road, was perhaps one of the most perfect of the kind in the kingdom. Of
                    the latter, the camp or station at Ardoch, and that at Comrie, are well known,
                    as well as the Roman road, which seems to have connected them. There is another
                    at Delvin, which is scarcely less remarkable. The ruins of the cathedrals of
                    Dunblane and Dunkeld are also in excellent preservation, though the architecture
                    is by no means of the highest order. The tower of Abernethy, which has long
                    puzzled the heads of antiquaries, is unfortunately decaying rapidly, as is also
                    the fine old abbey of Culross.</p>
                <p part="N">Red deer are still numerous in Perthshire, and impart a feature of
                    peculiar interest to its forest scenery. The deer-forest of Athole is said to
                    contain 80,000 acres; and the number of the deer in the whole county is
                    estimated at 6000, of which about 100 are annually killed. Harts are destroyed
                    in the months of August and September, and hinds in January, the last month of
                    the season. From several of the large proprietors having combined to preserve
                    the deer, it is considered that their number must be greatly upon the increase.
                    Feathered game of every description abounds in the upland district of
                    Perthshire, and affords a rich treat to die sportsman. Many of the moors are let
                    to sportsmen, and bring large sums annually. Salmon is amazingly plentiful,
                    especially in the Tay, and is also found in the tributaries of that river. The
                    fisheries on the Tay alone are understood to bring a rental of L.l0,000 a year,
                    and those on the Earn are likewise said to be productive. The export of salmon
                    forms a considerable article of commerce, as is mentioned in the account of
                    Perth.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal towns are Perth and Culross, which are royal burghs;
                    Crieff, Callander, Kincardine, Doune, Comrie, Dunblane, Auchterarder, Dunkeld,
                    and Blairgowrie. Of the latter class, the largest is Crieff, the population of
                    which in 1831 amounted to nearly 5000. It is a chief seat of the linen
                    manufacture, which is also the principal occupation of Blairgowrie and
                    Auchterarder, with a population of about 8000 each. None of the other towns is
                    very remarkable, if we except Comrie, which is celebrated for the frequency of
                    earthquakes in its neighbourhood; Dunblane, for its mineral waters; and Doune,
                    once a great Highland mart, for its manufactory of pistols. The villages are
                    numerous, and many of them populous and thriving; but it is unnecessary to
                    particularize them. The greater part of Coupar Angus is included in the county
                    of Perth.</p>
                <p part="N">The manufacture of linen, as already mentioned, is the staple
                    manufacture of Perthshire; but cotton goods are also produced to a considerable
                    extent. Mills for spinning flax, bleachfields, and calico-printfields, are
                    numerous; and there are some large establishments for spinning cotton-yarn at
                    Stanley near Perth, and at Danston. Paper is likewise manufactured to a
                    considerable extent; and oil-mills are to be found in various places. A great
                    many shoes are made in Perth, and the tanning of leather is carried on to a
                    considerable extent at Crieff and at Thornhill. Of agricultural produce, large
                    quantities of sheep and black cattle from the upper districts are brought to the
                    country markets and sold there. Wool is likewise an article of considerable
                    sale. From the more fertile districts large quantities of grain are annually
                    brought to market. Bark and timber, principally larch and oak, also form
                    commercial articles of no small importance. The produce of its fisheries has
                    already been noticed as being amongst the list of exports. Limestone, slate,
                    freestone, marl, and marble, from the fine quarries of Glentilt, are also
                    brought to market, although, from the difficulty of transport, to a much less
                    extent than they would otherwise be done.</p>
                <p part="N">In a word, the leading characteristics of this noble county are the
                    variety and diversity of its scenery and productions, and the picturesque manner
                    in which these are frequently grouped together. Fertility and barrenness, the
                    wildest alpine magnificence, and the most delicious scenes upon which the eye of
                    the lover of natural beauty could desire to rest; the rugged mountain towering
                    in rude majesty, and the sweet glen enlivened with sunshine or curtained with
                    mist; the rich alluvial plains of England contrasting with the glories of
                    Switzerland in a more softened and subdued form; these are the general and
                    prominent features by which it is distinguished. To the tourist it presents
                    attractions of almost every kind. It is a sort of shifting diorama, in which new
                    scenes remarkable for new beauties continually present themselves to his view,
                    leaving upon his mind the impression that the· last is, in some respects, the
                    finest he has yet beheld. To the sportsman it opens a boundless field of
                    amusement in its beautiful streams and its extensive moors, where the grouse,
                    undeterred by the deadly hostility of man, renew their race but only to invite
                    renewed destruction. In this county the naturalist has still much to explore;
                    and after all the labours of Lord Webb Seymour, Professor Playfair, and some
                    others, Glentilt alone would occupy a generation of mineralogists and
                    geologists. In a word, this county, rich in every kind of natural beauty, and
                    possessing many localities which have a deep historical interest attached to
                    them, is not undeserving of the preeminence which has, by universal consent,
                    been assigned to it, and merits a far larger share of attention than in the
                    present article we have been able to bestow upon it.</p>
                <p part="N">The population of the county of Perth, in 1831, amounted to 142,894
                    persons, being an increase since 1821 of only 3844. The number of families was
                    31,749, and that of inhabited houses 23,809. Of the relative numbers employed in
                    trade and agriculture we have no recent returns. The county sends a member to
                    parliament, as does also Perth, the principal city. Culross, Queensferry,
                    Dunfermline, Inverkeithing, and Stirling, unite in returning a third. The only
                    change affecting this county made by the reform act, was enfranchising the city
                    of Perth, which previously had only a fraction of a representative.</p>
