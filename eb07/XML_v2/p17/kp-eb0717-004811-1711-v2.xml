                <p part="N">Before entering on a description of the papyrus, it may be right to say
                    a word or two as to the opinion generally received in Europe concerning the
                    disappearance of this plant. Supposing the circumstance possible, the date of it
                    must be fixed at no distant period; for it is not more than two centuries since
                    Guilandin and Prosper Alpin observed the papyrus on the banks of the Nile.
                    Guilandin observed the inhabitants of the country eating the inferior and
                    succulent part of the stem, in the manner of the ancients; a fact which shoλvs
                    that it must have been the papyrus. This, and the practices related by Prosper
                    Alpin, are sufficientto<pb break="no" facs="nls:193491724?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0717-1724-0049"/> convince us that the plant is not wholly
                    useless, although it is not now employed in the fabrication of paper. The
                    alteration in the soil of Egypt, and the methods of agriculture, have in all
                    probability rendered the plant less common; but causes altogether local could
                    not occasion the destruction of the papyrus, especially as its residence in the
                    marshes would prevent their operation. It is needless, however, to reason from
                    probabilities or analogy. Mr Bruce not only saw the papyrus growing both in
                    Egypt and Abyssinia, but actually made paper of it in the same manner as that in
                    which it was made by the ancients. He tells us, likewise, that, so far from any
                    part of it being useless, the whole plant is at this day used in Abyssinia for
                    making boats, a piece of the acacia tree being put into the bottom to serve as a
                    keel. That such were the boats of ancient Egypt, we know from the testimony of
                    Pliny, who informs us that the plants were first sewed together, and then
                    gathered up at stem and stern, and tied fast to the keel: <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conseritur bibula Memphitis cymba papyro.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The papyrus, says Pliny, grows in the marshes of Egypt, or in the
                    stagnant places of the Nile, formed by the overflowing of that river, provided
                    they are not beyond the depth of two cubits. Its roots are tortuous, and in
                    thickness about four or five inches; and its stem is triangular, rising to the
                    height of ten cubits. Prosper Alpin states it as growing about six or seven
                    cubits above the water; the stem tapering from the bottom, and terminating in a
                    point. Theophrastus adds, that the papyrus carries a top or plume of small
                    hairs, which is the thyrsus of Pliny. Guilandin informs us, that its roots throw
                    to the right and left a great number of small fibres, which support the
                    plantagainst the violence of the wind, and against the waters of the Nile.
                    According to him, the leaves of the plant are obtuse, and resemble the <hi
                        rend="italic">typha</hi> of the marshes. Mr Bruce, on the other hand,
                    assures us that it never could have existed in the Nile. Its head, says he, is
                    far too heavy; and in a plain country the wind must have had too violent a hold
                    of it. The stalk is small and feeble, and withal too tall; the root is also too
                    short and slender to stay it against the violent pressure of the wind and
                    current; and therefore it could never have been a plant growing in the river
                    Nile itself, or in any very deep or rapid river, but only in the calishes or
                    places where the Nile had overflowed and was stagnant.</p>
                <p part="N">The Egyptians made of this plant paper fit for writing (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Paper),</hi> which they called <hi rend="italic"
                        >βιζλoς,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">philuria,</hi> and also χαgrjji, whence
                    the Latin <hi rend="italic">charta;</hi> for in general the word <hi
                        rend="italic">Charta</hi> is used to signify the paper of Egypt.</p>
                <p part="N">The papyrus was produced in so great quantities on the banks of the
                    Nile, that Cassiodorus compares it to a forest. There, says he, rises to the
                    view, this forest without branches, this thicket without leaves, this harvest of
                    the waters, this ornament of the marshes. Prosper Alpin is the first who gives
                    us a plate of the papyrus, which corresponds in some degree with the description
                    of the plant mentioned by Theophrastus; but by far the best drawing of it is
                    that given by Bruce.</p>
                <p part="N">The ancient botanists placed the papyrus amongst the gramineous plants
                    or dog-grass; ignorant of the particular ki*ad to which it belonged, they were
                    contented to specify it under the name of <hi rend="italic">papyrus,</hi> of
                    which there were two kinds, namely, that of Egypt, and that of Sicily. The
                    moderns have endeavoured to show that these two plants are one and the same
                    species of cyperus; and it is under this genus that they are found in the
                    catalogues and descriptions of plants published since the edition of Morrison’s
                    work, where the papyrus is called <hi rend="italic">Cyperus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Niloticus Syriacus maximus papyraceus.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">It is impossible to determine whether the papyrus of Sicily was used in
                    any way by the Romans. In Italy it is called <hi rend="italic">papeτo,</hi> and,
                    according to Cesalpin, <hi rend="italic">pipero. '</hi> This papyrus of Sicily
                    was cultivated in a garden at Pisa; and if we can depend on the authority of
                    Cesalpin, who himself examined the plant, it is different from the papyrus of
                    Egypt. The papyrus, says he, which is commotìly called <hi rend="italic"
                        >pipero</hi> in Sicily, has a longer and thicker stem than the plant
                    cyperus. It rises sometimes to the height of four cubits; the angles are obtuse,
                    and the stem at the base is surrounded with leaves growing from the root; and
                    there are no leaves on the stem even when the plant is at the greatest
                    perfection; but it carries at the top a large plume, which resembles a great
                    tuft of dishevelled hairs. This is composed of a great number of triangular
                    pedicles, in the form of reeds, at the extremity of which are placed the
                    flowers, between two small leaves of a reddish colour like the cyperus. The
                    roots are woody, about the thickness of reeds, jointed, and throw out a great
                    number of branches, which extend themselves in an oblique direction. These are
                    scented somewhat like the cyperus, but their colour is a lighter brown: from the
                    lower part issue many small fibres, and from the higher a number of stems shoot
                    up, which, in proportion as they are tender, contain a sweet juice.</p>
                <p part="N">The plume of the papyrus of Sicily is a tuft or assemblage of a great
                    number of long slender pedicles, which grow from the same point of division, are
                    disposed in the manner of a parasol, and carry at the top three long and narrow
                    leaves, from which issue other pedicles, shorter than the former, and
                    terminating in several knots of flowers. Micheli <hi rend="italic">(Nova
                        Plantarum Genera,</hi> Florence, 1728) has given an engraving of one of the
                    long pedicles in its natural length. It is surrounded at the base with a case of
                    about one inch and a half in height; and towards the extremity it carries three
                    long and narrow leaves, and four pedicles, to which are fixed the knots of
                    flowers. Every pedicle has also a small case surrounding its base. In short, the
                    papyrus of Sicily is well known to botanists. It were to be wished that we had
                    as particular a description of the papyrus of Egypt. It may be observed,
                    however, that these two plants have a near affinity to one another; that they
                    are confounded together by many authors; and that, according to Theophrastus,
                    the <hi rend="italic">sari</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">papyrus ηilotica</hi>
                    have a decided character of resemblance, differing only in this, that the
                    papyrus sends forth thick and tall stems, which being divided into slender
                    plates, are fit for the fabrication of paper, whilst the <hi rend="italic"
                        >sari</hi> has small stems, considerably shorter, and altogether useless for
                    any kind of paper.</p>
                <p part="N">The papyrus, which anciently served to make paper, must not be
                    confounded with the papyrus of Sicily, which is also found in Calabria.
                    According to Strabo, the papyrus was not to be found anywhere except in Egypt
                    and in India. The greater part of botanists have believed that the Sicilian
                    plant is the same with the sari of Theophrastus; but others have alleged that
                    the papyrus of Egypt and the sari were the same plant in two different stages of
                    its existence, or considered with respect to the greater or less height; which,
                    according to them, might depend upon the qualities of the soil, the difference
                    of the climate, or other accidental causes. In proof of this, it is maintained,
                    that there is an essential difference between the papyrus growing in the waters
                    and the same plant growing on the banks of rivers and in marshes. The first of
                    these has thick and tall stems, and a plume in the form of a tuft of hair very
                    long and slender, and without any seed. The second differs from the first in all
                    these particulars; it has a shorter and more slender stem, its plume is loaded
                    with flowers, and consequently it produces seed. In whatever way we consider
                    these facts, it is sufficient for us to know, that the difference between the
                    papyrus and the sari neither depends on climate, nor soil, nor situation. The
                    plants whose difference depended on these circumstances both grew in Egypt, and
                    were both employed in the manufacture of <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193491737?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1737-0050"/>paper. But
                    it is an established fact, that the sari cannot be employed for this
                    purpose.</p>
                <p part="N">Finally, the papyrus of Sicily began to be known by botanists in the
                    years 1570, 1572, and 1583, at which periods the works of Lobel, of Gnilandin,
                    and of Cesalpin, first appeared. The ancients had no manner of knowledge of this
                    plant, and Pliny makes no mention of it in his Natural History; from which it is
                    evident that it was used neither in Rome nor in Sicily. If he had seen this
                    plant, he must have been struck with its resemblance to the papyrus and the
                    sari, as these were described by Theophrastus; and since he gives a particular
                    description of the latter, he would most naturally have hinted at their
                    conformity to the Sicilian papyrus, had such actually been the case.</p>
