                    the author of several books relating to ancient customs and privileges in
                    England, was born at Prestbury in Gloucestershire, on the 28th of September
                    1601. When very young, he spent some time in one of the Inns of Chancery, and
                    went from thence to the Middle Temple, where he became learned in the law. In
                    the civil wars, he was a bold assertor of the king’s prerogative, and so
                    strongly attached to Charles I. that, two days before that monarch was beheaded,
                    he wrote a protestation against the intended murder, and caused it to be
                    printed, and affixed to posts in all the public places. He likewise published,
                    in 1649, a quarto pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Veritas</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Inconcussa,</hi> or King Charles I. no Man of Blood, but a
                    Martyr for his People, which was reprinted in 1660, 8vo. In 1663, when the
                    courts of justice at Westminster, especially the chancery, were dissolved by
                    Cromwell’s parliament, he published Considerations against the dissolving and
                    taking them away, for which he received the thanks of parliament. He was for
                    some time filazer for London, Middlesex, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdonshire;
                    and spent much money in searching records, and writing in favour of the royal
                    prerogative. The only advantage he received for this attachment to the royal
                    cause was the place of commissioner for regulating the law, worth L.200 per
                    annum, but which only lasted two years. After the restoration of Charles II.
                    when the bill for taking away the tenures was depending in parliament, Philips
                    wrote and published a book to show the necessity of preserving them, entitled

                    Antiquity, Legality, Reason, Duty, and Necessity of Pre-emption and Purveyance
                    for the King, in 4to; and afterwards many other pieces upon subjects of a
                    similar kind. He assisted Dr Bates in his <hi rend="italic">Elenchus
                        Motuum,</hi> especially in searching the records and offices for that work,
                    and died on the 17th of November ]690, in his eighty-ninth year. He was a man
                    well acquainted with records and antiquities; but his manner of writing is
                    neither close nor well digested. He published a political pamphlet in 1681,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Ursa Major</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Philips,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ambrose,</hi> an
                    English poet of some note, was descended from an ancient and considerable family
                    of that name in Leicestershire. He received his education at St John’s College,
                    Cambridge, and during his stay there wrote 1ιis pastorals, which at that time
                    acquired him a high reputation. His next performance was the Life of Archbishop
                    Williams, written, according to Mr Cibber, to make known his political
                    principles, which in the course of it he had an opportunity of doing, as the
                    archbishop, who is the hero of his work, was a strong opponent of the
                    high-church party and their measures.</p>
                <p part="N">When he quitted the university and went to London, Philips became a
                    constant attendant at, and one of the wits of, Button’s coffee-house, where he
                    obtained the friendship and intimacy of many celebrated men of that age,
                    particularly of Sir Richard Steele, who, in the first volume of his Tatler, has
                    inserted a little poem of Philips’s, which he entitles a Winter Piece, dated
                    from Copenhagen, and addressed to the Earl of Dorset, and on which he bestows
                    the highest encomiums; and, indeed, so just are these commendations, that even
                    Pope himself, who had a fixed aversion to the author, whilst he affected to
                    despise his other works, used always to except this from his censure and
                    contempt.</p>
                <p part="N">The first dislike Pope conceived against Philips proceeded from that
                    jealousy of fame which was so conspicuous in his character; for Sir Richard
                    Steele had taken so strong a liking to the pastorals of Philips, that he formed
                    a design of instituting a critical comparison of them with those of Pope, in the
                    conclusion of which the preference was to be given to Philips. This design,
                    however, having come to the knowledge of Pope, the latter, who could not bear a
                    rival near the throne, determined to ward off this stroke by a stratagem of the
                    most artful kind; which was no other than taking the same task on himself.
                    Accordingly, in a paper in the Guardian, he drew a similar comparison, and gave
                    a like preference, but on principles of criticism so evidently fallacious, as to
                    point out to all the absurdity of the decision. However, notwithstanding the
                    ridicule which Philips drew upon himself by standing as it were in competition
                    with so powerful an antagonist, it is allowed that in some parts of his
                    pastorals there are certain touches of nature, and a degree of simplicity, which
                    are much better suited to the purposes of pastoral than the more
                    correctly-turned periods of Pope’s versification. Philips and Pope being of
                    different political principles, proved another cause of enmity between them,
                    which at length rose to so great a height, that the former, finding his
                    antagonist too hard for him at the weapon of wit, had determined upon making use
                    of a rougher kind of argument; and for this purpose he even went so far as to
                    hang up a rod at Button’s for the chastisement of his adversary whenever he
                    should come thither. Pope, however, declining to brave his antagonist, avoided
                    the <hi rend="italic">argumentum</hi><hi rend="italic">baculi-num,</hi> in which
                    he would, no doubt, have found himself on the weaker side of the question. Our
                    author also wrote several dramatic pieces, as the Briton, Distressed Mother, and
                    Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, all of which met with success, and one of them
                    still continues to be a standard entertainment at the theatres, being generally
                    repeated several times in every season. Philips’s circumstances were throughout
                    his life not only easy, but rather affluent, in consequence of his being
                    connected, by political principles, with persons of great rank and consequence.
                    He was concerned with Dr Hugh Boulter, afterwards archbishop of Armagh, the
                    Right Honourable Richard West, lord chancellor of Ireland, the Rev. Gilbert
                    Burnet, and the Rev. Henry Stevens, in writing a series of papers under the
                    title of the <hi rend="italic">Freethinker,</hi> which were all published
                    together by Philips, in three volumes 12mo.</p>
                <p part="N">In the latter part of Queen Anne’s reign, he was secretary to the
                    Hanover Club, a set of noblemen and gentlemen who had formed an association in
                    honour of that succession, and for the support of its interests, and who used
                    particularly to distinguish in their toasts such of the fair sex as were most
                    zealously attached to the illustrious house of Brunswick. Philips’ station in
                    this club, together with the zeal shown in his writings, recommended him to the
                    notice and favour of the new government. Soon after the accession of George I.,
                    he was put into the commission of die peace, and appointed one of the
                    commissioners of the lottery; and, on his friend Dr Boulter being made primate
                    of Ireland, he accompanied that prelate across St George’s Channel, where
                    considerable preferments were bestowed on him, and he was elected a member of
                    the Irish House of Commons, as representative for the county of Armagh. At
                    length, having purchased an annuity for life of L.400 per annum, he returned to
                    England some time in the year 1748; but being in a very bad state of health,
                    and, moreover, at an advanced age, he died soon afterwards, at his lodgings near
                    Vauxhall, in Surrey.</p>

                    ingenious lady, the daughter of Mr John Fowler, merchant, was born at London in
                    January 1631, and educated at a school near Hackney. She married James Philips
                    of the priory of Cardigan; and went with the Viscountess of Dungannon into
                    Ireland, where she translated into English Corneille’s tragedy of Pompey, which
                    was several times acted there with great applause. She also translated the first
                    four acts of the Horace, another tragedy of Corneille, the fifth being executed
                    by Sir John Denham. This remarkable person died of the small-pox in London on
                    the 22d of June 1664, much and justly regretted; “having,” according to
                    Langbaine, “not left any of her sex her equal in poetry.” Dr Jeremy Taylor
                    addressed to her his Measures and Offices of Friendship, the second edition of
                    which appeared in the year 1657, in 12mo. Her assumed poetical name was <hi

                        rend="italic">John,</hi> an English poet of considerable eminence, was born
                    in 1676. He was educated at Winchester and Oxford, where he became acquainted
                    with Milton, whom he studied with great application, and traced in all Jιis
                    successful translations from the ancients. The first poem by which he
                    distinguished himself was his Splendid Shilling, which in the Tatler is styled
                    the “finest burlesque poem in the English language.” His next was entitled
                    Blenheim, which he wrote at the request of the Earl of Oxford, and Mr Henry St
                    John, afterwards Lord Bolingbroke, on the victory obtained by the Duke of
                    Marlborough in the year 1704. It was published in 1705; and the year after, he
                    finished another poem upon cider, the first book of which had been written at
                    Oxford. It is on the model of Virgil’s Georgies, and is thought a very excellent
                    piece. We have no more of Philips’ except a Latin ode to Mr Henry St John, which
                    is esteemed a masterpiece. He was contriving greater things, when he was seized
                    with the illness of which he died, at Hereford, on the !5th of February 1708,
                    before he had attained his thirty-third year.</p>
                <p part="N">It deserves to be remarked, that there were other two poets of the same
                    name who flourished in his time. One of these was Milton’s nephew, who wrote
                    several things, particularly some memoirs of his uncle, and part of Virgil
                    Travestied. The other was the author of two political farces, which were both
                    printed in 1716, viz. The Earl of Marr Married, with the Humours of Jockey the
                    Highlander; and the Pretender’s Flight, or a Mock Coronation, with the Humours
                    of the facetious Harry St John.</p>
