                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PHILIPPINES</label>. This archipelago, in the
                    Eastern Seas, extends from the fifth to the twentieth degree of north latitude,
                    and consists of a great number of islands of various sizes, and many of which
                    are but little known. The largest of the group is Luzon or Luconia; and to the
                    south lie the other principal islands, namely, Mindoro, Panay, Marindique,
                    Negros, Masbate, Zebu, Bohol, Leyte, Samar, and Magindanao. There are, besides,
                    several smaller ones, and they are all, nominally at least, subordinate to the
                    Spanish government at Manilla; but its power does not extend over all parts of
                    the islands. There are many remote· places to which the Spaniards have never
                    been able to penetrate. Amongst their fastnesses and mountains, the natives roam
                    in a state of barbarous independence, and wage an inveterate war against their
                    Spanish oppressors. These islands, which are partially colonized, pay tribute,
                    which is collected by the Spanish magistrates in the provinces or districts into
                    which the country is subdivided. The appellation of Philippines was given to
                    them in compliment to Philip II. of Spain, who at the time of their subjugation
                    was prince of the Asturias. ’</p>
                <p part="N">The Philippines, from their situation, possess a tropical climate, and
                    are subject to the periodical rains, though the <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193495611?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5611-0348"/>heats are
                    moderated by the breeze from the sea. The rains generally commence in May, and
                    last till September, but sometimes they are protracted to the beginning of
                    December; from which latter period till the succeeding May the weather is
                    delightful, being a perpetual spring. The vegetation is luxuriant, owing to the
                    copious rains; the trees are constantly covered with leaves, and the soil with
                    verdure, so that it is difficult to keep the land clear of weeds and insects.
                    The winds which most commonly prevail are the north, the east, and the
                    south-west, each of which continues for four months; the change of wind being
                    attended with violent storms of thunder and lightning, and at times by
                    whirlwinds. These storms rage occasionally with frightful violence, and blow
                    from every point of the compass in the course of twenty-four hours, ravaging and
                    destroying the country, and tearing up trees by the roots.</p>
                <p part="N">These islands, from their extent, their climate, and the fertility of
                    their soil, would produce all sorts of colonial products, if there were adequate
                    industry on the part of the inhabitants. Their chief production, however, is
                    rice, which is the principal subsistence of the natives. They cultivate, besides
                    the bread-fruit, beans, the cacavata, &amp;c.; and the palm-tree is much
                    attended to, as it yields a spirit and an oil, besides a sweetmeat named
                    chanaca. The pith of the palm, the young shoots of the sugar-cane, green withes,
                    and other succulents, serve as substitutes for rice to those who cannot procure
                    anything better. The other products are different sorts of pulse, such as
                    mangos, patani, kidney beans, and millet. They have not many fruit-trees, and
                    they are, besides, of an indifferent quality, excepting the plantain, to which
                    may be added the orange and the mango. The areca or betel-nut is also
                    cultivated, and used in great quantities, both by Spaniards and by natives. The
                    domestic animals are buffaloes, goats, pigs, ducks, and fowls. Horses and horned
                    cattle, having been imported in great numbers by the Spaniards, have multiplied
                    to such a degree that they now run wild in the mountains, without being claimed
                    by any owner. Deer abound in the mountains, and all sorts of pigeons swarm in
                    the fields, with other small birds, such as quails, a species of partridge,
                    woodcocks, &amp;c. The swallow which builds the edible bird-nests so much
                    esteemed by the Chinese is found here. The surrounding seas yield abundant
                    «up-plies of fish, which afford a wholesome nourishment to the inhabitants. The
                    natives take a great delight in fishing, as it flatters their natural indolence,
                    and gives them a supply of fish, which they prefer to flesh. Shells in great
                    variety are found upon the shores; amongst these are the cowries, and the
                    enormous kima cockle, so large as to hold a gallon, and used in the churches as
                    vessels for containing holy water. They have also introduced sheep, as well as
                    geese; and amongst vegetables, grapes, figs, wheat, pepper, cocoa, coffee,
                    sugar, tobacco, and various sorts of plants, which have thriven remarkably
                    well.</p>
                <p part="N">These islands contain many valuable mineral productions. In the interior
                    there are mines of gold and of iron, but they are not worked, either from a
                    deficiency of produce, or from the want of skill and industry amongst the
                    inhabitants. Gold is also procured by washing the sand which is found in the
                    mountain streams. At one place the gold mines are so indolently worked as
                    scarcely to defray the expense. The mountains abound in excellent timber, both
                    for ship and house building; and the bamboos are large and long. Some of them
                    are of the thickness of a man’s thigh; and of these the native houses are
                    constructed, after which they are covered with palm-leaves. The inhabitants also
                    raise a little cotton for clothing, which is dyed with indigo, logwood, &amp;c.
                    The other productions of the Philippines which are articles of export, consist
                    of wax, wild honey, amber, marble, tar, brimstone, and other lesser
                    articles.</p>
                <p part="N">These islands, notwithstanding their natural fertility, continue in a
                    very desolate state, which is owing partly to physical disadvantages, namely,
                    the hurricanes, which sweep across the country with wide-wasting desolation, and
                    to the destruction caused by rats, insects, and other vermin, which swarm in all
                    parts, and are a great annoyance; partly also to the indolence of the natives,
                    and to the intolerant and illiberal policy of the Spaniards. If the Chinese were
                    encouraged by an enlightened government, they would settle in great numbers in
                    these islands, and by their enterprise and industry would soon change the face
                    of the country. These islands import a variety of piece-goods, especially
                    ordinary long cloth, white, blue, and red; handkerchiefs of all kinds; chintz,
                    principally dark grounds; Surat goods of most sorts, and all kinds of European
                    cutlery and iron. The exports are the edible bird-nests, cassia, gold-dust,
                    pepper, rattans, sago, tortoise-shell, wax, wild honey, amber, marble, tar,
                    brimstone, and other articles of inferior note. The native Indians trade with
                    each other for the different productions of their country, and employ gold as
                    the medium of exchange. They likewise carry on a trade, though inconsiderable,
                    with the Chinese and the Malays of Borneo, for flag-stones, copper, and articles
                    of furniture. They are rude in their manners, and go about almost naked. These
                    islands are visited by junks which come from several parts of the Chinese
                    empire, bringing various articles for the consumption of the numerous resident
                    Chinese, and silk-goods, lackeredjvare, china-ware, and teas, for the Acapulco
                    ships. Cochineal, black wood, and dollars, constitute the returns. A trade is
                    also carried on with the British settlements, though not to any great
                    extent.</p>
                <p part="N">The Spaniards who first visited these islands spread the most
                    extraordinary and incredible tales of their inhabitants, whom they described as
                    divided into three classes, satyrs, men with tails, and sea-monsters. There were
                    only in these islands two races, the Bisayan Indians, and that strange race of
                    oriental negroes who still occupy the Papuan Isles. The latter roamed the
                    mountains almost in a state of nature, merely covering the fore-part of the body
                    with the bark of a tree, and living on roots, or on such animals as they could
                    kill with their bows and arrows, and the flesh of which they devoured raw. In
                    short, they were nearly on a level in their habits and manners with the beasts
                    of the forest. The Spaniards have succeeded in domesticating them, and
                    introducing amongst them an imperfect civilization. But their barbarous aversion
                    to labour they have never been able to conquer. They are of opinion that the
                    negroes were the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, and that the Bisayans
                    were intruders. At present the Papuans are few in number, and consequently
                    feeble; yet they retain all their original hatred to the Bisayans, whom they lie
                    in wait for and murder without remorse. There are, besides, several other races
                    who inhabit the Philippines, and differ in features, language, and manners. The
                    Pampangos reside to the north of Manilla, as also the painted races termed by
                    the Spaniards Pintados, from whom these islands were originally named Islas de
                    Pintados. The Indians found by the Spaniards in these islands were of regular
                    stature, and an olive complexion, with flat noses, large eyes, and long hair.
                    They were all governed by their chiefs, and their different villages waged an
                    everlasting war with each other. The prisoners on each side were condemned to
                    slavery. In some places a race of Indians was discovered whiter than the others,
                    the descendants, as is supposed, of Chinese who had been wrecked on the coasts,
                    and who had intermarried with Indians. The tribes of Igorrates or Ilocas, in
                    particular, have eyes resembling the Chinese. Their customs and usages mark a
                    barbarous people. They have no fixed laws. Certain traditions are the only rules
                    which they have for deciding civil suits; and criminal cases are <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193495624?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5624-0349"/>generally
                    compounded for a sum of money, unless in cases of murder, where one tribe
                    retaliates upon another, and a scene of bloody contention ensues. They are
                    permitted to have only one wife. But the principal persons have several
                    concubines, who are slaves. No great reformation of manners has been effected by
                    the Spaniards, nor have they made any great progress in the conversion of the
                    natives. The Tagala or Gala language is in general use throughout the Philippine
                    Islands. The dialects are so many and various, that the inhabitants of one
                    province are not intelligible in those of another; yet their language is all
                    derived from one common stock. Their religion is a rude species of idolatry, and
                    consists in frantic ceremonies and sacrifices to idols, of which the details
                    would be of little interest.</p>
                <p part="N">These islands were discovered in 1521, by Magelhaens, who named them the
                    Archipelago of St Lazarus. In 1565 they were taken possession of by a fleet
                    which was despatched from Mexico, in consequence of orders from Philip II. of
                    Spain, and first stopped at the island of Zebu, which was soon wholly subdued.
                    In 1570 a fleet sailed from the island of Panay for Luzon, and, after several
                    engagements with the princes of the country, effected a settlement at the mouth
                    of the Manilla River. In 1571 the Spanish admiral took possession of the town of
                    Manilla, which he constituted the capital of the Spanish possessions in the
                    Philippines, and proceeded in his reduction of the island under the Spanish
                    authority. In 1574 the existence of the Spanish settlement was threatened by a
                    Chinese pirate, who arrived with sixty-two junks; but, after many bloody
                    engagements, he was expelled, and great part of his army destroyed. Towards the
                    conclusion of the sixteenth century a considerable trade was openly carried on
                    with Japan; and many rich cargoes were brought from that country to Manilla,
                    which had now become an emporium of the trade with China, Java, the coast of
                    Coromandel, and Mexico. In 1590 the island of Sooloo was attacked by the
                    Spaniards, but they were repulsed with great slaughter by the natives; nor could
                    the Spanish maritime force make any impression on the Sooloo pirates, who have
                    continued for nearly three centuries the scourge of these seas. The number of
                    industrious Chinese had been daily increasing in the Philippines, and about the
                    year 1639 they amounted to 30,000, most of whom were settled as cultivators. The
                    Spaniards were always jealous of them, though they enriched the country by their
                    industry; and that year, in consequence of suspected disaffection, they
                    commenced a war against them, and made so dreadful a havoc amongst them, that in
                    a short time their numbers were diminished to 7000, who surrendered at
                    discretion. In 1757, the Chinese, who had again increased in the island, were
                    all banished to their own country; and, to prevent their future establishment in
                    the archipelago, the quarter of St Fernando was appropriated for the reception
                    of such Chinese as should come to the island for the purposes of commerce, and
                    regulations were made for their re-embarkation in good time, unless they should
                    be in the mean time converted to the Christian religion, in which case they were
                    permitted to settle as cultivators. In 1762, Manilla was attacked by a British
                    fleet under Admiral Cornish and General Draper, and the place was stormed on the
                    5th of October. A capitulation was agreed upon next day, when, in order to
                    redeem the city from general plunder, a ransom was agreed upon of four millions
                    of dollars. Manilla was restored to the Spaniards at the peace of 1763, and has
                    ever since remained in their possession. Besides Manilla and the larger
                    establishments in Luzon, the Spaniards have many smaller settlements scattered
                    over the islands to the southward; but such is the weakness of their government,
                    that they have never been able to protect them against the attacks of the
                    pirates who infest these seas. And so jealous of the natives are the Spanish
                    rulers of these islands, that, though unable to defend them, they do not allow
                    the natives’to possess arms, or any sort of iron, which is a royal monopoly. In
                    the year 1809 they published a declaration of their adherence to Ferdinand VII.
                    and opened their ports to the British; and since that period a free trade has
                    been carried on to a considerable extent. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f.)</hi></p>
