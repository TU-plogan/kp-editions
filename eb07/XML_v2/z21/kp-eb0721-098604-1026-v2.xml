                        Islands.</hi> The appellation of Zetland, given to this northern cluster of
                    islands, is a corruption of their ancient name. In the oldest northern
                    chronicles, as the Orkneyinga Saga, their denomination is Hialtland, <hi
                        rend="italic">the Land of the Hilt,</hi> either from some fancied
                    resemblance in the form of the whole group to the hilt of a sword, or from the
                    warlike propensities of the inhabitants. This name was corrupted by Scotish
                    writers of later times into Yetland or Zetland; the letters Z and Y having in
                    the Scotish dialect the same sound, as is well known, in proper names like
                    Menzies, Monzie, Cockenzie, and the like. The Zetland Islands, along with those
                    of Orkney, form one of the counties of Scotland. Exclusively of the small island
                    called Fair Isle, which lies midway between Orkney and Zetland, and is about
                    twenty miles distant from either cluster, they are situated in the North Sea,
                    between the parallels 59° 52' and 60° 50' north latitude. The meridian of
                    Greenwich passes through them almost at their extreme east, and they stretch to
                    2° 11' west. They are distant from Norway forty-four leagues, from Aberdeenshire
                    fortyseven, and from Leith ninety-six. In number they are more than one hundred,
                    but of these only thirty-four are inhabited. The population of the islands, by
                    the last census (1831), amounted to 29,392. “The climate of the Zetland
                    islands,” we quote from the work of Dr Edmonstone, a native of the county, “is
                    very variable and damp, although by no means generally unwholesome to their
                    inhabitants. Spring can scarcely be said to commence until April, and there is
                    but little general warmth before the middle of June. The summer terminates for
                    the most part with August, though sometimes it continues through September.
                    Autumn is a very uncertain period, and winter commences with the middle of
                    October, and occupies the remaining months of the year.”</p>
                <p part="N">Referring our readers to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Orkney</hi>
                    for the general history and present political state of the county, we shall
                    notice what appears most interesting in the principal islands.</p>
                <p part="N">The largest island, Mainland, is about sixty miles long, and varies in
                    breadth from twenty-five miles to one hundred yards; the former is the distance
                    from Sandness to the Noup of Nesting, and the latter is the breadth of the
                    isthmus called Mavis-Grind. The bold and precipitous capes called Fitful Head
                    and Sumburgh Head (both celebrated by Sir Walter Scott in his Pirate), the
                    castle of Scalloway, the green vale of Tingwall, the remains of the chapel of
                    the barons of Burgh, Ronas Hill in the parish of Northmavine, and the town of
                    Lerwick with its harbour, fort, and shipping (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Lerwick
                        ),</hi> are the most remarkable objects on the Mainland. The small islet of
                    Moussa, on the eastern coast of the Mainland, contains the most perfect
                    remaining specimen of those circular towers, with gracefully curved walls,
                    perforated by low galleries, which Scotland can boast. This is undoubtedly
                    Scandinavian, and affords a fair presumption that the similar structures in
                    Glenbeg, Dundornadilla in Sutherland, and other Highland districts, belong to
                    the same people. To the north of the Mainland lies Yell, eight miles in breadth
                    and twenty in length. It is a flat island, with much good sheep-pasture, and
                    some arable land, lying along the shores and coasts of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >vocs,</hi> or ocean inlets. In Yell are the remains of no less than twenty
                    chapels or religious houses, small unadorned buildings, in all probability
                    erected long centuries ago, as votive offerings by tempest-tossed mariners, who
                    barely escaped with life.</p>
                <p part="N">Still farther north, and somewhat to the east, is Unst, the most
                    northerly of the British islands, ten miles long and four broad. In this island
                    the law-tings or judicial assemblies of Zetland were once held. They were
                    afterwards removed to Tingwall, on the south-west side of the Mainland. In Unst
                    there is much good grazing, and very valuable arable land. At Burness, near
                    Balta Sound, in this island, Biot, and afterwards Captain Kater, in the years
                    1817 and 1818, instituted a series of experiments in order to determine the
                    variation in the length of the seconds pendulum. Chromate of iron has lately
                    been found, and in considerable quantity, in Unst, and is indeed its chief
                    treasure. South of Unst, and east from Yell, lies the small fertile island of
                    Fetlar. Eight miles south of Fetlar, and distant from the Mainland two or three
                    miles, is Whalsey. The arable land in this island has been cultivated at
                    considerable expense, and admirably improved; and the results shew what care and
                    a judicious expenditure will accomplish, even in this hyperborean region.
                    Whalsey is surrounded by holms or small islands, on one of which, about sixty
                    years ago, a Russian frigate was wrecked, and almost all on board perished.
                    Bressay, five or six miles long by three broad, lies to the east of the
                    Mainland, and the channel between the islands forms Lerwick harbour, or Bressay
                    Sound, one of the safest and most commodious havens in Britain. The principal
                    entrance is a mile wide, and the anchorage is about three miles long. Within the
                    harbour, towards the north, is the sunk rock called the Unicorn, from the vessel
                    of Kirkcaldy of Grange, which was dashed to pieces on it when in pursuit of the
                    infamous Bothwell. To the east of Bressay is the small island of Noss; and on
                    the south-east side of this island lies the holm of Noss, a rock rising almost
                    per <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1027"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-1027-0987"/>pendicularly to the height of 200 feet, and
                    having its summit covered with short rich pasture. The holm is thirty yards
                    distant from the island, and a communication has been effected and is continued
                    in the following way. A daring islander climbed the perpendicular face of the
                    holm, and drove two strong posts into the ground near the edge of the side next
                    to Noss, and a rope having been conveyed from the larger islet, was fastened to
                    these posts, and the chasm was passed. The <hi rend="italic">craigsman</hi>
                    scorned to take advantage of his success, and attempting to return by the rocks,
                    lost his footing and was dashed to pieces. The rope is annually removed before
                    winter, and the communication is re-opened generally in July. The following is
                    the mode of doing it. A stone is fastened to the <hi rend="italic">double</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">bight</hi> of a small cord, the ends of which are secured,
                    the stone is flung till the thrower succeeds in getting the attached string
                    beyond the posts on the holm. When this is accomplished, a stronger line is
                    substituted, and a still stronger one, and the process of substitution is
                    repeated, till a rope of the desired strength has been drawn round the posts,
                    and secured to corresponding stakes on Noss. A wooden box called “the cradle of
                    Noss” is then slung upon the rope, and a person getting into this, easily pushes
                    himself backwards and forwards. Dangerous as all this seems, accidents, it is
                    affirmed, seldom happen. Immense numbers of wild fowl frequent the holm, and
                    their eggs, feathers, and young ones, and the pasture afforded to about a dozen
                    sheep, are deemed a recompense sufficient for the trouble and risk encountered
                    in annually erecting this aerial bridge. Almost opposite to Bressay, on the west
                    side of the Mainland, lie the two islands of Burra, separated by a narrow
                    channel, which in one place is so contracted that a wooden bridge is thrown
                    across it to facilitate communication. The soil of these islands is in general
                    of the finest quality, and they produce what in Zetland is regarded as a large
                    quantity of grain. About the middle of the seventeenth century a Dutch squadron
                    was driven by stress of weather on the west side of Burra. Two vessels were
                    lost, but the rest of the fleet succeeded in making a harbour. To the north and
                    west of Burra, and separated from the Mainland by a narrow but troubled strait,
                    lies Papa Stour, an island two miles in length. There are several large caves in
                    this island, open to the sea, which are frequented by numerous seals. One of
                    these caves is lighted from above, by an aperture fifty feet long by twenty
                    broad. Here too may be seen, rising perpendicularly to a great height from its
                    ocean bed, the Stack of Snalaa, a magnificent rock, on the summit of which, from
                    time immemorial, the eagle has had his eyrie. In the bay of St Magnus, tower up
                    the magnificent Drongs, the perforated rocks so finely delineated by Dr Hibbert.
                    Placed far amid the melancholy main is Foula, the most westerly of the Zetland
                    Islands, and with every probability supposed to be the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Thule</hi> of the Romans. At a distance it presents the appearance of five
                    conical hills, the loftiest of which reaches a height of 1300 feet, an immense
                    elevation in appearance, there being no gradual rise, as in inland mountains.
                    “On reaching the highest ridges of the rocks,” says Dr Hibbert, “the prospect
                    presented on every side is of the sublimest description. The spectator looks
                    down from a perpendicular height of 1100 or 1200 feet, and sees below the wide
                    Atlantic roll its tide. Dense columns of birds hover through the air, consisting
                    of mews, kittywakes, lyres, sea-parrots or guillemots: the cormorants occupy the
                    lowest portions of the cliffs, the kittywakes whiten the ledges of one distant
                    cliff, gulls are found on another, and lyres on a third. The welkin is darkened
                    with their flight; nor is the sea less covered with them as they search the
                    waters in quest of food. But when the winter appears the colony is fled, and the
                    rude harmony produced by their various screams is succeeded by a desert
                    stillness. From the brink of this awful precipice the adventurous fowler is, by
                    means of a rope tied round his body, let down many fathoms; he then lands on the
                    ledges where the various sea-birds nestle, being still as regardless as his
                    ancestors of the destruction that awaits the falling of some loose stones from a
                    crag, or the untwisting of a cord. It was formerly said of a Foula-man, ‘ his
                    gutcher (grandfather) gaid before, his father gaid before, and he must expect to
                    go over the sneug too.’” Twenty miles S.S.W. from Sumburgh Head, the southern
                    extremity of the Mainland, lies the Fair Isle, two miles in length, and about
                    three-fourths of a mile in breadth. On this island the duke of Medina Sidonia,
                    the admiral of the armada, was wrecked while attempting to reach home after his
                    disastrous expedition had failed. The crews of his ship reached the shore, but
                    the islanders are said to have murdered them almost to a man, from a conviction
                    that a famine could not otherwise be warded off. The duke was spared, and having
                    wintered in Zetland, he afterwards reached Spain by way of France.</p>
                <p part="N">The natural history of Zetland differs little from that of Orkney, to
                    which we refer. The plants in both clusters of islands are, generally speaking,
                    the same; and a similar remark applies to the zoology.</p>
                <p part="N">The geology of Zetland has been discussed at great length both by
                    Professor Jameson and Dr Hibbert; and appended to Neill’s Tour in these islands
                    is a valuable paper on the subject by Professor Traill. Owing to the variety of
                    the rocks, and the easy access to them which the ocean has thrown open, Zetland
                    presents an interesting field to the mineralogist. Primitive clay-slate,
                    intermixed with a few quartz and hornblende beds, abounds in the southern parts
                    of the Mainland. Ronas Hill, and the greater portion of Northmavine, consist of
                    a hard red granite. In Foula the rocks are all micaceous schistus. Bressay and
                    Ness are composed of sandstone, and much of the shores of Yell and Unst are of
                    serpentine.</p>
                <p part="N">It is difficult to give any thing at all approaching to an estimate of
                    the trade of Zetland. Its exports are principally salted fish, oil, tallow,
                    butter, skins, stockings, cattle, sheep, and ponies. The imports are of a very
                    miscellaneous description; and as Zetland produces about one third less grain
                    than its inhabitants require, large quantities of meal and flour are annually
                    introduced.</p>
                <p part="N">The fisheries, namely, the whale-fishing at Greenland and Davis Straits,
                    and the herring and haaf or deep-sea fishings at home, employ many hands, and
                    bring much wealth into the country.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the state of agriculture in these islands it is impossible to speak
                    in very favourable terms. Shirreff in his Survey says, there is reason to
                    believe that the undivided and consequently uncultivated waste lands amount to
                    more than 400,000 acres. This immense tract is pastured in common by the tenants
                    of the adjoining arable lands, which do not exceed 25,000 acres; and in many
                    places the arable land is <hi rend="italic">runrig</hi> or interrupted. Little
                    improvement can in such circumstances be expected. Still a few spirited
                    individuals have set an example. The results of their exertions have been most
                    favourable, and are visible; and it is to be hoped that others will be prompted
                    to imitate them. Till the era of the reform bill, Zetland had no representative
                    in parliament, the landholders having no vote for the county-member. This
                    anomaly is now happily removed; and though unwilling to attach undue importance
                    to mere political changes, the writer of these remarks cannot but think, that
                    the alteration produced on the relations of landlord and tenant consequent on
                    the passing of the bill, the inducements now held out to the former to grant
                    leases of some duration, and the more frequent intercourse among themselves and
                    with strangers which an extension(in this case a creation) of the franchise
                    invariably produces; all this will operate favourably both on the commerce and
                    the agriculture of the islands. Owing to their remote situation and their
                    poverty, the lower <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1028"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-1028-0988"/>orders are more dependent on the mere will of
                    those above them than is desirable; but the great change on their political
                    state to which we have already alluded, and other causes now in operation, will,
                    we trust, diminish, if they do not remove, many of the hardships under which
                    they have hitherto laboured. By all who have visited them, the Zetlanders are
                    found to be a warm-hearted, affectionate, honest, and most hospitable people.
