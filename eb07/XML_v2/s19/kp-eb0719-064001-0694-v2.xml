                    of Khyra-bad, belonging to the nabob of Oude, situated in a bleak and desolate
                    country, without a tree or a shrub to shade the arid soil. In the vicinity is an
                    extensive lake. Sandy is twenty-five miles south-east from Furruckabad. Long.

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Sandy Desert,</hi> an extensive tract in Hindustan,
                    so named in the maps, bounded on the south by the province of Cutch, on the east
                    by that of Gujerat, on the west by Sinde, and on the north by Ajmecr. This
                    region is but little known to Europeans; but, from the accounts of those by whom
                    it has been traversed, it does not appear to be such a uniform and barren
                    wilderness as it has been represented, being interspersed with many fertile
                    spots, the seats of petty chiefships or stationary tribes. The most powerful of
                    these chiefs are the Beloochee Kosahs, who settled in the country a good many
                    years ago, and are a race of sanguinary thieves, who infest the district of
                    Parkur, and extend their ravages to the Joudpour territories. They amount to
                    about 12,000. They disown all allegiance to any superior, subsisting by their
                    horses and their swords, and hiring out their services to the different
                    predatory chieftains. The only produce of this tract is a coarse species of
                    grain, which only grows where the sandy soil is a little mixed with clay. Wa
                    termelons grow abundantly and in great perfection throughout the whole of this
                    parched region, and furnish a most grateful refreshment. The river Loonee, which
                    comes from Marwar, runs through the Gurrah district, and is said to fall into
                    the Run, which bounds Cutch to the north. The route across this tract of country
                    from Rahdunpore is fifty coss, and is said to be good the whole way. Thirty coss
                    west from Pareenuggur is situated Islamnaggur. The intervening country consists
                    of sand-hills, in traversing which the traveller is exposed to great hardship
                    from the heat, the glare, and the want of water. All over this sandy tract are
                    to be found scattered jungle, and coarse vegetation of different sorts, which
                    supply the cattle with food. Islamnaggur is described as a strong fort, situated
                    in the desert, and destitute of water without the walls. The country north from
                    Parkur, towards Amercote, is called Dhat, and the distance is eighty coss. The
                    country is of the same character as that already described, being composed of
                    sand-hills and jungle, with occasional wells. In many parts there is no
                    cultivation, and the inhabitants subsist on the produce of their numerous flocks
                    of cattle, and camels. The natives are described as pacifically inclined,
                    possessing few horses, and armed with swords only. It was in this tract that the
                    array of the celebrated Mahmoud of Ghizni was nearly lost.</p>
