                <p part="N"><label type="entry">SOAP</label>, a composition of caustic, fixed
                    alkaline salt, and oil, sometimes hard and dry, sometimes soft and liquid; much
                    used in washing, whitening linens, and by dyers and fullers. Soap may be made by
                    several methods, which however all depend upon the same principle. The soap
                    which is used in medicine is made without heat.</p>
                <p part="N">In manufactures where large quantities of itare prepared, soap is made
                    with heat. A lixivium of quicklime and soda is made, but is less concentrated
                    than that above referred to, and only so much that it can sustain a fresh egg. A
                    part of this lixivium is to be even diluted and mixed with an equal weight of
                    oil of olives. The mixture is to be put on a gentle fire, and agitated, that the
                    union may be accelerated. When this mixture begins to unite well, the rest of
                    the lixivium is to be added to it; and the whole is to be digested with a very
                    gentle heat, till the soap be completely made. A trial is to be made of it, to
                    examine whether the just proportion of oil and alkali has been observed. Good
                    soap of this kind ought to be firm, and very white when cold; not subject to
                    become moist by exposure to air, and entirely miscible with pure water, to which
                    it communicates a milky appearance, but without any drops of oil floating on the
                    surface. When the soap has not these qualities, the combination has not been
                    well managed, or the quantity of salt or oil is too great, which faults must be
                    corrected.</p>
                <p part="N">In soft or liquid soaps, green or black soaps, cheaper oils are
                    employed, as oil of nuts, of hemp, of fish, &amp;c. These soaps, excepting in
                    consistence, are not essentially different from white soap. Fixed alkalies are
                    much disposed to unite with oils that are not volatile, both vegetable and
                    animal, since this union can be made even without heat. The compound resulting
                    from this union partakes at the same time of the properties of oil and of
                    alkali; but these properties are modified and tempered by each other, according
                    to the general rule of combinations. Alkali formed into soap has not nearly the
                    same acrimony as when it is pure; it is even deprived of almost all its
                    causticity, and its other saline alkaline properties are almost entirely
                    abolished. The same oil contained in soap is less combustible than when pure,
                    from its union with the alkali, which is an inflammable body. It is miscible, or
                    even soluble, in water, to a certain degree, by means of the alkali. Soap is
                    entirely soluble in spirit of wine; and still better in aquavitae sharpened by a
                    little alkaline salt, according to an observation of Mr. Geoffroy.</p>
                <p part="N">The manufacture of soap in London first began in the year 1524; before
                    which time this city was served with white soap from foreign countries, and with
                    gray soap speckled with white from Bristol, which was sold for a penny a pound;
                    and also with black soap, which sold for a halfpenny a pound.</p>
                <p part="N">Concerning the decomposition of soap by means of acids, we must observe,
                    first, that all acids, even the weakest vegetable acids, may occasion this
                    decomposition, because every one of them has a greater affinity than oil with
                    fixed alkali. Secondly, these acids, even when united with any basis, excepting
                    fixed alkali, are capable of occasioning the same decomposition; whence all
                    ammoniacal salts, all salts with bases of earth, and all those with metallic
                    bases, are capable of decomposing soap, in the same manner as disengaged acids
                    are; with this difference, that the oil separated from the fixed alkali, by the
                    acid of these salts, may unite more or less intimately with the substance which
                    was the basis of the neutral salt employed for the decomposition.</p>
                <p part="N">Soap may also be decomposed by distillation, as Lemery has shown. When
                    first exposed to fire, it yields a phlegm called by him a <hi rend="italic"
                        >spirit;</hi> which nevertheless is neither acid nor alkaline, but some
                    water which enters into the composition of soap. It becomes more and more
                    coloured and empyreumatic as the fire is increased, which shows that it contains
                    the most subtle part of the oil. It seems even to raise along with it, by help
                    of the oil and action of the fire, a small part of the alkali of the soap: for,
                    as the same chemist observes, it occasions a precipitate in a solution of
                    corrosive sublimate. After this phlegm the oil rises altered, precisely as if it
                    had been distilled from quicklime, that is, empyreumatic, soluble in spirit of
                    wine, at first sufficiently subtle and afterwards thicker. An alkaline residuous
                    coal remains in the retort, consisting chiefly of the mineral alkali contained
                    in the soap, and which may be disengaged from the coal by calcination in an open
                    fire, and obtained in its pure state.</p>
                <p part="N">Alkaline soaps arc very useful in many arts and trades, and also in
                    chemistry and medicine. Their principal utility consists in a detersive quality
                    that they receive from their alkali, which, although it is in some measure
                    saturated with oil, is yet capable of acting upon oily matters, and of rendering
                    them saponaceous and miscible with water. Hence soap is very useful to cleanse
                    any substances from all fat matters with which they happen to be soiled. Soap is
                    therefore daily used for the washing and whitening of linen, for<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=499" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0499-0433"
                    /> the cleansing of woollen cloths from oil, and for whitening silk and freeing
                    it from the resinous varnish with which it is naturally covered. Pure alkaline
                    lixiviums being capable of dissolving oils more effectually than soap, might be
                    employed for the same purposes; but when this activity is not mitigated by oil,
                    as it is in soap, they are capable of altering, and even of destroying entirely,
                    by their causticity, most substances, especially animal matters, as silk, wool,
                    and others; whereas soap cleanses from oil almost as effectually as pure alkali,
                    without danger of altering or destroying; a circumstance which renders it very
                    useful.</p>
                <p part="N">Soap was imperfectly known to the ancients. It is mentioned by Pliny as
                    made of fat and ashes, and as an invention of the Gauls. Aretaeus and others
                    inform us, that the Greeks obtained their knowledge of its medical use from the
                    Romans.</p>
