                    Scotish lawyer, was the second son of James Skene of Ramore, and of Janet the
                    second daughter of Alexander Burnet of Leys. He thus derived his lineage from
                    the ancient family of Skene of Skene. We may place his birth about the year
                    1540. He is said to have been partly educated at King’s College, Aberdeen; but
                    he is known to have been incorporated at St. Andrews in the year 1556; and in
                    this university he took the degree of A.M. In 1564 and 1565 he taught as one of
                    the regents of St. Mary’s College. According to Dempster, he spent a great part
                    of his youth in Norway, Denmark, and Poland, and had thus an opportunity of

                    in Switzerland in 1568, and that he was at Cracow in Poland during the following

                    annual pension from the elector of Saxony, and imbued with some knowledge of the
                    civil law. He appears to have begun his travels in 1567, and to have returned in

                    his native country, he finally made choice of the legal profession, and was
                    admitted as an advocate on the 19th of March 1575. He speedily acquired some
                    degree of distinction as a lawyer.</p>
                <p part="N">The earl of Morton, then regent of the kingdom, had formed a plan for
                    reducing the laws into a more easy form and method. The execution of the plan
                    was committed to Skene and to Sir James Balfour, president of the court of
                    session. Among other ostensible coadjutors, we find Lord Glammis, chancellor,
                    Lord Ruthven, and William Baillie of Provand, who likewise attained to the
                    dignity of president. The only result of this commission is supposed to have
                    been the compilation of a book which passes under the title of Sir James
                    Balfour’s Practicks. “If I might be allowed to indulge in conjecture,” says Mr.
                    Thomson, “I should be inclined to suppose, that the conception or project of
                    this digest of the laws may have originated with Balfour; that his own exile
                    afterwards precluded him from continuing to take any part in its execution; that
                    the active drudgery of the proposed investigation was devolved upon younger men;
                    and that the unfinished result of their labours is perhaps no other than the
                    volume of Practicks to which the name of Sir James Balfour has been
                    traditionally annexed.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    interpolated; for, as Lord Hailes has remarked, it mentions certain acts of
                    parliament, and the names of certain peers, that did not exist till after the
                    death of Balfour. Of this compilation, which was not printed till 1754, the
                    value has never been highly estimated. The labours of Skene, whatever may have
                    been their nature or extent, were, on the 10th of June 1577, rewarded by the
                    grant of an annual pension of “ten chalders of meal,” payable out of the
                    revenues of the abbey of Aberbrothock.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1589 he was employed in another capacity. Sir James Melville
                    was selected by the king as his ambassador to the court of Denmark, for the
                    purpose of negoci∙ ating a marriage with a Danish princess; and he required the
                    advice and assistance of a lawyer, with a special reference to the Danish claims
                    on Orkney. “When I schew his maieste,” says Melville, “that I wald tak with me,
                    for man of law, Mester Jhon Skein, his maieste thocht then that ther wer many

                    five years, he published “The Lawes and Actes of Parliament maid be King lames

                    our present mode of reckoning, the book was published in the year 1598. With a
                    separate title, it includes a treatise “De Verborum Significatione. The

                <p part="N">In September 1594 he had been appointed to the office of Clerk Register,
                    in the room of Alexander Hay of Easter Kennet, whom he also succeeded as one of
                    the Judges of the Court of Session. He was admitted on the 30th of November. For
                    his preferment he is said to have been indebted to the influence of Walter
                    Stewart, prior of Blantyre, who had married a sister of Skene’s wife, Helen the
                    daughter of Sir James Somerville of Cambusnethan. In 1596 he was nominated one
                    of the commissioners of the exchequer, commonly described as the Octavians; but
                    being viewed by the people as a dangerous junto, they relinquished their office
                    in the course of the following year. In 1604 he was associated with other
                    commissioners for discussing the terms of a union between the two kingdoms.</p>

                    presented to parliament, and having been highly approved, was ordered to be
                    printed. With the view of defraying the expense, and procuring some remuneration
                    to the editor, a sum of money was ordered to be paid by the sherifls, bailies,
                    stewards, and other judges, and likewise by the prelates, earls, lords, and
                    boroughs of the kingdom. A commission was appointed for the purpose of fixing
                    the rate of the different contributions. James Carmichael, minister of
                    Haddington, was selected as the fittest person for correcting the press; and on
                    the 13th of October 1608, the privy council requested the presbytery to grant
                    him leave of absence for the period of about two months.<note anchored="true"

                <p part="N">The labours of Sir John Skene were highly valued by his contemporaries,
                    who must have found them useful at a period when so little had been effected for
                    illustrating either the principles or the history of our law. It is not however
                    to be concealed that his publications are deficient in critical accuracy, and
                    even in editorial fidelity. It is well known that the treatise “De Legibus et
                    Consuetudinibus Regni Angliae,” commonly ascribed to Glanville, was at an early
                    period adopted in Scotland, with a few changes and modifications; and that,
                    under this new form, it bears the title of <hi rend="italic">Begiam
                        Majestatem,</hi> from the initial words of the prologue. Ranulph Glanville
                    was chief justice of England during the reign of Henry the Second, and he still
                    retained his office when Richard succeeded to the throne.<note anchored="true"

                    Ranulpho de Glanvilla ;” an inscription which by no means describes the chief
                    justice as the author. From these words, says Lord Lyttelton, I infer that the
                    book was not written by Glanville himself, “but by some clergyman, under his
                    direction and care; I say clergyman, because it is written in Latin, which could
                    hardly be done but by a clergyman of that age.”<note anchored="true"

                    was however anxious to exhibit <hi rend="italic">Begiam Majestatem</hi> as the
                    original, and to represent it as having been composed and divulged by the
                    authority of David the First, who closed his reign in the year 1153. From what
                    manuscripts he derived his text, he has not thought proper to specify; but
                    several are to be found which contain a reference to Glanville by name. Henry,
                    under whom he acted as chief justice, did not begin his reign till the year
                    1154. Lord Cromarty’s MS. contains references to the gloss on the Decretals of
                    Gregory IX. and to the Decretals of Boniface VIII.<note anchored="true"

                    1227 to 1241; that of Boniface from 1294 to 1303. It is sufficiently evident
                    that a writer in the reign of David could not quote such authorities. Of this
                    circumstance Skene was sufficiently aware; and the passages which refer to
                    Glanville and the canon law are silently excluded from his edition. This is not
                    merely a defect in literary accuracy; it is a want of that ordinary fidelity
                    which every editor is bound to exercise. If he had excluded such passages from
                    the text, and stated in the notes his reasons for rejecting them as spurious,
                    his conduct would not have been liable to censure.</p>

                    afterwards successively earl of Melrose and of Haddington. “Thinking to get his
                    son provided to his office,” says Spotswood, he “had sent him to court with a
                    dimission of the place, but with a charge not to use it, unless he found the
                    king willing to admit him: yet he, abused by some politick wits, made a
                    resignation of the office, accepting an ordinary place among the Lords of
                    Session. The office upon his resignation was presently disponed to the advocate;
                    which grieved the father beyond all measure. And the case indeed was pitiful,
                    and much regrated by all honest men; for he had been a man much employed, and
                    honoured with divers legations, which he discharged with good credit, and now in
                    age to be circumvented in this sort by the simplicity or folly of his son, 'twas
                    held lamentable. The king being informed of the abuse by the old mans complaint,
                    was very careful to satisfie him, and to have the son reconciled to his father,
                    which after some travel was brought to pass: yet so exceeding was the old man’s
                    discontent, as within a few days he deceased.”<note anchored="true"

                    fatal. Skene resigned his office in the year 1612, and he survived till the 16th
                    of March 1617.</p>

                    Curriehill and Redhall in the county of Edinburgh, and Edinganoch in the county
                    of Aberdeen. His title on the bench was Lord Curriehill. His son Sir James Skene
                    succeeded him on the 12th of June 1612, and became president of the Court of
                    Session on the 14th of February 1626. On the 15th of October 1633, he died in
                    his own house near the grammar school. The second son, named John, was appointed
                    one of the principal clerks of Session in 1614. He purchased the estate of
                    Hallyards. About twenty years ago, his last descendant, Elizabeth Skene,
                    bequeathed to the Advocates Library a collection of family papers, together with
                    a very curious collection of ancient music, which appears to have belonged to
                    this ancestor. The <hi rend="italic">Shene Papers</hi> have been carefully bound
                    in a folio volume; and the music has very recently been published by Mr. Dauney,
                    who has added a copious and elaborate introduction, together with notes and

                    clerk of the registration of hornings. Beside these three sons, he had four
                    daughters. The eldest daughter became the wife of Alexander Hay of Fosterseat, a
                    judge and privy councillor. The second daughter was married to Sir William Scott
                    of Ardross; the third to Robert Lermont, advocate, brother to Lermont of

                    magistrates of Edinburgh for attending mass, but was released at the
