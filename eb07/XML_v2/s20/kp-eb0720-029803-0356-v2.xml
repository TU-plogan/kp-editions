                    river Rubas; and forms a large triangular peninsula, the point of which
                    stretches into the Caspian. From its form it varies extremely in breadth, which,
                    at the extremity of the peninsula on the Rubas, is scarcely sixteen miles; near
                    Kuba it amounts to forty; from the mouth of the Ata it is above fifty; while in
                    the interior part it amounts to 160. It has the Caspian to the east; Daghestan
                    to the north; the Kur and the plains of Mogam to the south and south-west, being
                    separated by the river Kur from the provinces of Ghilan and Azerbijan; and the
                    kingdom of Georgia to the north-west. The northern part of this province
                    consists of a plain, which is formed by the mountains that extend toward the sea
                    near Derbend, and which, gradually receding behind that city, approach again in
                    a circular form near the sea at the mouth of the river Ata. Numerous streams,
                    issuing from the mountains, greatly contribute to fertilize this plain, and, at
                    the same time, to secure it against the access of an invading army. They branch
                    off in various directions, and being generally mountain-streams, are uncommonly
                    rapid, though they are shallow, with a wide channel, and a rough and sandy bed.
                    The plain is interspersed with small woods and clumps of bushes, and the
                    villages are surrounded with orchards, vineyards, and plantations of mulberries.
                    The second division of Schirvan extends on one side along the coast from the Ata
                    to the plains watered by the Kur; and on the other it is bounded by the higher
                    range of mountains, which run in a south-east course through the province. The
                    length of this district is about eighty miles; but as the coast projects
                    considerably, the breadth varies. The higher portions of the country are here
                    the most fertile; the part towards the sea is barren, being devoid of water; and
                    to the north of Baku is a desert tract of about fifty miles. The plain along the
                    left of the Kur is about 140 miles in length, and from forty to fifty in
                    breadth. The district is in a great degree surrounded with mountains, and, being
                    exposed to frequent inundations, is overgrown with rushes to a considerable
                    distance. The most elevated division of Schirvan is that which extends from the
                    Rubas to Lesgestan. This tract varies much in breadth, and is intersected by
                    narrow valleys, in many of which are small lakes, which continue filled even in
                    the greatest heat of summer. This province is abundantly watered by streams,
                    which fall, some into the Caspian, and others into the Kur. The most
                    considerable are the Samur, Deli, Sagaite, and Persagat. This province was
                    annexed to Persia in the year 1500, and continued subject to that empire till
                    the decline of the Sefi dynasty, when the native princes, taking advantage of
                    the weakness of Persia, re-established their independence. Of late, however, the
                    Russians have obtained possession of the sea-coast, though the interior is still
                    in the hands of the native chiefs. The principal towns are Schamachi, the
                    capital, and Baku.</p>
