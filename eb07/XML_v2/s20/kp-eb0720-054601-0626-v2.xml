                    was born at Amsterdam the 24th November 1632. His father was a Jew of Portugal,
                    and by profession a merchant. After being taught Latin by a physician, the son
                    applied himself for many years to the study of theology, and afterwards devoted
                    himself entirely to philosophy. He began very early to be dissatisfied with the
                    Jewish religion; and as his temper was open, he did not conceal his doubts from
                    the synagogue. The Jews, it is said, offered to tolerate his infidelity, and
                    even promised him a pension of a thousand dollars per annum, if he would remain
                    in their society, and continue outwardly to practise their ceremonies. But if
                    this offer was really made, he rejected it, perhaps from his aversion to
                    hypocrisy, or rather be cause he could not endure the restraint which it would
                    have imposed. He also refused being constituted heir to an independent fortune,
                    to the prejudice of the natural claimants; and he learned the art of polishing
                    glass for spectacles, that he might be enabled to maintain himself by the labour
                    of his own hands.</p>
                <p part="N">His retreat from the synagogue was hastened by an alarming incident. As
                    he was returning home one evening from the theatre, he was stabbed by a Jew: the
                    wound was slight, but the attempt naturally led Spinoza to conclude that the
                    Jews had formed the design of assassinating him. After leaving the synagogue he
                    professedly became a Chris tian, and frequented the churches of the Lutherans
                    and Calvinists. He now devoted himself more than ever to his favourite
                    philosophical speculations; and finding himself frequently interrupted by the
                    visits of his friends, he left Amsterdam, and settled at the Hague, where he
                    often continued for three months together without ever stirring from his
                    lodging. During his residence in that city, his hostess, who was a Lutheran,
                    asked him one day if she could be saved while she continued in her religion?
                    “Yes,” replied</p>
                <p part="N">Spinoza, “provided you join to your religion a peaceable and virtuous
                    life.” From this answer, it has been concluded, that he was a Christian in
                    appearance only, while in reality he regarded all religions as indifferent. But
                    this conclusion would be too severe, even if the woman had been a Mahommedan.
                    His “Tractatus theologico-politicus”(Hamb. 1670, 4to.) is a better proof of his
                    insincerity than a thou sand such conclusions; for this book contains all those
                    doc trines in embryo which were afterwards unfolded in his posthumous works, and
                    which are generally considered as a system of atheism. His fame, which had now
                    spread far and wide, obliged him sometimes to interrupt his philosophical reve
                    ries. Learned men visited him from all quarters. While the prince of Condé
                    commanded the French army in Utrecht, he intreated Spinoza to visit him; and
                    though he was ab sent when the philosopher arrived, he immediately retum ed and
                    spent a considerable time with him in conversation. The elector Palatine offered
                    to make Spinoza professor of philosophy at Heidelberg; but this offer he thought
                    it expedient to decline. He died of consumption at the Hague on the 21st
                    February 1677, at the age of forty-five. His life was a perpetual contradiction
                    to his opinions. He was temperate, liberal, and remarkably disinterested; he was
                    sociable, affable, and friendly. His conversation was agreeable and instructive,
                    and never deviated from the strictest propriety.</p>

                    Posthuma.” [Arastelodami] 1677, 4to. A collective edition of his works has been
                    published in the course of the present century: “Benedicti de Spinoza Opera quae

                    considered as the author of a tract entitled “Lucii Antistii Constantis de Jure
                    Ecclesiasticorum liber singularis.” Alethopoli, 1666, 8vo. It has also been
                    ascribed to Meyer, his friend and physician; but Leibnitz believed the author to
