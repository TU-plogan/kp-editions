                    an eminent antiquary, descended from an ancient family in Lincolnshire, was born
                    at Holbech in that county, on the 7th of November 1687. From the free school of
                    his native town he was removed to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he
                    was admitted on the 7th of November 1703. Having chosen the medical profession,
                    he took the degree of Μ. B. in 1709, and that of Μ. D. in 1719. He first settled
                    as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> practitioner at Boston; but in 1717 be removed to
                    London, and was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians in 1720. By the
                    recommendation of Dr Mead, he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society. He
                    contributed to the re-establishment of the Society of Antiquaries; of which he
                    officiated as secretary for many years. In 1726 he left the metropolis, and
                    settled at Grantham in Lincolnshire, where he soon obtained extensive practice.
                    In 1728 he married Frances, the daughter of Robert Williamson, Esq. of
                    Allington, a lady of good family and fortune. Being much afflicted with the
                    gout, he found the exercise of his profession very laborious, and therefore
                    meditated a retreat into the church. On the 20th of July 1720, being then in the
                    thirty-third year of his age, he received ordination from Archbishop Wake; and
                    in the ensuing October was presented by the lord-chancellor King to the living
                    of All-Saints in Stamford. He became a widower in 1737, and, in the course of
                    the following year, married the only daughter of Dr Gale, the learned dean of
                    York. In 1739 the living of Somerby near Grantham was bestowed upon him by the
                    duke of Ancaster. In 1747 the duke of Montagu presented him to the rectory of St
                    George, Queen Square, and he then vacated his other benefices. He survived till
                    the 3d of March 1765. On the 27th of the preceding month, he had been struck
                    with palsy, after attending a full vestry on a contested election for a
                    lecturer. The apartment was much heated; and on returning through his garden,
                    accompanied by Serjeant Eyre, “they both caught their deaths, for the serjeant
                    never was abroad again, and the doctor’s illness came on that night.” By his
                    first wife Dr Stukeley bad three daughters, one of whom died young, and the
                    other two survived him. The one was married to Mr Richard Fleming, an eminent
                    solicitor, and the other to the Rev. Thomas Fairchild, rector of Pitsey in
                    Essex. They both died in 1782. Of his second marriage there was no issue.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Stukeley was a man of varied learning, but was chiefly distinguished
                    by his knowledge of antiquities. His writings are numerous, and partly relate to
                    medical, as well as theological subjects; but we shall confine ourselves to an
                    enumeration of the most important or curious of his antiquarian publications. An
                    Account of a Roman Temple near Graham's Dike. 1720, 4to. Of the Roman
                    Amphitheater at Dorchester. Lond. 1723, 4to. <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium

                    refers to the year 1783, or some period subsequent to the appearance of the
                    English Review. The degree had very honourably been conferred upon Stuart many
                    years before; and Julin Whitaker, on whom it was never conferred, was a B. D. of
