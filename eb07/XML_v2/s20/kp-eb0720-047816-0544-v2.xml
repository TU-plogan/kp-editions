                    These isles, about sixty in number, derive their name from Sooloo, the principal
                    island in the group. They form a chain which extends in a northeast and
                    southwest direction, from the northeastern extremity of Borneo to the western
                    extremity of Magindanao, and from the 4th to the 7th degrees of north latitude.
                    The island of Sooloo is about thirty miles in length by twelve in average
                    breadth, and contains 60,000 inhabitants. It lies midway between the islands of
                    Borneo and Magindanao, is well cultivated, and affords a fine prospect from the
                    sea; nor has it any certain rainy seasons, like the other Malay islands. This is
                    owing to the moderate height of the hills not intercepting the clouds in their
                    passage from the sea. Most rain falls, however, during the southwest monsoon,
                    and also at the change of the monsoon, especially the au tumnal. But these
                    changes are not followed by any storms, and very seldom at any other time, so
                    that the island enjoys almost a perpetual summer. There are several good
                    harbours among these islands, particularly at Bewabewa, Tavitave, Tappool,
                    Secassee, between Boobooan and Tap peantana, south of Basselan. The harbour of
                    Bewan, the capital of Sooloo, is not good, except during the southwest monsoon.
                    This place is situated on the seacoast, on the northwest part of the island, and
                    is of considerable size. The houses are built after the manner of the Malays,
                    elevated about four feet from the ground with bamboos, of which the floors also
                    are made. The island of Sooloo being small in proportion to its population,
                    habits of industry prevail, and great attention is paid to agriculture. Rice is
                    planted; but it is a precarious crop, owing to the uncertainty of the rains.
                    Many roots are in consequence cultivated in its stead, namely, the Spanish or
                    sweet potatoe, and yams of different species. They have abundance and variety of
                    every species of tropical fruit. The oranges are equal in quality to those in
                    China: they have also a fruit called jack or nanka, durians, a kind of large
                    custard apple, called madang, mangoes, mangustines, rambustines, and a fruit
                    they call bolona, like a large plum or mangoe, white inside. The trees in the
                    woods are loaded with fruits, which ripen well, and are not injured by too much

                    the Chinese that are among them, have learned from them the art of gardening;
                    and they ingraft and improve their fruits.</p>
                <p part="N">Wild elephants are to be found in the woods; which is a remarkable
                    circumstance, considering that the island is small and populous. Spotted deer,
                    goats, and black cattle, are also abundant. Wild hogs abound, and do much
                    mischief; but the natives have few sheep. They have, how ever, a good breed of
                    horses, which are trained to trot, but not to gallop. After harvest the
                    inhabitants hunt both the elephants and the wild hogs, with a view to destroy
                    them.</p>
                <p part="N">The island of Sooloo was formerly the centre of an extensive trade, and
                    was frequented by ships from Japan, which imported silver, amber, silks, chests,
                    cabinets, and other curiosities made of fragrant woods, besides great quantities
                    of silks and porcelain from China. It was also visited by vessels from Java,
                    Sumatra, Ceylon, and the coast of Coromandel, with valuable cargoes. This trade
                    has greatly declined. The intercourse with China is now confined to two junks,
                    which arrive annually from Amoy with cargoes of brass salvers, iron, sugarcandy,
                    raw silk, black nankeen, white linen of a strong fabric, china ware, flowered
                    silks, besides tea, cutlery and other hard ware, brass wire, gongs, beads of all
                    colours, little swan-shot, fireworks, &amp;c. In return they export to China
                    biche de mer, black and white wax, pearl-oyster shells, bird-nests, and
                    tortoiseshell; also a seaweed used as gum or glue, and other articles, such as
                    Carooang oil, clovebark, black wood, ratans, sago, various barks for dyeing,
                    cassia, pepper, native camphire, sandalwood, curious shells for grottoes,
                    pearls, and spices. These islands are also occasionally visited by country
                    ships, which import articles of European manufacture, such as brasiery, cutlery,
                    cloth, gunpowder, firearms, manufactures in glass, iron, opium, piece-goods,
                    saltpetre, shot, swords, tin ware, watches, sugar, tobacco, &amp;c. From Borneo
                    are imported sago, biche de mer, cowries, and tortoiseshell. Rice is imported
                    from Magindanao, and is paid for with Chinese goods. Cotton manufactures from
                    Celebes complete the list of imports. There is a famous pearl-fishery at Sooloo
                    and the neighbouring islands.</p>
                <p part="N">These islands are governed by a hereditary prince or sultan, whose power
                    is, however, counterbalanced by the nobles. The Sooloos seldom venture from home
                    in their own vessels, except for the purpose of predatory excursions to make
                    slaves among the Philippine Islands. They are warlike in their habits, though
                    they depend less on firearms than on the lance, sword, and dagger, in the use of
                    which they are very dexterous. The inhabitants have reached a higher stage of
                    civilization than is generally attained in the Asiatic islands. The women are
                    not strictly confined, as in many Mahommedan countries. In their houses are
                    domesticated many Philippine and some Spanish slaves, who are purchased from the
                    Illanos and Magindanese cruisers. Not withstanding their boasted civilization,
                    murder is a crime extremely common among them, and occurs on the least
                    provocation. In 1800 they treacherously assassinated the captain of a country
                    ship, and his boat’s crew; and afterwards made an attack on the ship, but were
                    repulsed.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the early history of these islanders little is known. They assert,
                    that they once formed a part of an ancient Bornean empire, founded by the
                    Chinese. But the Magindanese assert that they were formerly subject to them.
                    From the period when the Spaniards obtained possession of the Philippines, they
                    have been engaged in a constant warfare with the Sooloos, but with little
                    advantage to them selves, being always repelled in their attempts to obtain
                    possession of these islands.</p>
