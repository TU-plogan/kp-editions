                    opened up vast stores of mineral wealth to assist in the advancement of
                    civilization and industry, which our former impotence and want of skill had
                    marked with the stigma of utter unproductiveness. It is therefore necessary that
                    we give in this article, as supplementary to our former treatise, an account of
                    the new process, now well known over the whole manufacturing world as the <hi
                        rend="italic">hot-blast process</hi> for smelting iron.<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=473" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0473-0407"
                    /> The hot-blast process was invented in Scotland by Mr. James Beaumont Neilson,
                    a practical engineer at Glasgow, and was by him made the subject of a patent,
                    dated September 1828, being entitled, an “improved application of air, to
                    produce heat in fires, forges, and furnaces, where bellows and other blowing
                    apparatus are required.”</p>
                <p part="N">The invention of Mr. Neilson, like a great many other inventions, and
                    indeed some of the most valuable, is characterized by extreme simplicity; and
                    his invention so perfectly accords with all the known laws of physics, that we
                    at once apply to it the well known exclamation of wonder, “how strange! that a
                    thing so obvious should not have been done long before !” an exclamation in
                    which we too often find ourselves doing an act of injustice to the very
                    inventors to whom we lie under the weightiest obligations. Mr. Neilson’s hot
                    blast is as simple a contrivance as was the steamengine condenser of his
                    countryman, Mr. Watt, and indeed bears a very close analogy to its character as
                    an invention. Before the time of Mr. Watt, steam was introduced into that part
                    of the steam-engine where it performed its labour, and was then condensed into
                    water in the same place where it had done its duty, thereby causing great waste
                    of fuel and loss of power; and to remedy this defect, Watt introduced his new
                    principle on which his fame rests; he used a <hi rend="italic">separate
                        condenser,</hi> that is, cooled the steam, and reconverted it into water,
                    not in the cylinder, where it was detrimental, but in a separate vessel
                    communicating with it. In like manner, Mr. Neilson's invention consists in
                    separately heating that which was formerly done so as to be injurious to the
                    process intended. Cold air was blown into a furnace designed to produce intense
                    heat for the smelting of iron from ore, so that the cold blast of air itself
                    required to be heated by the fuel in the furnace intended to smelt the iron, and
                    so its temperature was cooled down by the very intensity of the blast required
                    for the desired combustion. To remedy this defect, Mr. Neilson introduced his
                    new principle of hot blast; and instead of allowing this blast of cold air to
                    enter at once from the blowing machine or bellows into the furnace, to be heated
                    there, he provided a <hi rend="italic">separate heating apparatus,</hi> by which
                    the air of the blast was to be heated by a separate furnace and fire, previously
                    to its entrance into the smelting furnace. This is the whole invention. A hot
                    blast of air, instead of a cold one, is thus introduced for the generation of
                    heat. Could any thing be more simple, more natural, more appropriate, or more
                    likely to prove effectual? This is the hot blast, which has already in this and
                    other countries created many millions of valuable property out of what was
                    formerly worthless, because unavailable by any of the processes formerly
                    known.</p>
                <p part="N">Like most other inventions, the progress of this was at first very slow.
                    Retarded by practical difficulties, which beset all new processes in their first
                    use, by men who have every thing to learn,—stopped every now and then by the
                    prejudices of custom and ignorance, which cling with inveterate tenacity to
                    maxims of established practice, and repel equally the innovations which improve
                    and those which merely alter without improvement,—opposed also by the change of
                    interests which such a revolution must necessarily involve; the invention, tardy
                    in its first steps, and feeble in its early efforts, was more than once at the
                    point of being altogether abandoned. Like the invention of Watt, a great part of
                    the interest in its possible remuneration was transferred by the inventor to
                    strangers, whose combined efforts and influence it was necessary to obtain on
                    the side of the innovation. To Mr. Dunlop of Clyde iron-works Mr. Neilson had to
                    give up three-tenths of his patent rights; to Mr. Mackintosh three-tenths; and
                    one-tenth to Mr. Wilson of Dundivan, retaining to himself only three-tenths of
                    this valuable monopoly. But the transfer was judicious; it was necessary. Mr.
                    Mackintosh is distinguished as a man of much practical science; Mr.Dunlop was
                    one of the most sagacious iron-masters of his time; and Mr. Wilson was a man of
                    tried practical talent. The co-operation of these gentlemen was essential to the
                    speedy and successful trial of the novel though simple process.</p>
                <p part="N">The following is the specification of Mr. Neilson’s patent: “I, James
                    Beaumont Neilson, do hereby declare, that the nature of my said invention for
                    the improved application of air to produce heat in fires, forges, and furnaces,
                    where bellows or other blowing apparatus are required, and the manner in which
                    the same is to be performed are particularly described and ascertained as
                    follows: That is to say, a blast or current of air must be produced by bellows
                    or other blowing apparatus in the ordinary way, to which mode of producing the
                    blast or current of air this patent is not intended to extend. The blast or
                    current of air so produced is to be passed <hi rend="italic">from the bellows or
                        blowing apparatus into an air vessel or receptacle, made sufficiently strong
                        to endure the blast, and through and from that vessel or receptacle, by
                        means of a tube, pipe, or aperture into the fire, forge, or furnace.</hi>
                    The air vessel or receptacle must be air-tight, or nearly so, except the
                    apertures for the admission and emission of the air; and at the commencement,
                    and during the continuance of the blast, it must be kept <hi rend="italic"
                        >artificially heated to a considerable temperature.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">“It is better that the temperature be kept to a red heat, or nearly so;
                    but so high a temperature is not absolutely necessary to produce a beneficial
                    effect. The air-vessel or receptacle may be conveniently made of iron; but as
                    the effect does not depend upon the nature of the material, other metals or
                    convenient materials may be used. The size of the air vessel must depend upon
                    the blast, and on the heat necessary to be produced. For an ordinary smith’s
                    fire or forge, an air vessel or receptacle, capable of containing 1200 cubic
                    inches, will be of proper dimensions; and for a cupola of the usual size for
                    cast-iron founders, an air-vessel capable of containing 10,000 cubic inches will
                    be of a proper size. For fires, forges, or furnaces, upon a greater scale, such
                    as blast-furnaces for smelting iron, and large cast-iron founders’ cupolas,
                    air-vessels of proportionably increased dimensions and numbers are to be
                    employed. The form or shape of the vessel or receptacle is immaterial to the
                    effect, and may be adapted to the local circumstances or situation. The
                    air-vessel may generally be conveniently heated by a fire, distinct from the
                    fire to be affected by the blast or current of air, and generally it will be
                    better that the air-vessels and the fire by which it is heated should be
                    inclosed in brick-work or masonry, through which the pipes or tubes connected
                    with the air-vessel should pass. The manner of applying the heat to the
                    air-vessel is, however, immaterial to the effect if it be kept at a proper
                    temperature. In witness whereof, I, the said James Beaumont Neilson, have
                    hereunto set my hand and seal, the 28th day of February, in the year of our Lord
                    1829.”</p>
                <p part="N">The only part of the process of smelting the iron which is at all
                    affected by this novelty, is the transit of the air from the blowing machinery
                    into the smelting furnace. The bellows, steam-engine, water-wheel, blowing
                    cylinders, equalizing reservoirs, or other apparatus of whatever sort, for
                    producing the current of air to blow the fire, are left unchanged, as we have
                    already described and figured them in our article on <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Iron</hi>. The furnace may be left of its former shape and dimensions in
                    every respect as used in the old process, and as we formerly described them; all
                    that is required for the introduction of the new process, is to interpose
                    between the smelting furnace and the blowing machinery an oven, heated by a
                    separate fire, through which, in appropriately shaped vessels or pipes, the
                    blast of air on its way to the furnace may be heated to a considerable
                    temperature,—400°, 600º, or any temperature found most suitable to the purpose,
                    and so blown upon the incandescent fuel in the furnace in a hot blast, as
                    distinguished from the ordinary cold blast of atmospheric air.</p>
                <p part="N">The consequences of this hot blast system in an econo<pb break="no"

                    /> mic point of view, may be illustrated by the following experimental
                    facts.</p>
                <p part="N">In a given furnace in Scotland, previous to the introduction of the new
                    process, the following was the average result obtained:</p>
                <p part="N">20 tons of coal (coked), with 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of limestone, smelted 4 <hi rend="superscript"
                        > 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of iron, being 3 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of fuel to
                    each ton of iron.</p>
                <p part="N">In the same furnace, by the introduction of the new process, the result
                    was as follows:</p>
                <p part="N">14 tons of coal (raw), with 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> tons of lime, smelted 8 tons of iron, being 1 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> tons of fuel to
                    each ton of iron.</p>
                <p part="N">Here, then, we see that, in the first place, one half of the fuel only
                    is required; that coking, a very expensive process, is avoided, the coal being
                    used raw, which was formerly impossible; and that only about one-third of the
                    quantity of limestone is required to flux the iron, and all the cost of these
                    materials, and all the labour employed in their transport, and in the process of
                    melting, are clearly saved. But these were not the only benefits conferred on
                    the iron-master. The same furnace, blowing apparatus, and establishment, that
                    formerly produced fifty tons a-week, yielded under the hot blast more than
                    double that quantity.</p>
                <p part="N">As it was in Scotland that these advantages were first obtained, so it
                    is there that they are still possessed in the highest degree. Previously to the
                    introduction of the hot blast, it had become an almost hopeless competition to
                    produce iron there at so cheap a rate as the Welsh iron-masters could import it
                    into Scotland. The hot blast at once turned the scale; and Scotland now
                    transmits annually many thousand tons of iron to all the markets of England, and
                    even into the very heart of the iron districts of the principality itself.</p>
                <p part="N">The cause of this difference between the advantage which Wales has
                    derived from the hot-blast process, and that conferred on Scotland, is simply
                    this: the coal fields of Wales are a rich, strong, and highly carbonaceous fuel,
                    which loses not more than thirty to forty per cent. in the process of coking.
                    The coal basin of Scotland in the iron district is, on the contrary, of a poor,
                    earthy, light description, so as to lose from fifty to sixty per cent. in the
                    process of coking, and giving, for every two tons of coal, not more, and
                    frequently much less, than one ton of coked fuel fit for the cold-blast
                    smelting-furnace. The expense and loss in the Scotish coal by this preparatory
                    process of coking, was therefore excessive, when compared with the Welsh coal;
                    and hence the adoption of this new plan, which did not require this preliminary
                    process of coking, became a much greater boon to the Scotchman, in exact
                    proportion to his former disadvantage.</p>
                <p part="N">Great as these advantages have been found in Scotland, they have by no
                    means been limited to the country of the inventor. In Staffordshire, in the
                    wonderfully rich mineral basins of Dudley, and in Derbyshire, the invention was
                    very early introduced, and most successfully practised. The following are the
                    general results of the hot-blast system, as now practised in Staffordshire, in
                    comparison with the old system:</p>
                <p part="N">By the cold blast,</p>
                <p part="N">8 tons of coal (coked), with 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ton of lime, yielded 3 tons of iron, being 2 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> tons of fuel to
                    each ton of iron.</p>
                <p part="N">By the hot blast, in 1840,</p>
                <p part="N">2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of
                    coal (raw), with <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi>
                    ths of a ton of limestone, yield 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of iron, being 1 ton of fuel to each ton of
                    iron.</p>
                <p part="N">The saving thus obtained in the article of fuel, is accompanied, it will
                    be noticed, in every instance, with a corresponding saving in the limestone
                    employed to flux the metal. But even here the whole amount of advantage does not
                    meet the eye. It was formerly important to use the very best quality of coal
                    that could be obtained,— light, bituminous, or earthy coal, being least fit for
                    the purpose, and most unprofitable. Now, although it is still desirable to have
                    a better rather than a worse fuel, the importance of this point is so greatly
                    diminished, that almost all the inferior descriptions of poorer and more
                    bituminous coal may be employed with economy and advantage. Limestone of the
                    best quality was essential to the produce of good iron by the old method; by the
                    new method, it is obvious, from inspection of the examples given, that the
                    saving in limestone varies from a third to two-thirds of the quantity employed;
                    but, in addition to this, it has become practicable to employ limestone of a
                    very inferior quality, where better may be scarce, without sensible
                    deterioration of the metal.</p>
                <p part="N">For the production of good iron, the hot-blast system has thus opened
                    vast resources, which formerly could not be rendered available, in consequence
                    of the inferior quality of some one of the raw materials which could be brought
                    together in a given locality. In one place, abundant in excellent carbonate of
                    lime and rich ore, it became impossible to realise the mineral wealth, on
                    account of the inferior quality of the coal; while, in another, an abundant
                    supply of good limestone, and of good coal, could not be used with advantage,
                    from the poverty of the ore, which happened to be a clay stone, containing a
                    small proportion of iron. Perhaps, also, a portion of sulphur mixed with the
                    materials in such a quantity, as to ruin the iron. These all are counterbalanced
                    by the hot blast, and every one of these impracticable cases is now exemplified
                    in daily use.</p>
                <p part="N">But there is no sphere in which the hot blast Jias exerted a more
                    beneficial influence in promoting the success of industry, and extending the
                    resources of civilization, than in its application to those sterile districts of
                    the mineral world, known as the region of the stone coal, blind coal, or
                    anthracite formation. In the blind or stone coal strata, we have that most
                    valuable of all combustibles, carbon, in a condition of high density and purity,
                    amounting to as much as ninety or ninety-five per cent. of the stone coal, with
                    a very small per centage of earthy or hydrogenous matter, yet so contracted,
                    and, as it were, iron-bound, so hard and obdurate, that, instead of forming a
                    good combustible, it seems to partake of the nature of that wonderful and
                    brilliant substance, so hard of combustion as to have been reckoned one of the
                    incombustibles until the glass of the accomplished analyst resolved the
                    glittering brilliant into its primitive carbon. The anthracite seems, in fact,
                    truly to deserve the name of the “black diamond,” having been rendered, by its
                    dense and close structure, nearly as incombustible. Although America, and many
                    wide districts of Europe, abound with this rich carbon, it has failed to
                    furnish, even in the hands of many accomplished chemists and mechanicians, an
                    available fuel, either tor the generation of steam, or for the ordinary wants of
                    social life, and has resisted even the intense heat of the blast furnace. But
                    even its consummate obstinacy has yielded to the power of the hot blast. In
                    Wales, and in America, hot-blast iron of the very finest quality is now made
                    from stone coal; and thus stores of the richest fuel which the world contains,
                    appear only to have been reserved, by their wonderful obduracy, from the rapid
                    destruction to which all other fuel has been so wastefully subjected, to supply
                    the civilization and science of the nineteenth century with the means of
                    rewarding and extending its astonishing discoveries. So kindly has Providence
                    placed at the surface of the earth one mineral fuel to replace the forests which
                    supplied the fires of our forefathers, and deposited another still richer, but
                    more remote in the bowels of the earth, to await and to reward the industry and
                    research of<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=475"

                    will henceforth call in question the abundance of that supply, which now seems
                    to augment with the very means that are invented for increasing its
                    consumption?</p>
                <p part="N">The Welsh coal-field is perhaps the richest in the world. Rich with
                    bitumen on one sidc, it gradually falls off by insensible gradations into a more
                    purely carbonaceous, but still free-burning coal, and, passing through every
                    intermediate gradation, is found at last in the state of a rich, resplendent
                    refractory anthractous, or stony coal. This, mixed in the proportion of two to
                    three, three to two, or half and half, smelts iron readily under he hot blast,
                    and produces a rich powerful pig, possessing the qualities of a rich charcoal
                    iron, and also capable of being converted into a most tenacious and malleable
                    bar iron. In the anthracite district of Wales, new furnaces are rapidly rising
                    into use; and Mr. Crane is distinguished by his extensive use of Mr. Neilson’s
                    hot-blast in that application of it</p>
                <p part="N">But it is probably in America that the hot-blast system will most
                    extensively contribute to the development of mineral wealth. The anthracite is
                    there the staple of fuel. It covers a vast extent of country, and constitutes
                    the only substitute with which our transatlantic brethren can replace those
                    forests that are so rapidly receding before the advances of civilization. Here
                    the hot-blast is most successfully employed.</p>
                <p part="N">We have thus given out readers the general specification of the
                    hot-blast improvement; a specification so general as to include all possible
                    forms of apparatus, applicable, not only to the smelting of iron, but to all
                    cases of manufacture in which a blast is employed to produce beat, and which
                    touches only the process of heating the air, without regard either to the mode
                    of producing the blast, the mode of applying the blast, or the means of beating
                    air; and the patent only provides for the carrying into effect the process of
                    heating the air, that the blast shall be passed through a heated vessel or
                    receptacle of any form or dimensions, euch as a cast or malleable iron retort,
                    kept to a dull red beat of some 1000° of temperature as the most desirable. It
                    will readily be imagined that this apparatus, described is terms of so great
                    generality, would assume various forms, according to the different views which
                    the various practical men employed to construct the apparatus took of the most
                    effective mode of heating the air. This is accordingly what occurred with the
                    progress of time, and the increasing experience of those who used the apparatus;
                    practical difficulties gradually diminished with the increased experience which
                    was every day suggesting new and better expedients. It was also soon found that
                    the advantage gained was increased in a rapid proportion with the degree of heat
                    communicated to the air, so that the apparatus which gave at first some 300° of
                    temperature to the air, and produced one measure of benefit, was soon superseded
                    by a second form of apparatus giving 400°, and conferring still higher
                    advantages; and this in its turn gave way to another and another, each giving a
                    higher temperature to the air, and promising a higher degree of economy to the
                    user. And thus at last a temperature between 600º and 700º was given to the air;
                    a temperature higher than that of melting lead, which is indeed the criterion
                    now generally applied to test the working heat of the blast.</p>
                <p part="N">W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> e shall probably give our readers the
                    clearest views of these general improvements, and of the progress which has
                    generally taken place in carrying them into effect, by taking a single example.
                    For this purpose we have selected the various modes of heating the air that have
                    necessarily suggested themselves to, or been put in practice by the ingenious
                    proprietors of the Butterly iron works in Derbyshire, who were the first to
                    introduce the hot-blast into that part of the country, and who have been among
                    the most successful in carrying it into effect, and producing one of the most
                    superior qualities of hot-blast iron.</p>
                <p part="N">Elate CCCCLXII. fig. 1, shows the construction of the earliest and
                    simplest plan by which the inventous of hot-blast first brought it into use. An
                    iron vessel <hi rend="italic">h h h</hi> was formed of malleable plates,
                    rivetted together like a common steam-boiler, something near three feet in
                    diameter, and eight or ten feet long, cylindrical, and fitted at the ends to two
                    pipes B <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, communicating with the bellows, and S <hi
                        rend="italic">s</hi> with the smelting furnace. Below this large pipe or
                    tube a fire is placed, which is fed from the door D, and the whole is enclosed
                    in an oven of brickwork OO OO, leaving a clear space all round the pipe <hi
                        rend="italic">h h h,</hi> so that the flame and hot air rising up and
                    enveloping the receptacle, should keep it so hot as to communicate through the
                    sides of the vessel a higher temperature to the air rushing through it, on its
                    way from the bellows, B, towards the smelting furnace S. And in order to
                    communicate this temperature more uniformly and completely to all the air
                    passing through the vessel <hi rend="italic">h h h,</hi> lunular partitions <hi
                        rend="italic">ppp</hi> proceeding alternately from opposite sides of the
                    tube on its interior surface, cause the stream of air to impinge first on one
                    side, and then on the other side of the heated iron pipe, as shown in the
                    figure. By this apparatus a moderate current of air has been heated to three or
                    four hundred degrees.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 2 shows the manner in which the method of beating the air was
                    employed at first in the Butterly ironworks. In the oven Ο O are placed the two
                    cast-iron retorts <hi rend="italic">hh,</hi> about thirty-two inches in
                    diameter, and nine feet long, being of metal an inch and an eighth part in
                    thickness. They are laid parallel to each other; one of them is at one end
                    connected with the pipe B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> from the blowing apparatus,
                    and this conducts the air from its other extremity through a curved junction
                    pipe J J, into the second receptacle <hi rend="italic">h h;</hi> where, on its
                    way becoming hot, it passes through the hot-air pipe S <hi rend="italic">s,</hi>
                    from the heating furnace or oven, and is blown by the orifice T through the
                    twyre T into the hearth of the smelting furnace at F. In this, as is usual, more
                    than one blast, as at T', was blown into the same smelting furnace. The fire <hi
                        rend="italic">dd,</hi> is placed at one corner of the oven on the bars <hi
                        rend="italic">rr,</hi> and is fed from the door D, and the smoke and flame
                    rising up and surrounding <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                    partition by the flue <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and fill the second compartment
                    of the oven, clear spaces being left quite round the retorts on every side for
                    the communication of the heat; only at the points <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> they are supported by contact on the brick pillars
                        <hi rend="italic">kk.</hi> Finally, the products of combustion pass through
                    a flue <hi rend="italic">f</hi> into the short chimney C. In this way the cold
                    air from the blast pipe B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> passing into the vessel <hi

                    chamber, which, being placed immediately over the fire, is much more intensely
                    hot, and from this second chamber at once discharged into the smelting
                    furnace.</p>
                <p part="N">This apparatus was first tried in November 1830. The air was only heated
                    to 240°. Yet so admirable is the process, that it was attended with the
                    following effect: With cold blast there were previously used at Butterly,</p>
                <p part="N">5 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons
                    coal (coked), to 1 ton of iron.</p>
                <p part="N">By the new apparatus there were required only 3 tons coal (raw), to 1
                    ton of iron.</p>
                <p part="N">So admirable an effect as this was not to be neglected on account of the
                    practical difficulties attending it, which indeed only served as an inducement
                    to further exertion; and in about a year after the following improved apparatus,
                    with an increased number of tubular vessels, having increased dimensions of
                    length, was successfully introduced.</p>

                    through the twyre into the hearth of the furnace. The fuel is placed through the
                    door D upon the fire of the oven on the bars <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and by

                    allowed to act directly on the retorts, it would irregularly and less
                    effectually heat their surface. The manner of protecting the retorts from the
                    direct action of the fire, is well shown in the transverse section: a brick arch
                        <hi rend="italic">aaa</hi> is thrown over the fire, and the flame is only
                    permitted to ascend through the aforesaid openings <hi rend="italic">cc,
                        ce.</hi> It will be noticed that the retorts are every where clear of the
                    building and of each other, that they are wholly enclosed by the oven Ο Ο O; and
                    it will also be seen in the transverse section, and in the longitudinal section,
                    that the products of combustion are carried off by a descending flue <hi
                        rend="italic">ff</hi> regulated by a damper <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi> into
                    the short vertical chimney C. This damper is very useful in retarding the
                    draught of air, so as to leave the products of combustion a longer time in
                    contact with the heaters.</p>
                <p part="N">This apparatus is more effective and more durable than the last. It
                    raised the heat of the air as high as 400° to 500°, being 200° higher than the
                    former plan, as indeed we should expect from the greater number and length of
                    the vessels, and the greater surface in contact with the air. The result,
                    compared with the last, is as follows:</p>
                <p part="N">By the former plan with air at 240°,</p>
                <p part="N">3 tons of coal were required to melt 1 ton of iron.</p>
                <p part="N">By the improved plan, with air at 400° to 500°,</p>

                    of coal were required to melt 1 ton of iron.</p>
                <p part="N">The reader will not fail to be struck with the fact, that a much greater
                    gain was obtained by the original ruder plan of using the air, when compared
                    with the old system of hot-blast, than was afterwards got from the introduction
                    of the improved apparatus over the former one. The higher temperature does not
                    appear to have conferred an advantage at all proportionable to the increased
                    temperature.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 4 is a very superior and durable heating apparatus, which continues
                    in efficient use to the present time. Its form is well adapted to prevent all
                    the evils of expansion and contraction; and it is our opinion that by
                    multiplying the vessels, a more effective apparatus might be made than any now
                    in use. Its form is very ingenious, and its functions may be easily learned by
                    studying the figure, in which the letters describe the same parts with those of
                    the previous figures. B is the pipe coming from the blowing apparatus to the

                    continued with great advantage, and make one of the best series of heating
                    vessels. The fire is covered by arches <hi rend="italic">a a a,</hi> with small

                <p part="N">This apparatus raised the temperature to between 500° and 600°, and
                    produced a further saving in coals. By the former plan 2 <hi rend="superscript">
                        13</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> tons of coal were required to smelt

                <p part="N">Figs. 5 and 6 are the general forms of apparatus now most extensively
                    used. Fig. 5 is a form first given to the apparatus, we believe, by Mr. Dixon at
                    Calder, and hence generally called the Calder pipes. Similar pipes were also
                    early introduced at Gartsherrie, and at Wedensbury; and are very generally
                    approved of from their extensive heating surface, although they are liable to
                    the inconvenience of cracking, from unequal expansion. The form, as erected at
                    Butterly, consists of two parallel horizontal pipes L L called technically “the
                    lying pipes,” one forming a communication immediately with the cold-blast pipe
                    B, and the other with the hot-blast pipe S. Into sockets formed in the lying
                    pipe, are inserted a series of smaller pipes springing up at right angles with
                    the one lying pipe, and after forming an arch, returning down to the second
                    lying pipe, being inserted In like manner into sockets in it. The air,
                    therefore, on entering the first lying pipe, is forced through these transverse
                    heating pipes, or “A pipes” as they are called from their figure, and thus
                    exposed to the heat of a very extensive surface, is delivered into the hot-air
                    pipe. Sometimes, as at Gartsherrie and many other works, there are several times
                    as many pipes as in this example, and the air is made to cross and recross the
                    fire several times.</p>
                <p part="N">The figures of the transverse pipes are as various as the taste of the
                    parties who use them. Sometimes they rise up and form a large semicircular arch
                    over the fire, which is placed in the centre; sometimes a double tier of such
                    arches is employed. Sometimes they cross the fire in the form of a pointed arch
                    variously acuminate. Then again by some, the pipes are carried up four, six,
                    eight, or ten feet, like columns, united at the top by a semicircular arch.</p>
                <p part="N">The cross section of the heating pipe is as various as the form into
                    which the pipe itself is made to bend. A circular pipe was used at first, then a
                    flattened elliptical one for the purpose of exposing more surface in proportion
                    to volume; next a pipe, flat at one part, and semicircular on the other, was
                    introduced; next a pipe of a cardioid or heart-like section was employed. At
                    Butterly Mr. Terrop used a circular pipe cast with a solid core, to keep the air
                    near the hot surface, as shown in the figure; and finally, he employed the
                    rectangular section as shown in our figure 6th. All of these appear to answer
                    their purpose of heating the air sufficiently well, and all of them cause
                    trouble and expense by cracking now and then.</p>
                <p part="N">The result of all these forms is to produce a hot-blast of more than
                    600° temperature, and at Butterly, figs. 5 and 6 yield as follows: 2 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> tons of coal melt
                    one ton of iron. It is found, however, at Butterly, that pigs, for the forge,
                    require about three cwt. less of coal than this average quantity, and that No. 1
                    iron requires about three cwt. more than this, as we should expect.</p>
                <p part="N">The Scotch use less coal than the Butterly Company, principally on this
                    account, that the former use calcined ore, of which thirty-two cwt. with seven
                    cwt. of lime, makes a ton of iron, while at Butterly, the quantity used for a
                    ton of iron is 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    tons, with a ton of lime, being 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> tons of materials in one case, and less than two
                    tons in the other.</p>
                <p part="N">The explanation of the principles from which hot-blast derives its
                    efficacy as the means of producing elevated temperature, is very easy and plain
                    to any one acquainted with the elementary principles of chemistry and mechanics.
                    All that we think it necessary to add on this subject, we shall state in the
                    words of Mr. Babbage and Dr. Ure.</p>
                <p part="N">“The increased effect,” says Babbage, “produced by thus heating the air
                    is by no means an obvious result; and an analysis of its action will lead to
                    some curious views repecting the future application of machinery for blowing
                    furnaces.</p>

                    and four-fifths azote. According to the present state of chemical knowledge, the
                    oxygen alone is effective in producing beat; and the operation of blowing a
                    furnace may be thus analyzed.</p>
                <p part="N">“1. The air is forced into the furnace in a condensed state, and,
                    immediately expanding, abstracts heat from the surrounding bodies.</p>
                <p part="N">“2. Being itself of moderate temperature, it would, even without
                    expansion, still require beat to raise it to the temperature of the hot
                    substances to which it is to be applied.</p>
                <p part="N">“3. On coming into contact with the ignited substances in the furnace,
                    the oxygen unites with them, parting at the βame moment with a large portion of
                    its latent heat, and forming compounds which have less specific beat than their
                    separate constituents. Some of these pass up the chimney in a gaseous state,
                    whilst others remain in the form of melted slags, floating on the surface of the
                    iron, which is fused by the heat thus set at liberty.</p>
                <p part="N">“4. The effects of the azote are precisely similar to the first and
                    second of those above described; it seems to form no combinations, and
                    contributes nothing, in any stage, to augment the beat.</p>
                <p part="N">“The plan, therefore, of heating the air before driving it into the
                    furnace, saves obviously the whole of that heat which the fuel must have
                    supplied in raising it from the temperature of the external air up to that of
                    600° Fahrenheit; thus rendering the fire more intense, and the glassy slags more
                    fusible, and perhaps also more effectually decomposing the iron ore. The same
                    quantity of fuel, applied at once to the furnace, would only prolong the
                    duration of its heat, not augment its intensity.</p>

                    it, amounting, in fact, to four-fifths of the whole, clearly shews the defects
                    of the present method, and the want of some better mode of exciting combustion
                    on a large scale.”</p>
                <p part="N">The reader will find it interesting to compare this account with the
                    following by Dr. Ure.</p>
                <p part="N">“Wherever a forced stream of air is employed for combustion, the
                    resulting temperature must evidently be impaired by the coldness of the air
                    injected upon the fuel. The beat developed in combustion is distributed into
                    three portions; one is communicated to the remaining fuel, another is
                    communicated to the azote of the atmosphere, and to the volatile products of
                    combustion, and a third to the iron and fluxes, or other surrounding matter to
                    be afterwards dissipated by wider diffusion. This inevitable distribution takes
                    place in such a way, that there is a nearly equal temperature over the whole
                    extent of a fire-place, in which an equal degree of combustion exists.</p>
                <p part="N">“We thus perceive that if the air and the coal be very cold, the
                    portions of heat absorbed by them might be very considerable, and sufficient to
                    prevent the resulting temperature from rising to a proper pitch; but if they
                    were very hot they would absorb less caloric, and would leave more to elevate
                    the common temperature. Let us suppose two furnaces charged with burning fuel,
                    into one of which cold air is blown, and into the other hot air, in the same
                    quantity. ln the same time, nearly equal quantities of fuel will be consumed
                    with a nearly equal production of beat; but notwithstanding of this, there will
                    not be the same degree of heat in the two furnaces, for the one which receives
                    the hot air will be hotter by all the excess of heat in its air above that of
                    the other, since the former air adds to the heat while the latter abstracts from
                    it. Nor are we to imagine that by injecting a little more cold air into the one
                    furnace, we can raise its temperature to that of the other. With more air indeed
                    we should bum more coals in the same time, and we should produce a greater
                    quantity of beat, but this heat being diffused proportionally among more
                    considerable masses of matter, would not produce a greater temperature; we
                    should have a larger space heated, but not a greater intensity of beat in the
                    same space.</p>
                <p part="N">“Thus, according to the physical principles of the production and
                    distribution of heat, fires fed with hot air should, with the same fuel, rise to
                    a higher pitch of temperature than fires fed with common cold air. This
                    consequence is independent of the masses, being as true for a small stove which
                    burns only an ounce of charcoal in a minute, as for a furnace which burns a
                    hundred weight; but the excess of temperature produced by hot air cannot be the
                    same in small fires as in great; because the waste of beat is usually less the
                    more fuel is burned.</p>
                <p part="N">“This principle may be rendered still more evident by a numerical
                    illustration. Let us take, for example, a blast furnace, into which 600 cubic
                    feet of air are blown per minute; suppose it to contain no ore but merely coal
                    or coke, and that it has been burning long enough to have arrived at the
                    equilibrium of temperature, and let us see what excess of temperature it would
                    have if blown with air of 300° C. (572° F.) instead of being blown with air at
                    0° C.</p>
                <p part="N">"Six hundred cubic feet of air under the mean temperature und pressure,
                    weigh a little more than 45 pounds avoirdupoise; they contain 10∙4 pounds of
                    oxygen, which would burn very nearly 4 pounds of carbon, and disengage 16,000
                    times as much heat as would raise by one degree cent. the temperature of two
                    pounds of water. These 16,000 portions of heat, produced every minute, will
                    replace 16,000 other portions of heat, dissipated by the sides of the furnace
                    and employed in heating the gases, which escape from its mouth. This must take
                    place in order to establish the assumed equilibrium of caloric.</p>
                <p part="N">“If the 45 pounds of air be heated beforehand up to 300° C., they will
                    contain about the eighth part of the heat of the 16,000 disengaged by the
                    combustion, and there will be therefore in the same space one-eighth of heat
                    more, which will be ready to operate upon any bodies within its range, and to
                    heat them one-eighth more. Thus the blast of 300° C. gives a temperature which
                    is nine-eighths of the blast at zero C., or at even the ordinary atmospheric
                    temperature; and as we may reckon at from 2'200° to 2700° F. (from 1200° to
                    1000° C.) the temperature of blast furnaces worked in the common way, we
                    perceive that the hot-air blast produces an increase of temperature equal to
                    from 270° to 360° F.</p>
                <p part="N">Now in order to appreciate the immense effects which this excess of
                    temperature may produce in metallurgic operations, we must consider that often
                    only a few degrees more temperature are required to modify the state of a
                    fusible body, or to determine the play of affinities dormant at lower degrees of
                    heat. Water is solid at 1° under 32° F.; it is liquid at 1° above. Every fusible
                    body has a determinate melting point, a very few degrees above which it is quite
                    fluid, though it may be pasty below it. the same observation applies to ordinary
                    chemical affinities; charcoal, for example, which reduces the greater part of
                    metallic oxides, begins to do so only at a determinate pitch of temperature,
                    under which it is inoperative, but a few degrees above, it is in general lively
                    and complete. It is unnecessary, in this article, to enter into any more details
                    to show the influence of a few degrees of heat, more or less, in a furnace, upon
                    chemical operations, or merely upon physical changes of state.</p>
                <p part="N">“These consequences might have been deduced long ago, and industry might
                    thus have been enriched with a new application of science; but philosophera have

                    abstractions. Within the space of seven years, the use of the hot-blast has been
                    so much extended in Great Britain, as to have enabled many proprietors of
                    iron-works to add 50 per cent. to their weekly production of metal, to diminish
                    the weekly expenses of smelting by 50 per cent., and, in many cases, to produce
                    a better sort of cast-iron from indifferent materials."</p>
                <p part="N">The following table is from a report of M. Dufresnoy, made to the

                    made good arrangements for mineral property, can manufacture iron at a cost of
                    little more than L.2 per. ton.</p>
                <p part="N">At the request of the British Association. Dr. Thomson of Glasgow
                    examined the chemical constitution of hot-blast iron, and he gives the following

                <p part="N">“It has been hitherto supposed that the difference between cast-iron and
                    malleable iron consists in the presence of carbon in the former, and its absence
                    from the latter; in other words, that cast iron is a carburet of iron. But in
                    all the specimens of cast iron which we analysed we constantly found several
                    other ingredients besides iron and carbon. Manganese is pretty generally present
                    in minute quantity, though in one specimen it amounted to no less a quantity
                    than 7 per cent.; its average amount is 2 per cent. <hi rend="italic"

                    it, while others contain less than a half per cent. Aluminum is very rarely
                    altogether absent, though its amount is more variable than that of silicon. Its
                    average amount is 2 per cent.; sometimes it exceeds 4 <hi rend="superscript">

                    from Mr. Neilson, and which he had smelted from pyrites, there was a trace of
                    copper, showing that the pyrites employed was not quite free from copper; and in
                    a specimen from the Clyde Iron-Works there was a trace of sulphur. The following

                    proportion of aluminum is four times as great, while the silicon is little more
                    than half as much. The atomic ratios are, carbon, 4; silicon, 0·67; aluminum,

                    originally began; and where, of course, it has been longest in use. The specific

                <p part="N">“Of the three columns of numbers in the table above, the first is the
                    strength or other quality in the cold-blast iron; the second is that in the
                    hot-blast; and the third is the ratio of these quantities.</p>
                <p part="N">“The results in this table contain nearly the whole information relative
                    to the question of hot and cold-blast-iron that the preceding research affords;
                    and before adverting to them, it may be mentioned, that it is usual for the
                    makers of cast-iron to divide it. when taken from the furnace, into three
                    classes, called Nos. 1, 2, 3, differing from each other in the appearance and
                    qualities of the material. No. 1 contains the softest and richest irons, those
                    which have the largest crystals; No. 3, the hardest and densest irone, those
                    with the least crystals; and No. 2, irons intermediate between the former two
                    descriptions. Beginning with the No. 1 iron, of which we have a specimen from
                    the Buffery Iron-Works, a few miles from Birmingham, we find the cold-blast iron
                    somewhat surpassing the hot-blast in all the following particulars; direct
                    tensile strength, compressive strength, transverse strength, power to resist
                    impact, modulus of elasticity or stiffness, specific gravity; whilst the only
                    numerical advantage possessed by the hot-blast iron is, that it bends a little
                    mote than the cold-blast before it breaks.</p>
                <p part="N">“In the irons of the quality No. 2, the case seems in some degree
                    different; in these the advantages of the rival kinds seem to be more nearly
                    balanced. They are still, however, rather in favour of the cold blast.</p>
                <p part="N">“Referring to the No. 2 iron, from the Carron Works in Scotland, we find
                    the tensile, compressive, and transverse strengths, together with the modulus of
                    elasticity and specific gravity, all higher in the cold-blast iron than the
                    hot-blast, whilst the ultimate deflection and power of sustaining impact are
                    greater in the hot-blast. The cold-blast iron is the better, but the difference
                    is very small.</p>
                <p part="N">" In the iron No. 2, from the Coed-Talon Works in North Wales, the
                    tensile strength is greater in the cold-blast than in the hot; but the
                    resistance to compression is higher in the latter than the former, and that is
                    the case with the specific gravity.</p>
                <p part="N">“So far as my experiments have proceeded, the irons of No. 1 have been
                    deteriorated by the hot-blast; those of No. 2 appear also to have been slightly
                    injured by it; while the irons of No. 3 seem to have benefited by its mollifying
                    powers. the Carron iron No. 3, bot-blast, resists both tension and compression
                    with considerably more energy than that made with the cold-blast; and the No. 9
                    hot-blast iron from the Devon Works, in Scotland, is one of the strongest cast.
                    iruns I have seen, whilst that made with the cold-blast is comparatively weak,
                    though its specific gravity is very high, and higher than in the hot. The
                    extreme hardness of the cold-blast Devon iron above prevented many experiments
                    that would otherwise have been made upon it, no tools being hard enough to form
                    the specimens. The difference of strength in the Devon irons is peculiarly
                    striking.</p>
                <p part="N">“From the evidence here brought forward, it is rendered exceedingly
                    probable that the introduction of a heated blast into the manufacture of
                    cast-iron has injured the softer irons, whilst it has frequently mollified and
                    improved those of a harder nature; and considering the small deterioration that
                    the irons of the quality No. 2 have sustained, and the apparent benefit to those
                    of No. 3, together with the great saving effected by the heated blast, there
                    seems good reason for the process becoming as general as it has done.” (c. <hi
