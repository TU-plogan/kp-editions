                <p part="N"><label type="entry">SELF-DEFENCE</label> implies not only the
                    preservation of one’s life, but also the protection of one’s property, because
                    without property life cannot be preserved in a civilized nation. The extent of
                    property essential to life is indeed small, and this consideration may enable us
                    to decide a question which some moralists have made intricate. By what means, it
                    has been asked, may a man protect his property? May he kill the person who
                    attacks it, if he cannot otherwise repel the attack?</p>
                <p part="N">That a man, in a state of nature, may kill the person who makes an
                    attack on his life, if he cannot otherwise repel the attack, is a truth which
                    has never been controverted; and he may do the same in civil society, if his
                    danger be so imminent that it cannot be averted by the interposition of the
                    protection provided for individuals by the state. In all possible situations,
                    except the three following, whatever is absolutely necessary to the preservation
                    of life may be lawfully performed; for the law of self-preservation is the first
                    and most sacred of those laws which are impressed on every mind by the Author of
                    nature.</p>
                <p part="N">The three excepted situations are those of a soldier in the day of
                    battle, of a criminal about to suffer by the laws of his country, and of a man
                    called upon to renounce his religion. The soldier hazards his life in the most
                    honourable of all causes, and cannot betray his trust, or play the coward,
                    without incurring a high degree of moral turpitude. He knows that the very
                    profession in which he is engaged necessarily subjects him to danger; and he
                    voluntarily incurs that danger for the good of his country, which, with great
                    propriety, annexes to his profession peculiar privileges and much glory. The
                    criminal under sentence of death cannot, without adding to his guilt, resist the
                    execution of that sentence; for the power of inflicting punishment is essential
                    to society, and society is the ordinance of God. The man who is called upon to
                    renounce his religion ought to submit to the most cruel death rather than comply
                    with that request, since religion is his only security for future and permanent
                    happiness. But in every other situation, that which is absolutely necessary to
                    the preservation of life is undoubtedly lawful. Hence it is that a person
                    sinking in water is never thought to be guilty of any crime, though he drag his
                    neighbour after him by his endeavours to save himself; and hence, too, a man in
                    danger of perishing by shipwreck may drive another from a plank which cannot
                    carry both of them, for since one of two lives must be lost, no law, human or
                    divine, calls upon either of them to prefer his neighbour’s life to his own.</p>
                <p part="N">But though the rights of self-defence authorize us to repel every attack
                    mode upon our life, and in case of extremity to save ourselves at the expense of
                    the life of our innocent neighbour, it is not so evident that, rather than give
                    to an unjust demand a few shillings or pounds, we may lawfully deprive a
                    fellow-creature of life, and the public of a citizen. A few pounds lost may be
                    easily regained; but life when lost can never be recovered. If these pounds,
                    indeed, be the whole of a man’s property; if they include his clothes, his food,
                    and the house where he shelters his head; there cannot be a doubt that, rather
                    than part with them, he may lawfully kill the aggressor, for no man can exist
                    without shelter, and food, and raiment. But it is seldom that an<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=96" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0096-0082"
                    /> attempt is made, or is indeed practicable, to rob a man at once of all that
                    he possesses. The question, then, of any importance is, may a man put a robber
                    to death rather than part with a small portion of his property? Paley doubts
                    whether he could innocently do so in a state of nature,</p>
                <p part="N">“because it cannot be contended to be for the augmentation of human
                    happiness, that one should lose his life or limb, rather than another a
                    pennyworth of his property.” He allows, that in civil society the life of the
                    aggressor may always be taken away by the person aggrieved, or meant to be
                    aggrieved, when the crime attempted is such as would subject its perpetrator to
                    death by the laws of his country.</p>
                <p part="N">To us, however, he seems to lose sight of his own principles. No
                    legislature can have a right to take away life in civil society, but in such
                    cases as individuals have the same right in a state of nature. If therefore a
                    man in the state of nature have not a right to protect his property by killing
                    the aggressor, when it cannot be otherwise protected, it appears to us
                    self-evident that no legislature can have a right to inflict the punishment of
                    death upon such offences; but if the laws inflicting death upon the crime of
                    robbery be morally evil, it is certain that an individual cannot be innocent
                    when he prevents robbery by the death of the robber, merely because he knows
                    that the laws of his country have decreed that punishment against those
                    convicted of the crime. But we think that the protection of property by the
                    death of the aggressor may be completely vindicated upon much more general
                    principles. It is necessary in every state, that property be protected, or
                    mankind could not subsist; but in a state of nature every man must be the
                    defender of his own property, which in that state must necessarily be small; and
                    if he be not allowed to defend it by every means in his power, he will not long
                    be able to protect it at all. By giving him such liberty, a few individuals may,
                    indeed, occasionally lose their lives and limbs for the preservation of a very
                    small portion of private property; but we believe that the sum of human
                    happiness will be more augmented by cutting off such worthless wretches than by
                    exposing property to perpetual depredation; and therefore, if general utility be
                    the criterion of moral good, we must be of opinion that a man may in every case
                    lawfully kill a robber rather than comply with his unjust demand.</p>
                <p part="N">But if a man may without guilt preserve his property by the death of the
                    aggressor, when it cannot be preserved by any other means, much more may a woman
                    have recourse to the last extremity to protect her chastity from forcible
                    violation. This, indeed, is admittcd by Paley hiιn-self, and will be
                    controverted by no man who reflects on the importance of the female character,
                    and the probable consequences of the smallest deviation from the established
                    laws of female honour.</p>
