                    /> ceremonies of their religion; and the third, the distribution of the people
                    into tribes or classes, with the duties pertaining to each class.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal precepts of morality, contained in the first part of the
                    Shaster, are the following. That no animal be killed, because the Indians
                    attribute souls to brute animals as well as to mankind; that they neither hear
                    nor speak evil, nor drink wine, nor eat flesh, nor touch any thing that is
                    unclean; that they observe the feasts, prayers, and washings which their law
                    prescribes; that they tell no lies, nor be guilty of deceit in trade; that they
                    neither oppress nor offer violence to one another; that they celebrate the
                    solemn feasts and fasts, and appropriate certain hours of ordinary sleep to
                    cultivate a disposition for prayer; and that they do not steal or defraud one
                    another.</p>
                <p part="N">The ceremonies, contained in the second part of the Shaster, are these.
                    That they wash often in the rivers, thereby obtaining the pardon of their sins;
                    that they mark their forehead with red, in token of their relation to the Deity;
                    that they present offerings and prayers under certain trees, set apart for this
                    purpose; that they pray in the temples, make oblations to their pagodas or
                    idols, sing hymns, and make processions; that they make pilgrimages to distant
                    rivers, and especially to the Ganges, there to wash themselves and make
                    offerings; that they make vows to particular saints, according to their
                    respective departments; that they render homage to the Deity at the first sight
                    of the sun; that they pay their respect to the sun and moon, which are the two
                    eyes of the Deity; and that they treat with particular veneration those animals
                    that are deemed more pure than others, because the souls of men have
                    transmigrated into these animals.</p>
                <p part="N">The third part of the Shaster records the distribution of the people
                    into four classes; the first being that of the Brahmins or priests, appointed to
                    instruct the people; the second, that of the kutteris or nobles, who are the
                    magistrates; the third, that of the shudderis or merchants; and the fourth, that
                    of the mechanics. Each person is required to remain in the class in which he was
                    bom, and to pursue the occupation assigned to him by the Shaster. According to
                    the Brahmins, the Shaster was imparted by God himself to Brahma, and by him to
                    the Brahmins, who communicated the contents of it to the people.</p>
                <p part="N">Modem writers have given us very different accounts of the antiquity and
                    importance of the Shaster. Mr Hol well, who had made considerable progress in
                    the translation of this book, apprehends that the mythology as well as the
                    cosmogony of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, was borrowed from the doctrines
                    of the Brahmins contained in it, even to the copying of the exteriors of
                    worship, and the distribution of their idols, though grossly mutilated and
                    adulterated. With respect to the Vedam and Shaster, or scriptures, of the
                    Gentoos, this writer informs us, that Vedam, in the Malabar language, signifies
                    the same as Shaster in the Sanscrit; and that the first book is followed by the
                    Gentoos of the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, and also of the island of Ceylon.
                    The Shaster is followed by the Gentoos of the provinces of Bengal, and by all
                    the Gentoos of the rest of India commonly called India Proper, along the course
                    of the rivers Ganges and Jumna, to the Indus. Both these books, he says, contain
                    the institutes of their respective religion and worship, as well as the history
                    of their ancient rajahs and princes, often couched under allegory and fable.
                    Their antiquity is contended for by the partisans of each; but he thinks that
                    the similitude of their names, idols, and great part of their worship, leaves
                    little room to doubt, nay plainly evinces, that both these scriptures were
                    originally one. He adds, if we compare the gτeat purity and chaste manners of
                    the Shaster with the great absurdities and impurities of the Vedam, we need not
                    hesitate to pronounce the latter a corruption of the former.</p>
                <p part="N">with regard to the high original of these scriptures, the account of the
                    Brahmins is as follows. Brahma or the Mighty Spirit, about 4866 years ago,
                    assumed the form of man, and the government of Hindustan. He translated the
                    divine law, designed for the restoration of mankind, who had offended in a
                    pre-existent state, and who are now in their last scene of probation, to the
                    dignity from which they were degraded, out of the language of angels, into the
                    well-known Sanscrit language, and called his translation the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Six Scriptures of Divine Words of the Mighty Spirit.</hi> He appointed the
                    Brahmins, deriving their name from him, to preach the word of God; and the
                    doctrines of the Shaster were accordingly preached in their original purity a
                    thousand years. About this time there was published a paraphrase on the Chartah
                    Bhade, or Six Scriptures; and about five hundred years afterwards a second
                    exposition appeared, called the <hi rend="italic">Eighteen Books of Divine
                        Words,</hi> written in a character compounded of the common Hindustan and
                    the Sanscrit. This innovation produced a schism among the Gentoos; on which
                    occasion, it is said, those of Coromandel and Malabar formed a scripture of
                    their own, which they pretended to be founded on the Chartah Bhade of Brahma,
                    and called it the Vedam of Birmah, or <hi rend="italic">Bivine Words of the
                        Mighty Spirit.</hi> The original Chartah Bhade was thrown aside, and at
                    length wholly unknown, except to a few families, who can still read and expound
                    it in the Sanscrit character. With the establishment of the Aughtorrah Bhade and
                    Vedam, which, according to the Gentoo account, is 3366 years ago, their
                    polytheism commenced; and the principles of religion became so obscure, and
                    their ceremonies so numerous, that every head of a family was obliged to keep a
                    Brahmin as a guide both in faith and practice. Mr Holwell is of opinion that the
                    Chartah Bhade, or original scriptures, are not copied from any other system of
                    theology promulgated to or obtruded upon mankind. The Gentoos do not attribute
                    them to Zoroaster; and Mr Holwell supposes that both Zoroaster and Pythagoras
                    visited Hindustan, not to instruct, but to be instructed.</p>
                <p part="N">From the account of Mr Dow, we learn that the books which contain the
                    religion and philosophy of the Hindus are distinguished by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Vedas;</hi> that they are four in number, and, like the sacred
                    wτitings of other nations, are said to have been penned by the Divinity. Veda he
                    says, in the Sanscrit language, literally signifies <hi rend="italic"
                        >science;</hi> and these books treat not only of religion and moral duties,
                    but of every branch of philosophical knowledge. The Brahmins maintain that the
                    Vedas are the divine laws which Brahma, at the creation of the world, delivered
                    for the instruction of mankind; but they affirm that their meaning was perverted
                    in the first age by the ignorance and wickedness of some princes, whom they
                    represent as evil spirits, who then haunted the earth.</p>
                <p part="N">The first credible account we have of the Vedas is, that about the
                    commencement of the Cal Jug, of which era the year 1768 was the 4886th year,
                    they were written, or rather collected, by a great philosopher and reputed
                    prophet, called Beäss Muni, or Beiiss the Inspired.</p>
                <p part="N">The Hindus, says Mr Dow, are divided into two great religious sects: the
                    followers of the doctrine of Bedang, which is the original Shaster or commentary
                    upon the Vedas; and those who adhere to the principles of the Nea-dirsen. The
                    original Shaster is called <hi rend="italic">Vedang,</hi> and is a commentary
                    upon the Vedas. This book, he says, is erroneously called in Europe the <hi
                        rend="italic">Vedam.</hi> It is ascribed to Beäss Muni, and is said to have
                    been revised some years after by one Serrider Swami, since which time it has
                    been reckoned sacred, and not subject to any farther alterations.</p>
                <p part="N">Almost all the Hindus of the Deccan, and those of the Malabar and
                    Coromandel coasts, are of this sect. The followers of the Vedang Shaster do not
                    allow that any physical evil exists. They maintain that God created all
                        things<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=210"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0210-0192"/> perfectly good; but that man, being a free
                    agent, may be guilty of moral evil, which may be injurious to himself, but can
                    be of no detriment to the general system of nature. God, they say, being
                    perfectly benevolent, never punished the wicked otherwise than by the pain and
                    affliction which are the natural consequences of evil actions; and hell,
                    therefore, is no other than a consciousness of evil.</p>
                <p part="N">The Neadirsen Shaster is said to have been written by a philosopher
                    called Goutam, nearly four thousand years ago. The Brahmins, from Mr Dow’s
                    account of their sacred books, appear to believe invariably in the unity,
                    eternity, omniscience, and omnipotence of God; and the polytheism of which they
                    have been accused is no more than a symbolical worship of the divine attributes,
                    which they divide into three classes. Under the name of Brahma, they worship the
                    wisdom and creative power of God; under the appellation of Vishen, his
                    providential and preserving quality; and under that of Shevah, that attribute
                    which tends to destroy.</p>
