                <p part="N"><label type="entry">SENSE</label> is a faculty of the soul, by which it
                    perceives external objects by means of the impressions they make upon certain
                    organs of the body. Sec <hi rend="smallcaps">MetaPHysIcs.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >common</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sense</hi> is a term that has been
                    variously used both by ancient and by modern writers. With some it has been
                    synonymous with public sense; with others it has denoted prudence; in certain
                    instances it has been confounded with some of the powers of taste; and,
                    accordingly, those who commit egregious blunders with regard to decorum, saying
                    and doing what is offensive to their company, and inconsistent with their own
                    character, have been charged with a defect in common sense. Some men are
                    distinguished by an uncommon acuteness in discovering the characters of others;
                    and this talent has been sometimes called common sense, similar to which is that
                    use of the term which makes it to signify that experience and knowledge of life
                    which is acquired by living in society. To this meaning Quintilian refers, when
                    speaking of the advantages of a public education. “Sensum ipsum qui communis
                    dicitur, ubi discet, cum se a congressu, qui non hominibus solum, sed mutis
                    quoque animalibus naturalis est, segregarit? (Lib. i. cap. 2.)</p>
                <p part="N">But the term common sense has in modem times been employed to signify
                    that power of the mind which perceives truth, or commands belief, not by
                    progressive argumentation, but by an instantaneous, instinctive, and
                    irresistible impulse, derived neither from education nor from habit, but from
                    nature, acting independently of our will, whenever its object is presented
                    according to an established law, and therefore called <hi rend="italic"
                        >sense;</hi> and acting in a similar manner upon all, or at least upon a
                    great majority of mankind, and therefore called <hi rend="italic">common
                        sense.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Moral</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sense</hi> is a determination of the
                    mind to be pleased with the contemplation of the affections, actions, or
                    characters, of rational agents, which we call good or virtuous.</p>
                <p part="N">This moral sense of beauty in actions and affections may at first view
                    appear strange. Some of our moralists themselves are offended at it in Lord
                    Shaftesbury, as being accustomed to deduce every approbation or aversion from
                    rational views of interest. It is certain that his lordship has carried the
                    influence of the moral sense very far, and some of his followers have carried it
                    farther. The advocates for the selfish system seem to drive their opinions to
                    the opposite extreme; and we have elsewhere endeavoured to show that the truth
                    lies between the contending parties. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Moral
