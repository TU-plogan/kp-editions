                    an eminent jurist and historian, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1742. His
                    father, George Stuart, LL. D., had succeeded John Ker as professor of humanity
                    during the preceding year. According to the tradition of the university, he was
                    an excellent Latinist, but of his proficiency he has left no public proofs. He
                    had prepared an amended and enlarged edition of Ainsworth’s Latin Dictionary;
                    but it was never committed to the press, and its suppression may perhaps have
                    been occasioned by the too high estimate which the professor had formed of its
                    pecuniary value.</p>
                <p part="N">The son was educated in the public school and in the university of his
                    native city. Of his proficiency in several branches of study, his various works
                    afford a sufficient criterion. To the pursuit of jurisprudence he devoted
                    himself with uncommon ardour; but although he had a strong relish for law as a
                    science, he anticipated no delight from its practice, and he was never called to
                    the bar. Of his early progress in this study he exhibited a very conspicuous
                    specimen in a work published without his name; “An Historical Dissertation
                    concerning the Antiquity of the English Constitution.” Edinb. 1768, 8vo. It has
                    been asserted that when he produced this work, he was little more than twenty
                    years of age; but the statement is not sufficiently accurate, for he had then
                    attained his twenty-sixth year. For a writer of that age, or indeed of any age,
                    it is an ingenious and able performance. His chief favourites and models are
                    Tacitus and Montesquieu. With no mean talents for research and disquisition, he
                    has endeavoured to evince that “the parts which compose our constitution arose
                    more immediately from the forests of Germany.” The same ground had recently been
                    occupied by the learned Dr Squire, bishop of St David’s; of whose Inquiry into
                    the Foundation of the English Constitution a second edition appeared in the year
                    1753. Stuart’s Dissertation, distinguished by so much vigour of intellect and
                    maturity of juridical learning, procured him from the university the degree of
                    LL. D., which is very rarely bestowed upon so young a scholar. A second edition,
                    bearing the author’s name, was published at London in the year 1771, and he then
                    prefixed a dedication to the earl of Mansfield.</p>
                <p part="N">The dedication is dated at London in the month of January 1770; and

                    with which he continued his connexion from 1768 to 1774. We likewise find him
                    employed as the editor of “An Historical Treatise on the Feudal Law, and the
                    Constitution and Laws of England; with a Commentary on Magna Charta, and

                    University.” Lond. 1772, 4to. Dr Sullivan had obtained a fellowship at the early
                    age of nineteen; and, as his editor informs us, he “was not less remarkable for
                    his knowledge in history and chronology than for his skill in his profession as
                    a barrister and civilian.” Towards the close of his life, he was engaged in
                    preparing a History of Ireland; but this task was reserved for Dr Leland,
                    another distinguished fellow of Trinity College. The editor, whose name does not
                    appear, has prefixed a preface of four pages, and has particularly extolled the
                    author for his “admirable vindication of the original freedom of our
                    constitution, and his excellent commentary on <hi rend="italic">Mayna

                <p part="N">A pseudonymous work, of a very different denomination, has been ascribed
                    to Dr Stuart. It bears the title of “Animadversions on Mr Adam’s Latin and
                    English Grammar; being an Exhibition of its Defects, and an Illustration of the
                    Danger of Introducing it into Schools. By John Richard Busby, Master of Arts.”
                    Edinb. 1773, 8vo. This grammar, at its first appearance, was doomed to encounter
                    a very fierce and general opposition. The other four masters of the school to
                    which the author belonged, presented to the town-council a remonstrance against
                    it; and the use of it in that seminary was formally prohibited.<note

                    Stuart’s zeal might be excited by his relationship to Ruddiman, whose elementary
                    works, both excellent in their kind, had for half a century retained their place
                    in the grammar schools. That the writer has detected and specified errors and
                    omissions, it would not be safe to deny; but the spirit as well as the style of
                    his animadversions is such as no unprejudiced reader could approve. They
                    conclude with the subsequent passage: “These strictures will, it is thought, be
                    sufficient to evince the entire frivolity of Mr Adam’s grammar, and the danger
                    that must attend its adoption into our schools. To point out all the errors of
                    his performance, would require several volumes; and I am not ambitious of
                    performing a task that would vie with any of the labours of Hercules. It is the
                    peculiar infelicity of this grammarian, that he exhibits every defect which it
                    is possible for an author to possess; a sterile invention, an unhappy method, a
                    cold and inauspicious manner, an inaccurate and nerveless expression, a
                    perverted judgment, a defective understanding, a corrupted taste.—Education is
                    -not a matter to be trifled with. The mistakes and miscarriage of our most
                    generous youth have too frequently their rise in the negligence with which they
                    have been treated in schools, where they have been sent to be initiated in the
                    first principles of knowledge. It is also no groundless complaint, that the
                    teacher often adds incapacity to neglect. And if this is, in general, a just
                    representation of the matter, how must we pity, in particular, the pupils of Mr
                    Adam! To disadvantages common to other boys, they must join the cruel and
                    insuperable one of studying a work that advances in an unvaried progress from
                    blunder to blunder, and from absurdity to absurdity.” The merits and demerits of
                    this grammar, which in spite of all opposition became very popular, were
                    discussed in various articles of the Weekly Magazine. Here we find two Latin
                    lucubrations on the subject, one of which was known to be the production of
                    Stuart, and the other might perhaps be written by the same satirical pen. In the
                    form of a description of a Roman funeral, he records the interment of Adam’s
                    Latin Grammar; nor does he neglect to introduce the well-known Jamie Duff, an
                    idiot whose supreme delight was to place himself, an unhired attendant, at the
                    head of a funeral procession: “Imus ad hortos scholasticos, praeeunte Jacobo
                    Duff, solita sua gravitate, densissimo ac laetissimo puerorum agmine cincto.”
                    The narrative closes with this monumental inscription:</p>

                <p part="N">Dr Stuart now undertook the management of “The Edinburgh Magazine and
                    Review,” of which the first number bears the date of November 1773. In the
                    commercial part of this enterprise his partners were Alexander Kincaid, his
                    majesty’s printer, William Creech, bookseller, William Smellie, printer, and
                    William Kerr, surveyor of the postoffice. The work was printed by Smellie, who
                    was likewise to manage the business details of the concern, to furnish the last
                    half-sheet of every number, and to review such books as the editor and he should
                    select. The profits were to lie distributed into six shares; one of which was
                    allotted to Kincaid and Creech conjunctly; one each to Stuart, Smellie, and
                    Kerr; and the remaining two to the editor and the printer, to be divided between
                    them as they should mutually agree. Stuart was himself the principal writer.
                    Various essays and reviews were furnished by Smellie. Lord Hailes, Dr Blacklock,
                    Professor Richardson of Glasgow, and Professor Barron of St Andrews, were among
                    the number of the contributors. The name of Dr Moor appears in the poetical
                    department. An extraordinary lucubration, entitled “A modest Defence of the
                    Accomplishment of Blasphemy,” was written by the Rev. A. Gillies. The Rev. Mr
                    Nimmo of Bothkennar wrote the Essay on the Antiquities of Stirlingshire, which
                    he afterwards enlarged to the size of an octavo volume.<note anchored="true"

                <p part="N">A periodical work, supported by such contributors, might have run a long
                    and prosperous career, if its success had not been marred by the editor’s want
                    of temper and discretion. At that period, the population of Edinburgh probably
                    did not amount to one third of its present number; and the freedom of public
                    discussion was circumscribed in at least an equal proportion. Dr Henry was one
                    of those who had most reason to complain of injurious treatment. A single sermon
                    of his was very unfavourably noticed by Smellie; and on the second volume of his
                    History of Great Britain two articles were written by Stuart, in a style of
                    unmitigated sarcasm and contempt; nor does it appear that there was any original
                    ground of personal offence. In some fragments of his letters which have been
                    published by D’Israeli, he speaks of this historian with a strange mixture of
                    levity and virulence. Lord Monboddo did not experience better treatment. On the
                    second volume of his Origin and Progress of Language they inserted two, and on
                    the third volume three articles, each of them more offensive than another. These
                    articles were written by Stuart, Smellie, and Gillies, but the greater portion
                    of them by the latter. The editor lent his aid in the review of the third<pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=928"

                    greatly excelled his coadjutors. It is scarcely to be supposed that any of the
                    disparaging expressions were attributable to Smellie. This attack on the learned
                    judge gave great offence to him and his friends, and indeed it had a visible
                    effect in precipitating the failure of the work. Of Lord Karnes’s Sketches of
                    the History of Man the editor had prepared a very severe review; but when it was
                    sent to the printer, he “counteracted the intentions of his colleague, by
                    altering the whole into a totally opposite tendency, converting the far greater
                    part from harsh invective into reasonable and merited panegyric.” On discovering
                    that the venom had thus been extracted, the writer was moved with violent anger;
                    but he speedily moderated his feelings so far as to admit that his friend had
                    acted rightly. Smellie, though he generally exercised a sounder discretion,
                    could himself display a strong vein of satire. This remark was sufficiently
                    verified in his controversy with Dr Nisbet, then minister of Montrose, and
                    afterwards president of Dickinson College at Carlisle in Pennsylvania.<note

                            American Biographical and Historical Dictionary, p. 449.</p></note> The
                    controversy was occasioned by the mode of reporting a certain debate in the
                    General Assembly. Nisbet printed two letters in a newspaper, and Smellie replied
                    in the magazine. This publication was continued till the month of August 1776,
                    when it terminated with tb.e fifth volume. A closing notice informed the
                    “numerous and respectable encouragera of this work,” that its publication was
                    only interrupted for some months, and that it would afterwards appear in an
                    improved form. But the promise was never fulfilled, nor is it very probable that
                    many readers expected its fulfilment.</p>
                <p part="N">Notwithstanding the failure of this project, Dr Stuart had displayed so
                    much talent in his principal articles, that his reputation as a man of letters
                    suffered no diminution. He however felt a very painful mortification at the
                    unsuccessful result of his labours; and his mind was so badly regulated that,
                    instead of reflecting on the natural tendency of his own conduct, he continued
                    to cherish a most bitter and indiscriminate resentment. In a letter, dated on
                    the 17th of June 1774, and probably addressed to his London publisher, he
                    expresses himself in these unseemly terms: “It is an infinite disappointment to
                    me, that the Magazine does not grow in London; I thought the soil had been
                    richer. But it is my constant fate to be disappointed in every thing I attempt;
                    I do not think I ever had a wish that was gratified, and never dreaded an event
                    that did not come. With this felicity of fate, I wonder how the devil I could
                    turn projector. I am now sorry that I left London; and the moment that I have
                    money enough to carry me back to it, 1 shall get off. I mortally detest and
                    abhor this place, and every body in it. Never was there a city where there was
                    so much pretension to knowledge, and that had so little of it. The solemn
                    foppery, and the gross stupidity of the Scottish literati, are perfectly
                    insupportable. I shall drop my idea of a Scots newspaper. Nothing will do in
                    this country that has common sense in it; only cant, hypocrisy, and
                    superstition, will flourish here. A curse on the country, and all the men,
                    women, and children of it.... The publication is too good for the country. There
                    are very few men of taste or erudition on this side the Tweed; yet every idiot
                    one meets with lays claim to both. Yet the success of the Magazine is in reality
                    greater than we could expect, considering that we have every clergyman in the
                    kingdom to oppose it; and that the magistracy of the place are every moment
                    threatening its destruction.” All this exhibits a melancholy picture of a man of
                    superior talents and attainments, deriving no wisdom from experience, but still
                    indulging those very passions to which his want of success was chiefly to be
                    attributed, and which always bear along with them their own punishment. Before
                    he vented his spleen in terms of such unseemly import, he ought to have
                    recollected, “It is a foul <hi rend="italic">corby</hi> that bewrays its own
                    nest.” The fault that he here commits, is not one with which his countrymen are
                    commonly chargeable; and the period which he thus describes as so barren in
                    taste and erudition, was perhaps remarkable for its intellectual eminence beyond
                    any former or succeeding period in the literary annals of Scotland.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Stuart was still in the early vigour of manhood, and he speedily
                    roused himself to new and greater exertions. After an interval of less than two
                    years, he produced what we are disposed to regard as the best of his works, “A
                    View of Society in Europe, in its Progress from Rudeness to Refinement: or,
                    Inquiries concerning the History of Law, Government, and Manners.” Edinb. 1778,
                    4to. This work, of which there are several other editions, excited much
                    attention on its first appearance. Hayley, who was then a popular writer,
                    described the author as possessing “all the energy of genius.”<note

                    conducted with judgment and sagacity; he grasps his subject with much vigour,
                    and always expresses himself with boldness and force. In the progress of his
                    discussions, he points out various mistakes of recent writers. One of these was
                    Blackstone, who silently rectified the errors which he detected.<note

                    or feeble, may however be considered as deficient in fluency and variety. His
                    periods are too uniformly short, to be altogether pleasing to the ear. Long
                    sentences he has elsewhere denounced in set terms. “This brevity,” he avers, “is
                    a conspicuous part of oratory, and is consistent with the greatest elevation and
                    dignity. Where Cicero himself is most eloquent, and where the tide of his
                    language is most rapid and powerful, his sentences are concise; and he avoids
                    with care the periodic swell, as cold, artificial, and unnatural. And indeed it
                    is to be laid down as a general rule, that where sentences are uniformly long,
                    as in Milton and in Clarendon, there is no eloquence in the composition, and

                <p part="N">The chief value of the work consists in the vivid and striking picture
                    which it exhibits of chivalry and the feudal system. In this respect it
                    possesses some advantages over Dr Robertson’s View of the Progress of Society in
                    Europe, though it is not written with the same degree of classical elegance. “In
                    the courtly and agreeable introduction to the History of Charles the Fifth,”
                    says Dr Stuart, “of which the scheme is so comprehensive, it is remarkable that,
                    amidst a wide variety of other omissions, there is not even the slightest
                    consideration of knight-service, and the knight’s fee. Yet these circumstances
                    were of a most powerful operation, both with respect to government and manners.
                    I make not this remark to detract from the diligence of an author whose
                    laboriousness is acknowledged, and whose total abstinence from all ideas and
                    inventions of his own, permitted him to carry an undivided attention to other
                    men’s thoughts and speculations; but that, resting on these peculiarities, I may
                    draw from them this general and humiliating, yet, I hope, not unuseful
                    conclusion, that the study and knowledge of the dark ages are still in their
                    infancy.” This contemptuous mention of the great historian could scarcely fail
                    to excite resentment, and of this resentment he speedily had occasion to prove
                    the bitter effects.</p>
                <p part="N">The professorship of the law of nature and nations was at that period
                    held by James Balfour; and in 1779, being then advanced in years, it was
                    ascertained that he was willing to resign it for a valuable consideration. Here
                    it is necessary to explain the very remarkable fact, that, under the sanction of
                    the secretary of state, this professorship was<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=929" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0929-0783"
                    /> regularly bought and sold. The price of his resignation had already been
                    fixed, and the chair, thus to be vacated, had been promised to Dr Stuart, when
                    the negociation was finally interrupted by a strong remonstrance from the
                    principal; who might safely represent to the lord advocate that the habits of
                    the candidate were not sufficiently academical, and that such an appointment
                    would be highly unsatisfactory to himself, as well as to some of his colleagues.
                    “While engaged in some of his studies and projected publications,” we are
                    informed, “he has been known to confine himself for many weeks to solitary
                    literary labour, hardly ever stirring abroad for air and exercise; but he
                    unfortunately indulged in occasional sallies of vastly too great latitude and
                    even licentiousness.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                <p part="N">This professorship was founded by the crown in the year 1707. The
                    salary, payable out of the tithes of the bishopric of Edinburgh, amounted in
                    1802 to about L.350; but it was then reduced so low as L.80 or L.90, by an
                    augmentation of stipend adjudged to the minister of St Cuthbert’s. As an
                    indemnity for this reduction, the professor obtained in 1806 a pension of E.200,
                    payable during his incumbency. He had “purchased his commission,” and he never
                    read a single lecture. He survived till the year 1831, and no successor has been
                    appointed. A middle way might certainly have been found between the conduct of
                    one administration and that of another. The number of lucrative offices in this
                    university is not superabundant, nor was it necessary to reduce their number by
                    so minute a fragment of public economy. Even on the admission of the chair
                    having been inefficient, this treatment, unless extended to some better-endowed
                    universities, can scarcely be regarded as impartial. The professorship of the
                    civil law at Oxford has long been as inefficient as the professorship of public
                    law at Edinburgh. Why should the one be suppressed, and the other spared?</p>
                <p part="N">His qualifications for the office which thus seemed to be within his
                    reach, were very eminent; and this signal disappointment of his hopes proved the
                    greatest misfortune of his life. His resentment against Dr Robertson appears to
                    have suggested all the works in which he afterwards engaged. This spirit is very
                    easily to be discerned in his next publication, “Observations concerning the
                    Public Law and the Constitutional History of Scotland: with occasional Remarks
                    concerning English Antiquity.” Edinb. 1779, 8vo. His extensive researches for
                    the View of Society must evidently have abridged his labour of preparing these
                    Observations, which contain much disquisition of a similar kind. The work is
                    able and elaborate, nor can it be safely overlooked by any student anxious to
                    investigate the constitutional history of our country. His antipathy to
                    Robertson is unequivocally displayed in many passages; and, at the conclusion,
                    he thus concentrates his sentiments of disparagement: “A propensity to embellish
                    other men’s notions, without considering enough on what authority they are
                    founded, how strong they are in themselves, and what inferences are to be
                    deduced from them, is a constant and a teeming source of mistake to this showy
                    and elegant historian. It is thence that he holds out many a frail opinion to
                    glitter and to perish. To collect these cannot be interesting to me. But, though
                    I could not submit to make a chronicle of his errors, I have been induced to
                    wipe away, and to dispel, in part, the stains and the gloom they would fix upon
                    our story, and to illustrate, by examples, the respect which is due to his
                    authority. And, while I perform this service to truth, to liberty, and to our
                    national antiquities, I disdain to be unjust, and am far from being insensible
                    to the peculiarities of his merit. It must be a pain, I know, to many of his
                    readers, that the most widely amusing of all our writers, is not at the same
                    time the best informed, and the most able. They must regret that a work which
                    forms so general, so easy, and so pleasing a pastime, is not also fraught with
                    instruction, and loaded with wisdom; and that the author, who is deservedly so
                    eminent in all the arts of courtly and popular composition, is not likewise
                    remarkable for those superior qualities, which alone can secure and establish
                    admiration, the power of thought, and the originality of sentiment.” It is
                    scarcely necessary for us to subjoin, that we are very far from being disposed
                    to acquiesce in this general estimate.</p>
                <p part="N">This publication was speedily followed by “The History of the
                    Establishment of the Reformation of Religion in Scotland.” Loud. 1780, 4to. The
                    work is written with his usual ability, but it cannot be affirmed that such an
                    undertaking was peculiarly adapted to his habits of thinking. He however
                    displays a greater degree of impartiality than could well have been anticipated.
                    He is willing to admit that “a tribute of the highest panegyric and praise is
                    justly to be paid to the actors in the Reformation. They gave way to the
                    movements of a liberal and a resolute spirit. They taught the rulers of nations
                    that the obedience of the subject is the child of justice, and that men must be
                    governed by their opinions and their reason. Their magnanimity is illustrated by
                    great and conspicuous exploits; which, at the same time that they awaken
                    admiration, are an example to support and animate virtue in the hour of trial
                    and peril. The existence of civil liberty was deeply connected with the
                    doctrines for which they contended and fought. While they treated with scorn an
                    abject and cruel superstition, and lifted and sublimed the dignity of man, by
                    catling his attention to a simpler and wiser theology, they were strenuous to
                    give a permanent security to the political constitution of their state.”</p>
                <p part="N">Of this work, his next publication may be considered as the sequel: “The
                    History of Scotland, from the Establishment of the Reformation till the Death of
                    Queen Mary.” Lend. 1782, 2 vols. 4to. Here the author has made a great, and
                    indeed a splendid effort, to eclipse the reputation of Robertson, whom he both
                    envied and hated. As the one historian considered Mary guilty of some of the
                    foulest crimes laid to her charge, it was almost an obvious consequence that the
                    other should represent her as innocent. Her innocence, he is willing to believe,
                    has been demonstrated by Goodall and Tytler; but more recent writers, and
                    especially Laing, have sufficiently disposed of their demonstrations; nor is it
                    perhaps to be anticipated that any historian of eminence will hereafter desert
                    the footsteps of Robertson to tread in those of Stuart. His work however
                    displays great vigour of mind, and the style is more easy and flowing than that
                    of his View of Society. Some of his characters are sketched with a powerful
                    pencil. This history attracted no inconsiderable share of public attention on
                    its first appearance, and, like his preceding volume, it reached a second
                    edition, but it made little or no progress in supplanting the rival work; and
                    the story of the ill-fated Mary’s crimes and sufferings still continues to be
                    chiefly read in the elegant and captivating pages of Robertson.</p>
                <p part="N">The preface to the History of Scotland is dated at London on the first
                    of March 1782; and soon after this period, he undertook the management of the
                    English Review, the property of the late John Murray, who had been the London
                    publisher of his Magazine. Of “The English Review, or, an Abstract of English
                    and Foreign Literature,” the first number appeared at the commencement of the
                    year 1783. One of his coadjutors was Whitaker, an uncandid and virulent critic,
                    whose chief effort in this journal was a series of articles on Gibbon’s
                        History.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">’
                            D'Israeli states that “he negociated for Whitaker and himself a doctor
                            of laws degree." (Calamities of Authors, vol. ii. p. 63.)

                    /> in a separate form in the year 1791. In this English Review, some Scotish
                    authors do not find much favour. The historical works of Dr Ferguson and Dr
                    Watson receive a liberal portion of praise; but the Lectures of Dr Blair and the
                    Dissertations of Dr Beattie are treated as works of very inferior merit and
                    importance. It is observable that Smellie's translation of Buffon is not
                    honoured with much commendation. Stuart had dedicated one of his works to the
                    chief justice; but the subsequent passage, which occurs in an article apparently
                    written by him, affords a sufficient indication of his altered sentiments: “Lord
                    Mansfield, during the course of his long life, has been uniformly the zealous
                    champion of prerogative; and has exerted and prostituted his abilities to
                    undermine the trial by jury, and the liberty of the press, those sacred and
                    formidable bulwarks which support the glorious fabric of the English
                    government.”</p>
                <p part="N">How long he continued to conduct the English Review, we are not
                    informed. In 1785 he became the editor of “The Political Herald and Review; or a
                    Survey of domestic and foreign Politics, and a critical Account of political and
                    historical Publications.” This work, it is believed, only reached a second
                    volume. One of his coadjutors, in this as well as the English Review, was Dr
                    Thomson, who, like himself, was too great a lover of Burton ale. Their favourite
                    haunt was the Peacock in Gray’s Inn Lane.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    It is too well known that Stuart’s mode of life had been such as to impair his
                    health and strength. With a constitution undermined by disease, and a mind
                    soured by disappointment, he embarked for Leith, and sought a place of rest
                    under the roof of his father, who having become emeritus professor in 1775, was
                    then residing at Musselburgh. The son was labouring under a dropsy, from which
                    the usual operation afforded him a temporary relief; but all medical aid was
                    ineffectual, and he descended to bis grave at the premature age of forty-four.
                    He died on the 13th of August 1786, and his father survived till the 18th of
                    June 1793.</p>
                <p part="N">Gilbert Stuart is thus described by a writer who seems to have had some
                    personal knowledge of him: He “was about the middle size, and justly
                    proportioned. His countenance was modest and expressive, sometimes announcing
                    sentiments of glowing friendship, of which he is said to have been truly
                    susceptible; at others, displaying strong indignation against folly and vice,
                    which he had also shewn in his writings. With all his ardour for study, he
                    yielded to the love of intemperance, to which, notwithstanding a strong
                    constitution, be fell an early sacrifice.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
