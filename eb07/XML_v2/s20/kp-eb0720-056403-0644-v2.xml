                <p part="N"><label type="entry">STARK, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>,
                    was born at Manchester in the month of July 1740; but the family from which he
                    sprang was Scotish, and respectable for its antiquity. One of his uncles, John
                    Stark, was minister of Lecropt in Perthshire; and it was under the care of this
                    gentleman that he receiv ed the rudiments of his education, which, when we
                    consider the character of the master, and reflect on the relation between him
                    and his pupil, we may presume was calculated to store the mind of the latter
                    with those virtuous prnciples which influenced his conduct through life. From
                    Lecropt young Stark was sent to the university of Glasgow, where, under the
                    tuition of Dr. Smith and Dr. Black, with other eminent masters, he learned the
                    rudiments of science, and acquired that mathematical accuracy, that logical
                    precision, and that contempt of hypotheses, with which he prosecuted all his
                    future studies. Having chosen physic for his profession, he removed from the
                    university of Glasgow to that of Edinburgh, where he was soon distinguished, and
                    honour ed with the friendship of the late Dr. Cullen; a man who was not more
                    eminently conspicuous for the superiority of his own genius, than quick-sighted
                    in perceiving, and liberal in encouraging, genius in his pupils. Having finished
                    his studies at Edinburgh, though he took there no degree, Mr. Stark, in the year
                    1765, went to London, and devoted himself entirely to the study of physic and
                    the elements of surgery; and looking upon anatomy as one of the principal
                    pillars of both these arts, he endeavoured to complete with Dr. Hunter what he
                    had begun with Dr.Monro; and under these two eminent teachers he appears to have
                    acquired a high degree of anatomical knowledge. He likewise entered himself,
                    about this time, a pupil at St. George’s hospital; and with what industry he
                    prosecuted this plan, with what success his labours were crowned, may be seen in
                    a series of Clinical and Anatomical Observations, which were made by him during
                    his attendance at the hospital, and were published after his death by his friend
                    Dr. Carmichael Smyth.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1767 he went to Leyden, where he took the degree of M.D.,
                    publishing an inaugural dissertation on the dysentery. On his return to London,
                    he recommenced his studies at the hospital; and when Dr. Black was called to the
                    chemical chair in Edinburgh, which he long filled with so much honour to himself
                    and credit to the university, Dr. Stark was solicited, by several members of the
                    υniversity of Glasgow, to stand as a candidate for their professor ship of the
                    theory and practice of physic, rendered vacant by Dr. Black’s removal to
                    Edinburgh. This, however, he de clined, being influenced by the advice of his
                    English friends, who wished to detain him in London, and having, likewise, some
                    prospects of an appointment in the hospital. In 1769 he commenced a series of
                    experiments on diet, which he was encouraged to undertake by Sir John Pringle
                    and Dr. Franklin, whose friendship he enjoyed, and from whom he received many
                    hints respecting both the plan and its exe cution. These experiments, or rather
                    the imprudent zeal with which he prosecuted them, proved, in the opinion of his
                    friends, fatal to himself; for he began them on the 12th of July 1769 in perfect
                    health and vigour, and from that day, though his health varied, it was seldom if
                    ever good, till the 23d of February 1770, when he died after suffering much
                    uneasiness.</p>
