                    Robert</hi></label>, professor of mathematics in the university of Glasgow, was
                    born in the year 1687, of a respectable family, which had held a small estate in
                    the county of Lanark for some generations. He was, we think, the second son of
                    the family. A younger brother was professor of medicine in the university of St.
                    Andrews, and is known by some works of reputation, particularly a <hi
                        rend="italic">Dissertation on the Nervous System,</hi> occasioned by the
                    dissection of a brain completely ossified.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr. Simson was educated in the university of Glasgow under the eye of
                    some of his relations who were professors. Eager after knowledge, he made great
                    progress in all his studies; and, as his mind did not, at the very first
                    openings of science, strike into that path which afterwards so strongly
                    attracted him, and in which he proceeded so far almost without a companion, he
                    acquired in every walk of science a stock of information, which, though it had
                    never been much augmented afterwards, would have done credit to a professional
                    man in any of his studies. He became at a very early period, an adept in the
                    philosophy and theology of the schools, was able to supply the place of a sick
                    relation in the class of oriental languages, was noted for historical knowledge,
                    and one of the most accomplished botanists of his time.</p>
                <p part="N">It was during his theological studies, as preparatory for his entering
                    into orders, that mathematics took hold of his fancy. He used to tell in his
                    convivial moments how he amused himself when preparing his exercises for the
                    divinity hall. When tired with vague speculation, in which he did not meet with
                    certainty to reward his labours, he turned up a book of oriental philology, in
                    which he found something which he could discover to be true or to be false,
                    without going out of the line of study which was to be of ultimate use to him.
                    Sometimes even this could not relieve his fatigue. He then had recourse to
                    mathematics, which never failed to satisfy and refresh him. For a long while he
                    restricted himself to a very moderate use of the cordial, fearing that he would
                    soon exhaust the small stock which so limited and abstract a science could
                    yield; till at last he found, that the more he learned, a wider field opened to
                    his view, and scenes that were inexhaustible. Becoming acquainted with subjects
                    far beyond the elements of the science, and with numbers of names celebrated
                    during that period of ardent research all over Europe, he found it to be a manly
                    and important study, by which he was as likely to acquire reputation as by any
                    other. About this time, too, a prospect began to open of making mathematics his
                    profession for life. He then gave himself up to it without reserve.</p>
                <p part="N">His original incitement to this stuoy as a treat, as something to please
                    and refresh his mind in the midst of more severe tasks, gave a particular turn
                    to his mathematical studies, from which he never could afterwards deviate.
                    Perspicuity and elegance are more attainable, and more discernible, in pure
                    geometry, than in any other parts of the science of measure. To this therefore
                    he chiefly devoted himself. For the same reason he preferred the ancient mode of
                    studying pure geometry, and even felt a dislike to the Cartesian method of
                    substituting symbols for operations of the mind, and still more was he disgusted
                    with the substitution of symbols for the very objects of discussion, for lines,
                    surfaces, solids, and their affections. He was rather disposed, in the solution
                    of an algebraical problem, where quantity alone was considered, to substitute
                    figure and its affections for the algebraical symbols, and to convert the
                    algebraic formula into an analogous geometrical theorem. And he came at last to
                    consider algebraic analysis as little better than a kind of mechanical knack, in
                    which we proceed without ideas of any kind, and obtain a result without meaning,
                    and without being conscious of any process of reasoning, and therefore without
                    any conviction of its truth. And there is no denying, that if genuine
                    unsophisticated taste alone is to be consulted, Dr. Simson was in the right; for
                    though it must also be acknowledged, that the reasoning in algebra is as strict
                    as in the purest geometry of Euclid or Apollonius, the expert analyst has little
                    perception of it as he goes on, and his final equation is not felt by himself as
                    the result of ratiocination, any more than if he had obtained it by Pascal’s
                    arithmetical mill. This does not in the least diminish our admiration of the
                    algebraic analysis; for its almost boundless grasp, its rapid and certain
                    procedure, and the delicate metaphysics and great address which may be displayed
                    in conducting it. Such, however, was the ground of the strong bias of Dr.
                    Simeon’s mind to the analysis of the ancient geometers. It increased as he went
                    forward; and his veneration for the ancient geometry was carried to a degree of
                    idolatry. His chief labours were exerted in efforts to restore the works of the
                    ancient geometers; and he has nowhere bestowed much pains in advancing the
                    modern discoveries in mathematics. The noble inventions, for example, of
                    fluxions and of logarithms, by which our progress in mathematical knowledge, and
                    in the useful application of this knowledge, is so much promoted, attracted the
                    notice of Dr. Simson; but he has contented himself with demonstrating their
                    truth on the genuine principles of the ancient geometry. Yet was he thoroughly
                    acquainted with all the modem discoveries; and there are to be seen amongst his
                    papers, discussions and investigations in the Cartesian method, which show him
                    thoroughly acquainted with all the principles, and even expert in the <hi

                            >In 1732 the writer nf tbiβ article, being then bis scholar, requested
                            him to examine an account which he gave him of what he thought a new
                            curve (a conchoid having a circle for its base.) Dr. Simson returned it
                            next day with a regular list of its leading properties, and the
                            investigation of such as be thought his scholar would not so easily
                            trace. In this hasty scrawl the lines related to the circle were
                            familiarly considered as arithmetical fractions of the radius considered
                            only as unity. This was before Euler published his Arithmetic of the
                            Sines and Tangents, now in universal use.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">About the age of twenty-five, Dr. Simson was chosen professor of
                    mathematics in the university of Glasgow. He went to London immediately after
                    his appointment, and there formed an acquaintance with the most eminent men of
                    that bright era of British science. Amongst these he always mentioned Captain
                    Halley (the celebrated Dr. Edmund Halley) with particular respect; saying, that
                    he had the most acute penetration, and the most just taste in that science, of
                    any man he had ever known. And, indeed, Dr. Halley has strongly exemplified both
                    of these in his divination of the work of Apollonius <hi rend="italic">de
                        Sectione Spatii,</hi> and the eighth book of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conics,</hi> and in some of the most beautiful theorems in Sir Isaac
                    Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Principia.</hi> Dr. Simson also admired the wide and
                    masterly steps which Newton was accustomed to take in his investigations, and
                    his manner of substituting geometrical figures for the quantities which are
                    observed in the phenomena of nature. It was from Dr. Simson that the writer of
                    this article had the<pb break="no"

                    /> remark which has been oftener than once repeated in the course of this work,
                    “That the thirty-ninth proposition of the first book of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Principia</hi> was the most important proposition that had ever been
                    exhibited to the physico-mathematical philosopher and he used always to
                    illustrate to his more advanced scholars the superiority of the geometrical over
                    the algebraic analysis, by comparing the solution given by Newton of the inverse
                    problem of centripetal forces, in the forty-second proposition of that book,
                    with the one given by John Bernoulli in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences
                    at Paris for 1713. We have heard him say, that to his own knowledge Newton
                    frequently investigated his propositions in the symbolical way, and that it was
                    owing chiefly to Dr. Halley that they did not finally appear in that dress. But
                    if Dr. Simson was well informed, we think it a great argument in favour of the
                    symbolical analysis, when this most successful practical artist (for so we must
                    call Newton when engaged in a task of discovery) found it conducive either to
                    dispatch or perhaps to his very progress.</p>
                <p part="N">Returning to his academical chair, Dr. Simson discharged the duties of a
                    professor for more than fifty years, with great honour to the university and to
                    himself.</p>
                <p part="N">It is almost needless to say, that in his prelections he followed
                    strictly the Euclidian method in elementary geometry. He made use of Theodosius
                    as an introduction to spherical trigonometry. In the higher geometry, he
                    prelected from his own Conics, and he gave a small specimen of the linear
                    problems of the ancients, by explaining the properties, sometimes of the
                    conchoid, sometimes of the cissoid, with their application to the solution of
                    such problems. In the more advanced class, he was accustomed to give Napier’s
                    mode of conceiving logarithms, that is, quantities as generated by motion, and
                    Mr. Coats’s view of them, as the sums of ratiunculae; and to demonstrate
                    Newton’s lemmas concerning the limits of ratios, and then to give the elements
                    of the fluxionary calculus; and to finish his course with a select set of
                    propositions in optics, gnomonics, and central forces. His method of teaching
                    was simple and perspicuous, his elocution clear, and his manner easy and
                    impressive. He had the respect, and still more the affection, of his
                    scholars.</p>
                <p part="N">With respect to his studies, we have already informed the reader that
                    they got an early bias to pure geometry, and to the elegant but scrupulous
                    methods of the ancients. We have heard Dr. Simson say, that it was in a great
                    measure owing to Dr. Halley that he so early directed his efforts to the
                    restoration of the ancient geometers. He had recommended this to him, as the
                    most certain way for him, then a very young man, both to acquire reputation, and
                    to improve his own knowledge and taste; and he presented him with a copy of
                    Pappus’s <hi rend="italic">Mathematical collections,</hi> enriched with some of
                    his own notes. The perspicuity of the ancient geometrical analysis, and a
                    certain elegance in the nature of the solutions which it affords, especially by
                    means of the local theorems, soon took firm hold of his fancy, and made him,
                    with the sanguine expectation of a young man, direct his very first efforts to
                    the recovery of this <hi rend="italic">in toto;</hi> and the restoration of
                    Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Pοrisms</hi> was the first task to which he set
                    himself. The accomplished geometer knows what a desperate task this was, from
                    the scanty and mutilated account which we have of this work in a single passage
                    of Pappus. It was an ambition which nothing but success could justify in so
                    young an adventurer. He succeeded; and as early as 1718, seemed to have been in
                    complete possession of this method of investigation, which was considered by the
                    eminent geometers of antiquity as their surest guide through the labyrinths of
                    the higher geometry. Dr. Simson gave a specimen of his discovery in 1723, in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions;</hi> and after this time he
                    ceased not from his endeavours to recover that choice collection of Porisms
                    which Euclid had collected, as of the most general use in the solution of
                    difficult questions. What some of these must have been, was pointed out to Dr.
                    Simson by the very nature of the general proposition of Pappus, which he has
                    restored. Others were pointed out by the lemmas which Pappus has given as helps
                    to the young mathematician towards their demonstration. And, being thus in
                    possession of a considerable number, their mutual relations pointed out a sort
                    of system, of which these made a part, and the blanks of which now remained to
                    be filled up.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr. Simson, having thus gained his favourite point, had leisure to turn
                    his attention to the other works of the ancient geometers; and the porisms of
                    Euclid now had only an occasional share. The <hi rend="italic">loci plani</hi>
                    of Apollonius was another task which he very early engaged in, and completed
                    about the year 1738. But, after it was printed, he imagined that he had not
                    given the <hi rend="italic">ipsissimae propositiones</hi> of Apollonius, and in
                    the precise spirit and order of that author. The impression lay by him for some
                    years; and it was with great reluctance that he yielded to the entreaties of his
                    mathematical friends, and published the work, in 1746, with some emendations,
                    where he thought he had deviated farthest from his author. He quickly repented
                    of this scanty concession, and recalled what he could of the small number of
                    copies which he had given to the booksellers, and the impression again lay by
                    him for years. He afterwards recorrected the work, and still with some
                    reluctance allowed it to come abroad as the <hi rend="italic">Restitution of
                        Apollonius.</hi> The public, however, had not been so fastidious as Dr.
                    Simson, and the work had acquired great celebrity, and he was now considered as
                    one of the first and the most elegant geometers of the age; for, in the
                    meantime, he had published his <hi rend="italic">Conic Sections,</hi> a work of
                    uncommon merit, whether we consider it as equivalent to a complete restitution
                    of the celebrated work of Apollonius Pergaeus, or as an excellent system of this
                    important part of mathematics. It is marked with the same features as the <hi
                        rend="italic">loci plani,</hi> the most anxious solicitude to exhibit the
                    very text of Apollonius, even in the propositions belonging to the books which
                    had been completely lost. These could be recovered in no other way but by a
                    thorough knowledge of the precise plan proposed by the author, and by taking it
                    for granted that the author had accurately accomplished this plan. In this
                    manner did Viviani proceed in the first attempt which was made to restore the
                    conics of Apollonius; and he has given us a detail of the process of his
                    conjectures, by which we may form an opinion of its justness, and of the
                    probability how far he has attained the desired object. Dr. Simeon’s view in his
                    performance was something different, deviating a little in this one case from
                    his general track. He was not altogether pleased with the work of Viviani, even
                    as augmented by the eighth book added by Halley, and his wish was to restore the
                    ancient original. But, in the meantime, an academical text-book for conic
                    sections was much wanted. He was much dissatisfied with those in common use; and
                    he was not insensible of the advantage resulting from the considerations of
                    these sections, independent of the cone first introduced by Dr. Wallis. He
                    therefore composed this excellent treatise as an elementary book, not to
                    supersede, but to prepare for the study of Apollonius; and accordingly he
                    accommodates it to this purpose, and gives several important propositions in
                    their proper places, expressly as restitutions of Apollonius, whom he keeps
                    constantly in view through the whole work.</p>
                <p part="N">Much about this time, Dr. Simson seriously began to prepare a perfect
                    edition of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> The intimate acquaintance
                    which he had by this time acquired with all the original works of the ancient
                    geometers, and their ancient commentators and critics, encouraged him to hope
                    that he could restore to its original lustre this leader in mathematical
                    science; and the errors which had crept into this celebrated work, and which
                    still remained in it, appeared of<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=421" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0421-0359"
                    /> magnitude sufficient to merit the most careful efforts for their removal. The
                        <hi rend="italic">data</hi> also, which were in like manner the introduction
                    to the whole art of geometrical investigation, seemed to call more loudly for
                    his amending hand. For it appears that the Saracens, who have preserved to us
                    the writings of the ancients, have contented themselves with admiring these
                    celebrated works, and have availed themselves of the knowledge which they
                    contain; but they have shewn no inclination to add to the stock, or to promote
                    the sciences which they had received. They could not do any thing without the
                    synthetical books of the geometers; but, not meaning to go beyond the
                    discoveries which they had made, they neglected all the books which related to
                    the analytic art alone, and the greatest part of them (about twenty-five out of
                    thirty) have irrecoverably perished. The data of Euclid have fortunately been
                    preserved, but the book was neglected, and the only ancient copies, which are
                    but three or four, are miserably erroneous and mutilated. Fortunately, it is no
                    very arduous matter to reinstate this work in its original perfection. The plan
                    is precise, both in its extent and its method. It has been restored, therefore,
                    with success by more than one author. But Dr. Simson’s comprehensive view of the
                    whole analytical system pointed out to him many occasions for amendment. He
                    therefore made its restitution a joint task with that of the elements. All the
                    lovers of true geometry will acknowledge their obligations to him for the
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Data</hi>
                    which he published about 1758. The text is corrected with the most judicious and
                    scrupulous care, and the notes are inestimable, both for their information, and
                    for the tendency which they must have to form the mind of the student to a true
                    judgment and taste in mathematical subjects. The more accomplished reader will
                    perhaps be sometimes disposed to smile at the axiom which seems to pervade the
                    notes, “that a work of Euclid must be supposed without error or defect.” If this
                    was not the case, Euclid has been obliged to his editor in more instances than
                    one. Nor should his greatest admirers think it impossible, that in the progress
                    of human improvement, a geometrical truth should occur to one of these latter
                    days, which escaped the notice of even the lynx-eyed Euclid. Such merit,
                    however, Dr. Simson nowhere claims, but lays every blame of error, omission, or
                    obscurity, to the charge of Proclus, Theon, and other editors and commentators
                    of the renowned Grecian.</p>
                <p part="N">There is another work of Apollonius on which Dr. Simson has bestowed
                    great pains, and has restored, as we imagine, <hi rend="italic">omnibus numeris
                        perfectum,</hi> namely, the <hi rend="italic">Sectio Determinata;</hi> one
                    of those performances which are of indispensable use in the application of the
                    ancient analysis. This also seems to have been an early task, though we do not
                    know the date of his labours on it. It did not appear till after his death,
                    being then published along with the great work, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Porisms</hi> of Euclid, at the expense of the Earl Stanhope, a nobleman
                    intimately conversant with the ancient geometry, and zealous for its reception
                    amongst the mathematicians of the present age. He had kept up a constant
                    correspondence with Dr. Simson on mathematical subjects; and at his death in
                    1768, engaged Mr. Clow, professor of logic in the university of Glasgow, to
                    whose care the Doctor had left all his valuable papers, to make a selection of
                    such as would serve to support and increase his well-earned reputation as the
                    restorer of ancient geometry.</p>
                <p part="N">We have been thus particular in our account of Dr. Simson’s labours in
                    these works, because his manner of execution, whilst it does honour to his
                    inventive powers, and shews his just taste in mathematical composition, also
                    confirms our former assertion, that he carried his respect for the ancient
                    geometers to a degree of superstitious idolatry, and that his fancy, unchecked,
                    viewed them as incapable of error or imperfection. This is distinctly to be seen
                    in the emendations which he has given of the texts, particularly in his editions
                    of Euclid. Not only every imperfection of the reading is ascribed to the
                    ignorance of copyists, and every indistinctness in the conception,
                    inconclusiveness in the reasoning, and defect in the method, is ascribed to the
                    ignorance or mistake of the commentators; but it is all along assumed that the
                    work was perfect in its kind, and that by exhibiting a perfect work, we restore
                    the genuine original. This is surely gratuitous; and it is very possible that it
                    has, in some instances, made Dr. Simson fail of his anxious purpose, and give ns
                    even a better than the original. It has undoubtedly made him fail in what should
                    have been his great purpose, namely, to give the world a connected system of the
                    ancient geometrical analysis, such as would, in the first place, exhibit it in
                    its most engaging form, elegant, perspicuous, and comprehensive; and, in the
                    next place, such as should engage the mathematicians of the present age to adopt
                    it as the most certain and successful conductor in those laborious and difficult
                    researches in which the demands of modem science continually engage them. And
                    this might have been expected, in the province of speculative geometry at least,
                    from a person of such extensive knowledge of the properties of figure, and who
                    had so eminently succeeded in the many trials which he had made of its powers.
                    We might have expected that he would at least have exhibited in one systematic
                    point of view, what the ancients had done in several detached branches of the
                    science, and how far they had proceeded in the solution of the several
                    successive classes of problems; and we might have hoped, that he would have
                    instructed us in what manner we should apply that method to the solution of
                    problems of a more elevated kind, daily presented to us in the questions of
                    physico-mathematical science. By this he would have acquired distinguished
                    honour, and science would have received the most valuable improvement. But Dr.
                    Simson has done little of all this; and we cannot say that great helps have been
                    derived from his labours by the eminent mathematicians of this age, who are
                    successfully occupied in advancing our knowledge of nature, or in improving the
                    arts of life. He has indeed contributed greatly to the entertainment of the
                    speculative mathematician, who is more delighted with the conscious exercise of
                    his own reasoning powers, than with the final result of his researches. Yet we
                    are not even certain that Dr. Simson has done this to the extent he wished and
                    hoped. He has not engaged the liking of mathematicians to this analysis, by
                    presenting it in the most agreeable form. His own extreme anxiety to tread in
                    the very footsteps of the original authors, has, in a thousand instances,
                    precluded him from using his own extensive knowledge, that he might not employ
                    principles which were not of a class inferior to that of the question in hand.
                    Thus, of necessity, did the method appear trammelled. We are deterred from
                    employing a process which appears to restrain us in the application of the
                    knowledge which we have already acquired; and, disgusted with the tedious, and
                    perhaps indirect path, by which we must arrive at an object which we see clearly
                    over the hedge, and which we could reach by a few steps, of the security of
                    which we are otherwise perfectly assured. These prepossessions are indeed
                    founded on mistake; but the mistake is such, that all fall into it, till
                    experience has enlarged their views. This circumstance alone has hitherto
                    prevented mathematicians from acquiring that knowledge of the ancient analysis
                    which would enable them to proceed in their researches with certainty, dispatch,
                    and delight. It is therefore deeply to be regretted, that this eminent genius
                    has occupied, in this superstitious palaeology, a long and busy life, which
                    might have been employed in original works of infinite advantage to the world,
                    and honour to himself.</p>
                <p part="N">Our readers will, it is hoped, consider these observations as of general
                    scientific importance, and as intimately connected with the history of
                    mathematics; and therefore as<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=422" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0422-0360"
                    /> not improperly introduced in the biographical account of one of the most
                    eminent writers on this science. Dr. Simeon claimed our notice as a
                    mathematician; and his affectionate admiration of the ancient analysis is the
                    prominent feature of his literary character. By this he is known all over
                    Europe; and his name is never mentioned by any foreign author without some very
                    honourable allusion to his distinguished geometrical elegance and skill. Dr.
                    James Moor, professor of Greek in the University of Glasgow, no less eminent for
                    his knowledge in ancient geometry than for his professional talents, put the
                    following apposite inscription below a portrait of Dr. Simson: “Geometriam, sub
                    Tyranno barbaro saeva servitute diu squalentem, in libertatem et decus antiquum
                    vindicavit unus.”</p>
                <p part="N">Yet it must not be understood that Dr. Simeon’s predilection for the
                    geometrical analysis of the ancients did so far mislead him as to make him
                    neglect' the symbolical analysis of the present times; on the contrary, he was
                    completely master of it, as has been already observed, and frequently employed
                    it. In his academical lectures to the students of his upper classes, he used to
                    point out its proper province, which he by no means limited by a scanty
                    boundary, and in what cases it might be applied with safety and advantage even
                    to questions of pure geometry. He once honoured the writer of this article with
                    the sight of a very short dissertation on this subject, perhaps the one referred
                    to in the preface to his <hi rend="italic">conic Sections.</hi> In this piece he
                    was perhaps more liberal than the most zealous partizans of the symbolical
                    analysis could desire, admitting <hi rend="italic">p* C as</hi> a sufficient
                    equation of the Conic Sections L=- <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>-, where</p>
                <p part="N">L is the <hi rend="italic">latus rectum, x</hi> is the distance of any
                    point of the curve from the focus, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the perpendicular
                    drawn from the focus to the tangent in the given point, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >c</hi> is the chord of the equicurve circle drawn through the focus.
                    Unfortunately this dissertation was not found amongst his papers. He spoke in
                    high terms of the analytical works of Cotes, and of the two Bernoullis. He was
                    consulted by Mr. Maclaurin during the progress of his inestimable <hi
                        rend="italic">Treatise of Fluxions,</hi> and contributed not a little to the
                    reputation of that work. The spirit of that most ingenious algebraic
                    demonstration of the fluxions of a rectangle, and the very process of the
                    argument, is the same with Dr. Simson’s in his dissertation on the limits of
                    quantities. It was therefore from a thorough acquaintance with the subject, and
                    by a just taste, that he was induced to prefer his favourite analysis, or, to
                    speak more properly, to exhort mathematicians to employ it in his own sphere,
                    and not to become ignorant of geometry, while he successively employed the
                    symbolical analysis in cases which did not require it, and which suffered by its
                    admission. It must be acknowledged, however, that in his later years, the
                    disgust which he felt at the artificial and slovenly employment on subjects of
                    pure geometry, sometimes hindered him from even looking at the most refined and
                    ingenious improvements of the algebraic analysis which occur in the writings of
                    Euler, D’Alembert, and other eminent masters. But, when properly informed of
                    them, he never failed to give them their due praise; and we remember him
                    speaking, in terms of great satisfaction, of an improvement of the infinitesmal
                    calculus, by D’Alembert and D’Lagrange, in their researches concerning the
                    propagation of sound, and the vibration of musical cords.</p>
                <p part="N">And that Dr. Simson was not only master of this calculus and the
                    symbolical calculus in general, but held them in proper esteem, appears from two
                    valuable dissertations to be found in his posthumous works; the one on
                    logarithms, and the other on the limits of ratios. The last, in particular,
                    shows how completely he was satisfied with respect to the solid foundation of
                    the method of fluxions; and it contains an elegant and strict demonstration of
                    all the applications which have been made of the method by its illustrious
                    author to the objects of pure geometry.</p>
                <p part="N">We hoped to have given a much more complete and instructive account of
                    this eminent geometer and his works, by the aid of a person fully acquainted
                    with both, and able to appreciate their value; but an accident has deprived us
                    of this assistance, when it was too late to procure an equivalent. And we must
                    request our readere to accept of this very imperfect account, since we cannot do
                    justice to Dr. Simson’s merit unless almost equally conversant in all the
                    geometry of the ancient Greeks.</p>
                <p part="N">The life of a literary man rarely teems with anecdote; and a
                    mathematician, devoted to his studies, is perhaps more abstracted than any other
                    person from the ordinary occurrences of life, and even the ordinary topics of
                    conversation. Dr. Simson was of this class; and, having never married, lived
                    entirely a college life. Having no occasion for the commodious house to which
                    his place in the university entitled him, he contented himself with chambers,
                    good, indeed, and spacious enough for his sober accommodation, and for receiving
                    his choice collection of mathematical writers, but without any decoration or
                    commodious furniture. His official servant sufficed for valet, footman, and
                    chamber-maid. As this retirement was entirely devoted to study, he entertained
                    no company in his chambers, but in a neighbouring house, where his apartment was
                    sacred to him and his guests.</p>
                <p part="N">Having in early life devoted himself to the restoration of the works of
                    the ancient geometers, he studied them with unremitting attention; and, retiring
                    from the promiscuous intercourse of the world, he contented himself with a small
                    society of intimate friends, with whom he could lay aside every restraint of
                    ceremony or reserve, and indulge in all the innocent frivolities of life. Every
                    Friday evening was spent in a party at whist, in which he excelled, and took
                    delight in instructing others, till increasing years made him less patient with
                    the dulness of a scholar. The card-party was followed by an hour or two
                    dedicated solely to playful conversation. In like manner, every Saturday he had
                    a less select party to dinner at a house about a mile from town. The Doctor’s
                    long life gave him occasion to see the <hi rend="italic">dramatis persona</hi>
                    of this little theatre completely changed, whilst he continued to give it a
                    personal identity; so that, without any design or wish of his own, it became, as
                    it were, his own house and his own family, and went by his name.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr. Simson was of a good stature, with a fine countenance; and even in
                    his old age he had a graceful carriage and manner, and always, except when in
                    mourning, dressed in light coloured clothes. He was of a cheerful disposition;
                    and though he did not make the first advances to acquaintance, had the most
                    affable manner, and strangers were at perfect ease in his company. He enjoyed a
                    long course of uninterrupted health; but toward the close of life suffered from
                    an acute disease, and was obliged to employ an assistant in his professional
                    labours for a few years preceding his death, which happened in 1768, at the age
                    of eighty-one. He left to the university his valuable library, which is now
                    arranged apart from the rest of the books, and the public use of it is limited
                    by particular rules. It is considered as the most choice collection of
                    mathematical books and manuscripts in the kingdom, and many of them are rendered
                    doubly valuable by Dr. Simson’s notes. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.b.b.)</hi></p>
