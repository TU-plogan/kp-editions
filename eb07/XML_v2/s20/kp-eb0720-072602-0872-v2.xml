                <p part="N"><label type="entry">STILPO</label>, a celebrated philosopher of Megara,
                    flourished under the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes. In his youth he had been
                    addicted to licentious pleasures, from which he religiously refrained from the
                    moment when he ranked himself among philosophers. When Ptolemy Soter, at the
                    taking of Megara, offered him a large sum of money, and requested that he would
                    accompany him into Egypt, he accepted but a small part of the offer, and retired
                    to the island of AEgina, whence, on Ptolemy’s departure, he returned to Megara.
                    That city being again taken by Demetrius the son of Antigonus, and the
                    philosopher required to give an account of any effects which he had lost during
                    the hurry of the plunder, he replied that he had lost nothing;<pb break="no"

                    /> for no one could take from him his learning and eloquence. So great was the
                    fame of Stilpo, that the most eminent philosophers of Athens took pleasure in
                    attending upon his discourses. His peculiar doctrines were, that species or
                    universals have no real existence, and that one thing cannot be predicated of
                    another. With respect to the former of these opinions, he seems to have taught
                    the same doctrine with the sect afterwards known by the appellation of <hi
                        rend="italic">Nominalists.</hi> To prove that one thing cannot be predicated
                    of another, he said, that <hi rend="italic">goodness</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >man,</hi> for instance, are different things, which cannot be confounded by
                    asserting the one to be the other. He argued further, that goodness is a
                    universal, and universals have no real existence; consequently, since nothing
                    cannot be predicated of any thing, goodness cannot be predicated of man. Thus,
                    while the subtile logician was, through his whole argument, predicating one
                    thing of another, he denied that any one thing could be the accident or
                    predicate of another. If Stilpo was serious in this reasoning, if he meant any
                    thing more than to expose the sophistry of the schools, he must be confessed to
                    have been an eminent master of the art of wrangling; and it was not wholly
                    without reason that Glycera, a celebrated courtezan, when she was reproved by
                    him as a corrupter of youth, replied, that the charge might be justly retorted
                    upon himself, who spent his time in filling their heads with sophistical
                    quibbles and useless subtleties. In ethics he seems to have been a Stoic, and in
                    religion he had a public and a private doctrine, the former for the multitude,
                    and the latter for his friends. He admitted the existence of a Supreme Divinity,
                    but had no reverence for the Grecian superstitions.</p>
