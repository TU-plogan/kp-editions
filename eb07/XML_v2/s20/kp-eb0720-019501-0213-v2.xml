                <p part="N"><label type="entry">SHEFFIELD</label>, an ancient, large, and
                    flourishing markettown in the west riding of the county of York, 160 miles
                    north-north-west from London. It derives its name from the river Sheaf, which
                    here flows into the Don. These rivers descend from the boldly swelling hills
                    west of the town, and form, with their mountain-tributaries, interesting
                    features in that beautiful scenery for which the neighbourhood has always been
                    noted. The town itself, which used formerly to be described as built upon a
                    gentle hill, rising within an ample valley, has long since stretched over the
                    ascending slopes on every side of its original site, particularly to the west,
                    which is a large suburb of beautiful villas. The inequalities of the ground have
                    not been compensated, either by the regularity of the streets, or by any thing
                    like uniformity in the buildings. The town has been said to be black; and
                    certainly the smoke emitted from upwards of one hundred steam-engine chimneys,
                    and ten times that number of forges, workshops, &amp;c., to say nothing of what
                    issues from so many dwellings, in a place where coal is cheap, does occasionally
                    form a considerable cloud; but the houses are not more dingy, and the streets
                    generally much cleaner, than in other manufacturing towns of the same size. Few
                    persons have approached the town in any direction, without being struck with the
                    beauty of the surrounding neighbourhood, resembling, in many respects, the
                    varied character of a nobleman’s park; and it would be difficult to find a
                    single street from which a glimpse of the landscape cannot be obtained. Many of
                    the neighbouring villas are built of a light-coloured stone, while those in the
                    town are mostly of a dark-red brick. A great proportion of the latter,
                    particularly in the newer streets, are small, being the residences of the
                    artisans and working classes generally, almost every family living in a separate
                    dwelling. This independent occupancy, added to the fact that in few cases are
                    the labours of the workmen carried on at home, bespeaks a degree of comfort and
                    cleanliness scarcely to be looked for in buildings where a single room serves at
                    once as the workshop of the industrious man and the residence of his family.</p>
                <p part="N">Sheffield is the modern capital of a somewhat undefined district, which
                    for ages has been called Hallamshire, the present Hallam, a hamlet west of the
                    town, having been considered the site of the ancient capital, where stood the
                        <hi rend="italic">aula,</hi> or chief residence of the Saxon lord.</p>
                <p part="N">Since the sixteenth century, the records of the place show a singularly
                    rapid increase of the population. In 1615 the town contained 2207 souls, in 1755
                    this number was multiplied sixfold, in 1796 the census was 29,013, in 1821 the
                    population of the entire parish of Sheffield was 65,275, and in 1831 the
                    inhabitants wore 91,692; at present they are estimated at 110,000. Of these,
                    about 96,000 may be said to reside in the town and suburbs, the remainder in the
                    out townships. A proportionate increase has taken place in the number of houses.
                    These in 1831 were stated to be 19,700; they are now 25,000.</p>
                <p part="N">Sheffield has no municipal head, no stipendiary magistrate, or other
                    paramount local governor. Some of the west-riding magistrates, generally those
                    nearest, for none of them reside within the township, sit in the town-hall twice
                    a week for the current disposal of offenders and other business. In the same
                    building is held the manor court for the recovery of small debts; and here too
                    are the offices of a night and day police. An attempt was made in 1838 to obtain
                    a corporation, in conformity with the recent act of parliament; but a great
                    majority of the inhabitants opposing the design, it was abandoned.</p>
                <p part="N">The vicinity of Sheffield abounds with the natural elements of
                    prosperity; and of these the inhabitants were prompt to avail themselves, long
                    before the means of a perfect intercommunication throughout the country had
                    generalized these advantages. On every side of the town coal has been got, and
                    actually within the town itself, the seams, although wrought for centuries,
                    appearing in some places almost inexhaustible. With the coal is found ironstone,
                    which is smelted in the neighbourhood; while clay, slate, and sandstone are
                    abundant, and of excellent quality. A navigable canal, opened in 1819, completed
                    a water-communication between Sheffield and the German Ocean; and in 1838, a
                    railway to Rotherham (six miles) was finished. The line of a railway between
                    Sheffield and Winchester is in progress, including a tunnel of three miles under
                    the English Apennines. The number and rapid descent of the streams west of the
                    town afford innumerable waterfalls, on which grinding establishments have been
                    built, and in which, previous to the introduction of steam power, all the
                    edgetools and cutlery made in the district were ground and polished.</p>
                <p part="N">Sheffield has long been celebrated, not only throughout Great Britain,
                    but all over the world, for its cutlery manufactures. The origin of this
                    celebrity dates as far back as the reign of Edward III., when “Sheffield
                    whittles,” as certain common kinds of knives were then and afterwards called,
                    appear to have been in repute. As early as the middle of the sixteenth century,
                    the staple trade was fostered by the feudal lords of Hallamshire, there being
                    still extant the various “acts and ordinances agreed upon by the whole
                    fellowship of cutlers, and by the assent of George earl of Shrewsbury.” About a
                    century afterwards, when, in consequence of the growing reputation of the
                    various articles manufactured at Sheffield, and the insufficiency of the manor
                    court to restrain the making and vending of spurious wares, the credit of the
                    trade was likely to be endangered, an act of parliament was obtained, by which,
                    under certain regulations, the cutlers of Sheffield were constituted a body
                    corporate. This important act, which bears date April 1624, was designed “for
                    the good order and government of the makers of knives, sickles, shears,
                    scissors, and other cutlery wares in Hallamshire, in the county of York, and
                    parts adjoining ;" the latter words having reference to a part of Derbyshire
                    immediately south of Sheffield, where vast quantities of scythes and sickles
                    have been made ever since the reign of Elizabeth.</p>
                <p part="N">The Cutlers’ Company consisted of a master elected annually, two
                    warders, six searchers, twenty-four assistants, and the commonalty. Their duties
                    were generally to register apprentices, grant corporate marks to be struck on
                    the wares of the members, and by other means to maintain the integrity of the
                    staple trades. This corporation continued in force, with a slight modification,
                    until the year 1814, when, by an act (54th Geo. III.), the local manufac-<pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=214"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0214-0196"/> tures of Sheffield were placed on an entirely
                    new footing; the liberty of engaging in any of the heretofore incorporated
                    trades, either as masters or journeymen, being extended indifferently to all
                    persons, whether freemen or strangers. The act which thus abolished the old
                    corporation influence and jurisdiction still perpetuated its formal continuance,
                    with power to grant marks, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.,</hi> the “master-cutler”
                    being also the returning officer in the election of the two members of
                    parliament for the borough of Sheffield, under the reform act. The corporation
                    have a very handsome hall in Church Street.</p>
                <p part="N">Although the throwing open the old corporate trades to unrestrained
                    competition had a considerable effect in multiplying manufacturers, yet the
                    peculiar nature of the handicrafts generally limited in some degree the changes
                    which, under other circumstances, might have resulted from the sudden rush of
                    capital into a new channel. In the first place, a workmanlike expertness in any
                    branch of cutlery cannot be acquired without a considerable period of probation.
                    In the second place, the application of machinery could only be applied, except
                    in the department of grinding, to a very limited extent; and, with this
                    exception, manual labour can hardly be said to be superseded, but rather
                    assisted, by water or steam power. There are other circumstances which have
                    operated in the same direction, especially the division of labour in the
                    production of a single article, which has given the artisans in one branch a
                    control over the others. This has led the workmen generally to act in concert in
                    all questions touching their respective departments of labour, as wages,
                    apprentices, engagements with masters, &amp;c. To maintain what they have
                    considered their rights, or at least their interests, recourse has been had to
                    various compacts formed under the designation of “Trades’ Unions,” frequently
                    exhibiting all the melancholy results of illegal combinations. Nor has the
                    mischief of these confederations been confined to portentous “strikes,” contests
                    between the masters and the journeymen; but nonjuring or suspected individuals
                    among the latter have sometimes become victims to the vigilance and the
                    vengeance of their banded fellows. What has been the entire effect of this
                    system upon the trade of the town generally, and upon the present condition of
                    the parties, it is not very easy to say. It may have kept up wages, but it has
                    more certainly broken down that good understanding which formerly existed
                    between masters and workmen, and driven numerous customers to foreign markets.
                    The number of persons employed in the cutlery workshops is about 10,000.</p>
                <p part="N">About 700 tons of Swedish iron are annually landed at the canal wharf,
                    which are converted in the town into the steel which is used in the manufacture
                    of knives, scissors, razors, files, saws, axes, and various other cutting
                    instruments. Of this really “precious metal,” however, the greater part is
                    exported to the United States in the form of tilted <hi rend="italic">cast
                        steel;</hi> that is, steel which, after carbonization in the original bars,
                    is broken up and melted in a crucible, afterwards cast into a mould, and then
                    reduced at the forges into rods of such sizes as the trade requires. Besides,
                    three or four thousand tons of British iron are annually brought into the town,
                    and some portion of it converted into steel for inferior purposes. There are
                    several large establishments for the manufacture of the finer kinds of stoves,
                    grates, and fenders. These articles are often executed in the most superb style,
                    modellers and other artists being constantly employed in devising new
                    patterns.</p>
                <p part="N">About a century ago, the art of plating upon copper with silver was
                    discovered in Sheffield; and thus originated a trade of immense importance to
                    the town. For many years past the quantity of wares executed in this beautiful
                    and comparatively cheap material has been very great, including particularly
                    urns, salvers, dishes, epergnes, candelabras, and indeed almost every article
                    which had formerly been made of silver. The silver-plating establishments are
                    among the most respectable in the town; their interests have also been the least
                    fluctuating. These circumstances are due mainly to the fact, that in works of
                    this kind a large capital must be sunk in stamps, dies, and other tools; added
                    to which is the expense of creating new designs, and involving the consideration
                    of taste as well as cost. Sheffield plate, for richness of design, the strength
                    of its more precious material, and for excellence of workmanship, is everywhere
                    in high estimation.</p>
                <p part="N">Manufactures in Britannia metal, which are likewise indigenous to the
                    town, are carried on to a great extent, and to a singular degree of perfection.
                    Nearly every one of the articles made in silver-plate are elegantly imitated in
                    this cheap material; with the addition of vast quantities of spoons, which are
                    first cast in metal moulds, and afterwards polished by brushing.</p>
                <p part="N">Latterly both the foregoing lucrative branches of trade have encountered
                    some competition from the use of what has been terme&lt;l German silver, a kind
                    of brass, which combines the colour, lustre, and durability of silver, at a cost
                    not greatly above that of manufactured copper.</p>
                <p part="N">Here are two or three large establishments for the manufacture of
                    optical instruments, including especially curious works for the grinding of
                    spectacle-glasses, the greater part of the trade throughout the country being
                    supplied from Sheffield. Several of the manufacturers have show-rooms on their
                    premises for the display of their brilliant wares, which are celebrated for the
                    variety and beauty of the cutlery-goods which they contain; and visiters may
                    here witness the various operations carried on in the workshops.</p>
                <p part="N">The town of Sheffield, in every branch of its productive industry, not
                    only carries on a considerable home trade, but its leading wares find a market
                    in every quarter of the globe. It is, however, to the United States of America
                    that the largest and most constant consignments are made; and hence Sheffield
                    participates very largely in every fluctuation which affects Transatlantic
                    mercantile interests.</p>
                <p part="N">The inhabitants of Sheffield are largely provided with places for the
                    promotion of religion, education, philanthropy, and intelligence. There are in
                    the parish twelve churches, seven in the town and five in the rural townships,
                    containing in all 15,160 sittings. Holy Trinity, or the parish church, is a
                    noble Gothic structure, enclosing a parallelogram 240 feet in length by 130 feet
                    in width. From near the centre rises a tower, containing ten very well-tuned
                    bells, and surmounted by a lofty spire of handsome proportions. That part of the
                    church now used for divine service was, in 1800, rebuilt from the foundation,
                    and the interior fitted up in a solid, handsome, and commodious manner, so that
                    the chancel alone presents any traces of antiquity.</p>
                <p part="N">The living is a vicarage, two parties presenting in turn, as
                    representatives of the original grantees of the advowson in 1544. Independently
                    of the vicarial patronage, three assistant ministers are appointed and
                    maintained by the church burgesses.</p>
                <p part="N">In addition to the churches and chapels of the establishment, the
                    Methodists, Independents, Baptists, Quakers, and Roman Catholics, have
                    respectively large, handsome, and commodious places of worship, in the whole not
                    fewer than twenty. Of these, six belong to the Wesleyans, and include some of
                    the largest and most ornamental chapels in the connection.</p>
                <p part="N">Here is an old endowed grammar-school; a collegiate school, recently
                    built by shareholders, at an expense of L.3000; and two charity schools, one for
                    sixty boys, and the other for sixty girls, all conducted in conformity with the
                    principles of the Church of England. The Wesleyan Methodists have just erected,
                    outside the town, and at a cost of about L. 15,000, a splendid proprietary
                    school, ca-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=215"

                    boys. Besides these establishments, all the religious denominations have
                    week-day and Sunday schools in different parts of the town. A literary and
                    philosophical society was instituted in 1822; they have a museum in the
                    music-hall, containing handsome cabinets of fossils, minerals, objects of
                    natural history, apparatus, &amp;c. and a capital full-length portrait of the
                    poet Montgomery, who has long been regarded as one of the chief ornaments of the
                    town.</p>
                <p part="N">There is a large theatre, erected in 1762; and under the same roof a
                    commodious assembly-room; and adjacent, the music-hall, in which concerts and
                    public lectures are usually delivered. A short distance outside the town, on the
                    west, are the botanical gardens, comprising a well-enclosed plot of eighteen
                    acres of ground, laid out in a style of elegance, and commanding an extensive
                    prospect. The glazed conservatories present a frontage of 300 feet. On the
                    opposite slope is a beautiful cemetery.</p>
                <p part="N">The general infirmary, which was opened in 1797 for “the sick and lame
                    poor of any nation,” is a large and handsome edifice, on the north-west side of
                    the town. A subscription of L.5000 has just been raised for the purpose of
                    adding a fever-hospital to this noble institution. Sheffield has also a medical
                    and anatomical school, a public dispensary, and a capital bath establishment. On
                    a fine eminence, just outside the town, stands the Shrewsbury Hospital, a
                    charity founded in 1673, and consisting of neat houses for eighteen men and
                    eighteen women, the former receiving ten and the latter eight shillings a week,
                    besides coals, coats, &amp;c. Holliss’s Hospital, in the town, contains sixteen
                    houses for poor cotters’ widows, who have each seven shillings a week. There are
                    various other smaller charities.</p>
                <p part="N">From the earliest period of authentic history, the Lovetots, Furnivals,
                    Talbots, and Howards, names of stirring interest in English annals, were
                    successively chiefs of Hallamshire, the present Duke of Norfolk being lord of
                    the manor of Sheffield. With the transactions of these illustrious families, the
                    older records of their ample domain and its industrious inhabitants are so
                    intimately mixed up, that it is hardly possible to give any history of the one
                    without involving details concerning the other. One circumstance especially has
                    given a universality of interest to this association, namely, the committal of
                    the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots to the custody of George the sixth earl of
                    Shrewsbury, and the fact that she spent the greater part of fourteen years of
                    her troubled life at Sheffield. The residence of the royal prisoner here was
                    chiefly at the castle, a place of strength, formerly standing at the confluence
                    of the rivers Sheaf and Don, at the northern angle of the town, but which was so
                    utterly demolished after the civil wars, that its situation is at present only
                    indicated by the historian, or by the ineffaceable names of adjacent localities.
                    The Talbots had likewise a summer residence, called the “Manour,” built on a
                    fine eminence in the ancient “Lark,” a mile east of the town: of this residence
                    a shattered and far-conspicuous fragment remains. And here, too, the ill-fated
                    Mary occasionally resided during her captivity; and the spot is often visited by
                    curious or sympathizing individuals on that account. An enthusiastic admirer and
                    apologist of Mary, Samuel Roberts, Esq. has recently erected, at an expense of
                    several thousand pounds, and in a beautiful situation, in Sheffield Lark, a
                    small castlc, of the most exquisite architecture, which he calls “Queen’s
                    Tower.”</p>
                <p part="N">The inhabitants of Sheffield are indebted for an elegant and most
                    elaborate history of the ancient and modern state of their town and
                    neighbourhood, to the Reverend Joseph Hunter, a native of the place, who, in
                    1819, published his “Hallamshire," in one volume folio.</p>

                    Buckinghamshire, an eminent writer of the seventeenth and eighteenth century, of
                    great personal bravery, and an able minister of state, was born about 1650. He
                    lost his father at nine years of age; and his mother having married Lord
                    Ossulston, the care of his education was left entirely to a governor, who did
                    not greatly improve him in his studies. Finding that he was deficient in many
                    parts of literature, he resolved to devote a certain number of hours every day
                    to his studies; and thereby improved himself to the degree of learning which he
                    afterwards attained. Though possessed of a good estate, he did not abandon
                    himself to pleasure and indolence, but entered as a volunteer in the second
                    Dutch war, and was in that famous naval engagement where the Duke of York
                    commanded as admiral; upon which occasion his lordship behaved so gallantly,
                    that he was appointed commander of the Royal Catharine. He afterwards made a
                    campaign in the French service under M. de Turenne. As Tangier was in danger of
                    being taken by the Moors, he offered to head the forces which were sent to
                    defend it, and accordingly was appointed to command them. He was then Earl of
                    Mulgrave, and one of the lords of the bed-chamber to Charles II. The Moors
                    retired on the approach of his majesty’s forces; and the result of the
                    expedition was the blowing up of Tangier. He continued in several great posts
                    during the short reign of James II. till that unfortunate prince was dethroned.
                    Lord Mulgrave, though he paid his respects to King William before he was
                    advanced to the throne, yet did not accept of any post in the government until
                    some years afterwards. In the sixth year of William and Mary he was created
                    Marquis of Normanby in the county of Lincoln. He was one of the most active and
                    zealous opponents of the bill which took away Sir John Fenwick’s life; and
                    exerted the utmost vigour in carrying through the Treason Bill, and the bill for
                    Triennial Parliaments. He enjoyed some considerable posts under King William,
                    and possessed much of his favour and confidence. In 1702 he was sworn lord
                    privy-seal; and in the same year was appointed one of the commissioners to treat
                    of an union between England and Scotland. In 1703 he was created Duke of
                    Normanby, and soon after Duke of Buckinghamshire. In 1711 he was made steward of
                    her majesty’s household, and president of the council. During Queen Anne’s reign
                    he was but once out of employment; and then he voluntarily resigned, being
                    attached to what were called the Tory Principles. Her majesty offered to make
                    him lord chancellor, but he declined the office. He was instrumental in the
                    change of the ministry in 1710. A circumstance that reflects the highest honour
                    on him, is the vigour with which he acted in favour of the unhappy Catalans, who
                    were afterwards so inhumanly sacrificed. He was survived by only one legitimate
                    son, who died at Rome in 1735; but he left several natural children. He died in
                    1721. He was admired by the poets of his age; by Dryden, Prior, and Garth. His
                    Essay on Poetry was applauded by Addison, and his Rehearsal is still read with
                    pleasure. His writings were splendidly printed in 1723, in two volumes 4to, and
                    have since been reprinted in 1729, in two volumes 8vo. The first contains his
                    poems on various subjects; the second, his prose works, consisting of historical
                    memoirs, speeches in parliament, characters, dialogues, critical observations,
                    essays, and letters. It may be proper to observe, that the edition of 1729 is
                    castrated; some particulars relating to the revolution having given offence.</p>
