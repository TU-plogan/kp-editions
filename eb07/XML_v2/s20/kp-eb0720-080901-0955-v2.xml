                        Day,</hi> a solemn festival observed by Christians on the first day of every
                    week, in memory of our Saviour’s resurrection. In the Breviary and other
                    offices, we meet with Sundays of the first and second class. Those of the first
                    class are, Palm, Easter, Advent, and Whitsunday, those of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Quasimodo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Quadragesima.</hi> Those of the second
                    class are the common Sundays. Anciently each Sunday in the year had its
                    particular name, which was taken from the introit of the day; which custom has
                    only been continued to some few in lent; as <hi rend="italic">Reminiscere,
                        Oculi, Laetare, Judica.</hi> Some are of opinion that the Lord's Day
                    mentioned in the Apocalypse is our Sunday, which they believe was so early
                    instituted by the apostles. Be this as it may, it is certain a regard was paid
                    to this day even in the earliest ages of the church, as appears from the first
                    Apology of Justin Martyr, where he describes the exercise of the day as not much
                    unlike to ours. But it was Constantine the Great who first made a law for the
                    proper observance of Sunday; and who, according to Eusebius, appointed it should
                    be regularly celebrated throughout the Roman empire. Before him, and even in his
                    time, they observed the Jewish Sabbath as well as Sunday; both to satisfy the
                    law of Moses, and to imitate the apostles, who used to meet together on the
                    first day. By Constantine’s law, promulgated in 321, it was decreed, that for
                    the future the Sunday should be kept as a day of rest in all cities and towns;
                    but he allowed the country people to follow their work. In 538, the council of
                    Orleans prohibited country labour; but because there were still many Jews in
                    Gaul, and the people fell into many superstitious uses in the celebration of the
                    new Sabbath, like those of the Jews in that of the old, the council declares,
                    that to hold it unlawful to travel with horses, cattle, and carriages, to
                    prepare food, or to do any thing necessary to the cleanliness and decency of
                    houses or persons, savours more of Judaism than of Christianity.</p>
