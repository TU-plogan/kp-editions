                <p part="N"><label type="entry">SEDUCTION</label> is the act of tempting and drawing
                    aside from the right path, and comprehends every endeavour to corrupt any
                    individual of the human race. This is the import of the word in its largest and
                    most general sense; but it is commonly employed to express the act of tempting a
                    virtuous woman to part with her chastity.</p>
                <p part="N">The seducer of female innocence practises the same stratagems of fraud
                    to get possession of a woman’s person, that the swindler employs to get
                    possession of his neighbour’s goods or money; yet the law of honour, which
                    pretends to abhor deceit and which impels its votaries to murder every man who
                    presumes, however justly, to suspect them of fraud, or to question their
                    veracity, applauds the address of a successful intrigue, though it be well known
                    that the seducer could not have obtained his end without swearing to the truth
                    of a thousand falsehoods, and calling upon God to witness promises which he
                    never meant to fulfil.</p>
                <p part="N">The law of honour is indeed a very capricious rule, which accommodates
                    itself to the pleasures and conveniences of higher life; but the law of the
                    land, which is enacted for the equal protection of high and low, may be supposed
                    to view the guilt of seduction with a more impartial eye. Yet for this offence,
                    even the laws of this kingdom have provided no other punishment than a pecuniary
                    satisfaction to they injured family; which, in England, can be obtained only by
                    one of the quaintest fictions in the world, by the father’s bringing his action
                    against the seducer for the loss of his daughter’s service during her pregnancy
                    and nurturing. (See Paley's Moral Philosophy, book iii. part iii. chap. 3.)</p>
                <p part="N">The moralist, however, who estimates the merit or demerit of actions,
                    not by laws of human appointment but by their general consequences as
                    established by the laws of nature, must consider the seducer as a criminal of
                    the deepest guilt. In every civilized country, and in many countries where
                    civilization has made but small progress, the virtue of women is collected as it
                    were into a single point which they are to guard above all things, as that on
                    which their happiness and reputation wholly depend. At first sight this may
                    appear a capricious regulation; but a moment’s reflection will convince us of
                    the contrary. In the married state so much confidence is necessarily reposed in
                    the fidelity of women to the beds of their husbands, and<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=89" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0089-0075"
                    /> evils so great result from the violation of that fidelity, that whatever
                    contributes in any degree to its preservation, must be agreeable to Him who, in
                    establishing the laws of nature, intended them to be subservient to the real
                    happiness of all his creatures. But nothing contributes so much to preserve the
                    fidelity of wives to their husbands, as the impressing upon the minds of women
                    the highest veneration for the virtue of chastity. She who, when unmarried, has
                    been accustomed to grant favours to different men, will not find it easy, if
                    indeed possible, to resist afterwards the allurements of variety. It is
                    therefore a wise institution, and agreeable to the will of Him who made us, to
                    train up women so that they may look upon the loss of their chastity as the most
                    disgraceful of all crimes; as that which sinks them in the order of society, and
                    robs them of all their value. In this light virtuous women actually look upon
                    the loss of chastity. The importance of that virtue has been so deeply impressed
                    upon their minds, and is so closely associated with the principle of honour,
                    that they cannot think but with abhorrence upon the very deed by which it is
                    lost. He therefore who by fraud and falsehood persuades the unsuspecting girl to
                    deviate in one instance from the honour of the sex, weakens in a great degree
                    her moral principle; and if he reconcile her to a repetition of the crime, he
                    destroys that principle entirely, as she has been taught to consider all other
                    virtues as inferior to that of chastity. Hence it is that the hearts of
                    prostitutes are generally steeled against the miseries of their
                    fellow-creatures; that they lend their aid to the seducer in his practices upon
                    other girls; that they lie, and swear, and steal without compunction; and that
                    too many of them hesitate not to commit murder, if it can serve any selfish
                    purpose of their own.</p>
                <p part="N">The loss of virtue, though the greatest that man or woman can sustain,
                    is not the only injury which the seducer bringe upon the girl whom he deceives.
                    She cannot at once reconcile herself to prostitution, or even to the loss of
                    character, and whilst a sense of shame remains in her mind, the misery which she
                    suffers must be exquisite. She knows that she has forfeited what in the female
                    character is most valued by both sexes; and she must be under the perpetual
                    dread of a discovery. She cannot even confide in the honour of her seducer, who
                    may reveal her secret in a fit of drunkenness, and thus rob her of her fame as
                    well as of her virtue; and whilst she is in this state of anxious uncertainty,
                    the agony of her mind must be insupportable. That it is so in fact, the many
                    instances of child-murder by unmarried women of every rank leave us no room to
                    doubt. The affection of a mother to her new-born child is one of the strongest
                    and most unequivocal instincts in human nature; and nothing short of the
                    extremity of distress can prompt any one so far to oppose nature as to embrue
                    her hands in the blood of her imploring infant.</p>
                <p part="N">Even this deed of horror seldom prevents a detection of the mother’s
                    frailty, which is indeed commonly discovered, though no child has been the
                    consequence of her intrigue. He who can seduce is base enough to betray; and
                    assuredly no woman can part with her honour and yet retain any well-grounded
                    hope that her amour shall be kept secret. The villain to whom she surrendered
                    will glory in his victory, if it was with difficulty obtained; and if she
                    surrendered at discretion, her own behaviour will reveal her secret. Her
                    reputation is then irretrievably lost, and no future circumspection will be of
                    the smallest avail to recover it. She will be shunned by the virtuous part of
                    her own sex, and treated as a mere instrument of pleasure by the other. In such
                    circumstances she cannot expect to he married with advantage. She may perhaps be
                    able to captivate the heart of a heedless youth, and prevail upon him to unite
                    his fate to hers, before the delirium of his passion shall give him time for
                    reflection; she may be addressed by a man who is a stranger to her story, and
                    married while he has no suspicion of her secret; or she may be solicited by one
                    of a station inferior to her own, who, though acquainted with every thing that
                    has befallen her, can barter the delicacy of wedded love for some pecuniary
                    advantage. But from none of these marriages can she look for happiness. The
                    delirium which prompted the first will soon vanish, and leave the husband to the
                    bitterness of his own reflections, which can hardly fail to produce cruelty to
                    the wife. Of the secret to which, in the second case, the lover was a stranger,
                    the husband will soon make a discovery, or at least find room for harbouring
                    strong suspicions; and suspicions of having been deceived in a point so delicate
                    have hitherto been uniformly the parents of misery. In the third case, the man
                    married her merely for her money, of which having got the possession, he has no
                    further inducement to treat her with respect. Such are some of the consequences
                    of seduction, even when the person seduced has the good fortune afterwards to
                    get a husband. But this is a fortune which few in her circumstances can
                    reasonably expect. By far the greater part of those who have been defrauded of
                    their virtue by the arts of the seducer sink deeper and deeper into guilt, till
                    they become at last common prostitutes. The public is then deprived of their
                    services as wives and parents; and instead of contributing to the population of
                    the state, and to the sum of domestic felicity, these outcasts of society become
                    seducers in their turn, corrupting the morals of every young man whose appetites
                    they can inflame, and of every young woman whom they can entice to their own
                    practices.</p>
                <p part="N">All this complication of evil is produced at first by arts which, if
                    employed to deprive a man of his property, would subject the offender to the
                    execration of his fellow-subjects, and to an ignominious death. But while the
                    forger of a bill is pursued with relentless rigour by the ministers of justice,
                    and the swindler loaded with universal reproach, the man who by fraud and
                    forgery has enticed an innocent girl to gratify his desires at the expense of
                    her virtue, and thus introduced her into a path which must infallibly lead to
                    her own ruin, as well as to repeated injuries to the public at large, is not
                    despised by his own sex, and is too often caressed even by the virtuous part of
                    the other. Yet the loss of property may be easily repaired; whilst the loss of
                    honour is irreparable. It is vain to plead in alleviation of this guilt, that
                    women should be on their guard against the arts of the seducer. Most
                    unquestionably they should; but arts have been used which hardly any degree of
                    caution would have been sufficient to counteract. It may as well be said that
                    the trader should be on his guard against the arts of the forger, and accept of
                    no bill without previously consulting him in whose name it is written. Cases,
                    indeed, occur in trade, in which this caution would be impossible. But he must
                    be little acquainted with the workings of the human heart, who does not know
                    that situations likewise occur in life, in which it is equally impossible for a
                    girl of tenderness and virtue to resist the arts of the man who has completely
                    gained her affections.</p>
