                            arise from the intercalation of the middle <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                            (that is, the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> immediately before the final
                            syllable <hi rend="italic">spear),</hi> can never be overlooked by those
                            who remember, at the opening of the Duncriad, the note upon this very
                            question about the orthography of Shakspeare’s name, as also upon the
                            other great question about the title of the immortal Satire, Whether it
                            ought not to have been the Dunceiade, seeing that Dunce, its great
                            author and progenitor, cannot possibly dispense with the letter <hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>. Meantime we must remark, that the first three
                            of Mr Campbell’s variations are mere caprices of the press; as is
                            Shagspere; or, more probably, this last euphonious variety arose out of
                            the gross clownish pronunciation of the two hiccuping “<hi rend="italic"
                                >marksmen"</hi> who rode over to "Worcester for the license; and one
                            cannot forbear laughing at the bishop's secretary for having been so
                            misled by two varlets, professedly incapable of signing their own names.
                            The same drunken villains had cut down the bride's name <hi
                                rend="italic">Hathaway</hi> into <hi rend="italic">Hathwey.</hi>
                            Finally, to treat the matter with seriousness. Sir Frederick Madden has
                            shown, in his recent letter to the Society of Antiquaries, that the poet
                            himself in all probability wrote the name uniformly <hi rend="italic"
                                >Shakspere.</hi> Orthography, both of proper names, of appellatives,
                            and of words universally, was very unsettled up to a period long
                            subsequent to that of Shakspeare. Still it must usually have happened
                            that names written variously and laxly by others, woud be written
                            uniformly by the owners; especially by those owners who had occasion to
                            sign their names frequently, and by literary people, whose attention was
                            often, as well as consciously, directed to the proprieties of spelling.
                                <hi rend="italic">Shakspeare</hi> is now too familiar to the eye for
                            any alteration to be attempted; but it is pretty certain that Sir
                            Frederick Madden is right in stating the poet s own signature to have
                            been uniformly <hi rend="italic">Shakspere.</hi> It is so written twice
                            in the course of his will, and it is so written on a blank leaf of
                            Florio's English translation of Montaigne’s Essays; a book recently
                            discovered, and sold, on account of its autograph, for a hundred
                            guineas.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">William Shakespeare</hi>, the
                    protagonist on the great arena of modern poetry, and the glory of the human
                    intellect, was born at Stratford-upon-Avon, in the county of Warwick, in the
                    year 1564, and upon some day, not precisely ascertained, in the month of April.
                    It is certain that he was baptized on the 25th; and from that fact, combined
                    with some shadow of a tradition, Malone has inferred that he was born on the
                    23d. There is doubtless, on the one hand, no absolute necessity deducible from
                    law or custom, as either operated in those times, which obliges us to adopt such
                    a conclusion; for children might be baptized, and were baptized at various
                    distances from their birth: yet, on the other hand, the 23d is as likely to have
                    been the day as any other; and more likely than any earlier day, upon two
                    arguments. First, because there was probably a tradition floating in the
                    seventeenth century, that Shakspeare died upon his birth-day: now it is beyond a
                    doubt that he died upon the 23d of April. Secondly, because it is a reasonable
                    presumption, that no parents, living in a simple community, tenderly alive to
                    the pieties of household duty, and in an age still clinging reverentially to the
                    ceremonial ordinances of religion, would much delay the adoption of their child
                    into the great family of Christ. Considering the extreme frailty of an infant’s
                    life during its two earliest years, to delay would often be to disinherit the
                    child of its Christian privileges; privileges not the less eloquent to the
                    feelings from being profoundly mysterious, and, in the English church, forced
                    not only upon the attention, but even upon the eye, of the most thoughtless.
                    According to the discipline of the English church, the unbaptized are buried
                    with “maimed rites,” shorn of their obsequies, and sternly denied that “sweet
                    and solcmn farewell” by which otherwise the church expresses her final charity
                    with all men; and not only so, but they are even <hi rend="italic">locally</hi>
                    separated and sequestrated. Ground the most hallowed, and populous with
                    Christian burials of households,</p>
                <p part="N">That died in peace with one another,</p>
                <p part="N">Father, sister, son, and brother.</p>
                <p part="N">opens to receive the vilest malefactor; by which the church symbolically
                    expresses her maternal willingness to gather back into her fold those even of
                    her flock who have strayed from her by the most memorable aberrations; and yet,
                    with all this indulgence she banishes to unhallowed ground the innocent bodies
                    of the unbaptized. To them and to suicides she turns a face of wrath. With this
                    gloomy fact offered to the very external senses, it is difficult to suppose
                    that, any parents would risk their own reproaches by putting the fulfilment of
                    so grave a duty on the hazard of a convulsion fit. The case of royal children is
                    different; their baptisms, it is true, were often delayed for weeks; but the
                    household chaplains of the palace were always at hand, night and day, to baptize
                    them in the very agonies of death.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">’ But, as a proof that, even in the case of
                            royal christenings, it was not thought pious to “tempt God," as it were,
                            by delav, Edward V I. the only son of Henry VIII. was bom on the 12th
                            day of October in the year 1537. And there was a delay on account of the
                            sponsors since the birth was not in London. Yet how little that delay
                            was made, may be seen by this fact: The birth took place in the dead of
                            the night, the day was Friday; and yet, in spite of all delay, the
                            christening was most pompously celebrated on the succeeding Monday. And
                            Prince Arthur, the elder brother of Henry VIII. was christened on the
                            very next Sunday succeeding to his birth, notwithstanding an inevitable
                            delay, occasioned by the distance of Lord Oxford, his godfather, and the
                            excessive rains, which prevented the earl being reached by couriers, or
                            himself reaching Winchester, without extraordinary exertions.</p></note>
                    We must presume, therefore, that William Shakspeare was born on some day very
                    little anterior to that of his baptism; and the more so because the season of
                    the year was lovely and genial, the 23d of April in 1564 corresponding in fact
                    with what we now call the 3d of May, so that, whether the child was to be
                    carried abroad, or the clergyman to be summoned, no hindrance would arise from
                    the weather. One only argument has sometimes struck us for supposing that the
                    22d might be the day, and not the 23d; which is, that Shakspeare’s sole
                    grand-daughter, Lady Barnard, was married on the 22d of April 1626, ten years
                    exactly from the poet’s death; and the reason for choosing this day <hi
                        rend="italic">might</hi> have had a reference to her illustrious
                    grandfather’s birthday; which, there is good reason for thinking, would be
                    celebrated as a festival in the family for generations. Still this choice <hi
                        rend="italic">may</hi> have been an accident, or governed merely by reason
                    of convenience. And, on the whole, it is as well perhaps to acquiesce in the old
                    belief, that Shakspeare was born and died on the 23d of April. We cannot do
                    wrong if we drink to his memory on both 22d and 23d.</p>
                <p part="N">On a first review of the circumstances, we have reason to feel no little
                    perplexity in finding the materials for a life of this transcendent writer so
                    meagre and so few; and amongst them the larger part of doubtful authority. All
                    the energy of curiosity directed upon this subject, through a period of one
                    hundred and fifty years (for so long it is since Betterton the actor began to
                    make researches) has availed us little or nothing. Neither the local traditions
                    of his provincial birth-place, though sharing with London through half<pb

                    presence, nor the recollections of that brilliant literary circle with whom he
                    lived in the metropolis, have yielded much more than such an outline of his
                    history as is oftentimes to be gathered from the penurious records of a
                    grave-stone. That he lived, and that he died, and that he was “a little lower
                    than the angels —these make up pretty nearly the amount of our undisputed
                    report. It may be doubted indeed whether at this day we are as accurately
                    acquainted with the life of Shakspeare as with that of Chaucer, though divided
                    from each other by an interval of two centuries, and (what should have been more
                    effectual towards oblivion) by the wars of the two roses. And yet the
                    traditional memory of a rural and a sylvan region, such as Warwickshire at that
                    time was, is usually exact as well as tenacious; and, with respect to Shakspeare
                    in particular, we may presume it to have been full and circumstantial through
                    the generation succeeding to his own, not only from the curiosity, and perhaps
                    something of a scandalous interest, which would pursue the motions of one living
                    so large a part of his life at a distance from his wife, but also from the final
                    reverence and honour which would settle upon the memory of a poet so
                    pre-eminently successful; of one who, in a space of five-and-twenty years, after
                    running a bright career in the capital city of his native land, and challenging
                    notice from the throne, had retired with an ample fortune, created by his
                    personal efforts, and by labours purely intellectual.</p>
                <p part="N">How are we to account, then, for that deluge, as if from Lethe, which
                    has swept away so entirely the traditional memorials of one so illustrious? Such
                    is the fatality of error which overclouds every question connected with
                    Shakspeare, that two of his principal critics, Steevens and Malone, have
                    endeavoured to solve the difficulty by cutting it with a falsehood. They deny in
                    effect that he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> illustrious in the century succeeding
                    to his own, however much he has since become so. We shall first produce their
                    statements in their own words, and we shall then briefly review them.</p>
                <p part="N">Steevens delivers <hi rend="italic">his</hi> opinion in the following
                    terms :— “How little Shakspeare was once read, may be understood from Tate, who,
                    in his dedication to the altered play of King Lear, speaks of the original as an
                    obscure piece, recommended to his notice by a friend; and the author of the
                    Tatler, having occasion to quote a few lines out of Macbeth, was content to
                    receive them from Davenant’s alteration of that celebrated drama, in which
                    almost every original beauty is either awkwardly disguised or arbitrarily
                    omitted.” Another critic, who cites this passage from Steevens, pursues the
                    hypothesis as follows :—“In fifty years after his death, Dryden mentions that he
                    was then become <hi rend="italic">a little obsolete.</hi> In the beginning of
                    the last century, Lord Shaftesbury complains of his <hi rend="italic">rude
                        unpolished style, and his antiquated phrase and wit.</hi> It is certain
                    that, for nearly a hundred years after his death, partly owing to the immediate
                    revolution and rebellion, and partly to the licentious taste encouraged in
                    Charles IL’s time, and perhaps partly to the incorrect state of his works, he
                    was <hi rend="smallcaps">almost</hi> ENTIRELY <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Neglected.”</hi> This critic then goes on to quote with approbation the
                    opinion of Malone,—“that if he had been read, admired, studied, and imitated, in
                    the same degree as he is now, the enthusiasm of some one or other of his
                    admirers in the last age would have induced him to make some inquiries
                    concerning the history of his theatrical career, and the anecdotes of his
                    private life.” After which this enlightened writer re-affirms and clenches the
                    judgment he has quoted by saying,—“His admirers, however, <hi rend="italic">if
                        he had admirers in that age,</hi> possessed no portion of such
                    enthusiasm.”</p>
                <p part="N">It may perhaps be an instructive lesson to young readers, if we now show
                    them, by a short sifting of these confident dogmatists, how easy it is for a
                    careless or a half-read man to circulate the most absolute falsehoods under the
                    semblance of truth; falsehoods which impose upon himself as much as they do upon
                    others. We believe that not one word or illustration is uttered in the sentences
                    cited from these three critics, which is not <hi rend="italic">virtually</hi> in
                    the very teeth of the truth.</p>
                <p part="N">To begin with Mr Nahum Tate:—This poor grub of lite-ratme, if he did
                    really speak of Lear as “an <hi rend="italic">obscure</hi> piece, recommended to
                    his notice by a friend,” of which we must be allowed to doubt, was then uttering
                    a conscious falsehood. It happens that Lear was one of the few Shakspearian
                    dramas which had kept the stage unaltered. But it is easy to see a mercenary
                    motive in such an artifice as this. Mr Nahum Tate is not of a class of whom it
                    can be safe to say that they are “well known they and their desperate tricks are
                    essentially obscure, and good reason he has to exult in the felicity of such
                    obscurity; for else this same vilest of travesties, Mr Nahum’s Lear, would
                    consecrate his name to everlasting scorn. For himself, he belonged to the age of
                    Dryden rather than of Pope: he “flourished,” if we can use such a phrase of one
                    who was always withering, about the era of the Revolution; and his Lear, we
                    believe, was arranged in the year 1682. But the family to which he belongs is
                    abundantly recorded in the Dunciad; and his own name will be found amongst its
                    catalogues of heroes.</p>
                <p part="N">With respect to <hi rend="italic">the author of the Tntler,</hi> a very
                    different explanation is requisite. Steevens means the render to understand
                    Addison; but it does not follow that the particular paper in question was from
                    his pen. Nothing, however, could be more natural than to quote from the common
                    form of the play as then in possession of the stage. It was <hi rend="italic"
                        >there,</hi> beyond a doubt, that a fine gentleman living upon town, and not
                    professing any deep scholastic knowledge of literature (a light in which we are
                    always to regard the writers of the Spectator, Guardian, &amp;c.), would be
                    likely to have learned anything he quoted from Macbeth. This we say generally of
                    the wτiters in those periodical papers; but, with reference to Addison in
                    particular, it is time to correct the popular notion of his literary character,
                    or at least to mark it by severer lines of distinction. It is already pretty
                    well known, that Addison had no very intimate acquaintance with the literature
                    of his own country. It is known also, that he did not think such an acquaintance
                    any ways essential to the character of an elegant scholar and <hi rend="italic"
                        >litterateur.</hi> Quite enough he found it, and more than enough for the
                    time he had to spare, if he could maintain a tolerable familiarity with the
                    foremost Latin poets, and a very slender one indeed with the Grecian. <hi
                        rend="italic">How</hi> slender, we can see in his “Travels.” Of modern
                    authors, none as yet had been published with notes, commentaries, or critical
                    collations of the text; and, accordingly, Addison looked upon all of them,
                    except those few who professed themselves followers in the retinue and equipage
                    of the ancients, as creatures of a lower race. Boileau, as a mere imitator and
                    propagator of Horace, he read, and probably little else, amongst the French
                    classics. Hence it arose that he took upon himself to speak sneeringly of Tasso.
                    To this, which was a bold act for his timid mind, he was emboldened by the
                    countenance of Boileau. Of the elder Italian authors, such as Ariosto, and, <hi
                        rend="italic">a fortiori,</hi> Dante, he knew absolutely nothing. Passing to
                    our own literature, it is certain that Addison was profoundly ignorant of
                    Chaucer and of Spenser. Milton only,—and why? simply because he was a brilliant
                    scholar, and stands like a bridge between the Christian literature and the
                    Pagan,—Addison had read and esteemed. There was also in the very constitution of
                    Milton’s mind, in the majestic regularity and planetary solemnity of its <hi
                        rend="italic">epic</hi> movements, something which he could understand and
                    appreciate: as to the meteoric and incalculable eccentricities of the <hi

                    1590-1630, they confounded and overwhelmed him.</p>
                <p part="N">In particular, with regard to Shakspeare, we shall now proclaim a
                    discovery which we made some twenty years ago. We, like others, from seeing
                    frequent references to Shakspeare in the Spectator, had acquiesced in the common
                    belief, that, although Addison was no doubt profoundly unlearned in Shakspeare’«
                    language, and thoroughly unable to do him justice (and this we might well
                    assume, since his great rival Pope, who had expressly studied Shakspeare, was,
                    after all, so memorably deficient in the appropriate knowledge),—yet, that of
                    course he had a vague popular knowledge of the mighty poet’s cardinal dramas.
                    Accident only led us into a discovery of our mistake. Twice or thrice we had
                    observed, that if Shakspeare were quoted, that paper turned out not to be
                    Addison’s; and at length, by express examination, we ascertained the curious
                    fact, that Addison has never in one instance quoted or made any reference to
                    Shakspeare. But was this, as Steevens most disingenuously pretends, to be taken
                    as an exponent of the public feeling towards Shakspeare? Was Addison’s neglect
                    representative of a general neglect? If so, whence came Rowe’s edition. Pope’s,
                    Theobald’s, Sir Thomas Hanmer’s, Bishop Warburton’s, all upon the heels of one
                    another? With such facts staring him in the face, how shameless must be that
                    critic who could, in support of such a thesis, refer to <hi rend="italic">“the
                        author of the Tatler,”</hi> contemporary with all these editors. The truth
                    is, Addison was well aware of Shakspeare’s hold on the popular mind; too well
                    aware of it. The feeble constitution of the poetic faculty, as existing in
                    himself, forbade his sympathising with Shakspeare; the proportions were too
                    colossal for his delicate vision; and yet, as one who sought popularity himself,
                    he durst not shock what perhaps he viewed as a national prejudice. Those who
                    have happened, like ourselves, to see the effect of passionate music and
                    “deep-inwoven harmonics” upon the feeling of an idiot,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">A great modem poet refers to
                            this very ease of music entering “the mouldy chambers of the dull
                            idiot’s brain but in support of what seems to us a baseless
                            hypothesis.</p></note> may conceive what we mean. Such music does not
                    utterly revolt the idiot; on the contrary, it has a strange but a horrid
                    fascination for him: it alarms, irritates, disturbs, makes him profoundly
                    unhappy; and chiefly by unlocking imperfect glimpses of thoughts and slumbering
                    instincts, which it is for his peace to have entirely obscured, because for him
                    they can be revealed only partially, and with the sad effect of throwing a
                    baleful gleam upon his blighted condition. Do we mean, then, to compare Addison
                    with an idiot? Not generally, by any means. Nobody can more sincerely admire him
                    where he was a man of real genius, viz. in his delineations of character and
                    manners, or in the exquisite delicacies of his humour. But assuredly Addison, as
                    a poet, was amongst the sons of the feeble; and between the authors of Cato and
                    of King Lear there was a gulf never to be bridged over.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">• Probably Addison’s fear of the
                            national feeling was a good deal strengthened by his awe of Milton and
                            of Dryden, both of whom had expressed a homage towards Shakspeare which
                            language cannot transcend. Amongst his political friends also were many
                            intense admirers of Shakspeare.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">But Dryden, we are told, pronounced Shakspeare already in <hi
                        rend="italic">his</hi> day “<hi rend="italic">a little obsolete.”</hi> Here
                    now we have wilful, deliberate falsehood. <hi rend="italic">Obsolete,</hi> in
                    Dryden’s meaning, docs not imply that he was so with regard to his popularity
                    (the question then at issue), but with regard to his diction and choice of
                    words. To cite Dryden as a witness for any purpose against Shakspeare,—Dryden,
                    who of all men had the most ransacked wit and exhausted language in celebrating
                    the supremacy of Shakspeare’s genius, does indeed require as much shamelessness
                    in feeling as mendacity in principle.</p>
                <p part="N">But then Lord Shaftesbury, who may be taken as half way between Dryden
                    and Pope (Dryden died in 1700, Pope was then twelve years old, and Lord S. wrote
                    chiefly, we believe, between 1700 and 1710), “complains,” it seems, “of his rude
                    unpolished style, and his antiquated phrase and wit.” What if he does? Let the
                    whole truth be told, and then we shall see how much stress is to be laid upon
                    such a judgment. The second Lord Shaftesbury, the author of the Characteristics
                    was the grandson of that famous political agitator, the Chancellor Shaftesbury,
                    who passed his whole life in storms of his own creation. The second Lord
                    Shaftesbury was a man of crazy constitution, querulous from ill health, and had
                    received an eccentric education from his eccentric grandfather. He was practised
                    daily in <hi rend="italic">talking</hi> Latin, to which afterwards he added a
                    competent study of the Greek; and finally he became unusually learned for his
                    rank, but the most absolute and undistinguishing pedant that perhaps literature
                    has to show. He sneers continually at the regular built academic pedant; but he
                    himself, though no academic, was essentially the very impersonation of pedantry.
                    No thought however beautiful, no image however magnificent, could conciliate his
                    praise as long as it was clothed in English; but present him with the most
                    trivial common-places in Greek, and he unaffectedly fancied them divine;
                    mistaking the pleasurable sense of his own power in a difficult and rare
                    accomplishment for some peculiar force or beauty in the passage. Such was the
                    outline of his literary taste. And was it upon Shakspeare only, or upon him
                    chiefly, that he lavished his pedantry? Far from it. He attacked Milton with no
                    less fervour; he attacked Dryden with a thousand times more. Jeremy Taylor he
                    quoted only to ridicule; and even Locke, the confidential friend of his
                    grandfather, he never alludes to without a sneer. As to Shakspeare, so far from
                    Lord Shaftesbury’s censures arguing his deficient reputation, the very fact of
                    his noticing him at all proves his enormous popularity; for upon system he
                    noticed those only who ruled the public taste. The insipidity of his objections
                    to Shakspeare may be judged from this, that he comments in a spirit of absolute
                    puerility upon the name <hi rend="italic">Desdemona,</hi> as though
                    intentionally formed from the Greek word for <hi rend="italic"
                        >superstition.</hi> In fact, he had evidently read little beyond the list of
                    names in Shakspeare; yet there is proof enough that the irresistible beauty of
                    what little he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> read was too much for all his
                    pedantry, and startled him exceedingly; for ever afterwards he speaks of
                    Shakspeare as one who, with a little aid from Grecian sources, really had
                    something great and promising about him. As to modem authors, neither this Lord
                    Shaftesbury nor Addison read anything for the latter years of their life but
                    Bayle’s Dictionary. And most of the little scintillations of erudition which may
                    be found in the notes to the Characteristics, and in the Essays of Addison, are
                    derived, almost without exception, and uniformly without acknowledgment, from
                        Bayle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">’ He
                            who is weak enough to kick and spurn his own native literature, even if
                            it were done with more knowledge than is shown by Lord Shaftesbury, will
                            usually be kicked and spurned in his turn; and accordingly it has been
                            often remarked, that the Characteristics are unjustly neglected in our
                            days. For Lord Shaftesbury, with all his pedantry, was a man of great
                            talents. Leibnitz had the sagacityto see this through the mists of a

                    hundred years after his death Shakspeare was almost entirely neglected,” we
                    shall meet this scandalous falsehood by a rapid view of his fortunes during the
                    century in question. The tradition has always been, that Shakspeare was honoured
                    by the especial notice of Queen Elizabeth, as well as by that of James I. At one
                    time we were disposed to question the truth of this tradition; but that was for
                    want of<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=190"

                    Jonson to the memory of Shakspeare, those generous lines which have so absurdly
                    been taxed with faint praise. Jonson could make no mistake on this point: he, as
                    one of Shakspeare’s familiar companions, must have witnessed at the very time,
                    and accompanied with friendly sympathy, every motion of royal favour towards
                    Shakspeare. Now he, in words which leave no room for doubt, exclaims</p>

                    with some of Shakspeare’s dramas. In Elizabeth the approbation would probably be
                    sincere. In James we can readily suppose it to have been assumed; for he was a
                    pedant in a different sense from Lord Shaftesbury; not from undervaluing modern
                    poetry, but from caring little or nothing for any poetry, although he wrote
                    about its mechanic rules. Still the royal <hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi>
                    would be influential and serviceable no less when offered hypocritically than in
                    full sincerity. Next let us consider, at the very moment of Shakspeare’s death,
                    who were the leaders of the British youth, the <hi rend="italic">principes

                    powers, as we may call them, these presiding stars over all that was English in
                    thought and action, were both impassioned admirers of Shakspeare. Each of them
                    counts for many thousands. The Prince of Wales<note anchored="true"

                            prince of those times, he was truly and eminently accomplished. His
                            knowledge of the arts was considerable; and, as a patron of art, he
                            stands foremost amongst all British sovereigns to this hour. He said
                            truly of himself, and wisely as to the principle, that he understood
                            English law as well as a gentleman ought to understand it; meaning that
                            an attorney's minute knowledge of forms and technical niceties was

                            a strength of memory, which are truly admirable; whilst the whole of his
                            accomplishments are recommended by a modesty and a humility as rare as

                    not originally from reading him, but from witnessing the court representations
                    of his plays at Whitehall. Afterwards we know that he made Shakspeare his closet
                    companion, for he was reproached with doing so by Milton. And we know also, from
                    the just criticism pronounced upon the character and diction of Caliban by one
                    of Charles’s confidential counsellors, Lord Falkland, that the king’s admiration
                    of Shakspeare had impressed a determination upon the court reading. As to
                    Milton, by double prejudices, puritanical and classical, his mind had been
                    preoccupied against the full impressions of Shakspeare. And we know that there
                    is such a thing as keeping the sympathies of love and admiration in a dormant
                    state, or state of abeyance; an effort of self-conquest realized in more cases
                    than one by the ancient fathers, both Greek and Latin, with regard to the
                    profane classics. Intellectually they admired, and would not belie their
                    admiration; but they did not give their hearts cordially, they did not abandon
                    themselves to their natural impulses. They averted their eyes and weaned their
                    attention from the dazzling object. Such, probably, was Milton’s state of
                    feeling towards Shakspeare after 1642, when the theatres were suppressed, and
                    the fanatical fervour in its noontide heat. Yet even then he did not belie his
                    reverence intellectually for Shakspeare; and in his younger days we know that he
                    had spoken more enthusiastically of Shakspeare than he ever did again of any
                    uninspired author. Not only did he address a sonnet to his memory, in which he
                    declares that kings would wish to die, if by dying they could obtain such a
                    monument in the hearts of men; but he also speaks of him in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Il Penseroso</hi> as the tutelary genius of the English stage.
                    In this transmission of the torch (λαμπαδoφoϑια) Dryden succeeds to Milton; he
                    was born nearly thirty years later; about thirty years they were contemporaries;
                    and by thirty years, or nearly, Dryden survived his great leader. Dryden, in
                    fact, lived out the seventeenth century. And we have now arrived within nine
                    years of the era when the critical editions started in hot succession to one
                    another. The names we have mentioned were the great influential names of the
                    century. But of inferior homage there was no end. How came Betterton the actor,
                    how came Devenant, how came Rowe, or Pope, by their intense (if not always
                    sound) admiration for Shakspeare, unless they had found it fuming upwards like
                    incense to the Pagan deities in ancient times from altars erected at every
                    turning upon all the paths of men?</p>
                <p part="N">But it is objected that inferior dramatists were sometimes preferred to
                    Shakspeare; and again, that vile travesties of Shakspeare were preferred to the
                    authentic dramas. As to the first argument, let it be remembered, that if the
                    saints of the chapel are always in the same honour, because <hi rend="italic"
                        >there</hi> men are simply discharging a duty, which once due will be due
                    for ever; the saints of the theatre, on the other hand, must bend to the local
                    genius, and to the very reasons for having a theatre at all. Men go thither for
                    amusement: this is the paramount purpose; and even acknowledged merit or
                    absolute superiority must give way to it. Does a man at Paris expect to see
                    Molière reproduced in proportion to his admitted precedency in the French drama?
                    On the contrary, that very precedency argues such a familiarization with his
                    works, that those who are in quest of relaxation will reasonably prefer any
                    recent drama to that which, having lost all its novelty, has lost much of its
                    excitement. We speak of ordinary minds; but in cases of <hi rend="italic"
                        >public</hi> entertainments, deriving part of their power from scenery and
                    stage pomp, novelty is for all minds an essential condition of attraction.
                    Moreover, in some departments of the comic, Beaumont and Fletcher, when writing
                    in combination, really had a freedom and breadth of manner which excels the
                    comedy of Shakspeare. As to the altered Shakspeare as taking precedency of the
                    genuine Shakspeare, no argument can be so frivolous. The public were never
                    allowed a choice; the great majority of an audience even now cannot be expected
                    to carry the real Shakspeare in their mind, so as to pursue a comparison between
                    that and the alteration. Their comparisons must be exclusively amongst what they
                    have opportunities of seeing; that is, between the various pieces presented to
                    them by the managers of theatres. Further than this it is impossible for them to
                    extend their office of judging and collating; and the degenerate taste which
                    substituted the caprices of Davenant, the rants of Dryden, or the filth of Tate,
                    for the jewellery of Shakspeare, cannot with any justice be charged upon the
                    public, not one in a thousand of whom was furnished with any means of comparing,
                    but exclusively upon those (viz. theatrical managers) who had the very amplest.
                    Yet even in excuse for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> much may be said. The very
                    length of some plays compelled them to make alterations. The best of
                    Shakspeare’s dramas, King Lear, is the least fitted for representation; and,
                    even for the vilest alteration, it ought in candour to be considered that
                    possession is nine points of the law. He who would not have introduced, was
                    often obliged to retain.</p>
                <p part="N">Finally, it is urged, that the small number of editions through which
                    Shakspeare passed in the seventeenth century, furnishes a separate argument, and
                    a conclusive one, against his popularity. We answer, that, considering the<pb

                    were <hi rend="italic">not few:</hi> compared with any known case, the copies
                    sold of Shakspeare were quite as many as could be expected under the
                    circumstances. Ten or fifteen times as much consideration went to the purchase
                    of one great folio like Shakspeare, as would attend the purchase of a little
                    volume like Waller or Donne. Without reviews, or newspapers, or advertisements
                    to diffuse the knowledge of books, the progress of literature was necessarily
                    slow, and its expansion narrow. But this is a topic which has always been
                    treated unfairly, not with regard to Shakspeare only, but to Milton, as well as
                    many others. The truth is, we have not facts enough to guide us; for the number
                    of editions often tells nothing accurately as to the number of copies. With
                    respect to Shakspeare it is certain, that, had his masterpieces been gathered
                    into small volumes, Shakspeare would have had a most extensive sale. As it was,
                    there can be no doubt, that from his own generation, throughout the seventeenth
                    century, and until the eighteenth began to accommodate, not any greater
                    popularity in <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> but a greater taste for reading in the
                    public, his fame never ceased to be viewed as a national trophy of honour; and
                    the most illustrious men of the seventeenth century were no whit less fervent in
                    their admiration than those of the eighteenth and the nineteenth, either as
                    respected its strength and sincerity, or as respected its open profession.<note

                            compression obliges us to omit many arguments and references by which we
                            could demonstrate the fact, that Shakspeare’s reputation was always in a
                            progressive state; allowing only for the interruption of about seventeen
                            years, which this poet, in common with all others, sustained, not so
                            much from the state of war (which did not fully occupy four of those
                            years), as from the triumph of a gloomy fanaticism. Deduct the
                            twenty-three years of the seventeenth century which had elapsed before
                            the first folio appeared, to this space add seventeen years of fanatical
                            madness, during fourteen of which <hi rend="italic">all</hi> dramatic
                            entertainments were suppressed, the remainder is sixty years. And surely
                            the sale of four editions of a vast folio in that space of time was an
                            expression of an abiding interest. <hi rend="italic">No other poet,
                                except Spenser, continual to sell throughout the century.</hi>
                            Besides, in arguing the case of a <hi rend="italic">dramatic</hi> poet,
                            we must bear in mind, that although readers of learned books might be
                            diffused over the face of the land, the readers of poetry would be
                            chiefly concentred in the metropolis; and such persons would have no
                            need to buy what they heard at the theatres. But then comes the
                            question, whether Shakspeare kept possession of the theatres. And we are
                            really humiliated by the gross want of sense which has been shown, by
                            Malone chiefly, but also by many others, in discussing this question.
                            From the Restoration to 1682, says Malone, no more than four plays of
                            Shakspeare’s were performed by a principal company in London- “Such was
                            the lamentable taste of those times, that the plays of Fletcher, Jonson,
                            and Shlrley, were much oftener exhibited than those of our author." What
                            cant is this! If that taste were “lamentable," what are we to think of
                            our own times, when plays a thousand times below those of Fletcher, or
                            even of Shirley, continually displace Shakspeare? Shakspeare would
                            himself have exulted in finding that he gave way only to dramatists so
                            excellent. And, as we have before observed, both then and now, it is the
                            very familiarity with Shakspeare which often banishes him from audiences
                            honestly in quest of relaxation and amusement. Novelty is the very soul
                            of such relaxation; but in our closets, when we are <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> unbending, when our minds are in a state of tension from
                            intellectual cravings, then it is that we resort to Shakspeare; and
                            oftentimes those who honour him most, like ourselves, are the most
                            impatient of seeing his divine scenes disfigured by unequal
                            representation (good, perhaps, in a single personation, bad in all the
                            rest); or to hear his divine thoughts mangled in the recitation; or
                            (which is worst of all) to hear them dishonoured and defeated by
                            imperfect apprehension in the audience, or by defective sympathy.
                            Meantime, if one theatre played only four of Shakspeare’s dramas,
                            another played at least seven. But the grossest folly of Malone is, in
                            fancying the numerous alterations so many insults to Shakspeare, whereas
                            they expressed as much homage to his memory as if the unaltered dramas
                            had been retained. The substance <hi rend="italic">was</hi> retained.
                            The changes were merely concessions to the changing views of scenical
                            propriety; sometimes, no doubt, made with a simple view to the
                            revolution effected by Davenant at the restoration, in bringing <hi
                                rend="italic">scene,</hi> (in the painter’s sense) upon the stage;
                            sometimes also with a view to the altered fashions of the audience
                            during the suspensions of the action, or perhaps to the introduction of
                                <hi rend="italic">after·pieces,</hi> by which, of course, the time
                            was abridged for the main performance. A volume might be written upon
                            this subject. Meantime let us never be told, that a poet was losing, or
                            bad lost his ground, who found in his lowest depression, amongst his
                            almost idolatrous supporters, a great king distracted by civil wars, a
                            mighty republican poet distracted by puritanical fanaticism, the
                            greatest successor by far of that great poet, a papist and a bigoted
                            royalist, and finally, the leading actor of the century, who gave and
                            reflected the ruling impulses of his age.</p></note> lt is therefore a
                    false notion, that the general sympathy with the merits of Shakspeare ever beat
                    with a languid or intermitting pulse. Undoubtedly, in times when the functions
                    of critical journals and of newspapers were not at hand to diffuse or to
                    strengthen the impressions which emanated from the capital, all opinions must
                    have travelled slowly into the provinces. But even then, whilst the perfect
                    organs of communication were wanting, indirect substitutes were supplied by the
                    necessities of the times, or by the instincts of political zeal. Two channels
                    especially lay open between the great central organ of the national mind, and
                    the remotest provinces. Parliaments were occasionally summoned (for the judges’
                    circuits were too brief to produce much effect); and during their longest
                    suspensions, the nobility, with large retinues, continually resorted to the
                    court. But an intercourse more constant and more comprehensive was maintained
                    through the agency of the two universities. Already, in the time of James I.,
                    the growing importance of the gentry, and the consequent birth of a new interest
                    in political questions, had begun to express itself at Oxford, and still more so
                    at Cambridge. Academic persons stationed themselves as sentinels at London, for
                    the purpose of watching the court and the course of public affairs. These
                    persons wrote letters, like those of the celebrated Joseph Mede, which we find
                    in Ellis’s Historical Collections, reporting to their fellow-collegians all the
                    novelties of public life as they arose, or personally carried down such reports,
                    and thus conducted the general feelings at the centre into lesser centres, from
                    which again they were diffused into the ten thousand parishes of England; for
                    (with a very few exceptions in favour of poor benefices, Welch or Cumbrian),
                    every parish priest must unavoidably have spent his three years at one or other
                    of the English universities. And by this mode of diffusion it is that we can
                    explain the strength with which Shakspeare’s thoughts and diction impressed
                    themselves from a very early period upon the national literature, and even more
                    generally upon the national thinking and conversation.<note anchored="true"

                            interweave themselves with our daily conversation, and pass into the
                            currency of the language. <hi rend="italic">Few French author., if any,

                            by aids from the mintage of Shakspeare, had already commenced in the

                    had not then commenced. Such a taste, often petty enough in its management was
                    the growth of after-ages. Else how came Spenser’s life and fortunes to be so
                    utterly overwhelmed in oblivion? No poet of a high order could be more
                    popular.</p>
                <p part="N">The answer we believe to be this: Twenty-six years after Shakspeare’s
                    death commenced the great parliamentary war: this it was, and the local feuds
                    arising to divide family from family, brother from brother, upon which we must
                    charge the extinction of traditions and memorials, doubtless abundant up to that
                    era. The parliamentary contest it will be said, did not last above three years;
                    the king’s standard having been first raised at Nottingham in August 1642, and
                    the battle of Naseby (which terminated the open warfare) having been fought in
                    June 1645. Or even if we extend its duration to the surrender of the last
                    garrison, that war terminated in the spring of 1646. And the brief explosions of
                    insurrection or of Scottish invasion which occurred on subsequent occasions were
                    all locally confined; and none came near to Warwickshire, except the battle of
                    Worcester, more than five years after. This is true; but a short war will do
                    much to efface recent and merely personal memorials. And the following
                    circumstances of the war were even more important than the general fact.</p>
                <p part="N">First of all, the very mansion founded by Shakspeare became the military
                    head-quarters for the queen in 1644, when marching from the eastern coast of
                    England to join the king in Oxford; and one such special visitation would be
                    likely to do more serious mischief in the way of extinction, than many years of
                    general warfare. Secondly, as a fact perhaps, equally important Birmingham, the
                    chief town of Warwickshire, and the adjacent district the seat of our hardware
                    manufactures, was the very focus of disaffection towards the royal cause. Not
                    only, therefore, would this whole region suffer more from internal and

                    Warwickshire, this county happens to be the central one of England, as regards
                    the roads between the north and south; and Birmingham has long been the great

                    relating to Shakspeare, as well as for the subversion of that quiet and security

                        rend="italic">nidus.</hi> Thus we obtain one solution, and perhaps the main
                    one, of the otherwise mysterious oblivion which had swept away all traces of the
                    mighty poet by the time when those quiet days revolved upon England, in which
                    again the solitary agent of learned research might roam in security from house
                    to house, gleaning those personal remembrances which, even in the fury of civil
                    strife, might long have lingered by the chimney corner. But the fierce furnace
                    of war had probably, by its <hi rend="italic">local</hi> ravages, scorched this
                    field of natural tradition, and thinned the gleaner’s inheritance by three parts
                    out of four. This, we repeat may be one part of the solution to this difficult
                    problem.</p>
                <p part="N">And if another is still demanded, possibly it may be found in the fact
                    hostile to the perfect consecration of Shakspeare’s memory, that after all he
                    was a player. Many a coarse-minded country gentleman, or village pastor, who
                    would have held his town glorified by the distinction of having sent forth a
                    great judge or an eminent bishop, might disdain to cherish the personal
                    recollections which surrounded one whom custom regarded as little above a
                    mountebank, and the illiberal law as a vagabond. The same degrading appreciation
                    attached both to the actor in plays and to their author. The contemptuous
                    appellation of “play book,” served as readily to degrade the mighty volume which
                    contained Lear and Hamlet, as that of “play-actor,” or “player-man,” has always
                    served with the illiberal or the fanatical to dishonour the persons of Roscius
                    or of Garrick, of Talma or of Siddons. Nobody, indeed, was better aware of this
                    than the noble-minded Shakspeare; and feelingly he has breathed forth in his
                    sonnets this conscious oppression under which he lay of public opinion,
                    unfavourable by a double title to his own pretensions; for, being both dramatic
                    author and dramatic performer, he found himself heir to a two-fold opprobrium,
                    and at an era of English society when the weight of that opprobrium was
                    heaviest. In reality, there was at this period a collision of forces acting in
                    opposite directions upon the estimation of the stage and scenical art and
                    therefore of all the ministers in its equipage. Puritanism frowned upon these
                    pursuits, as ruinous to public morals; on the oilier hand, loyalty could not but
                    tolerate what was patronized by the sovereign; and it happened that Elizabeth,
                    James, and Charles I., were all alike lovers and promoters of theatrical
                    amusements, which were indeed more indispensable to the relief of court
                    ceremony, and the monotony of aulic pomp, than in any other region of life. This
                    royal support, and the consciousness that any brilliant success in these arts
                    implied an unusual share of natural endowments, did something in mitigation of a
                    scorn which must else have been intolerable to all generous natures.</p>
                <p part="N">But whatever prejudice might thus operate against the perfect sanctity
                    of Shakspeare’s posthumous reputation, it is certain that the splendour of his
                    worldly success must have done much to obliterate that effect; his admirable
                    colloquial talents a good deal, and his gracious affability still more. The
                    wonder therefore w ill still remain, that Betterton, in less than a century from
                    his death, should have been able to glean so little. And for the solution of
                    this wonder we must throw ourselves chiefly upon the explanations we have made
                    as to the parliamentary war, and the local ravages of its progress in the very
                    district of the very town, and the very house.</p>
                <p part="N">If further arguments are still wanted to explain this mysterious
                    abolition, we may refer the reader to the following succession of disastrous
                    events, by which it should seem that a perfect malice of misfortune pursued the
                    vestiges of the mighty poet’s steps. In 1613, the Globe theatre, with which he
                    had been so long connected, was burned to the ground. Soon afterwards a great
                    fire occurred in Stratford; and next (without counting upon the fire of London,
                    just fifty years after his death, which, however, would consume many an
                    important record from periods far more remote), the house of Ben Jonson, in
                    which probably, as Mr Campbell suggests, might be parts of his correspondence,
                    was also burned. Finally, there was an old tradition that Lady Barnard, the sole
                    grand-daughter of Shakspeare, had carried off many of his papers from Stratford;
                    and these papers have never since been traced.</p>
                <p part="N">In many of the elder lives it has been asserted, that John Shakspeare,
                    the father of the poet, was a butcher,<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=193" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0193-0175"
                    /> and in others that he was a woolstapler. It is now settled beyond dispute
                    that he was a glover. This was his professed occupation in Stratford, though it
                    is certain that, with this leading trade, from which he took his denomination,
                    he combined some collateral pursuits; and it is possible enough that, as
                    openings offered, he may have meddled with many. In that age, and in a
                    provincial town, nothing like the exquisite subdivision of labour was attempted
                    which we now see realized in the great cities of Christendom. And one trade is
                    often found to play into another with so much reciprocal advantage, that even in
                    our own days we do not much wonder at an enterprising man, in country places,
                    who combines several in his own person. Accordingly John Shakspeare is known to
                    have united with his town calling the rural and miscellaneous occupations of a
                    farmer.</p>
                <p part="N">Meantime his avowed business stood upon a very different footing from
                    the same trade as it is exercised in modem times. Gloves were in that age an
                    article of dress more costly by much, and more elaborately decorated, than in
                    our own. They were a customary present from some cities to the judges of assize,
                    and to other official persons; a custom of ancient standing, and in some places,
                    we believe, still subsisting; and in such cases it is reasonable to suppose that
                    the gloves must originally have been more valuable than the trivial modern
                    article of the same name. So also, perhaps, in their origin, of the gloves given
                    at funerals. In reality, whenever the simplicity of an age makes it difficult to
                    renew the parts of a wardrobe except in capital towns of difficult access,
                    prudence suggests that such wares should be manufactured of more durable
                    materials; and, being so, they become obviously susceptible of more lavish
                    ornament. But it will not follow, from this essential difference in the gloves
                    of Shakspeare’s age, that the glover’s occupation was more lucrative. Doubtless
                    he sold more costly gloves, and upon each pair had a larger profit; but for that
                    very reason he sold fewer. Two or three gentlemen “of worship” in the
                    neighbourhood might occasionally require a pair of gloves, but it is very
                    doubtful whether any inhabitant of Stratford would ever call for so mere a
                    luxury.</p>
                <p part="N">The practical result, at all events, of John Shakspeare’s various
                    pursuits does not appear permanently to have met the demands of his
                    establishment; and in his maturer years there are indications still surviving
                    that he was under a cloud of embarrassment. He certainly lost at one time his
                    social position in the town of Stratford; but there is a strong presumption, in
                        <hi rend="italic">our</hi> construction of the case, that he finally
                    retrieved it; and for this retrieval of a station which he had forfeited by
                    personal misfortunes or neglect, he was altogether indebted to the filial piety
                    of his immortal son.</p>
                <p part="N">Meantime the earlier years of the elder Shakspeare wore the aspect of
                    rising prosperity, however unsound might be the basis on which it rested. There
                    can be little doubt that William Shakspeare, from his birth up to his tenth or
                    perhaps his eleventh year, lived in careless plenty, and saw nothing in his
                    father’s house but that style of liberal housekeeping which has ever
                    distinguished the upper yeomanry and the rural gentry of England. Probable
                    enough it is that the resources for meeting this liberality were not strictly
                    commensurate with the family income, but were sometimes allowed to entrench, by
                    means of loans or mortgages, upon capital funds. The stress upon the family
                    finances was perhaps at times severe; and that it was borne at all, must be
                    imputed to the large and even splendid portion which John Shakspeare received
                    with his wife.</p>
                <p part="N">This lady, for such she really was in an eminent sense, by birth as well
                    as by connections, bore the beautiful name of Mary Arden, a name derived from
                    the ancient forest district<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    merits a more elaborate notice than our slender materials will furnish. To have
                    been <hi rend="italic">the mother of Shakspeare,—</hi> how august a title to the
                    reverence of infinite generations, and of centuries beyond the vision of
                    prophecy. A plausible hypothesis has been started in modern times, that the
                    facial structure, and that the intellectual conformation, may be deduced more
                    frequently from the corresponding characteristics in the mother than in the
                    father. It is certain that no very great man has ever existed, but that his
                    greatness has been rehearsed and predicted in one or other of his parents. And
                    it cannot be denied, that in the most eminent men, where we have had the means
                    of pursuing the investigation, the mother has more frequently been repeated and
                    reproduced than the father. We have known cases where the mother has furnished
                    all the intellect, and the father all the moral sensibility; upon which
                    assumption, the wonder ceases that Cicero, Lord Chesterfield, and other
                    brilliant men, who took the utmost pains with their sons, should have failed so
                    conspicuously; for possibly the mothers had been women of excessive and even
                    exemplary stupidity. In the case of Shakspeare, each parent, if we had any means
                    of recovering their characteristics, could not fail to furnish a study of the
                    most profound interest; and with regard to his mother in particular, if the
                    modern hypothesis be true, and if we are indeed to deduce from <hi rend="italic"
                        >her</hi> the stupendous intellect of her son, in that case she must have
                    been a benefactress to her husband’s family beyond the promises of fairyland or
                    the dreams of romance; for it is certain that to her chiefly this family was
                    also indebted for their worldly comfort.</p>
                <p part="N">Mary Arden was the youngest daughter and the heiress of Robert Arden of
                    Wilmecote, Esq. in the county of Warwick. The family of Arden was even then of
                    great antiquity. About one century and a quarter before the birth of William
                    Shakspeare, a person bearing the same name as his maternal grandfather had been
                    returned by the commissioners in their list of the Warwickshire gentry; he was
                    there styled Robert Arden, Esq. of Bromich. This was in 1433, or the l'2th year
                    of Henry VI. In Henry VII.'s reign, the Ardens received a grant of lands from
                    the crown; and in 1568, four years after the birth of William Shakspeare, Edward
                    Arden, of the same family, was sheriff of the county. Mary Arden was therefore a
                    young lady of excellent descent and connections, and an heiress of considcrable
                    wealth. She brought to her husband, as her marriage portion, the landed estate
                    of As-bics, which, upon any just valuation, must be considered as a handsome
                    dowry for a woman of her station. As this point has been contested, and as it
                    goes a great way towards determining the exact social position of the poet’s
                    parents, let us be excused for sifting it a little more narrowly than might else
                    seem warranted by the proportions of our present life. Every question which it
                    can be reasonable to raise at all, it must be reasonable to treat with at least
                    so much of minute research as may justify the conclusions which it is made to
                    support.</p>
                <p part="N">The estate of Asbies contained fifty acres of arable land, six of
                    meadow, and a right of commonage. What may we assume to have been the value of

                    L.110. 13s. 4d, is sure that the value of Asbies could not have been more than
                    one hundred pounds. But why? Because, says he, the “average” rent of land at
                    that time was no more than three shillings per acre. This we deny; but<pb

                            the gross anachronism of making an estimate for Shakspeare’s days in a
                            coin which did not exist until a century, within a couple of years,
                            after Shakspeare’s birth, and did not settle to the value of twenty-one
                            shillings until a century after his death-The nerve of such an
                            anachronism would lie in putting the estimate into a mouth of that age.
                            And this is precisely the blunder into which the foolish forger of
                            Vortigern, Ac. has fallen. He does not indeed directly mention guineas;
                            but indirectly and virtually he does, by repeatedly giving us accounts
                            imputed to Shakspearian contemporaries, in which the sum-total amounts
                            to L.5. 5s.; or to L.26. 5s.; or, again, to L.17. 17s. 6d. A man is
                            careful to subscribe L.14. 14s. and so forth. But how could such amounts
                            have arisen unless under a secret reference to guineas, which were not
                            in existence until Charles II.’s reign; and, moreover, to guineas at
                            their final settlement by law into twenty-one shillings each, which did

                    than was usually given to a landed gentleman’s daughter.” But this writer
                    objects to Malone’s principle of valuation. “We find,” says he, “that John
                    Shakspeare also farmed the meadow of Tugton, containing sixteen acres, at the
                    rate of eleven shillings per acre. Now what proof has Mr Malone adduced that the
                    acres of Asbies were not as valuable as those of Tugton? And if they were so,
                    the former estate must have been worth between three and four hundred pounds.”
                    In the main drift of his objections we concur with Mr Campbell. But as they are
                    liable to some criticism, let us clear the ground of all plausible cavils, and
                    then see what will be the result. Malone, had he been alive, would probably have
                    answered, that Tugton was a farm specially privileged by nature; and that if any
                    man contended for so unusual a rent as eleven shillings an acre for land not
                    known to him, the <hi rend="italic">onus probandi</hi> would lie upon <hi
                        rend="italic">him</hi>. Be it so; eleven shillings is certainly above the
                    ordinary level of rent, but three shillings is below it. We contend, that for
                    tolerably good land, situatcd advantageously, that is, with a ready access to
                    good markets and good fairs, such as those of Coventry, Birmingham, Gloucester,
                    Worcester, Shrewsbury, &amp;c., one noble might be assumed as the annual rent;
                    and that in such situations twenty years’ purchase was not a valuation, even in
                    Elizabeth’s reign, very unusual. Let us, however, assume the rent at only five
                    shillings, and land at sixteen years’ purchase: upon this basis, the rent would
                    be L.14, and the value of the feesimple L.224. Now, if it were required to
                    equate that sum with its present value, a very operose<note anchored="true"

                            still a very difficult problem, complex, and, after all, merely
                            tentative in the results, to assign the true value in such cases; not
                            only for the obvious reason, that the powers of money have varied in
                            different directions with regard to different objects, and in different
                            degrees where the direction has on the whole continued the same, but
                            because the very objects to be taken into computation are so
                            indeterminate, and vary so much, not only as regards century and

                            to one, is a luxurious superfluity to another. And, in order to
                            ascertain these differences, it is an indispensable qualification to
                            have studied the habits and customs of the several classes concerned,

                    calculation might be requisite. But contenting ourselves with the gross method
                    of making such equations between 1560 and the current century, that is,
                    multiplying by five, we shall find the capital value of the estate to be eleven
                    hundred and twenty pounds, whilst the annual rent would be exactly seventy. But
                    if the estate had been sold, and the purchasemoney lent upon mortgage (the only
                    safe mode of investing money at that time), the annual interest would have
                    reached L.28, equal to L.140 of modern money; for mortgages in Elizabeth’s age
                    readily produced ten per cent.</p>
                <p part="N">A woman who should bring at this day an annual income of L.140 to a
                    provincial tradesman, living in a sort of <hi rend="italic">rus in urbe,</hi>
                    according to the simple fashions of rustic life, would assuredly be considered
                    as an excellent match. And there can be little doubt that Mary Arden’s dowry it
                    was which, for some ten or a dozen years succeeding to his marriage, raised her
                    husband to so much social consideration in Strat ford. In 1550 John Shakspeare
                    is supposed to have first settled in Stratford, having migrated from some other
                    part of Warwickshire. In 1557 he married Mary Arden; in 1565, the year
                    subsequent to the birth of his son William, his third child, he was elected one
                    of the aldermen; and in the year 1568 he became first magistrate of the town, by
                    the title of high bailiff. This year we may assume to have been that in which
                    the prosperity of this family reached its zenith; for in this year it was, over
                    and above the presumptions furnished by his civic honours, that he obtained a
                    grant of arms from Clarencieux of the Heralds’ College. On this occasion he
                    declared himself worth five hundred pounds derived from his ancestors. And we
                    really cannot understand the right by which critics, living nearly three
                    centuries from his time, undertake to know his affairs better than himself, and
                    to tax him with either inaccuracy or falsehood. No man would be at leisure to
                    court heraldic honours when he knew himself to be embarrassed, or apprehended
                    that he soon might be so. A man whose anxieties had been fixed at all upon his
                    daily livelihood would, by this chase after the aerial honours of heraldry, have
                    made himself a butt for ridicule such as no fortitude could enable him to
                    sustain.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1568, therefore, when his son William would be moving through his
                    fifth year, John Shakspeare (now honoured by the designation of <hi
                        rend="italic">Master)</hi> would be found at times in the society of the
                    neighbouring gentry. Ten years in advance of this period he was already in
                    difficulties. But there is no proof that these difficulties had then reached a
                    point of degradation, or of memorable distress. The sole positive indications of
                    his decaying condition are, that in 1578 he received an exemption from the small
                    weekly assessment levied upon the aldermen of Stratford for the relief of the
                    poor; and that in the following year, 1579, he is found enrolled amongst the
                    defaulters in the payment of taxes. The latter fact undoubtedly goes to prove
                    that, like every man who is falling back in the world, he was occasionally in
                    arrears. Paying taxes is not like the honours awarded or the processions
                    regulated by Clarendeux; no man is ambitious of precedency there; and if a
                    laggard pace in that duty is to be received as evidence of pauperism, nine
                    tenths of the English people might occasionally be classed as paupers. With
                    respect to his liberation from the weekly assessment, that may bear a
                    construction different from the one which it has received. This payment, which
                    could never have been regarded as a burthen, not amounting to five pounds
                    annually of our present money, may have been held up as an exponent of wealth
                    and consideration; and John Shakspeare may have been required to resign it as an
                    honourable distinction, not suitable to the circumstances of an embarrassed man.
                    Finally, the fact of his being indebted to Robert Sadler, a baker, in the sum of
                    five pounds, and his being under the necessity of bringing a friend as security
                    for the payment, proves nothing at<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=195" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0195-0177"
                    /> all. There is not a town in Europe in which opulent men cannot be found that
                    are backward in the payment of their debts. And the probability is, that Master
                    Sadler acted like most people who, when they suppose a man to be going down in
                    the world, feel their respect for him sensibly decaying, and think it wise to
                    trample him under foot, provided only in that act of trampling they can squeeze
                    out of him their own individual debt. Like that terrific chorus in Spohr's
                    oratorio of St Paul, “<hi rend="italic">stone him to death"</hi> is the cry of
                    the selfish and the illiberal amongst creditors, alike towards the just and the
                    unjust amongst debtors.</p>
                <p part="N">It was the wise and beautiful prayer of Agar, “Give me neither poverty
                    nor riches ;” and, doubtless, for quiet, for peace, and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >latentis semita vitae,</hi> that is the happiest dispensation. But,
                    perhaps, with a view to a school of discipline and of moral fortitude, it might
                    be a more salutary prayer, “Give me riches <hi rend="italic">and</hi> poverty,
                    and afterwards neither.” For the transitional state between riches and poverty
                    will teach a lesson both as to the baseness and the goodness of human nature,
                    and will impress that lesson with a searching force, such as no borrowed
                    experience ever can approach. Most probable it is that Shakspeare drew some of
                    his powerful scenes in the Timon of Athens, those which exhibit the vileness of
                    ingratitude and the impassioned frenzy of misanthropy, from his personal
                    recollections connected with the case of his own father. Possibly, though a
                    cloud of 270 years now veils it, this very Master Sadler, who was so urgent for
                    his five pounds, and who so little apprehended that he should be called over the
                    coals for it in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, may have sate for the portrait of
                    that Lucullus who says of Timon—</p>
                <p part="N">Alas, good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not keep so good a
                    house. Many a tune and often I have dined with him, and told him on’t; and come
                    again to supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less: and yet he would
                    embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming. Every man has his fault, and
                    honesty is his; I have told him on't, but I could never get him from it.</p>
                <p part="N">For certain years, perhaps, John Shakspeare moved on in darkness and
                    sorrow:</p>
                <p part="N">His familiars from his buried fortunes Slunk all away; left their false
                    vows with him,</p>
                <p part="N">Like empty purses pick'd: and his poor self,</p>
                <p part="N">A dedicated beggar to the air,</p>
                <p part="N">With his disease of all-shunn’d poverty,</p>
                <p part="N">Walk'd, like contempt, alone.</p>
                <p part="N">We, however, at this day are chiefly interested in the case as it bears
                    upon the education and youthful happiness of the poet. Now if we suppose that
                    from 1568, the high noon of the family prosperity, to 1578, the first year of
                    their mature embarrassments, one half the interval was passed in stationary
                    sunshine, and the latter half in the gradual twilight of declension, it will
                    follow that the young William had completed his tenth year before he heard the
                    first signals of distress; and for so long a period his education would probably
                    be conducted on as liberal a scale as the resources of Stratford would allow.
                    Through this earliest section of his life he would undoubtedly rank as a
                    gentleman’s son, possibly as the leader of his class, in Stratford. But what
                    rank he held through the next ten years, or, more generally, what was the
                    standing in society of Shakspeare until he had created a new station for himself
                    by his own exertions in the metropolis, is a question yet unsettled, but which
                    has been debated as keenly as if it had some great dependencies. Upon this we
                    shall observe, that could we by possibility be called to settle beforehand what
                    rank were best for favouring the development of intellectual powers, the
                    question might wear a face of deep practical importance; but when the question
                    is simply as to a matter of fact, what <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the rank held
                    by a man whose intellectual development bas long ago been completed, this
                    becomes a mere question of curiosity. The tree has fallen; it is confessedly the
                    noblest of all the forest; and we must therefore conclude that the soil in which
                    it flourished was either the best possible, or, if not so, that any thing bad in
                    its properties had been disarmed and neutralized by the vital forces of the
                    plant, or by the benignity of nature. If any future Shakspeare were likely to
                    arise, it might be a problem of great interest to agitate, whether the condition
                    of a poor man or of a gentleman were best fitted to nurse and stimulate his
                    faculties. But for the actual Shakspeare, since what he was he was, and since
                    nothing greater can be imagined, it is now become a matter of little moment
                    whether his course lay for fifteen or twenty years through the humilities of
                    absolute poverty, or through the chequered paths of gentry lying in the shade.
                    Whatever <hi rend="italic">was,</hi> must, in this case at least, have been the
                    best, since it terminated in producing Shakspeare; and thus far we must all be
                    optimists.</p>
                <p part="N">Yet still, it will be urged, the curiosity is not illiberal which would
                    seek to ascertain the precise career through which Shakspeare ran. This we
                    readily concede; and we are anxious ourselves to contribute any thing in our
                    power to the settlement of a point so obscure. What we have wished to protest
                    against is the spirit of partisanship in which this question has too generally
                    been discussed. For, whilst some with a foolish affectation of plebeian
                    sympathies overwhelm us with the insipid commonplaces about birth and ancient
                    descent, as honours containing nothing meritorious, and rush eagerly into an
                    ostentatious exhibition of all the circumstances which favour the notion of a
                    humble station and humble connections; others, with equal forgetfulness of true
                    dignity, plead with the intemperance and partiality of a legal advocate for the
                    pretensions of Shakspeare to the hereditary rank of gentleman. Both parties
                    violate the majesty of the subject. When we are seeking for the sources of the
                    Euphrates or the St Lawrence, we look for no proportions to the mighty volume of
                    waters in that particular summit amongst the chain of mountains which embosoms
                    its earliest fountains, nor are we shocked at the obscurity of these fountains.
                    Pursuing the career of Mahommed, or of any man who has memorably impressed his
                    own mind or agency upon the revolutions of mankind, we feel solicitude about the
                    circumstances which might surround his cradle to be altogether unseasonable and
                    impertinent. Whether he were born in a hovel or a palace, whether he passed his
                    infancy in squalid poverty, or hedged around by the glittering spears of
                    body-guards, as mere questions of fact may be interesting; but, in the light of
                    either accessories or counteragencies to the native majesty of the subject, are
                    trivial and below all philosophic valuation. So with regard to the creator of
                    Lear and Hamlet, of Othello and Macbeth; to him from whose golden urns the
                    nations beyond the far Atlantic, the multitude of the isles, and the generations
                    unborn in Australian climes, even to the realms of the rising sun (the ἀvατoλαι
                    ἡελιoιo), must in every age draw perennial streams of intellectual life, we feel
                    that the little accidents of birth and social condition are so unspeakably below
                    the grandeur of the theme, are so irrelevant and disproportioned to the real
                    interest at issue, so incommensurable with any of its relations, that a
                    biographer of Shakspeare at once denounces himself as below his subject if he
                    can entertain such a question as seriously affecting the glory of the poet. In
                    some legends of saints, we find that they were born with a lambent circle or
                    golden aureola about their heads. This angelic coronet shed light alike upon the
                    chambers of a cottage or a palace, upon the gloomy limits of a dungeon or the
                    vast expansion of a cathedral; but the cottage, the palace, the dungeon, the
                    cathedral, were all equally incapable of adding one ray of colour or one pencil
                    of light to the supernatural halo.</p>
                <p part="N">Having therefore thus pointedly guarded ourselves from misconstruction,
                    and consenting to entertain the question<pb break="no"

                    /> as one in which we, the worshippers of Shakspeare, have an interest of
                    curiosity, but in which he, the object of our worship, has no interest of glory,
                    we proceed to state what appears to us the result of the scanty facts surviving
                    when collated with each other.</p>
                <p part="N">By his mother’s side, Shakspeare was an authentic gentleman. By his
                    father’s he would have stood in a more dubious position; but the effect of
                    municipal honours to raise and illustrate an equivocal rank has always been
                    acknowledged under the popular tendencies of our English political system. From
                    the sort of lead, therefore, which John Shakspeare took at one time amongst his
                    fellow-townsmen, and from his rank of first magistrate, we may presume that,
                    about the year 1568, he had placed himself at the head of the Stratford
                    community. Afterwards he continued for some years to descend from this altitude;
                    and the question is, at what point this gradual degradation may be supposed to
                    have settled. Now we shall avow it as our opinion, that the composition of
                    society in Stratford was such that, even had the Shakspeare family maintained
                    their superiority, the main body of their daily associates must still have been
                    found amongst persons below the rank of gentry. The poet must inevitably have
                    mixed chiefly with mechanics and humble tradesmen, for such people composed
                    perhaps the total community. But had there even been a gentry in Stratford,
                    since they would have marked the distinctions of their rank chiefly by greater
                    reserve of manners, it is probable that, after all, Shakspeare, with his
                    enormity of delight in exhibitions of human nature, would have mostly cultivated
                    that class of society in which the feelings are more elementary and simple, in
                    which the thoughts speak a plainer language, and in which the restraints of
                    factitious or conventional decorum are exchanged for the restraints of mere
                    sexual decency. It is a noticeable fact to all who have looked upon human life
                    with an eye of strict attention, that the abstract image of womanhood, in its
                    loveliness, its delicacy, and its modesty, nowhere makes itself more impressive
                    or more advantageously felt than in the humblest cottages, because it is there
                    brought into immediate juxtaposition with the grossness of manners and the
                    careless license of language incident to the fathers and brothers of the house.
                    And this is more especially true in a nation of unaffected sexual
                        gallantry,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >Never was the <hi rend="italic">case quαm videri</hi> in any point more
                            strongly discriminated than in this very point of gallantry to the
                            female sex, as between England and France. In France, the verbal homage
                            to women is so excessive as to betray its real purpose, viz. that it is
                            a mask for secret contempt. In England, little is <hi rend="italic"
                                >said</hi>; but, in the mean time, we allow our sovereign ruler to
                            be a woman; which in France is impossible. Even that fact is of some
                            importance, but less so than what follows. In every country whatsoever,
                            if any principle has a deep root in the moral feelings of the people, we
                            may rely upon its showing itself, by a thousand evidences, amongst the
                            very lowest ranks, and in their daily intercourse, and their <hi
                                rend="italic">undress</hi> manners. Now in England there is, and
                            always has been, a manly feeling, most widely diffused, of unwillingness
                            to see labours of a coarse order, or requiring muscular exertions,
                            thrown upon women. Pauperism, amongst other evil effects, has sometimes
                            locally disturbed this predominating sentiment of Englishmen; but never
                            at any time with such depth as to kill the root of the old hereditary
                            manliness. Sometimes at this day a gentleman, either from carelessness,
                            or from over-ruling force of convenience, or from real defect of
                            gallantry, will allow a female servant to carry his portmanteau for him;
                            though, after all, that spectacle is a rare one. And everywhere women of
                            all ages engage in the pleasant, nay elegant, labours of the hay field;
                            but in Great Britain women are never suffered to mow, which is a most
                            athletic and exhausting labour, nor to load a cart, nor to drive a
                            plough or hold it. In France, on the other hand, before the Revolution
                            (at which period the pseudo-homage, the lip-honour, was far more
                            ostentatiously professed towards the female sex than at present), a
                            Frenchman of credit, and vouching for his statement by the whole weight
                            of his name and personal responsibility (SI. Simond, now an American
                            citizen), records the following abominable scene as one of no uncommon
                            occurrence: A woman was in some provinces yoked side by side with an ass
                            to the plough or the harrow; and M. Simond protests that it excited no
                            horror to see the driver distributing his lashes impartially between the
                            woman and her brute yoke-fellow. So much for the wordy pomps of French
                            gallantry. In England, we trust, and we believe, that any man, caught in
                            such a situation, and in such an abuse of his power (supposing the case
                            Otherwise a possible one), would be killed on the spot.</p></note> such
                    as the English and the Gothic races in general; since, under the immunity which
                    their women enjoy from all servile labours of a coarse or out-of-doors order, by
                    as much lower as they descend in the scale of rank, by so much more do they
                    benefit under the force of contrast with the men of their own level. A young man
                    of that class, however noble in appearance, is somewhat degraded in the eyes of
                    women, by the necessity which his indigence imposes of working under a master;
                    but a beautiful young woman, in the very poorest family, unless she enters upon
                    a life of domestic servitude (in which case her labours are light, suited to her
                    sex, and withdrawn from the public eye), so long in fact as she stays under her
                    father’s roof, is as perfectly her own mistress and <hi rend="italic">sui
                        juris</hi> as the daughter of an earl. This personal dignity, brought into
                    stronger relief by the mercenary employments of her male connections, and the
                    feminine gentleness of her voice and manners, exhibited under the same
                    advantages of contrast, oftentimes combine to make a young cottage beauty as
                    fascinating an object as any woman of any station.</p>
                <p part="N">Hence we may in part account for the great event of Shakspeare’s early
                    manhood, his premature marriage. It has always been known, or at least
                    traditionally received for a fact, that Shakspeare had married whilst yet a boy;
                    and that his wife was unaccountably older than himself. In the very earliest
                    biographical sketch of the poet, compiled by Rowe, from materials collected by
                    Betterton the actor, it was stated (and that statement is now ascertained to
                    have been correct), that he had married Anne Hathaway, “the daughter of a
                    substantial yeoman.” Further than this nothing was known. But in September 1836
                    was published a very remarkable document, which gives the assurance of law to
                    the time and fact of this event, yet still, unless collated with another record,
                    does nothing to lessen the mystery which had previously surrounded its
                    circumstances. This document consists of two parts: the first, and principal,
                    according to the logic of the case, though second according to the arrangement,
                    being a <hi rend="italic">license</hi> for the marriage of William Shakspeare
                    with Anne Hathaway, under the condition “of <hi rend="italic">once</hi> asking
                    of the bannes of matrimony,” that is, in effect, dispensing with two out of the
                    three customary askings; the second or subordinate part of the document being a
                        <hi rend="italic">bond</hi> entered into by two sureties, viz. Fulke
                    Sandells and John Rychardson, both described as <hi rend="italic">agricoles</hi>
                    or yeomen, and both marksmen (that is, incapable of writing, and therefore
                    subscribing by means of <hi rend="italic">marks),</hi> for the payment of forty
                    pounds sterling, in the event of Shakspeare, yet a minor, and incapable of
                    binding himself, failing to fulfil the conditions of the license. In the bond,
                    drawn up in Latin, there is no mention of Shakspeare’s name; but in the license,
                    which is altogether English, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> name, of course, stands
                    foremost; and as it may gratify the reader to see the very words and orthography
                    of the original, we here extract the <hi rend="italic">operative</hi> part of
                    this document, prefacing only, that the license is attached by way of
                    explanation to the bond. “The condition of this obligation is suche, that if
                    herafter there shall not appere any lawfull lett or impediment, by reason of any
                    precontract, &amp;c., but that Willm. Shag-spere, one thone ptie” [on the one
                    party), “and Anne Hathwey of Stratford, in the diocess of Worcester, maiden, may
                    lawfully solemnize matrimony together; and in the<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=197" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0197-0179"
                    /> same afterwards remaine and continew like man and wiffe. And, moreover, if
                    the said Willm. Shagspere do not proceed to solemnization of mariadg with the
                    said Anne Hath-wey, without the consent of hir frinds ;—then the said
                    obligation” [viz. to pay forty pounds] “to be voyd and of none effect, or els to
                    stand &amp; abide in full force and vertue.”</p>
                <p part="N">What are we to think of this document? Trepidation and anxiety are
                    written upon its face. The parties are not to be married by a special license;
                    not even by an ordinary license; in that case no proclamation of banns, no
                    public asking at all, would have been requisite. Economical scruples are
                    consulted; and yet the regular movement of the marriage “through the
                        bell-ropes”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >Amongst people of humble rank in England, who only were ever asked in

                            the young couple elect were said jocosely to be “hanging in the

                            completion of the marriage.</p></note> is disturbed. Economy, which
                    retards the marriage, is here evidently in collision with some opposite
                    principle which precipitates it. How is all this to be explained? Much light is
                    afforded by the date when illustrated by another document. The bond bears date
                    on the 28th day of November in the 25th year of our lady the queen, that is, in
                    1582. Now the baptism of Shakspeare’s eldest child, Susanna, is registered on
                    the 26th of May in the year following. Suppose, therefore, that his marriage was
                    solemnized on the 1st day of December; it was barely possible that it could be
                    earlier, considering that the sureties, drinking, perhaps, at Worcester
                    throughout the 28th of November, would require the 29th, in so dreary a season,
                    for their return to Stratford; after which some preparation might be requisite
                    to the bride, since the marriage was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> celebrated at
                    Stratford. Next suppose the birth of Miss Susanna to have occurred, like her
                    father’s, two days before her baptism, viz. on the 24th of May. From December
                    the 1st to May the 24th, both days inclusively, are 175 days; which, divided by
                    seven, gives precisely twenty-five weeks, that is to say, six months short by
                    one week. Oh, fie, Miss Susanna, you came rather before you were wanted.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Campbpll’s comment upon the affair is, that “<hi rend="italic"
                        >if</hi> this was the case,” viz. if the baptism were really solemnized on
                    the 26th of May, “the poet’s first child would <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> to
                    have been born only six months and eleven days after the bond was entered into.”
                    And he then concludes that, on this assumption, “Miss Susanna Shakspeare came
                    into the world a little prematurely.” But this is to doubt where there never was
                    any ground for doubting; the baptism was <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> on the
                    26th of May; and, in the next place, the calculation of six months and eleven
                    days is sustained by substituting lunar months for calendar, and then only by
                    supposing the marriage to have been celebrated on the very day of subscribing
                    the bond in Worcester, and the baptism to have been coincident with the birth;
                    of which suppositions the latter is improbable, and the former, considering the
                    situation of Worcester, impossible.</p>
                <p part="N">Strange it is, that, whilst all biographers have worked with so much
                    zeal upon the most barren dates or most baseless traditions in the great poet’s
                    life, realising in a manner the chimeras of Laputa, and endeavouring “to extract
                    sunbeams from cucumbers,” such a story with regard to such an event, no fiction
                    of village scandal, hut involved in legal documents, a story so significant and
                    so eloquent to the intelligent, should formerly have been dismissed without
                    notice of any kind, and even now, after the discovery of 1836, with nothing
                    beyond a slight conjectural insinuation. For our parts, we should have been the
                    last amongst the biographers to unearth any forgotten scandal, or, after so vast
                    a lapse of time, and when the grave had shut out all but charitable thoughts, to
                    point any moral censures at a simple case of natural frailty, youthful
                    precipitancy of passion, of all trespasses the most venial, where the final
                    intentions are honourable. But in this case there seems to have been something
                    more in motion than passion or the ardour of youth. “I like not,” says Parson
                    Evans (alluding to Falstaff in masquerade), “I like not when a woman has a great
                    peard; I spy a great peard under her muffler.” Neither do we like the spectacle
                    of a mature young woman, five years past her majority, wearing the semblance of
                    having been led astray by a boy who had still two years and a half to run of his
                    minority. Shakspeare himself, looking back on this part of his youthful history
                    from his maturest years, breathes forth pathetic counsels against the errors
                    into which his own inexperience had been ensnared. The disparity of years
                    between himself and his wife he notices in a beautiful scene of the Twelfth
                    Night. The Duke Orsino, observing the sensibility which the pretended Cesario
                    had betrayed on hearing some touching old snatches of a love strain, swears that
                    his beardless page must have felt the passion of love, which the other admits.
                    Upon this the dialogue proceeds thus; <hi rend="italic">Duke.</hi> What kind of

                <p part="N">These counsels were uttered nearly twenty years after the event in his
                    own life to which they probably look back; for this play is supposed to have
                    been written in Shakspeare’s thirty-eighth year. And we may read an earnestness
                    in pressing the point as to the <hi rend="italic">inverted</hi> disparity of
                    years, which indicates pretty clearly an appeal to the lessons of his personal
                    experience. But his other indiscretion, in having yielded so far to passion and
                    opportunity as to crop by prelibation, and befbre they were hallowed, those
                    flowers of paradise which belonged to hie marriage-day; this he adverts to with
                    even more solemnity of sorrow, and with more pointed energy of moral reproof, in
                    the very last drama which is supposed to have proceeded from his pen, and
                    therefore with the force and sanctity of testamentary counsel. The Tempest is
                    all but ascertained to have been composed in 1611, that is, about five years
                    before the poet’s death; and indeed could not have been composed much earlier;
                    for the very incident which suggested the basis of the plot, and of the local
                    scene, viz. the shipwreck of Sir George Somers on the Bermudas (which were in
                    consequence denominated the Somers’ Islands), did not occur until the year 1609.
                    In the opening of the fourth act, Prospero formally betrothes his daughter to
                    Ferdinand; and in doing so he pays the prince a well-merited compliment of
                    having “worthily purchas’d” this rich jewel, by the patience with which, for her
                    sake, he had supported harsh usage, and other painful circumstances of his
                    trial. But, he adds solemnly,</p>

                <p part="N">The young prince assures him in reply, that no strength of opportunity,

                <p part="N">The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion Our worser genius

                    take any advantage of Miranda’s innocence. And he adds an argument for this
                    abstinence, by way of reminding Prospero, that not honour only, but even
                    prudential care of his own happiness, is interested in the observance of his
                    promise. Any unhallowed anticipation would, as he insinuates, take away</p>
                <p part="N">The edge of that day's celebration,</p>
                <p part="N">When I shall think, or Pboebus’ steeds are founder'd.</p>

                    seem to move too slowly. Even thus Prospero is not quite satisfied: during his
                    subsequent dialogue with Ariel, we are to suppose that Ferdinand, in conversing
                    apart with Miranda, betrays more impassioned ardour than the wise magician
                    altogether approves. The prince’s caresses have not been unobserved; and thus
                    Prospero renews his warning:</p>
                <p part="N">Look thou be true: do not give dalliance</p>
                <p part="N">Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw</p>
                <p part="N">To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,</p>
                <p part="N">Or else—good night your vow.</p>
                <p part="N">The royal lover re-assures him of his loyalty to his engagements; and
                    again the wise father, so honourably jealous for his daughter, professes himself
                    satisfied with the prince’s pledges.</p>
                <p part="N">Now in all these emphatic warnings, uttering the language “of that sad
                    wisdom folly leaves behind,” who can avoid reading, as in subtile hieroglyphics,
                    the secret record of Shakspeare’s own nuptial disappointments? We, indeed, that
                    is, universal posterity through every age, have reason to rejoice in these
                    disappointments; for to them, past all doubt, we are indebted for Shakspeare’s
                    subsequent migration to London, and his public occupation, which, giving him a
                    deep pecuniary interest in the productions of his pen, such as no other literary
                    application of his powers could have approached in that day, were eventually the
                    means of drawing forth those divine works which have survived their author for
                    our everlasting benefit.</p>
                <p part="N">Our own reading and deciphering of the whole case is as follows. The
                    Shakspeares were a handsome family, both father and sons. This we assume upon
                    the following grounds: First, on the presumption arising out of John
                    Shakspeare’s having won the favour of a young heiress higher in rank than
                    himself; secondly, on the presumption involved in the fact of three amongst his
                    four sons having gone upon the stage, to which the most obvious (and perhaps in
                    those days a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non)</hi> recommendation would be a good
                    person and a pleasing countenance; thirdly, on the direct evidence of Aubrey,
                    who assures us that William Shakspeare was a handsome and a well-shaped man;
                    fourthly, on the implicit evidence of the Stratford monument, which exhibits a
                    man of good figure and noble countenance; fifthly, on the confirmation of this
                    evidence by the Chandos portrait, which exhibits noble features, illustrated by
                    the utmost sweetness of expression; sixthly, on the selection of theatrical
                    parts, which it is known that Shakspeare personated, most of them being such as
                    required some dignity of form, viz. kings, the athletic (though aged) follower
                    of an athletic young man, and supernatural beings. On these grounds, direct or
                    circumstantial, we believe ourselves warranted in assuming that William
                    Shakspeare was a handsome and even noble-looking boy. Miss Anne Hathaway had
                    herself probably some personal attractions; and, if an indigent girl, who looked
                    for no pecuniary advantages, would probably have been early sought in marriage.
                    But as the daughter of “a substantial yeoman," who would expect some fortune in
                    his daughter’s suitors, she had, to speak coarsely, a little outlived her
                    market. Time she had none to lose. William Shakspeare pleased her eye; and the
                    gentleness of his nature made him an apt subject for female blandishments,
                    possibly for female arts. Without imputing, however, to this Anne Hathaway any
                    thing so hateful as a settled plot for ensnaring him, it was easy enough for a
                    mature woman, armed with such inevitable advantages of experience and of
                    self-possession, to draw onward a blushing novice; and, without directly
                    creating opportunities, to place him in the way of turning to account such as
                    naturally offered. Young boys are generally flattered by the condescending
                    notice of grown-up women; and perhaps Shakspeare’s own lines upon a similar
                    situation, to a young boy adorned with the same natural gifts as himself, may
                    give us the key to the result:</p>
                <p part="N">Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won;</p>
                <p part="N">Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;</p>
                <p part="N">And, when a woman woos, what woman's son Will sourly leave her till he
                    have prevail'd?</p>
                <p part="N">Once, indeed, entangled in such a pursuit, any person of manly feelings
                    would be sensible that he had no retreat: <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would
                    be—to insult a woman, grievously to wound her sexual pride, and to insure her
                    lasting scorn and hatred. These were consequences which the gentle-minded
                    Shakspeare could not face: he pursued his good fortunes, half perhaps in
                    heedlessness, half in desperation, until he was roused by the clamorous
                    displeasure of her family upon first discovering the situation of their
                    kinswoman. For such a situation there could be but one atonement, and that was
                    hurried forward by both parties; whilst, out of delicacy towards the bride, the
                    wedding was not celebrated in Stratford (where the register contains no notice
                    of such an event); nor, as Malone imagined, in Weston-upon-Avon, that being in
                    the diocese of Gloucester; but in some parish, as yet undiscovered, in the
                    diocese of Worcester.</p>
                <p part="N">But now arose a serious question as to the future maintenance of the
                    young people. John Shakspeare was depressed in his circumstances, and he had
                    other children besides William, viz. three sons and a daughter. The elder lives
                    have represented him as burdened with ten; but this was an error, arising out of
                    the confusion between John Shakspeare the glover and John Shakspeare a
                    shoemaker. This error has been thus far of use, that, by exposing the fact of
                    two John Shakspeares (not kinsmen) residing in Stratford-upon-Avon, it has
                    satisfactorily proved the name to be amongst those which are locally indigenous
                    to Warwickshire. Meantime it is now ascertained that John Shakspeare the glover
                    had only eight children, viz. four daughters and four sons. The order of their
                    succession was this: Joan, Margaret, WILLIAM, Gilbert, a second Joan, Anne,
                    Richard, and Edmund. Three of the daughters, viz. the two eldest of the family,
                    Joan and Margaret, together with Anne, died in childhood: all the rest attained
                    mature ages, and of these William was the eldest. This might give him some
                    advantage in his father’s regard; but in a question of pecuniary provision
                    precedency amongst the children of an insolvent is nearly nominal. For the
                    present John Shakspeare could do little tor his son; and, under these
                    circumstances, perhaps the father of Anne Hathaway would come forward to assist
                    the new-married couple. This condition<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=199" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0199-0181"
                    /> of dependency would furnish matter for painful feelings and irritating words:
                    the youthful husband, whose mind would be expanding as rapidly as the leaves and
                    blossoms of spring-time in polar latitudes, would soon come to appreciate the
                    sort of wiles by which he had been caught. The female mind is quick, and almost
                    gifted with the power of witchcraft, to decipher what is passing in the thoughts
                    of familiar companions. Silent and forbearing as William Shakspeare might be,
                    Anne, his staid wife, would read his secret reproaches; ill would she dissemble
                    her wrath, and the less so from the consciousness of having deserved them. It is
                    no uncommon case for women to feel anger in connection with one subject, and to
                    express it in connection with another; which other, perhaps (except as a
                    serviceable mask), would have been a matter of indifference to their feelings.
                    Anne would therefore reply to those inevitable reproaches which her own sense
                    must presume to be lurking in her husband’s heart, by others equally stinging,
                    on his inability to support his family, and on his obligations to her father’s
                    purse. Shakspeare, »e may be sure, would be ruminating every hour on the means
                    of his deliverance from so painful a dependency; and at length, after four
                    years’ conjugal discord, he would resolve upon that plan of solitary emigration
                    to the metropolis, which, at the same time that it released him from the
                    humiliation of domestic feuds, succeeded so splendidly for his worldly
                    prosperity, and with a train of consequences so vast for all future ages.</p>
                <p part="N">Such, we are persuaded, was the real course of Shakspeare’s transition
                    from school-boy pursuits to his public career: and upon the known temperament of
                    Shakspeare, his genial disposition to enjoy life without, disturbing his
                    enjoyment by fretting anxieties, we build the conclusion, that had his friends
                    furnished him with ampler funds, and had his marriage been well assorted or
                    happy, we—the world of posterity—should have lost the whole benefit and delight
                    which we have since reaped from his matchless faculties. The motives which drove
                    him <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Stratford are clear enough; but what motives
                    determined his course <hi rend="italic">to</hi> London, and especially to the
                    stage, still remains to be explained. Stratford-upon-Avon, lying in the high
                    rood from London through Oxford to Birmingham (or more generally to the north),
                    had been continually visited by some of the best comedians during Shakspeare’s
                    childhood. One or two of the most respectable metropolitan actors were natives
                    of Stratford. These would be well known to the elder Shakspeare. But, apart from
                    that accident, it is notorious that mere legal necessity and usage would compel
                    all companies of actors, upon coming into any town, to seek, in the first place,
                    from the chief magistrate, a license for opening a theatre, and next, over and
                    above this public sanction, to seek his personal favour and patronage. As an
                    alderman, therefore, but still more whilst clothed with the official powers of
                    chief magistrate, the poet’s father would have opportunities of doing essential
                    services to many persons connected with the London stage. The conversation of
                    comedians acquainted with books, fresh from the keen and sparkling circles of
                    the metropolis, and filled with racy anecdotes of the court, as well as of
                    public life generally, could not but have been fascinating, by comparison with
                    the stagnant society of Stratford. Hospitalities on a liberal scale would be
                    offered to these men: not impossibly this fact might be one principal key to
                    those dilapidations which the family estate had suffered. These actors, on <hi
                        rend="italic">their</hi> part, would retain a grateful sense of the kindness
                    they had received, and would seek to repay it to John Shakspeare, now that he
                    was depressed in his fortunes, as opportunities might offer. His eldest son,
                    growing up a handsome young man, and beyond all doubt from his earliest days of
                    most splendid colloquial powers (for assuredly of <hi rend="italic">him</hi> it
                    may be taken for granted, Nec licuit populis parvum te, Nile, videre), would be
                    often reproached in a friendly way for burying himself in a country life. These
                    overtures, prompted alike by gratitude to the father, and a real selfish
                    interest in the talents of the son, would at length take a definite shape; and,
                    upon some clear understanding as to the terms of such an arrangement, William
                    Shakspeare would at length (about 1586, according to the received account, that
                    is, in the fifth year of his married life, and the twenty-third or twenty-fourth
                    of his age), unaccompanied by wife or children, translate himself to London.
                    Later than 1586 it could not well be; for already in 1589 it has been recently
                    ascertained that he held a share in the property of a leading theatre.</p>
                <p part="N">We must here stop to notice, and the reader will allow us to notice with
                    summary indignation, the slanderous and idle tale which represents Shakspeare as
                    having fled to London in the character of a criminal, from the persecutions of
                    Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecot. This tale has long been propagated under two
                    separate impulses: chiefly, perhaps, under the vulgar love of pointed and
                    glaring contrasts; the splendour of the man was in this instance brought into a
                    sort of epigrammatic antithesis with the humility of his fortunes; secondly,
                    under a baser impulse, the malicious pleasure of seeing a great man degraded.
                    Accordingly, as in the case of Milton,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">In a little memoir of Milton, which the author

                            there cannot be a doubt that Milton alluded to the dry scholastic
                            disputations, which were shocking and odious to his fine poetical
                            genius. If, therefore, the vile story is still to be kept up in order to
                            dishonour a great man, at any rate let it not in future be pretended
                            that any countenance to such a slander can be drawn from the confessions
                            of the poet himself.</p></note> it has been affirmed that Shakspeare had
                    suffered corporal chastisement, in fact (we abhor to utter such words), that he
                    had been judicially whipped. Now, first of all, let us mark the inconsistency of
                    this tale: the poet was whipped, that is, he was punished most
                    disproportionately, and yet he fled to avoid punishment. Next, we are informed
                    that his offence was deer-stealing, and from the park of Sir Thomas Lucy. And it
                    has been well ascertained that Sir Thomas had no deer, and had no park.
                    Moreover, deer-stealing was regarded by our ancestors exactly as poaching is
                    regarded by us. Deer ran wild in all the great forests; and no offence was
                    looked upon as so venial, none so compatible with a noble Robin-Hood style of
                    character, as this very trespass upon what were regarded as <hi rend="italic"
                        >ferae natures,</hi> and not at all as domestic property. But had it been
                    otherwise, a trespass was not punishable with whipping; nor had Sir Thomas Lucy
                    the power to irritate a whole community like Stratford-upon-Avon, by branding
                    with permanent disgrace a young man so closely connected with three at least of
                    the best families in the neighbourhood. Besides, had Shakspeare suffered any
                    dishonour of that kind, the scandal would infallibly have pursued him at his
                    very heels to Lon-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=200"

                    record, in a posthumous work of 1592, his malicious feelings towards Shakspeare,
                    could not have failed to notice it. For, be it remembered, that a judicial
                    flagellation contains a twofold ignominy: flagellation is ignominious in its own
                    nature, even though unjustly inflicted, and by a ruffian; secondly, any judicial
                    punishment is ignominious, even though not wearing a shade of personal
                    degradation. Now a judicial flagellation includes both features of dishonour.
                    And is it to be imagined that an enemy, searching with the diligence of malice
                    for matter against Shakspeare, should have failed, six years after the event, to
                    hear of that very memorable disgrace which had exiled him from Stratford, and
                    was the very occasion of his first resorting to London; or that a leading
                    company of players in the metropolis, <hi rend="italic">one of whom,</hi> and a
                    chief one, <hi rend="italic">was his own townsman,</hi> should cheerfully adopt
                    into their society, as an honoured partner, a young man yet flagrant from the
                    lash of the executioner or the beadle?</p>
                <p part="N">This tale is fabulous, and rotten to its core; yet even this does less
                    dishonour to Shakspeare’s memory than the sequel attached to it. A sort of
                    scurrilous rondeau, consisting of nine lines, so loathsome in its brutal
                    stupidity, and so vulgar in its expression, that we shall not pollute our pages
                    by transcribing it, has been imputed to Shakspeare ever since the days of the
                    credulous Rowe. The total point of this idiot’s drivel consists in calling Sir
                    Thomas “an asse and well it justifies the poet’s own remark, “Let there be gall
                    enough in thy ink, no matter though thou write with a goose pen.” Our own belief
                    is, that these lines were a production of Charles II.’s reign, and applied to a
                    Sir Thomas Lucy, not very far removed, if at all, from the age of him who first
                    picked up the precious filth: the phrase “parliament <hi rend="italic"
                        >member!'</hi> we believe to be quite unknown in the colloquial use of Queen
                    Elizabeth’s reign.</p>
                <p part="N">But, that we may rid ourselves once and for ever of this outrageous
                    calumny upon Shakspeare’s memory, we shall pursue the story to its final stage.
                    Even Malone has been thoughtless enough to accredit this closing chapter, which
                    contains, in fact, such a superfetation of folly as the annals of human dulness
                    do not exceed. Let us recapitulate the points of the story. A baronet, who has
                    no deer and no park, is supposed to persecute a poet for stealing these aerial
                    deer out of this aerial park, both lying in <hi rend="italic"
                        >nephelοcoccygia.</hi> The poet sleeps upon this wrong for eighteen years;
                    but at length, hearing that his persecutor is dead and buried, he conceives
                    bloody thoughts of revenge. And this revenge he purposes to execute by picking a
                    hole in his dead enemy’s coat-of-arms. Is this coat-of-arms, then, Sir Thomas
                    Lucy’s? Why, no: Malone admits that it is not. For the poet, suddenly
                    recollecting that this ridicule would settle upon the son of his enemy, selects
                    another coat-of-arras, with which his dead enemy never had any connection, and
                    he spends his thunder and lightning upon this irrelevant object; and, after all,
                    the ridicule itself lies in a Welchman's mispronouncing one single heraldic
                    term—a Welchman who mispronounces all words. The last act of the poet’s malice
                    recalls to us a sort of jest-book story of an Irishman, the vulgarity of which
                    the reader will pardon in consideration of its relevancy. The Irishman having
                    lost a pair of silk stockings, mentions to a friend that he has taken steps for
                    recovering them by an advertisement, offering a reward to the finder. His friend
                    objects that the costs of advertising, and the reward, would eat out the full
                    value of the silk stockings. But to this the Irishman replies, with a knowing
                    air, that he is not so green as to have overlooked <hi rend="italic">that;</hi>
                    and that, to keep down the reward, he had advertised the stockings as worsted.
                    Not at all less flagrant is the bull ascribed to Shakspeare, when he is made to
                    punish a dead man by personalities meant for his exclusive ear, through his
                    coat-of-arms, but at the same time, with the express purpose of blunting and
                    defeating the edge of his own scurrility, is made to substitute for the real
                    arms some others which had no more relation to the dead enemy than they had to
                    the poet himself. This is the very sublime of folly, beyond which human dotage
                    cannot advance.</p>
                <p part="N">It is painful, indeed, and dishonourable to human nature, that whenever
                    men of vulgar habits and of poor education wish to impress us with a feeling of
                    respect for a man’s talents, they are sure to cite, by way of evidence, some
                    gross instance of malignity. Power, in their minds, is best illustrated by
                    malice or by the infliction of pain. To this unwelcome fact we have some
                    evidence in the wretched tale which we have just dismissed; and there is another
                    of the same description to be found in all lives of Shakspeare, which we will
                    expose to the contempt of the reader whilst we are in this field of discussion,
                    that we may not afterwards have to resume so disgusting a subject.</p>
                <p part="N">This poet, who was a model of gracious benignity in his manners, and of
                    whom, amidst our general ignorance, thus much is perfectly established, that the
                    term <hi rend="italic">gentle</hi> was almost as generally and by prescriptive
                    right associated with his name as the affix of <hi rend="italic">venerable</hi>
                    with Bede, or <hi rend="italic">judicious</hi> with Hooker, is alleged to have
                    insulted a friend by an imaginary epitaph beginning “<hi rend="italic">Ten in
                        the Hundred,”</hi> and supposing him to be damned, yet without wit enough
                    (which surely the Stratford bellman could have furnished) for devising any, even
                    fanciful, reason for such a supposition; upon which the comment of some foolish
                    critic is, “The <hi rend="italic">sharpness of the satire</hi> is said to have
                    stung the man so much that he never forgave it.” We have heard of the sting in
                    the tail atoning for the brainless head; but in this doggerel the tail is surely
                    as stingless as the head is brainless. For, 1 <hi rend="italic">st</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italic">Ten in the Hundred</hi> could be no reproach in Shakspeare’s
                    time, any more than to call a man <hi rend="italic"
                        >Three-and-α-half-per-cent.</hi> in this present year 1838; except, indeed,
                    amongst those foolish persons who built their morality upon the Jewish
                    ceremonial law. Shakspeare himself took ten per cent. <hi rend="italic"
                        >2dly,</hi> It happens that John Combe, so far from being the object of the
                    poet’s scurrility, or viewing the poet as an object of implacable resentment,
                    was a Stratford friend; that one of his family was affectionately remembered in
                    Shakspeare’s will by the bequest of his sword; and that John Combe himself
                    recorded his perfect charity with Shakspeare by leaving him a legacy of L.5
                    sterling. And in this lies the key to the whole story. For, <hi rend="italic"
                        >idly,</hi> the four lines were written and printed before Shakspeare was
                    born. The name Combe is a common one; and some stupid fellow, who had seen the
                    name in Shakspeare’s will, and happened also to have seen the lines in a
                    collection of epigrams, chose to connect the cases by attributing an identity to
                    the two John Combes, though at war with chronology.</p>
                <p part="N">Finally, there is another specimen of doggerel attributed to Shakspeare,
                    which is not equally unworthy of him, because not equally malignant, but
                    otherwise equally below his intellect, no less than his scholarship; we mean the
                    inscription on his grave-stone. This, as a sort of <hi rend="italic">siste
                        viator</hi> appeal to future sextons, is worthy of the grave-digger or the
                    parish-clerk, who was probably its author. Or it may have been an antique
                    formula, like the vulgar record of ownership in books—</p>
                <p part="N">Anthony Timothy Dolthead’s bock,</p>
                <p part="N">God give him grace therein to look.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus far the matter is of little importance; and it might have been
                    supposed that malignity itself could hardly have imputed such trash to
                    Shakspeare. But when we find, even in this short compass, scarcely wider than
                    the posy of a ring, room found for traducing the poet’s memory, it becomes
                    important to say, that the leading sentiment, the<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=201" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0201-0183"
                    /> horror expressed at any disturbance offered to his bones, is not one to which
                    Shakspeare could have attached the slightest weight; far less could have
                    outraged the sanctities of place and subject, by affixing to any sentiment
                    whatever (and, according to the fiction of the case, his farewell sentiment) the
                    sanction of a curse.</p>
                <p part="N">Filial veneration and piety towards the memory of this great man have
                    led us into a digression that might have been unseasonable in any cause less
                    weighty than one having for its object to deliver his honoured name from a load
                    of the most brutal malignity. Never more, we hope and venture to believe, will
                    any thoughtless biographer impute to Shakspeare the asinine doggerel with which
                    the uncritical blundering of his earliest biographer has caused his name to be
                    dishonoured. We now resume the thread of our biography. The stream of history is
                    centuries in working itself clear of any calumny with which it has once been
                    polluted.</p>
                <p part="N">Most readers will be aware of an old story, according to which
                    Shakspeare gained his livelihood for some time after coming to London by holding
                    the horses of those who rode to the play. This legend is as idle as any one of
                    those which we have just exposed. No custom ever existed of riding on horseback
                    to the play. Gentlemen, who rode valuable horses, would assuredly not expose
                    them systematically to the injury of standing exposed to cold for two or even
                    four hours; and persons of inferior rank would not ride on horseback in the
                    town. Besides, had such a custom ever existed, stables (or sheds at least) would
                    soon have arisen to meet the public wants; and in some of the dramatic sketches
                    of the day, which noticed every fashion as it arose, this would not have been
                    overlooked. The story is traced originally to Sir William Davenant. Betterton
                    the actor, who professed to have received it from him, passed it onwards to
                    Rowe, he to Pope, Pope to Bishop Newton the editor of Milton, and Newton to Dr
                    Johnson. This pedigree of the fable, however, adds nothing to its credit, and
                    multiplies the chances of some mistake. Another fable, not much less absurd,
                    represents Shakspeare as having from the very first been borne upon the
                    establishment of the theatre, and so far contradicts the other fable, but
                    originally in the very humble character of <hi rend="italic">call-boy</hi> or
                    deputy prompter, whose business it was to summon each performer according to his
                    order of coming upon the stage. This story, however, quite as much as the other,
                    is irreconcileable with the discovery recently made by Mr Collier, that in 1589
                    Shakspeare was a shareholder in the important property of a principal London
                    theatre. It seems destined that all the undoubted facts of Shakspeare’s life
                    should come to us through the channel of legal documents, which are better
                    evidence even than imperial medals; whilst, on the other hand, all the fabulous
                    anecdotes, not having an attorney’s seal to them, seem to have been the fictions
                    of the wonder-maker. The plain presumption from the record of Shakspeare’s
                    situation in 1589, coupled with the fact that his first arrival in London was
                    possibly not until 1587, but according to the earliest account not before 1586,
                    a space of time which leaves but little room for any remarkable changes of
                    situation, seems to be, that, either in requital of services done to the players
                    by the poet’s family, or in consideration of money advanced by his
                    father-in-law, or on account of Shakspeare’s personal accomplishments as an
                    actor, and as an adapter of dramatic works to the stage; for one of these
                    reasons, or for all of them united, William Shakspeare, about the 23d year of
                    his age, was adopted into the partnership of a respectable his trionic company,
                    possessing a first-rate theatre in the metropolis. If 1586 were the year in
                    which he came up to London, it seems probable enough that his immediate motive
                    to that step was the increasing distress of his father; for in that year John
                    Shakspeare resigned the office of alderman. There is, however, a bare
                    possibility that Shakspeare might have gone to London about the time when he
                    completed his twenty-first year, that is, in the spring of 1585, but not
                    earlier. Nearly two years after the birth of his eldest daughter Susanna, his
                    wife lay in for a second and a <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time; but she then
                    brought her husband twins, a son and a daughter. These children were baptized in
                    February of the year 1585; so that Shakspeare’s whole family of three children

                    were bap-tizcd by the names of Hamnet and Judith, those being the names of two
                    amongst their sponsors, viz. Mr Sadler and his wife. Hamnet, which is a
                    remarkable name in itself, becomes still more so from its resemblance to the

                            actually mis-spells the name of his friend Sadler, and calls him Hamlet.

                    fourteen years older than himself. Shakspeare’s son must then have been most
                    interesting to his heart, both as a twin child and as his only boy. He died in
                    1596, when he was about eleven years old. Both daughters survived their father;
                    both married; both left issue, and thus gave a chance for continuing the
                    succession from the great poet. But all the four grandchildren died without
                    offspring.</p>
                <p part="N">Of Shakspeare personally, at least of Shakspeare the man, as
                    distinguished from the author, there remains little more to record. Already in
                    1592, Greene, in his posthumous Groat's-worth of Wit, had expressed the earliest
                    vocation of Shakspeare in the following sentence:—“There is an upstart crow,
                    beautified with our feathers; in his own conceit the only <hi rend="italic"
                        >Shakscene</hi> in a country !” This alludes to Shakspeare’s office of
                    re-casting, and even re-composing, dramatic works, so as to fit them for
                    representation; and Master Greene, it is probable, had suffered in his
                    self-estimation, or in his purse, by the alterations in some piece of his own
                    which the duty of Shakspeare to the general interests of the theatre had obliged
                    him to make. In 1591 it has been supposed that Shakspeare wrote his first drama,
                    the Two Gentlemen of Verona; the least characteristically marked of all his
                    plays, and, with the exception of Love’s Labour’s Lost, the least
                    interesting.</p>
                <p part="N">From this year, 1591 to that of 1611, are just twenty years, within
                    which space lie the whole dramatic creations of Shakspeare, averaging nearly one
                    for every six months. In 1611 was written the Tempest, which is supposed to have
                    been the last of all Shakspeare’s works. Even on that account, as Mr Campbell
                    feelingly observes, it has “a sort of sacredness ;” and it is a most remarkable
                    fact, and one calculated to make a man superstitious, that in this play the
                    great enchanter Prospero, in whom, “<hi rend="italic">as if conscious,”</hi>
                    says Mr Campbell, “<hi rend="italic">that this would be his last work,</hi> the
                    poet has been <hi rend="italic">inspired to typify himself as a</hi> wise,

                    Shakspeare himself, it may be said, that “within that circle” (the circle of his
                    own art) “none durst tread but he,” solemnly and for ever renounces his
                    mysterious functions, symbolically breaks his enchanter’s wand, and declares
                    that he will bury his books, his science, and his secrets</p>

                    /> voice of Prospero, issues that magnificent prophecy of the total destruction
                    which should one day swallow up</p>
                <p part="N">The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</p>
                <p part="N">Yea all which it inherit.</p>
                <p part="N">And this prophecy is followed immediately by a most profound
                    ejaculation, gathering into one pathetic abstraction the total philosophy of
                    life:</p>
                <p part="N">We are such stuff</p>
                <p part="N">As dreams are mode of; and our little life Is rounded by a sleep; that
                    is, in effect, our life is a little tract of feverish vigils, surrounded and
                    islanded by a shoreless ocean of sleep— sleep before birth, sleep after
                    death.</p>
                <p part="N">These remarkable passages were probably not undesigned; but if we
                    suppose them to have been thrown off without conscious notice of their
                    tendencies, then, according to the superstition of the ancient Grecians, they
                    would have been regarded as prefiguring words, prompted by the secret genius
                    that accompanies every man, such as insure along with them their own
                    accomplishment. With or without intention, however, it is believed that
                    Shakspeare wrote nothing more after this exquisite romantic drama. with respect
                    to the remainder of his personal history, Dr Drake and others have supposed,
                    that during the twenty years from 1591 to 1611, he visited Stratford often, and
                    latterly once a year.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1589 he had possessed some share in a theatre; in 1596 he had a
                    considerable share. Through Lord Southampton, as a surviving friend of Lord
                    Essex, who was viewed as the martyr to his Scottish politics, there can be no
                    doubt that Shakspeare had acquired the favour of James I.; and accordingly, on
                    the 29th of May 1603, about two months after the king’s accession to the throne
                    of England, a patent was granted to the company of players who possessed the
                    Globe theatre; in which patent Shakspeare’s name stands second. This patent
                    raised the company to the rank of his majesty’s servants, whereas previously
                    they arc supposed to have been simply the servants of the Lord Chamberlain.
                    Perhaps it was in grateful acknowledgment of this royal favour that Shakspeare
                    afterwards, in 1606, paid that sublime compliment to the house of Stuart which
                    is involved in the vision shown to Macbeth. This vision is managed with
                    exquisite skill: it was impossible to display the whole series of princes from
                    Macbeth to James I.; but he beholds the posterity of Banquo, one “gold-bound
                    brow” succeeding to another, until he comes to an eighth apparition of a
                    Scottish king,</p>

                <p part="N">Which shows him many more; and some he sees Who <hi rend="italic"
                        >twofold</hi> balls and <hi rend="italic">treble</hi> sceptres carry; thus
                    bringing down without tedium the long succession to the very person of James I.
                    by the symbolic image of the two crowns united on one head.</p>
                <p part="N">About the beginning of the century Shakspeare had become rich enough to
                    purchase the best house in Stratford, called <hi rend="italic">The Great
                        House,</hi> which name he altered to <hi rend="italic">New Place;</hi> and
                    in 1602 he bought 107 acres adjacent to this house for a sum (L.320)
                    corresponding to about 1500 guineas of modern money. Malone thinks that he
                    purchased the house as early as 1597; and it is certain that about that time he
                    was able to assist his father in obtaining a renewed grant of arms from the
                    Heralds’ College, and therefore, of course, to re-establish his father’s
                    fortunes. Ten years of well-directed industry, viz. from 1591 to 1601, and the
                    prosperity of the theatre in which he was a proprietor, had raised him to
                    affluence; and after another ten years, improved with the same success, he was
                    able to retire with an income of L.300, or (according to the customary
                    computations) in modem money of L.1500, per annum. Shakspeare was in fact the
                    first man of letters, Pope the second, and Sir Walter Scott the third, who, in
                    Great Britain, has ever realized a large fortune by literature; or in
                    Christendom, if we except Voltaire, and two dubious cases in Italy. The four or
                    five latter years of his life Shakspeare passed in dignified ease, in profound
                    meditation, we may be sure, and in universal respect, at his native town of
                    Stratford; and there he died, on the 23d of April 1616.<note anchored="true"

                    most witty saying with respect to a piratical and knavish publisher, who made a
                    trade of insulting the memories of deceased authors by forged writings, that he
                    was “among the new terrors of death.” But in the gravest sense it may be
                    affirmed of Shakspeare, that he is among the modern luxuries of life; that life,
                    in fact, is a new thing, and one more to be coveted, since Shakspeare has
                    extended the domains of human consciousness, and pushed its dark frontiers into
                    regions not so much as dimly descried or even suspected before his timc, far
                    less illuminated (as now they are) by beauty and tropical luxuriance of life.
                    For instance,—a single instance, indeed one which in itself is a world of new
                    revelation,—the possible beauty of the female character had not been seen as in
                    a dream before Shakspeare called into perfect life the radiant shapes of
                    Desdemona, of Imogene, of Hermione, of Perdita, of Ophelia, of Miranda, and many
                    others. The Una of Spenser, earlier by ten or fifteen years than most of these,
                    was an idealized portrait of female innocence and virgin purity, but too shadowy
                    and unreal for a dramatic reality. And as to the Grecian classics, let not the
                    reader imagine for an instant that any prototype in this field of Shakspearian
                    power can be looked for there. The <hi rend="italic">Antigone</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Electra</hi> of the tragic poets are the two leading female
                    characters that classical antiquity offers to our respect, but assuredly not to
                    our impassioned love, as disciplined and exalted in the school of Shakspeare.
                    They challenge our admiration, severe, and even stern, as impersonations of
                    filial duty, cleaving to the steps of a desolate and afflicted old man; or of
                    sisterly affection, maintaining the rights of a brother under circumstances of
                    peril, of desertion, and consequently of perfect self-reliance. lphigenia,
                    again, though not dramatically coming before us in her own person, but according
                    to the beautiful report of a spectator, presents us with a fine statuesque model
                    of heroic fortitude, and of one whose young heart, even in the very agonies of
                    her cruel immolation, refused to forget, by a single indecorous gesture, or so
                    much as a moment’s neglect of her own princely descent, and that she herself was
                    “a lady in the land.” These are fine marble groups, but they are not the warm
                    breathing realities of Shakspeare; there is “no speculation” in their cold
                    marble eyes; the breath of life is not in their nostrils; the fine pulses of
                    womanly sensibilities are not throbbing in their bosoms. And besides this
                    immeasurable difference between the cold moony reflexes of life, as exhibited by
                    the power of Grecian art, and the true sunny life of Shakspeare, it must be
                    observed that the Antigones, &amp;c. of the antique put forward but one single
                    trait of character, like the aloe with its single blossom: this solitary feature
                    is presented to us as an abstraction, and as an insulated quality; whereas in
                    Shakspeare all is presented in the <hi rend="italic">concrete;</hi> that is to
                    say, not brought forward in relief, as by some effort of an anatomical artist;
                    but embodied and imbedded, so to speak, as by the force of a creative nature, in
                    the complex system of a human life; a life in which all the elements move and
                    play simultaneously, and with something more than mere simultaneity or
                    co-existence, acting and re-acting each upon the other, nay, even acting by each
                    other and through each other. In Shakspeare’s characters is felt for ever a real
                        <hi rend="italic">organic</hi> life, where each is for the whole and in the
                    whole, and where the whole is for each and in each. They only are real
                    incarnations.</p>

                    life, and shocking the feelings of the audience. The drama with the Greeks, as
                    with us, though much less than with us, was a picture of human life; and that
                    which could not occur in life could not wisely be exhibited on the stage. Now,
                    in ancient Greece, women were secluded from the society of men. The conventual

                    Mahommedan consecration of its threshold against the ingress of males, had been
                    transplanted from Asia into Greece thousands of years perhaps before either
                    convents or Mahommed existed. Thus barred from all open social intercourse,
                    women could not develope or express any character by word or action. Even to <hi
                        rend="italic">have</hi> a character, violated, to a Grecian mind, the ideal
                    portrait of feminine excellence; whence, perhaps, partly the too generic, too
                    little individualized, style of Grecian beauty. But prominently to <hi
                        rend="italic">express</hi> a character was impossible under the common tenor
                    of Grecian life, unless when high tragical catastrophes transcended the decorums
                    of that tenor, or for a brief interval raised the curtain which veiled it. Hence
                    the subordinate part which women play upon the Greek stage in all but some half
                    dozen cases. In the paramount tragedy on that stage, the model tragedy, the <hi
                        rend="italic">OEdipus Tgrannus</hi> of Sophocles, there is virtually no
                    woman at all; for Jocasta is a party to the story merely as the dead Laius or
                    the self-murdered Sphinx was a party, viz. by her contributions to the
                    fatalities of the event, not by any thing she does or says spontaneously. In

                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0204-0186"/> Greek poet, if a wise poet, could not address
                    himself genially to a task in which he must begin by shocking the sensibilities
                    of his countrymen. And hence followed, not only the dearth of female characters
                    in the Grecian drama, but also a second result still more favourable to the
                    sense of a new power evolved by Shakspeare. Whenever the common law of Grecian
                    life did give way, it was, as we have observed, to the suspending force of some
                    great convulsion or tragical catastrophe. This for a moment (like an earthquake
                    in a nunnery) would set at liberty even the timid, fluttering Grecian women,
                    those doves of the dove-cot, and would call some of them into action. But which?
                    Precisely those of energetic and masculine minds; the timid and feminine would
                    but shrink the more from public gaze and from tumult. Thus it happened, that
                    such female characters as <hi rend="italic">were</hi> exhibited in Greece, could
                    not but be the harsh and the severe. If a gentle Ismene appeared for a moment in
                    contest with some energetic sister Antigone (and chiefly, perhaps, by way of
                    drawing out the fiercer character of that sister), she was soon dismissed as
                    unfit for scenical effect. So that not only were female characters few, but,
                    moreover, of these few the majority were but repetitions of masculine qualities
                    in female persons. Female agency being seldom summoned on the stage except when
                    it had received a sort of special dispensation from its sexual character, by
                    some terrific convulsions of the house or the city, naturally it assumed the
                    style of action suited to these circumstances. And hence it arose, that not
                    woman as she differed from man, but woman as she resembled man—woman, in short,
                    seen under circumstances so dreadful as to abolish the effect of sexual
                    distinction, was the woman of the Greek tragedy.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">And hence, by parity of reason,
                            under the opposite circumstances, under the circumstances which, instead
                            of abolishing, most emphatically drew forth the sexual distinctions,
                            viz. in the <hi rend="italic">comic</hi> aspects of social intercourse,
                            the reason that we see no women on the Greek stage; the Greek comedy,
                            unless when it affects the extravagant fun of farce, rejects
                        women.</p></note> And hence generally arose for Shakspeare the w ider field,
                    and the more astonishing by its perfect novelty, when he first introduced female
                    characters, not as mere varieties or echoes of masculine characters, a Medea or
                    Clytemnestra, or a vindictive Hecuba, the mere tigress of the tragic tiger, but
                    female characters that had the appropriate beauty of female nature; woman no
                    longer grand, terrific, and repulsive, but woman “after her kind”—the other
                    hemisphere of the dramatic world; woman running through the vast gamut of
                    womanly loveliness; woman as emancipated, exalted, ennobled, under a new law of
                    Christian morality; woman the sister and co-equal of man, no longer his slave,
                    his prisoner, and sometimes his rebel. “It is a far cry to Loch Awe and from the
                    Athenian stage to the stage of Shakspeare, it may be said, is a prodigious
                    interval. True; but prodigious as it is, there is really nothing between them.
                    The Roman stage, at least the tragic stage, as is well known, was put out, as by
                    an extinguisher, by the cruel amphitheatre, just as a candle is made pale and
                    ridiculous by daylight. Those who were fresh from the real murders of the bloody
                    amphitheatre regarded with contempt the mimic murders of the stage. Stimulation
                    too coarse and' too intense had its usual effect in making the sensibilities
                    callous. Christian emperors arose at length, who abolished the amphitheatre in
                    its bloodier features. But by that time the genius of the tragic muse had long
                    slept the sleep of death. And that muse had no resurrection until the age of
                    Shakspeare. So that, notwithstanding a gulf of nineteen centuries and upwards
                    separates Shakspeare from Euripides, the last of the surviving Greek tragedians,
                    the one is still the nearest successor of the other, just as Connaught and the
                    islands in Clew Bay are next neighbours to America, although three thousand
                    watery columns, each of a cubic mile in dimensions, divide them from each
                    other.</p>
                <p part="N">A second reason, which lends an emphasis of novelty and effective power
                    to Shakspeare’s female world, is a peculiar fact of contrast which exists
                    between that and his corresponding world of men. Let us explain. The purpose and
                    the intention of the Grecian stage was not primarily to develope human <hi
                        rend="italic">character,</hi> whether in men or in women; human <hi
                        rend="italic">fates</hi> were its object; great tragic situations under the
                    mighty control of a vast cloudy destiny, dimly descried at intervals, and
                    brooding over human life by mysterious agencies, and for mysterious ends. Man,
                    no longer the representative of an august <hi rend="italic">will,</hi> man the
                    passion-puppet of fate, could not with any effect display what we call a
                    character, which is a distinction between man and man, emanating originally from
                    the will, and expressing its determinations, moving under the large variety of
                    human impulses. The will is the central pivot of character; and this was
                    obliterated, thwarted, cancelled, by the dark fatalism which brooded over the
                    Grecian stage. That explanation will sufficiently clear up the reason why marked
                    or complex variety of character was slighted by the great principles of the
                    Greek tragedy. And every scholar who has studied that grand drama of Greece with
                    feeling,—that drama, so magnificent, so regal, so stately,—and who has
                    thoughtfully investigated its principles, and its difference from the English
                    drama, will acknowledge that powerful and elaborate character, character, for
                    instance, that could employ the fiftieth part of that, profound analysis which
                    has been applied to Hamlet, to Falstaff, to Lear, to Othello, and applied by Mrs
                    Jamieson so admirably to the full development of the Shakspearian heroines,
                    would have been as much wasted, nay, would have been defeated, and interrupted
                    the blind agencies of fate, just in the same way as it would injure the shadowy
                    grandeur of a ghost to individualize it too much. Milton’s angels are slightly
                    touched, superficially touched, with differences of character; but they are such
                    differences, so simple and general, as are just sufficient to rescue them from
                    the reproach applied to Virgil’s “<hi rend="italic">fortemque Gyan, fοrtemque
                        Cloanthem</hi> just sufficient to make them knowable apart. Pliny speaks of
                    painters who painted in one or two colours; and, as respects the angelic
                    charactere, Milton does so; he is <hi rend="italic">monochromatic.</hi> So, and
                    for reasons resting upon the same ultimate philosophy, were the mighty
                    architects of the Greek tragedy. They also were monochromatic; they also, as to
                    the characters of their persons, painted in one colour. And so far there might
                    have been the same novelty in Shakspeare’s men as in his women. There <hi
                        rend="italic">might</hi> have been; but the reason why there is <hi
                        rend="italic">not,</hi> must be sought in the fact, that History, the muse
                    of History, had there even been no such muse as Melpomene, would have forced us
                    into an acquaintance with human character. History, as the representative of
                    actual life, of real man, gives us powerful delineations of character in its
                    chief agents, that is, in men; and therefore it is that Shakspeare, the absolute
                    creator of female character, was but the mightiest of all painters with regard
                    to male character. Take a single instance. The Antony of Shakspeare, immortal
                    for its execution, is found, after all, as regards the primary conception, in
                    history: Shakspeare’s delineation is but the expansion of the germ already
                    pre-existing, by way of scattered fragments, in Cicero’s Philippics, in Cicero’s
                    Letters, in Appian, &amp;c. But Cleopatra, equally fine, is a pure creation of
                    art: the situation and the scenic circumstances belong to history, but the
                    character belongs to Shakspeare.</p>

                            mere state ghost—a diplomatic ghost. But Banquo—he exists only for
                            Macbeth; the guests do not see him, yet bow solemn, how real, how
                            heart-searching he is.</p></note> no Roman, could have conceived a
                    ghost. That shadowy conception, the protesting apparition, the awful projection
                    of the human conscience, belongs to the Christian mind: and in all Christendom,
                    who, let us ask, who, who but Shakspeare has found the power for effectually
                    working this mysterious mode of being? In summoning back to earth “the majesty
                    of buried Denmark,” how like an awful necromancer does Shakspeare appear! All
                    the pomps and grandeurs which religion, which the grave, which the popular
                    superstition had gathered about the subject of apparitions, are here converted
                    to his purpose, and bend to one awful effect. The wormy grave brought into
                    antagonism with the scenting of the early dawn; the trumpet of resurrection
                    suggested, and again as an antagonist idea to the crowing of the cock (a bird
                    ennobled in the Christian mythus by the part he is made to play at the
                    Crucifixion); its starting “as a guilty thing” placed in opposition to its
                    majestic expression of offended dignity when struck at by the partisans of the
                    sentinels; its awful allusions to the secrets of its prison-house; its ubiquity,
                    contrasted with its local presence; its aerial substance, yet clothed in
                    palpable armour; the heart-shaking solemnity of its language, and the
                    appropriate scenery of its haunt, viz. the ramparts of a capital fortress, with
                    no witnesses but a few gentlemen mounting guard at the dead of night,—what a
                    mist, what a <hi rend="italic">mirage</hi> of vapour, is here accumulated,
                    through which the dreadful being in the centre looms upon us in far larger
                    proportions than could have happened had it been insulated and left naked of
                    this circumstantial pomp! In the <hi rend="italic">Tempest,</hi> again, what new
                    modes of lifc, preternatural, yet far as the poles from the spiritualities of
                    religion. Ariel in antithesis to Caliban! What is most ethereal to what is most
                    animal! A phantom of air, an abstraction of the dawn and of vesper sun-lights, a
                    bodiless sylph on the one hand; on the other a gross carnal monster, like the
                    Miltonic Asmodai, “the fleshliest incubus” among the fiends, and yet so far
                    ennobled into interest by his intellectual power, and by the grandeur of
                        misanthropy!<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">Caliban has not yet been thoroughly fathomed. For all
                            Shakspeare’s great creations are like works of nature, subjects of
                            unexhaustible study. It was this character of whom Charles I. and some
                            of his ministers expressed such fervent admiration; and, among other
                            circumstances, most justly they admired the new language almost with
                            which he is endowed, for the purpose of expressing his fiendish and yet
                            carnal thoughts of hatred to his master. Caliban is evidently not meant
                            for scorn, but for abomination mixed with fear and partial respect. He
                            is purposely brought into contrast with the drunken Trinculo and
                            Stephano, with an advantageous result. He is much more intellectual than
                            either, uses a more elevated language, not disfigured by vulgarisms, and
                            is not liable to the low passion for plunder as they are. He is mortal,
                            doubtless, as his “dam” (for Shakspeare will not call her mother)
                            Sycorax. But he inherits from her such qualities of power as a witch
                            could be supposed to bequeath. He trembles indeed before Prospero; but
                            that is. as we are to understand, through the moral superiority of
                            Prospero in Christian wisdom; tor when he finds himself in the presence
                            of dissolute and unprincipled men, he rises at once into the dignity of
                            intellectual power.</p></note> ’ In the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Midsummer-Night's Dream,</hi> again, we have the old traditional fairy, a
                    lovely mode of preternatural life, remodified by Shakspeare’s eternal talisman.
                    Oberon and Titania remind us at first glance of Ariel: they approach, but how
                    far they recede: they are like—“like, but, oh, how different !” And in no other
                    exhibition of this dreamy population of the moonlight forests and forest-lawns,
                    are the circumstantial proprieties of fairy life so exquisitely imagined,
                    sustained, or expressed. The dialogue between Oberon and Titania is, of itself,
                    and taken separately from its connection, one of the most delightful poetic
                    scones that literature affords. The witches in Macbeth are another variety of
                    supernatural life, in which Shakspeare’s power to enchant and to disenchant are
                    alike portentous. The circumstances of the blasted heath, the army at a
                    distance, the withered attire of the mysterious hags, and the choral litanies of
                    their fiendish Sabbath, are as finely imagined in their kind as those which
                    herald and which surround the ghost in Hamlet. There we see the <hi
                        rend="italic">positive</hi> of Shakspeare’s superior power. But now turn and
                    look to the <hi rend="italic">negative.</hi> At a time when the trials of
                    witches, the royal book on demonology, and popular superstition (all so far
                    useful, as they prepared a basis of undoubting faith for the poet’s serious use
                    of such agencies) had degraded and polluted the ideas of these mysterious beings
                    by many mean associations, Shakspeare does not fear to employ them in high
                    tragedy (a tragedy moreover which, though not the very greatest of his efforts
                    as an intellectual whole, nor as a struggle of passion, is <hi rend="italic"
                        >among</hi> the greatest in any view, and positively <hi rend="italic"
                        >the</hi> greatest far scenical grandeur, and in that respect makes the
                    nearest approach of all English tragedies to the Grecian model); he does not
                    fear to introduce, for the same appalling effect as that for which AEschylus
                    introduced the Eumenides, a triad of old women, concerning whom an English wit
                    has remarked this grotesque peculiarity in the popular creed of that day,—that
                    although potent over winds and storms, in league with powers of darkness, they
                    yet stood in awe of the constable,—yet relying on his own supreme power to
                    disenchant as well as to enchant, to create and to uncreate, he mixes these
                    women and their dark machineries with the power of armies, with the agencies of
                    kings, and the fortunes of martial kingdoms. Such was the sovereignty of this
                    poet, so mighty its compass!</p>
                <p part="N">A third fund of Shakspeare’s peculiar power lies in his teeming
                    fertility of fine thoughts and sentiments. From his works alone might be
                    gathered a golden bead-roll of thoughts the deepest, subtilest, most pathetic,
                    and yet most catholic and universally intelligible; the most characteristic,
                    also, and appropriate to the particular person, the situation, and the casc,
                    yet, at the same time, applicable to the circumstances of every human being,
                    under all the accidents of life, and all vicissitudes of fortune. But this
                    subject offers so vast a field of observation, it being so eminently the
                    prerogative of Shakspeare to have thought more finely and more extensively than
                    all other poets combined, that we cannot wrong the dignity of such a theme by
                    doing more, in our narrow limits, than simply noticing it as one of the
                    emblazonries upon Shakspeare’s shield.</p>
                <p part="N">Fourthly, we shall indicate (and, as in the last case, <hi rend="italic"
                        >barely</hi> indicate, without attempting in so vast a field to offer any
                    inadequate illustrations) one mode of Shakspeare’s dramatic excellence which
                    hitherto has not attracted any special or separate notice. We allude to the
                    forms of life, and natural human passion, as apparent in the structure of his
                    dialogue. Among the many defects and infirmities of the<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=206" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0206-0188"
                    /> French and of the Italian drama, indeed we may say of the Greek, the dialogue
                    proceeds always by independent speeches, replying indeed to each other, but
                    never modified in its several openings by the momentary effect of its several
                    terminal forms immediately preceding. Now, in Shakspeare, who first set an
                    example of that most important innovation, in all his impassioned dialogues,
                    each reply or rejoinder seems the mere rebound of the previous speech. Every
                    form of natural interruption, breaking through the restraints of ceremony under
                    the impulses of tempestuous passion; every form of hasty interrogative, ardent
                    reiteration when a question has been evaded; every form of scornful repetition
                    of the hostile words; every impatient continuation of the hostile statement; in
                    short, all modes and formulae by which anger, hurry, fretfulness, scorn,
                    impatience, or excitement under any movement whatever, can disturb or modify or
                    dislocate the formal bookish style of commencement,—these are as rife in
                    Shakspeare’s dialogue as in life itself; and how much vivacity, how profound a
                    verisimilitude, they add to the scenic effect as an imitation of human passion
                    and real life, we need not say. A volume might be written illustrating the vast
                    varieties of Shakspeare’s art and power in this one field of improvement;
                    another volume might be dedicated to the exposure of the lifeless and unnatural
                    result from the opposite practice in the foreign stages of France and Italy. And
                    we may truly say, that were Shakspeare distinguished from them by this single
                    feature of nature and propriety, he would on that account alone have merited a
                    great immortality. (w. w. w.)</p>
