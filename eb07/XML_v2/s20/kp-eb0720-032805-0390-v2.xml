                    (whose maiden name was Sarah Kemble,) the greatest actress that ever trode the
                    stage, was born at Brecon, in South Wales, on the 5th of July 1755. Roger
                    Kemble, her father, was manager of a provincial company of players, and amongst
                    this class of persons he seems to have held a highly respectable rank. Sarah,
                    who was his eldest daughter, appeared very early on the stage, and went the
                    usual round of juvenile characters without exciting much expectation. At the age
                    of eighteen she married Mr.Siddons, an actor in her father’s company, soon after
                    which event she removed to Cheltenham, where she attracted some attention, and
                    was recommended to Garrick. Her first appearance on the London boards was not
                    successful, simply because she never had a proper part assigned her. Mrs.
                    Siddons accordingly returned to the provinces much mortified; but the praises
                    showered upon her by such audiences as those of York, Manchester, and Bath,
                    induced the managers of Drury Lane to re-invite her to the metropolis. Her
                    reappearance took place on the 10th of October 1782. The character which she
                    chose was that of Isabella in “The Fatal Marriage.” The effect of that
                    performance was extraordinary and unparalleled. It gave a shock of wonder and
                    delight to the public mind, like the news of some great and unexpected victory.
                    On that night, Mrs. Siddons at once took possession of the tragic throne, on
                    which, for thirty years, she reigned without a rival. Some idea of the
                    excitement which she created may be learned from the fact, that “the grave and
                    reverend seignors” of the English bar presented her with a purse of one hundred
                    guineas. During the season, Mrs. Siddons played <hi rend="italic">Euphrasia,
                        Jane Shore, Calista,</hi> and, for her two benefits, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Belvidera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zara.</hi> In all of these characters
                    she greatly added to her fame; the public were astonished at the vastness of her
                    powers, and tragedy became the fashion. In subsequent seasons she encreased her
                    circle of characters, adding from shakespeare those of <hi rend="italic">Lady
                        Macbeth, Constance, Isabella, Queen Katherine,</hi> (the most chaste,
                    beautiful, and perfect performance that ever drew a tear,) <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rosalind,</hi> (not in her line, for she was altogether too stately and
                    heroic for comedy,) <hi rend="italic">Desdemona, Volumnia, Portia, Hermione,
                        Imogene,</hi> and a few others. This list shows, that her range was
                    surprising, but she was not equally excellent in all her parts. Her comedy never
                    gave great satisfaction, although there was occasionally much to admire in it.
                    When the metropolitan season closed, it was the custom of this, as it is of
                    every great actor, to visit the principal cities of Ireland, Scotland, and the
                    provinces of England. Every where she enchanted the lovers of the drama. She
                    became a favourite with their majesties, and was in the habit of reading plays
                    to them, an occupation of more honour than emolument. However, Mrs. Siddons. by
                    her professional exertions, realized a for-<pb break="no"

                    /> tune equal to her wishes, and retired from the stage in 1812. Her death took
                    place on the 8th of June 1831, when she was in her 76th year.</p>
                <p part="N">The symmetry of this great actress’s person was most captivating. Her
                    features were strongly marked, but finely harmonised; the flexibility of her
                    countenance was extraordinary, yielding instantaneously to every, change of
                    passion; her voice was plaintive, yet capable of firmness and exertion; her
                    articulation was clear, penetrating, and distinct ;—above all, she was
                    completely mistress of her powers, and possessed that high judgment which
                    enabled her to display all her other qualifications to the greatest advantage.
                    One of Mrs. Siddons’s highest, if not her very highest endowment, was the power
                    of identifying herself with the character which she personated. The scenes in
                    which she acted, were to her far from being a mere mimic show; so powerfully did
                    her imagination conjure up the reality, that the tears which she shed were those
                    of bitterness felt at the moment. From her frown of proud disdain and scorn, the
                    very actors themselves shrank with something like terror. Her greatest
                    characters were Katherine in Henry VIII., and Lady Macbeth, in which she
                    manifested a dignity and a sensibility, a power and a pathos never equalled by
                    any female performer. Lastly, Mrs. Siddons was truly an original; she copied no
                    one, living or dead, but acted from nature and herself. In all the relations of
                    life her conduct was most exemplary, “She was more than a woman of genius,” says
                    the poet Campbell, who knew her well, “for the additional benevolence of her
                    heart made her an honour to her sex, and to human nature.” (<hi rend="smallcaps"
