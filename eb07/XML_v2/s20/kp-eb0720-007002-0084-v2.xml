                        rend="italic">Taisch,</hi> is a mode of seeing superadded to that which
                    nature generally bestows. This gift or faculty, which is neither voluntary nor
                    constant, is in general rather troublesome than agreeable to the possessors of
                    it, who are chiefly to be found among the inhabitants of the Highlands of
                    Scotland, those of the Western Isles, of the Isle of Man, and of Ireland. It is
                    an impression made either by the mind upon the eye, or by the eye upon the mind,
                    by which things distant or future are perceived, and seen as if they were
                    present. A man on a journey far from home falls from his horse; another, who is
                    perhaps at work about the house, sees him bleeding on the ground, commonly with
                    a landscape of the place where the accident befalls him. Another seer, driving
                    home his cattle, or wandering in idleness, or musing in the sunshine, is
                    suddenly surprised by the appearance of a bridal ceremony, or funeral
                    procession, and counts the attendants or mourners, of whom, if he knows them, he
                    relates the names, but if he knows them not, he can describe the dresses. Things
                    distant are seen at the instant they happen.</p>
                <p part="N">Of things future, Johnson says that he knows no rule pretended to for
                    determining the time between the sight and the event; but we are informed by Mr
                    Grose, that in general the time of accomplishment bears some relation to the
                    time of the day in which the impressions are received. Thus visions seen early
                    in the morning, which seldom happens, will be much sooner accomplished than
                    those appearing at noon; and those seen at noon will take place in a much
                    shorter time than those happening at night. Sometimes the accomplishment of the
                    latter does not fall out within a year or more.</p>
                <p part="N">These visions are not confined to solemn or important events, nor is it
                    true, as is commonly reported, that to the second sight nothing is presented but
                    phantoms of evil. The future visit of a mountebank or a piper, a plentiful
                    draught of fish, the arrival of common travellers, or, if possible, still more
                    trifling matters than these, are foreseen by the seers. A gentleman told Dr
                    Johnson, that when he had once gone far from his own island, one of his
                    labouring servants predicted his return, and described the livery of his
                    attendant, which he had never worn at home, and which had been, without any
                    previous design, occasionally given him.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Beattie of Aberdeen gives the following account of this imaginary
                    gift. The Highlands of Scotland are a picturesque but a melancholy country. Long
                    tracts of mountainous desert, covered with dark heath, and often obscured by
                    misty weather; narrow valleys, thinly inhabited, and bounded by precipices
                    resounding with the fall of torrents; a soil so rugged, and a climate so dreary,
                    as in many parts to admit neither the amusements of pasturage nor the labours of
                    agriculture; the mournful dashing of waves along the friths and lakes that
                    intersect the country; the portentous noises which every change of the wind and
                    every increase or diminution of the waters is apt to raise in a lonely region
                    full of echoes and rocks and caverns; the grotesque and ghastly appearance of
                    such a landscape by the light of the moon; objects like these diffuse a gloom
                    over the fancy, which may be compatible enough with occasional and social
                    merriment, but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts of a native in the hour of
                    silence and solitude. If these people, notwithstanding their reformation in
                    religion, and more frequent intercourse with strangers, do still retain many of
                    their old superstitions, we need not doubt but in former times they must have
                    been much more enslaved to the horrors of imagination, when beset with the
                    bugbears of Popery and Paganism. Most of their superstitions are of a melancholy
                    cast. That of Second Sight, by which some are still supposed to be haunted, is
                    considered by themselves as a misfortune, on account of the many dreadful images
                    it is said to obtrude upon the fancy. It is said that some of the Alpine regions
                    do likewise lay claim to a sort of second sight. Nor is it wonderful, that
                    persons of a lively imagination, immured in deep solitude, and surrounded with
                    the stupendous scenery of clouds, precipices, and torrents, should<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=85" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0085-0071"
                    /> dream, even when they think themselves awake, of those few striking ideas
                    with which their lonely lives are diversified; of corpses, funeral processions,
                    and other subjects of terror; or of marriages, the arrival of strangers, and
                    such like matters of more agreeable curiosity.</p>
                <p part="N">Let it be observed, also, that the ancient Highlanders of Scotland had
                    hardly any other way of supporting themselves than by hunting, fishing, or war,
                    professions which are continually exposed to fatal accidents; and hence, no
                    doubt, additional horrors would often haunt their solitude, and a deeper gloom
                    overshadow the imagination even of the hardiest native.</p>
                <p part="N">A treatise on this subject was published in the year 1762, in which many
                    tales were told of persons whom the author believed to have been favoured, or
                    haunted, with these illuminations; but most of the tales were trifling and
                    ridiculous, and the whole work betrayed, on the part of the compiler, the most
                    extreme credulity.</p>
                <p part="N">That any of these visionaries are apt to be swayed in their declarations
                    by sinister views, we will not say; but this may be alleged with confidence,
                    that none but ignorant people pretend to be gifted in this way; and in them it
                    may be nothing more, perhaps, than short fits of sudden sleep or drowsiness,
                    attended with lively dreams, and arising from some bodily disorder, the effect
                    of idleness, low spirits, or a gloomy imagination. For it is admitted, even by
                    the most credulous Highlanders, that as knowledge and industry are propagated in
                    their country, the second sight disappears in proportion; and nobody ever laid
                    claim to the faculty who was much employed in the intercourse of social life.
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Nor is it at all extraordinary that one
                    should have the appearance of being awake, and should even think one’s self so,
                    during those fits of dozing; that they should come on suddenly, and while one is
                    engaged in some business. The same thing happens in persons much fatigued, or
                    long kept awake, who frequently fall asleep for a moment, or for a long space,
                    while they arc standing, or walking, or riding on horseback. Add but a lively
                    dream to this slumber, and take away the consciousness of having been asleep,
                    and a superstitious man may easily mistake his dream for a waking vision; which,
                    however, is soon forgotten when no subsequent occurrence recalls it to his
                    memory, but which, if it shall be thought to resemble any future event, exalts
                    the poor dreamer into a Highland prophet. This conceit makes him more recluse
                    and more melancholy than ever, and so feeds his disease, and multiplies his
                    visions, which, if they are not dissipated by business or society, may continue
                    to haunt him as long as he lives, and which, in their progress through the
                    neighbourhood, receive some new tinctures of the marvellous from every mouth
                    that promotes their circulation. As to the prophetical nature of this second
                    sight, it cannot be admitted at all. That the Deity should work a miracle in
                    order to give intimation of the frivolous things of which these tales are
                    composed, the arrival of a stranger, the nailing of a coffin, or the colour of a
                    suit of clothes; and that these intimations should be given for no end, and to
                    those persons only who are idle and solitary, who speak Gaelic, or who live
                    among mountains and deserts; is like nothing in nature or providence that we are
                    acquainted with, and must therefore, unless it were confirmed by satisfactory
                    proof, be rejected as absurd and incredible.</p>
                <p part="N">To these objections Dr Johnson replies, that by presuming to determine
                    what is fit and what is beneficial, they presuppose more knowledge of the
                    universal system than man has attained, and therefore depend upon principles too
                    complicated and extensive for our comprehension; that there can be no security
                    in the consequence when the premises are not understood; that the second sight
                    is only wonderful because it is rare, for, considered in itself, it involves no
                    greater difficulty than dreams, or perhaps than the regular exercise of the
                    cogitative faculty; that a general opinion of communicative impulses, or
                    visionary representations, has prevailed in all ages and among all nations; that
                    particular instances have been given, with such evidence as neither Bacon nor
                    Bayle has been able to resist; that sudden impressions, which the event has
                    verified, have been felt by more than own or publish them; that the second sight
                    of the Hebrides implies only the local frequency of a power which is nowhere
                    totally unknown; and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent reason, we
                    must be content to yield to the force of testimony. By the pretension to second
                    sight, no profit was ever sought or gained. It is an involuntary affection, in
                    which neither hope nor fear are known to have any part. Those who profess to
                    feel it do not boast of it as a privilege, nor are considered by others as
                    advantageously distinguished. They have no temptation to feign, and their
                    hearers have no motive to encourage the imposture.</p>
