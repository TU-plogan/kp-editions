                        >Gregoras</hi></label>, a Greek historian, was born about the close of the
                    thirteenth century, and flourished in the fourteenth, under the Emperors
                    Andronicus, John Palaeologus, and John Cantacuzenus. He was a great favourite of
                    the elder Andronicus, who made him librarian of the church of Constantinople,
                    and sent him as ambassador to the Prince of Servia. He accompanied this emperor
                    in his misfortunes, and assisted at his death, after which he repaired to the
                    court of the younger Andronicus, where he seems to have been well received; and
                    it is certain that, by his influence over the Greeks, that church was prevailed
                    on to refuse entering into any conference with the legates of Pope John XXII.
                    But in the dispute which arose between Barlaam and Palamos, he took part with
                    the former, and maintained his cause zealously in the council held at
                    Constantinople in 1351. For this he was cast into prison, and continued there
                    till the return of John Palaeologus, who released him; after which he held a
                    disputation with Palamos, in the presence of that emperor. He compiled the
                    Byzantine history from 1204, when Constantinople was taken by the French, to the
                    death of Andronicus the younger, in 1341; a work which is not only barbarous in
                    style, but inaccurate in facts. This history, with a Latin translation by Jerome
                    Wolf, was printed at Basil in 1562, and again at Geneva in 1615; but a more
                    correct edition than either of the preceding is that which was printed at the
                    Louvre in 1702, by Boivin, in two vols, folio. Nicephorus was the author of
                    several other works, all of which remain inedited, excepting his <hi

                    learned monk of Constantinople, who flourished in the fourteenth century, under
                    the Emperor Andronicus Palaeologus the elder. He wrote in Greek an
                    ecclesiastical history in twenty-three books, eighteen of which are still
                    extant, and contain the transactions of the church from the birth of Christ till
                    the death of the Emperor Phocas in the year 610. Of the other five books we have
                    nothing but the arguments, which show that they embraced the portion extending
                    from the commencement of the reign of the Emperor Heraclius to the end of that

                    Andronicus Palaeologus the elder; it was translated into Latin by John Langius,
                    and has gone through several editions, the best of which is that of Paris,
                    published in 1630.</p>
