                    who held that Mary was not the mother of God. They received their name from
                    Nestorius, bishop of Constantinople, whose doctrines were spread with much zeal
                    throughout Syria, Egypt, and Persia. One of the chief promoters of the Nestorian
                    cause was Barsumas, who appears to have been created Bishop of Nisibis in the
                    year 435. Such were his zeal and success, that the Nestorians considered him
                    alone as their parent and founder. By him Pherozes the Persian monarch was
                    persuaded to expel those Christians who had adopted the opinions of the Greeks;
                    to admit the Nestorians in their place; and to put the latter in possession of
                    the principal seat of ecclesiastical authority in Persia, namely, the see of
                    Seleucia. Barsumas also erected at Nisibis a school, from which proceeded those
                    Nestorian doctors who in the fifth and sixth centuries spread their tenets
                    throughout Egypt, Syria, Arabia, India, Tartary, and China. He differed
                    considerably from Nestorius, in holding that there are two persons in Jesus
                    Christ, as well as that the virgin was not his mother as God, but only as man.
                    The abettors of this doctrine refuse the title Nestorian«, alleging that it had
                    been handed down from the earliest times of the Christian church. In the tenth
                    century, the Nestorians in Chaldaea, whence they were sometimes called <hi
                        rend="italic">Chaldaeans,</hi> extended their spiritual conquests beyond the
                    Imaus, and introduced the Christian religion into Tartary properly so called,

                        xml:id="kp-eb0716-8230-0105"/> cially into the country bordering on the
                    northern part of China. The prince of that country, whom the Nestorians
                    converted to the Christian faith, is said to have assumed, after his baptism,
                    the name of John, to which, from a principle of modesty, he added the surname of
                    presbyter; and hence it is said that his successors were each of them called <hi
                        rend="italic">Prester John</hi> until the time of Ghengis Khan. But Mosheim
                    observes, that the famous Prester John did not begin to reign in that part of
                    Asia before the conclusion of the eleventh century. The Nestorians formed so
                    considerable a body of Christians, that the missionaries of Rome were
                    industrious in their endeavours to reduce them under the papal yoke; and for
                    this purpose Innocent IV. in 1246, and Nicolas IV. in 1278, employed their
                    utmost efforts, but without success. Till the time of Julius IIL the Nestorians
                    acknowledged but one patriarch, who resided first at Bagdad, and afterwards at
                    Mosul; but a division having arisen amongst them, in the year 1551 the
                    patriarchate became divided, at least for a time, and Julius consecrated a new
                    patriarch, whose successors fixed their residence in the city of Ormus, in the
                    mountainous part of Persia, where they were distinguished by the name of Simeon.
                    The great Nestorian pontiffs, who form the opposite party, and look with a
                    hostile eye on this patriarch, have since the year 1559 been distinguished by
                    the name of Elias, and reside constantly in the city of Mosul. Their spiritual
                    dominion is very extensive, including a great part of Asia, and comprehending
                    also within its circuit the Arabian Nestorians, and the Christians of St Thomas,
                    who dwell along the coast of Malabar. About the middle of the seventeenth
                    century, the Catholic missionaries gained over to the communion of Rome a small
                    number of Nestorians, whom they formed into a congregation or church, the
                    patriarchs or bishops of which resided in the city of Amida, or Diarbekir, and
                    all assumed the denomination of Joseph. But the Nestorians in general
                    perseλ'ered in their refusal to enter into the communion of the Church of
                    Rome.</p>
