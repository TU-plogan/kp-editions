                    cardinal, and a great ornament of the monastic order of St Augustin, was
                    descended from the president Jason, or James de Noris, and was born at Verona in
                    1631. He was carefully educated by his father Alexander Noris, originally of
                    Ireland, and well known by his history of Germany. From his infancy he
                    discovered an excellent understanding, great vivacity, and quick apprehension.
                    His father instructed him in the rudiments of grammar, and procured an able
                    professor of λ <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> erona, called Massoleim, to act as
                    his preceptor. At fifteen he was admitted as a boarder in the Jesuits’ College
                    at Rimini, where he studied philosophy; after which he applied himself to the
                    writings of the fathers of the church, particularly those of St Augustin; and
                    taking the habit in the convent of the Augustinian monks of Rimini, he in a
                    short time distinguished himself amongst that fraternity by his erudition,
                    insomuch that, as soon as he had completed his noviciate, the general of the
                    order sent for him to Rome, to give him an opportunity of improving himself in
                    the more solid branches of learning. Nor did he disappoint the expectations of
                    bis superior. He gave himself up entirely to his studies, and spent whole days,
                    and even nights, in the library of the Angeliques of St Augustin. His constant
                    course was to study fourteen hours a day; and this he continued till he became a
                    cardinal. Thus he became qualified to instruct others, and was first sent to
                    Pezaro, and thence to Perugia, where he took his degree of doctor of divinity;
                    after which, proceeding to Padua, he applied himself to finish his History of
                    Pelagianism. He began it at Rome at the age of twenty-six, and when he had
                    completed his design, the book was printed at Florence, and published in 1673.
                    In the following year the Grand Duke of Tuscany invited him to that city, made
                    him his chaplain, and appointed him professor of ecclesiastical history in the
                    university of Pisa, which his highness had recently founded.</p>
                <p part="N">In his history he explained and defended the condemnation pronounced, in
                    the eighth general council, against Origen and Mopsuesta, the original authors
                    of the Pelagian errors; and he also added an account of the schism of Aquileia,
                    with a vindication of the books written by St Augustin against the Pelagians and
                    Semi-Pelagians. The work procured the author great reputation, but called forth
                    several antagonists, to whom he published proper answers. The dispute grew warm,
                    and was carried before the sovereign tribunal of the Inquisition. There the
                    history was examined with the utmost rigour, and the author dismissed without
                    the least censure. It was reprinted twice afterwards, and the author was
                    honoured by Pope Clement X. with the title of qualificator of the holy office.
                    Notwithstanding this, the charge was renewed against the History, and it was
                    delated afresh to the Inquisition in 1676; but it <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194560089?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0089-0248"/>came again
                    out of the trial with the same success as before. Mr Noris was now suffered to
                    remain in peace for sixteen years, and taught ecclesiastical history at Pisa,
                    without any molestation, until he was called to Rome by Innocent XII., who, in
                    1692, made him under-librarian of the Vatican. This post was a step to a
                    cardinal’s hat; his accusers, therefore, took fire afresh, and published several
                    new pieces against him. Upon this the pope appointed some learned divines, who
                    had taken neither side, to re-examine Father Noris’s books, and report on them.
                    Their testimony was so advantageous to the author, that his holiness made him
                    counsellor of the Inquisition. Yet this did not prevent one of his adversaries,
                    the most formidable on account of his erudition, from rising up against him, and
                    attacking him warmly, under the assumed title of a Scrupulous Doctor of the
                    Sorbonne. Noris tried to remove these scruples in a work which appeared in 1695,
                    under the title of, An Historical Dissertation concerning One of the Trinity
                    that suffered in the Flesh, in which, having justified the monks of Scythia, who
                    had made use of that expression, he vindicated himself also from the imputation
                    of having attainted the Pope’s infallibility, and abused Viπcentius Lirinensis,
                    and other bishops of Gaul, as favourers of Semi-Pela2f1an- ism, and as having
                    themselves fallen into the errors of the Bishop of Ypres. But his answers to all
                    these accusations were so much to the satisfaction of the pope, that at length,
                    in 1695, his holiness honoured him with the purple.</p>
                <p part="N">After this he was in all the congregations, and employed in the most
                    important affairs; so that he had little time to spend in study, a circumstance
                    of which he frequently complained to his friends. Upon the death of Cardinal
                    Casanati, he was made principal keeper of the Vatican Library in 1700, and two
                    years afterwards he was nominated, amongst others, to reform the calendar; but
                    he died at Rome, of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> dropsy, in 1704. He was one of the
                    most learned men of his time; his writings abound with erudition, and are also
                    remarkable for their elegance. His works are numerous, and <hi
