                    privilege of sending two members to the House of Commons; but it has been
                    disfranchised. The parish in which it stands contains 1084 inhabitants, few of
                    whom live within the limits of the borough.</p>

                    in the hundred of South Bradford, 140 miles from London. It is situated upon a
                    plain on the borders of Staffordshire, and has a market, which is held on
                    Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2307, in 1811 to 2114, in 1821 to
                    2343, and in 1831 to 2745.</p>

                    the hundred of Kemmess, in South Wales, distant 244 miles from London. It is
                    situated on the river Nevern, which is navigable, and runs into the Bristol
                    Channel. It is a corporate town, governed by a mayor, twelve aidermen, and a
                    recorder; but the market, having long declined, has at length disappeared. The
                    population amounted in 1801 to 1392, in 1811 to 1433, in 1821 to 1666, and in

                    Monmouth, and hundred of Wentlodge, 147 miles from London. It stands at the
                    mouth of the river Usk, across which theré is a fine bridge. A canal, divided
                    into two branches, and running into great coal-fields, has created a large trade
                    in coals between this town and the opposite ports of the Bristol Channel in the
                    counties of Somerset and Devon. In the neighbourhood there are many ruins of

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Newport,</hi> a town situated within the parish of
                    Carisbrook, in the Isle of Wight, and the capital of that island. It is
                    seventy-nine miles from London, and stands upon a gentle elevation close to the
                    river Medina. It is a well-built town, with a good market-place, wide streets,
                    and respectable dwellings. It has a corporation, consisting of a mayor, twelve
                    aidermen, and twelve burgesses, in whom was formerly vested the right of
                    electing two members to the House of Commons; but this is now extended to all
                    the inhabitants. There are good markets, which are held on Wednesday and
                    Saturday, and at the latter the greater part of the corn grown on the island is
                    sold. About one mile from the town is Carisbrook Castle, a remarkable pile,
                    celebrated for the imprisonment of Charles I. within its walls. It is still in
                    tolerable preservation. The population amounted in 1801 to 3585, in 1811 to
                    3855, in 1821 to 4059, and in 1831 to 4081.</p>

                    endowed by a citizen of London. Considerable occupation is afforded in making
                    bone lace, and there are paper-mills. It was long the residence of the poet
