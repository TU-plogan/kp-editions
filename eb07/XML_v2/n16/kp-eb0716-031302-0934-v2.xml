                    an appellation given to certain inferior goddesses, inhabiting the mountains,
                    woods, and waters, and said to have been the daughters of Oceanus and Tethys.
                    All the universe was represented as full of these nymphs, who were distinguished
                    into several ranks or classes. The general division of them was into celestial
                    and terrestrial. The former were called <hi rend="italic">Uraniae,</hi> and were
                    supposed to be intelligences which governed the heavenly bodies or spheres. The
                    terrestrial nymphs, called <hi rend="italic">Epigeiae,</hi> were believed to
                    preside over the several parts of the inferior world, and were divided into
                    those of the water and those of the earth. The nymphs of the water were the <hi
                        rend="italic">Oceanitides,</hi> or nymphs of the ocean; the <hi
                        rend="italic">Nereids,</hi> or the nymphs of the sea; the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Naiads</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ephy-driαdes,</hi> or the nymphs of the
                    fountains; and the <hi rend="italic">Lim-ηiades,</hi> or the nymphs of the
                    lakes. The nymphs of the earth were the <hi rend="italic">Oreades,</hi> or
                    nymphs of the mountains; the <hi rend="italic">Napaeae,</hi> or nymphs of the
                    meadows; and the <hi rend="italic">Dryads</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hamadryads,</hi> who were nymphs of the forests and groves. Besides these,
                    we meet with nymphs who took their names from particular countries, rivers, and
                    places.</p>
                <p part="N">“The nymphs,” says Dr Chandler, “were supposed to enjoy longevity, but
                    not to be immortal. They were believed to delight in springs and fountains. They
                    are described as sleepless, and as dreaded by the country people. They were
                    susceptible of passion. The Argonauts, it is related, landing on the shore of
                    the Propontis to dine, in their way to Colchis, sent Hylas, a boy, for water,
                    who discovered a lonely fountain, in which the nymphs Eunica, Malis, and
                    Nycheia, were preparing to dance; and these seeing him were enamoured, and,
                    seizing him by the hand as he was filling his vase, pulled him in. The deities,
                    their copartners in the cave, are such as presided with them over rural and
                    pastoral affairs.</p>
                <p part="N">“The old Athenians were ever ready to cry out, a god, or a goddess. The
                    tyrant Pisistratus entered the city in a chariot with a tall woman dressed in
                    armour to resemble Minerva, and regained the Acropolis, which he had been forced
                    to abandon, by this stratagem; the people worshipping, and believing her to be
                    the deity whom she represented. The nymphs, it was the popular persuasion,
                    occasionally appeared; and nympholepsy is characterised as a frenzy which arose
                    from having beheld them. Superstition disposed the mind to adopt delusion for
                    reality, and gave to a fancied vision the efficacy of full conviction. The
                    foundation was perhaps no more than an indirect, partial, ar obscure view of
                    some harmless girl, who had approached the fountain on a like errand with Hylas,
                    or was retir-ng after she had filled her earthen pitcher.</p>
                <p part="N">“Amongst the sacred caves on record, one on Mount Ida in Crete was the
                    property of Jupiter, and one by Le-ιadeain Boeotia, of Trophonius. Both these
                    were oracular, ιnd the latter bore some resemblance to that which we tave
                    described. It was formed by art, and the mouth sur-ounded with a wall. The
                    descent to the landing place vas by a light and narrow ladder, occasionally
                    applied and emoved. It was situated on a mountain above a grove; ιnd the story
                    goes, that a swarm of bees conducted the &gt;erson by whom it was first
                    discovered. But the common nvners of caves were the nymphs, and these were
                    some-imes local. On Cithaeron, in Boeotia, many of the inhabit- . ∣nts were
                    possessed by nymphs called <hi rend="italic">Sphragitides,</hi> whose cave, once
                    also oracular, was upon a summit of the mountain. Their dwellings had generally
                    a well or spring of water, the former being often a collection of moisture
                    condensed or exuding from the roof and sides; and this,in many instances, being
                    pregnant with stony particles, concreted and marked its passage by incrustation,
                    the groundwork, in all ages and countries, of idle tales framed or adopted by
                    superstitious and credulous people.</p>
                <p part="N">“A cave in Paphlagonia was sacred to the nymphs who inhabited the
                    mountains about Heraclea. It was long and wide, and pervaded by cold water clear
                    as crystal. There also were seen bowls of stone, and nymphs and their webs and
                    distaffs, and curious work, exciting admiration. The poet who has described this
                    grotto does not deserve to be regarded as servilely copying Homer; he may justly
                    lay claim to rank as an original topographer.</p>
                <p part="N">“The piety of Archidamus furnished a retreat for the nymphs, where they
                    might find shelter and provision, if distressed; whether the sun parched up
                    their trees, or Jupiter, enthroned in clouds upon the mountain top, scared them
                    with his red lightning and terrible thunder, pouring down a deluge of rain, or
                    brightening the summits with his snow.”</p>
