                    more perfect than that which they had acquired of the river Niger. Eratosthenes,
                    the librarian of Alexandria, who flourished about 220 years before Christ, had a
                    knowledge of the entire course of the river more correct than has been attained
                    by moderns until a recent date;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">“Eratosthenes,” says Colonel Leake, “was well
                            infoιmed on the course of the Nile above Egypt, and particularly as to
                            the great south-western bend of Dongola, which was scarcely known to the
                            moderns before the journey of Burckhardt into Nubia. It was from
                            Eratosthenes that Strabo derived his information on the peninsula of
                            Meroë, and it was probably from the same source that Artemidorus of
                            Ephesus learnt that the city of Meroë was fifteen days distant from the
                            sea. Eratosthenes described the island of Meroë as formed of two
                            branches of the Nile, named Astaboras, now Atbara, and Astapus; but
                            added, that the latter was sometimes called Astasobas, while the name
                            Astapus was applied to another river rising in certain lakes to the
                            south, meaning the White River. This agrees with Ptolemy, inasmuch as he
                            clearly attaches the name Astapus to the Blue or Abyssinian Nile, and
                            derives the Nilus, or proper Nile, that is to say, the White River, from
                            lakes situated far to the south. On the other hand, Artemidorus, Strabo,
                            and Pliny, followed those authorities alluded to by Eratosthenes, who
                            gave the name Astapus to the White Nile, and that of Astasobas to the
                            Blue River. The latter name may be accounted for by the discoveries of
                            late travellers; from whom we learn, that on the right bank of the
                            Bahr-el-Azrek, or Blue River, a little above the fork at Khartum, there
                            are some ruins called Soba, apparently" of the same age as those of
                            Meroë; whence it would seem that Astasobas meant the river of Soba, and
                            that the Ast, which enters into the composition of this and the two
                            other names of the rivers ο» Meroë, implies river, having probably been
                            introduced into that country by the Egyptian Greeks from Macedonia,
                            where we find its elements, doubtless with the same import, in the names
                            Astraeus, Strymon, and perhaps also the modern Vistritza. Astapus, in
                            fact, was the name of a Macedonian city (now called Istib), and not
                            improbably of the river also upon which the town is situated. When the
                            Blue Nile had generally assumed the appellation of Astasobas, that of
                            Astapus may still have distinguished the united stream as far as the
                            junction of the Astaboras, and may at length have become attached also
                            to the White River above the fork, by a process which has often changed
                            the names of rivers, especially when formed of two nearly equal
                            branches. The Scamander of Troy is a remarkable instance. The Simoeis of
                            Homer was the Scamander of the time of Strabo.” <hi rend="italic"
                                >(Journal of the Geographical Society·)</hi></p></note> and if his
                    remarks be compared with those of Artemidorus, Strabo, and Ptolemy, it will be
                    found that little information was ever added to that of Eratosthenes, regarding
                    either the Nile or its branches, which form the great peninsula of Meroë.
                    Eratosthenes distinguishes three great branches of the Nile; the first or most
                    easterly being the Atbara or Tacazze; the second the Λstapus or Bahr-el-Azrek;
                    and the third the Nile proper, to which the two former are tributaries, namely,
                    the Bahr-el-Λbiad. He places lakes at the head of the Blue and white Rivers, and
                    in so doing is followed by Ptolemy, who assigns an enormous extension southwards
                    to the Blue River. In considering the White River the real Nile, he agrees with
                    Herodotus, inasmuch as the historian states that the Nile came from the
                    westward, and that the Automoli were at a distance above Meroë equal to that of
                    Meroë above Elephantine; thus placing the Automoli on the White Nile, in the
                    country now inhabited by the Denka. Under the Ptolemies the Gréeks exploded the
                    vulgar error which prevailed in the time of Herodotus, of supposing that the
                    rivers of Western Africa flowed to the Nile. The opinion that lakes were
                    situated at the sources of the two main branches of this great river having been
                    found correct with regard to the Blue Nile, there is some reason for presuming
                    that the Nile proper may have a similar origin; “and if,” as Colonel Leake says,
                    “we suppose Ptolemy tohave placed the two lakes of the Nilus, or White River,
                    twelve degrees to the south of their real position, as he is proved to have
                    placed the Lake Coloe at the source of his Astapus, or the Abyssinian branch, it
                    will follow that the lakes of the White River are about the latitude of five
                    degrees north.” This, of course, is merely conjectural; nor is it very
                    philosophical to determine the latitude in which a river rises on the ground of
                    a presumed error.</p>
                <p part="N">Our information regarding this great and unsolved problem of African
                    geography, viz. the source of the Bahr-el-Abiad, is derived from three modern
                    authorities, Browne, Linant, and Ibrahim Kashef, who headed a party sent out by
                    the viceroy of Egypt in order to capture slaves in the distant regions of
                    Soudan. Browne, it is well known, penetrated some degrees to the south of
                    Darfur; and his inquiries went to prove that the sources of the river were
                    situated about latitude seven degrees norta and longitude twenty-seven degrees
                    east, not in lakes, but in many streams flowing from the Gibel-el-Kumri, or
                    Mountains of the Moon. It may be remarked, that this is precisely the name given
                    by Ptolemy to the mountains at the source of the Nile; and Denham also found it
                    attached to a part of the same great range farther to the westward. Linant, who
                    travelled for the African Association in 1827, surveyed the course of the White
                    Nile from the confluence of the Blue River to Aleïs, a direct distance of 132
                    geographical miles. But the most recent information is that of Ibrahim Kashef,
                    who set out from Khartum, at the fork of the two great branches. This
                    expedition, divided into two parties, marched for thirty-five days along both
                    banks of the river. On the twelfth day they reached the first island of the
                    Shilluks, traversed the territory of that people for fifteen days, and on the
                    twenty-ninth day entered that of the Denka, from which they returned at the end
                    of six days. The river was then shallow, and fall of islands, six hours in
                    breadth, and there were no mountains to be seen. “The latter part of the march,”
                    says Colonel Leake, “appears, from the description of Ibrahim, to have been in a
                    direction nearly west; so that if the first island of the Shilluks, which they
                    reached on the twelfth day, was not far from Aleïs, as Linant’s journal gives
                    reason to believe, the extreme point obtained by them was about twenty-nine
                    degrees east longitude, and ten degrees north latitude. The result of the last
                    expedition agrees with that of Browne’s, inasmuch as it gives an easterly course
                    to that part of the river which lies to the south of Darfur, and as it makes the
                    sources of the river to fall to the south-westward of that kingdom, not farther
                    northward than seven degrees north. It supports the opinion also that Browne’s
                    Donga is no other than the country of the Denka; that both the sources and
                    mountains are more distant than Browne’s information supposed; and still leaves
                    the possibility, therefore, that Ptolemy was right in describing the river as
                    originating in lakes. In fact, the enormous breadth attributed to the river by
                    the Turkish slaving party, although it may be an exaggeration, and is certainly
                    not to be reckoned by the usual allowance of the itinerary hour, leaves little
                    doubt that the river, at the extreme point of their journey, was much broader
                    than at its junction with the Blue Nile; and indicates, therefore, that its
                    conformation is of an extraordinary' kind, its origin being perhaps in a lake or
                    lakes, which may be supplied <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559803?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0716-9803-0226"/>by streams flowing from a distant range of
                    mountains. The existence of lakes having a communication with the river only in
                    time of high water is rendered highly probable by a passage in the journal of M.
                    Linant, which states, that at the time of the inundation of the White River, an
                    incredible quantity of fish is brought down towards Khartum by the
                        current."<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                    all the knowledge we possess regarding the source of the Nile proper, which, in
                    spite of Bruce, still remains the same problem as it has ever been. Regarding
                    the Egyptian expedition, Colonel Leake observes, “As a want of success alone
                    caused the return of the Turkish slaving party, the natives constantly eluding
                    their pursuit, it seems evident, that if geographical discovery, instead of
                    man-stealing, had been their object, they might have explored the river much
                    farther; and that it might consequently be in the power of the viceroy of Egypt
                    to arrive at the mysterious sources, or to escort an European mission thither,
                    if a motive sufficiently powerful should ever prompt him to assist in the
                    attempt. In the mean time, a route by water, in the direction of the sources of
                    the White Nile, is now afforded from the westward by means of the
                    newly-discovered branch of the Quorra, called Shary, or Shadda, or Tshadda,
                    which, being one mile and a half at its junction with the Quorra, is probably
                    navigable for a great distance above the confluence.”<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Ibid.</p></note> There are great
                    doubts, however, of the river Shary ever aiding in the discovery of the sources
                    of the Nile, inasmuch as it probably has its origin in Lake Tshad, which is
                    situated at least ten degrees west-north-west from the reputed sources of this
                    great stream. Nor are our hopes that the problem will speedily be resolved at
                    all raised by the Egyptian expedition; for the proceedings of the viceroy in
                    hunting for slaves on the banks of the river has so exasperated the natives
                    against the whites, that they will allow no opportunity of making reprisals upon
                    them to escape. Such at least is the opinion of Mr Hoskins. “The source of the
                    Nile could only,” he thinks, “be discovered by an armed force; and even that
                    method would present great difficulties. It would require a large army to subdue
                    the great extent of country through which the Bahr-el-Abiad probably passes. Not
                    only the chiefs, but the whole population, instead of any of them joining the
                    standard of the invader, or furnishing him with provisions, would resolutely
                    oppose him. Each man would fight with desperation for the preservation of his
                    property, family, and liberty.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">The voyage of Μ. Linant along the Bahr-el-Abiad having thrown
                    considerable light on its character near to the point of junction, we shall
                    present a brief analysis of his journal. From the mean of this traveller’s
                    astronomical observations, a small island placed just at the junction of the
                    Bahr-el-Abiad with the Blue River is situated in latitude 15. 34. north, and
                    longitude 32. 30. 58. east from Greenwich. On ascending the river, it was found
                    in many places a mile and a half in width, and even then was far within its
                    regular banks, which sometimes seemed about four miles apart, and were
                    distinctly marked beyond a wide sandy beach destitute of any appearance of
                    verdure. Even this is not the extreme breadth when the river is at its greatest
                    height, as it then overflows the adjoining country to a considerable extent,
                    especially to the westward, the eastern bank being the higher, although on both
                    sides the general aspect of the country is flat. The farther banks are covered
                    on the eastern side with wood of stunted growth, rooted chiefly in the sand; on
                    the western side it is of larger size, growing on a better soil. The borders of
                    the river were crowded with water game, such as wild geese, pelicans, swans, and
                    the like. On being repeatedly sounded, the depth was always found to be from
                    three to four fathoms. Farther up, the river was found to be somewhat narrower,
                    the eastern shore to be lower, and both banks very richly wooded, with fine
                    verdure clothing it close to the water’s edge. Fish were taken in abundance by
                    the natives, and hippopotamuses and crocodiles swarmed everywhere. Numerous
                    islands were passed at intervals, some of them beautiful spots covered with tall
                    trees of a splendid green, and thickly set with herbaceous plants. Multitudes of
                    birds were found upon them; and from the trunks of trees bee-hives were easily
                    procured. The Shil∙ Inks came from a distance for the sole purpose of obtaining
                    this honey, and chasing the hippopotamuses. Aleïs was the highest point attained
                    by Μ. Linant; and the following are the conclusions which he draws from the
                    voyage: “The Bahr-el-Abiad is undoubtedly the principal oí the two rivers which
                    form by their junction the Nile of Egypt. It discharges a greater volume of
                    water than the Bahr-el-Azrek; and although somewhat narrower immediately at the
                    confluence than it is higher up, it is, even in this respect, equal to the Blue
                    River. The colour of its waters is also that which characterises the conjunct
                    stream in the dry season, the Bahr-el-Azrek being then of a greenish hue, while
                    the Bahr-el-Abiad is always white, and as it were soapy, even during the
                    inundations, when the Bahr-el-Azrek becomes reddish, from the nature of the
                    detritus brought down by the Bahr-Toumat, which falls into it in the province of
                    Fasuolo. And the Bahr-Mo-gren, or northernmost branch of the Nile, also brings
                    down at this time a quantity of black earth, which influences the general
                    colour.”....“1 have been unable,” he continues, “to obtain any precise
                    information as to the origin of the Bahr-Abiad, none but the Arabs called
                    Corouns and the Wed Abrof pretending to know any thing of it. Hassan, the sheikh
                    of Fasuolo, a well-informed man for his country, and who has travelled a great
                    deal in the adjacent districts, gave me, however, some particulars, which induce
                    me to believe that it cannot rise in a lower latitude than Fasuolo.<note

                    a great distance, except what they find in the beds of torrents or among the
                    rocks. When I asked them, also, why they did not rather follow the banks of the
                    Bahr-Abiad, they always answered me that it passed a long way north of them; and
                    that, beyond the Shilluks, it came directly from the west quarter.</p>

                    rivers which come from the west; and the following is a list of them in the

                    river which passes to the south of it is said to flow from a great lake, to
                    which I heard several names given, none of which I shall therefore recite.
                    Several other rivers are reported to fall into it, the first called the

                            Bahr-Abiad before they arrived at Sennaar; that, before arriving at the
                            Abiad, they followed the course of another river upwards; and that the
                            Abiad had its rise in a country called Bahr-el-Lesse, from which some of
                            the waters flow towards Marok, or Maιocco, that is, to the

                <p part="N">“The Sheikh Hassan of Fasuolo also told me, that south of the Shilluks
                    the Bahr-Abiad is lost in some extensive lakes, which stretch away to the
                    westward, and communicate with each other during the inundations, the
                    intervening country being flat and marshy. And the remarks which I made on the
                    stream agree well with this statement, neither gravel nor sand indicative of its
                    being fed by torrents being found in it, and its shoals being all clay, proving
                    that it does not come from mountains, but from a country of the same nature; or,
                    at least, that if it does originate in mountains, it has a long subsequent
                    course over a country of an opposite kind; whence its source cannot possibly be
                    in the Mountains of the Moon, or, at least, in the place where they are marked
                    in our maps. Besides all which, another remarkable fact seems to me to prove
                    indubitably that it comes from a system of lakes; namely, the prodigious
                    quantity of fish which arrive with the freshes at their first appearance; for
                    these fish can only come from lakes, where they remain imprisoned when the
                    waters are low, and escape when the inundation takes place.”</p>
                <p part="N">At the point of its junction with the Bahr-el-Azrek the Bahr-el-Abiad is
                    about eighteen hundred feet across; but, as we have already observed, it
                    enlarges much a little above, its banks being frequently three or four miles
                    apart, and in some places during the inundations the waters extend twenty-one
                    miles from side to side. “It is said that they are specifically lighter,” says
                    Μ. Linant, “and more wholesome for use, than those of the Azrek; it is certain,
                    at least, that the banks of the Abiad are much the more healthy.” The cause of
                    the comparative heaviness of the waters of the Azrek here mentioned, is no doubt
                    to be attributed to the presence of earthy matters held in suspension by the
                    waters, being part of the “detritus brought down by the Tournai,” as described
                    by Μ. Linant. But the statement regarding the superior salubrityjof the waters
                    of the Abiad is quite at variance with that of Mr Hoskins. “I have been assured
                    by several Arab merchants, and also Turks,” says he, “that the water of the
                    river is less sweet than that of the Azrek, that the caravans stationed on what
                    they call the island, between the two rivers, universally prefer the water of
                    the latter. The Egyptians, therefore, are indebted to the Azrek for the singular
                    sweetness of the waters of the Nile.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">Hoskins’ Travels in Ethiopia, above the Second
                            Cataract of the Nile.</p></note> Mr Hoskins continues: “The Arabs’
                    invariable description of the Bahr-el-Abiad is, that it has waves like the Red
                    Sea, but the currentis not powerful like that of the Blue River; that a boat
                    would sail rapidly up, on account of the prevailing northerly winds, but it
                    would be more difficult to descend. It is not improbable that the reason of the
                    superior rapidity of the Blue River is its proximity to its source in the
                    mountains, whilst the Bahr-el-Abiad may pass through immense districts, where
                    the surface is more level and uniform.’<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">Ibid. p. 119.</p></note> The shores of the
                    Abiad are in general very flat, especially on the western side; and the water is
                    only deep towards the middle of the stream. On the western side the bank is
                    composed a of deposit from the river, without any sand; but, on the opposite
                    side, it is entirely of a yellowish sand, not brought down by the river, but by
                    the south-east winds during the winter; and this being stopped by the river,
                    forms hillocks, which give this side a greater elevation, and the descent from
                    it to the water a greater declivity than on the opposite shore. Hence, also, the
                    water on this side is a little deeper. The rise of the Bahr-el-Abiad is not
                    perceptible till some time after that of the Bahr-el-Azrek. Below the junction
                    the general aspect of the Nile has much more of the character of the
                    Bahr-el-Azrek than that of the Bahr-el-Abiad, excepting in the colour of its
                    waters during the dry season. In every respect it resembles the former as to the
                    nature of its banks and adjoining scenery, its width, sinuous course,
                    sand-banks, and the want of large shells, such as are only to be found on the
                    shores of the Bahr-el-Abiad. Below, also, as well as along the banks of the
                    Bahr-el-Azrek, there are comparatively few aquatic birds, whilst near the
                    Bahr-el-Abiad they are innumerable. Lord Prudhoe thus compares the two rivers:
                    “The banks of this river (the Bahr-el-Abiad) are low and flat, presenting a
                    succession of grass lawn, and fine trees of the harrez (accacia). No scenery can
                    be more unlike the Nile, whilst the Bahr&lt;el-Azrek is its facsimile; the same
                    high banks forming steppes from the annual inundations, bare of trees, but
                    eminently fertile from the rich deposit of the river; whilst the Bahr-el-Abiad,
                    stretching into wide lakes during the inundation, leaves the soil so sterile,
                    that neither corn nor other crops, not even doorrah, can be grown when the
                    waters subside; in lieu springs up grass, a production nearly unknown in Egypt.
                    Here we saw a bird like the ibis, never seen on the Nile; it was black and
                    white, with a curved beak, as represented in Egyptian sculpture. Many of the
                    picus species were also flying about, with feathers of blue and red. The fish,
                    too, of the Bahr-el-Abiad are peculiar to that river, and are not found in the
                        Nile.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                    Such is a summary of the facts ascertained regarding the main branch or artery
                    of the Nile.</p>
                <p part="N">The Bahr-el-Azrek, the other branch, flowing from the south-east, rises
                    in Abyssinia, and joins the Bahr-el-Abiad under the parallel before specified.
                    The province of Gojam, in which it rises, is very mountainous; and numerous
                    streams which have their origin in this chain flow first eastward and form the
                    great lake of Dembea, one of the most conspicuous features of Abyssinian
                    geography. That which appears to be the largest of these issues from two
                    fountains in Sacala, near Geesh, and after flowing into the lake, and quitting
                    it on its eastern shore, sweeps in a semicircular direction round the provinces
                    of Damot and Gojam, flowing first in a westerly course, and then taking its main
                    bearing, which is north-north-west. The result of about forty observations of
                    Bruce places these fountains in east longitude 36. 55. 30. and 10.59. 25. north
                    latitude. The mercury in the barometer stood at twenty-two inches, which
                    indicates an altitude of more than two miles above the level of the sea. This
                    river is considered in Abyssinia as the real Nile, and was so regarded by Bruce.
                    AÍ1 the Portuguese travellers and missionaries, from whom alone our early
                    information is derived, were impressed with the same idea. It is not, therefore,
                    wonderful that Bruce embarked on his arduous undertaking of penetrating to its
                    sources under this impression; and that, after having placed his glory in the
                    discovery, he should have admitted slowly and with caution<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194559829?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9829-0228"/> the
                    observation of D’Anville, that the Bahr-cl-Abiad, admitted to be the greater
                    stream, even by the traveller himself, had in all respects the best title to be
                    considered as the Nile of the ancients. But even granting that it is not, the
                    admission will deduct little from the achievement of Bruce, whose journey to the
                    fountains of Geesh, through wild and unexplored regions, must ever be regarded
                    as one of the noblest instances of human daring, directed by judgment and
                    science.</p>
                <p part="N">In its northerly course, the Bahr-el-Azrek, or Blue River, receives an
                    accession of several considerable streams, amongst which are the Beto and
                    Bahr-Tournât, flowing in on the western side, and the Dender, Rehat, and Rabat,
                    which unite with it on the eastern side. The waters of the Bahr-Toumat are very
                    considerable during the freshes, but at other times they are so dried up as not
                    even to flow. When it begins to rise, however, it does so with such rapidity and
                    violence as to carry every thing before it, the noise of its approach being thus
                    heard at a considerable distance, and taken as a signal to escape from its banks
                    with the utmost precipitation. At Sennaar, which is about one hundred
                    milesabovethejunctionof the Blue and White Rivers, Bruce describes the former as
                    a “delightful river, above a mile broad, full to the very brim, but never
                    overflowing. Everywhere on these banks are seen numerous herds of the most
                    beautiful cattle of various kinds.”...“The banks of the Nile about Sennaar
                    resemble the pleasantest parts of Holland in the summer season; but soon after,
                    when the rains cease, and the sun exerts his utmost influence, the dorra begins
                    to ripen, the leaves to turn yellow and to rot, the lakes to putrefy, smell, and
                    be full of vermin, all this beauty suddenly disappears.” The principal tributary
                    of the united streams of the Azrek and the z∖biad, called variously the Tacazze,
                    Atbara, Astaboras, Sittet, and Mugrum, falls into it in east longitude 34. 5.
                    and in north latitude 17. 40. This river rises in Abyssinia, and flows through a
                    great portion of it, draining all the high chains of mountains in its western
                    part. The streams which combine to form the main river spread over a wide tract
                    of country, and are very numerous, which is partly the cause of the Tacazze
                    having so many names. Its principal tributaries are the Mareb and Mogreu (the
                    Mareb of Bruce), the latter joining it not far from its confluence with the
                    Nile. Here Bruce found it a quarter of a mile broad, and very deep, flowing
                    through a parched, desert, and barren country, its banks having lost the beauty
                    which clothed them whilst it flowed through Abyssinia. Mr Hoskins gives a more
                    particular account of it. “Opposite to Unmatur is the junction of the Mugrum,
                    the ancient Λstaboras, with the Nile, which is comparatively clear at this
                    season (March). I perceived also that the taste was different, and that it had a
                    strong disagreeable smell.”...“The width of the Mugrum, as the Astaboras is now
                    called, from what I could learn, is, at the time of the rise, about a thousand
                    feet. At this season they tell rne it is almost stagnant. It swells many days
                    earlier than the Bahr-el-Abiad or the Azrek; and I think the green colour that
                    tinges the whole Nile for the first thirty or forty days after its rise may be
                    attributed to the influx of the waters of this river. The chief province or
                    district on its banks is called Atbara, evidently a corruption from the ancient
                    name of the river, which is curious, as any analogy is rarely to be found
                    between the modern and ancient names in this country.”... “From the best
                    information I have been able to obtain, there are seven days’journey from the
                    mouth of the Mugrum to Goss Radjeb, the principal village on its banks: for the
                    first two days the direction of this river is nearly east.”<note anchored="true"

                <p part="N">Arabs, that the Mugrum abounds much more than the Nile in hippopotamuses
                    and crocodiles, and that the western bank is infested with lions. This river,
                    along with the Nile, and its branch the Balιr-el-Azrek, encloses a tract of
                    country called Meroë, which obtained from the ancients the name of Island. See
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Merge.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">After the junction of the Bahr-el-Azrek with the Bahr-el-Abiad, the Nile
                    takes a very remarkable bend, which, as it appears on the map, cannot be better
                    described than by saying that it resembles an irregular letter, S, the upper
                    part, inclining to the left. This immense tortuosity extends from about the
                    sixteenth to nearly the twenty-third degree of north latitude. To give a
                    detailed account of the Nile and its banks during this long course, would only
                    be to present an ever-recurring picture of the same objects. The width of the
                    Nile varies exceedingly, being sometimes more than a mile, and at other times
                    only about a quarter of a mile, in breadth. It is studded with innumerable
                    islands, some of which are of very considerable size, and clothed with the
                    richest vegetation. The banks of the Nile, also, are often picturesque and
                    beautiful; and the portions of land which may be said to be enclosed by the
                    bendings of the river contain a much greater extent of cultivated soil, and
                    support a larger population, than any part of Lower Nubia. The whole of the
                    country, however, which has been subjected to cultivation, can only be described
                    as a long and narrow oasis, that has been rescued from the surrounding
                    desolation by the river which traverses it. Dongola is the name of the territory
                    most remarkable for its fertility and beauty. High granitic rocks enclose the
                    green and cultivated valley of Jarjar, which flourishes in freshness and
                    fertility in the bosom of the wildest waste. Immediately beyond it there is a
                    pass called the Water’s Mouth, particularly celebrated for the grandeur of its
                    scenery. It is formed by a succession of huge detached masses of naked rock, and
                    of large fragments scattered along the plain. Below is the large island of Argo,
                    a spot of peculiar and striking fertility, forming in the bosom of the desert
                    the most luxuriant natural garden. About ten miles above it is Ma-ragga, El
                    Ourde, or New Dongola, the last name having been given to it by the Mamelukes,
                    who, during their temporary occupation of this country, made it their
                    capital.</p>

                    celebrated in antiquity, and so much exaggerated by some modern travellers. The
                    first is situated about three miles above the island of Elephantine, in latitude
                    24° north. The beauty of this green spot on the waters strikes all travellers
                    with admiration; by the natives it is termed the Island of Flowers, and
                    travellers call it the Garden of the Tropics. It presents, indeed, within the
                    space of a mile in length and a quarter of a mile in breadth, a verdure and
                    fertility equal to the finest parts of Egypt. λVhether or not the body of water
                    of the Nile has, in the course of ages, worn or rather broken down the
                    precipices over which the river once rushed, we cannot say; but this is
                    certainly not at all probable. However, the thundering sound of the cataracts
                    which was said to compel the inhabitants to remove to a distance from the
                    deafening commotion, is no longer to be heard. It does not appear that there is
                    at present any considerable fall, the highest not being above five feet in
                    perpendicular descent. A picturesque and extraordinary scene, however, is
                    produced by the Mile dashing through the wild confusion of granite rocks, with
                    which its bed for several miles is thickly strewed. The rocky chain which
                    stretches along either bank, presenting projections of every form, meet and
                    cross in the middle of its course. The river, which above flows in calm majesty
                    upwards of a mile in breadth, is here narrowed to <pb break="no"

                    space: and its stream, forcing its way through the innumerable islets situated
                    above, amidst, and below the cataract, boiling and foaming amidst a thousand
                    rocks, presents a scene of peculiar grandeur and effect. The water in the
                    different channels is tossed about in every direction, forming numberless little
                    cascades; and the noise, resembling that of a tempestuous ocean beating on a
                    rocky shore, is in winter and spring very formidable, being heard at the
                    distance of three miles. There are six of these cataracts enumerated by
                    travellers, besides some falls of inconsiderable size, although not surrounded
                    by picturesque scenery. The most celebrated is the second cataract, situated at
                    Wady Halfa, in latitude 21. 50. north. This cataract has also disappointed
                    travellers, who expected to find it a mighty waterfall. Like the first, it is
                    formed by a multitude of rocky islands, through which the Nile dashes amidst
                    clouds of foam, and is whirled and tossed in perpetual eddies. The rocks consist
                    of a species of black marble, not of granite, and the islets being covered with
                    patches of verdure, and several of them being even inhabited, produce a
                    picturesque effect, which relieves the aspect of desolation characteristic of
                    the first. The fifth cataract is not to be compared to either the first or
                    second for picturesque effect. “There are here no mountains or even hills,” says
                    Mr Hoskins, “and the fall at a little distance is scarcely perceptible. The
                    sound is great, the rapids strong, and of such an extent, that at this season of
                    the year (February) certainly no boat of any size could pass; when the Nile is
                    high there would be little difficulty.” The other cataracts do not require any
                    particular notice. It is clear that they are rather what the Americans call
                    rapids than what we are accustomed to associate with the name of cataract; a
                    series of inconsiderable falls, remarkable rather for their number and the
                    picturesque scenery adjacent thereto, than for any other circumstance or
                    peculiarity.</p>
                <p part="N">The Nile enters Egypt at Assouan, near the site of the ancient Syene, in
                    latitude 24° north. It follows nearly a northerly course, and below Cairo
                    (latitude 30. 15. north) divides into two main arms, the Damietta or the
                    eastern, and the Rosetta or western branch. A description of this, the most
                    important part of the course of the Nile,.has already been given at sufficient
                    length in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt,</hi> to which the reader is
                    referred, as well as for an account of the inundation and other circumstances
                    connected with this great river. As to the length of its course, the distance
                    from the confluence of its two head branches to the sea has been estimated at
                    1500 miles, and from its highest sources at 2500 miles. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r.
