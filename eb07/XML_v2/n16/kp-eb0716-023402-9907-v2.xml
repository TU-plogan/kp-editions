                            rend="smallcaps">Noe</hi></label>, the son of Lamech, was born in the
                    year of the world 1056. Amidst the general corruption into which all mankind had
                    at this time fallen, Noah alone was found to be just and perfect in his
                    generation, walking with God. This extraordinary person having therefore found
                    favour in the sight of Heaven, the Almighty, seeing that all flesh had corrupted
                    their ways, told Noah that he was resolved to destroy mankind from the face of
                    the earth by a flood of waters; and not them alone, but all the beasts of the
                    earth, and every creeping thing, as well as the fowls of the air. The Lord
                    therefore directed Noah, as a means of preserving himself and his family (for he
                    had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who were all married before the Flood),
                    to build an ark or vessel of a certain form and size fitted to that end, and
                    which might besides accommodate such numbers of animals of all sorts, that were
                    liable to perish in the Flood, as would be sufficient to preserve the several
                    species, and again to replenish the earth.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year of the world 1656, being the six hundredth of his age, Noah,
                    by God’s appointment, entered the ark, together with his wife, his three sons,
                    their wives, and all the animals which God had caused to come to him; and being
                    all entered, and the door <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the ark being shut down
                    from, the outside, the waters of the Deluge began to fall upon the earth, and
                    increased in such a manner that they were fifteen cubits above the tops of the
                    highest mountains, and continued thus upon the earth for 150 days; so that
                    whatever had life upon the earth, or in the air, was destroyed, except such as
                    were with Noah in the ark. But the Lord remembering Noah, sent a wind upon the
                    earth, which caused the waters to subside; so that upon the seventeenth day of
                    the seventh month the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat; and Noah having
                    uncovered the roof of the ark, and observing that the earth was dry, he received
                    orders from the Lord to come out of it, with all the animals that were therein.
                    This he did in the six hundred and first year of his age, on the 27th day of the
                    second month. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Deluge.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Then Noah offered as a burnt sacrifice to the Lord one of all the pure
                    animals that were in the ark; and the Lord accepted his sacrifice, and said to
                    him that he would no more pour out his curse upon the whole earth, nor any more
                    destroy all the animals, as he had now done. He gave Noah power over all the
                    brute creation, and permitted him to eat of them, as well as of the herbs and
                    fruits of the earth; excepting only the blood of animals, the use of which God
                    did not allow him. He bade him increase and multiply, made a covenant with him,
                    and engaged no more to send an universal deluge upon the earth; and as a
                    memorial of his promise, he set his bow in the clouds, to be as a pledge of the
                    covenant which he had made with Noah.</p>
                <p part="N">Noah, being an husbandman, began now to cultivate the vine; and having
                    made wine and drank thereof, he unwarily became intoxicated, and falling asleep
                    in his tent, happened to uncover himself in an indecent posture. Ham, the father
                    of Canaan, having observed him in this condition, made sport with his father,
                    and acquainted his two brothers, who were without, of the exposure of
                    thepatriarch But they, instead of making it a matter of sport, turned away from
                    it, and going backwards, they covered their father’s nakedness, by throwing a
                    mantle over him. Noah awaking, and knowing what Ham had done, said that Canaan
                    the son of Ham should be accursed, that he should be a slave of slaves in
                    respect of his brethren. It is thought he had a mind to spare the person of his
                    son Ham, for fear the curse might light upon the other children of Ham, who had
                    had no part in this action. He cursed Canaan by a spirit of prophecy, because
                    the Canaanites, his descendants, were afterwards to be rooted out by the
                    Israelites. Noah added, Let the Lord, the God of Shem, be blessed, and let
                    Canaan be the servant of Shem. And he was so in effect, in the person of the
                    Canaanites subdued by the Hebrews. Lastly, Noah said, Let God extend the
                    possession of Japheth; let Japheth dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be
                    his servant. This prophecy had its accomplishment, when the Grecians, and
                    afterwards the Romans, being descended from Japheth, made a conquest of Asia,
                    which formed the portion of Shem.'</p>
                <p part="N">But Noah lived yet after the Deluge three hundred and fifty years; and
                    the whole duration of his life having been nine hundred and fifty years, he died
                    in the year of the world 2006. He left three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, of
                    whom mention is made under their several names; and, according to the common
                    opinion, he divided the whole world amongst them, in order that it might be
                    repeopled. To Shem he gave Asia, to Ham Africa, and to Japheth Europe. Some will
                    have it, that, besides these three sons, he had several others. The spurious
                    Berosus assigns him thirty, called Titans, from the name of their mother. It is
                    also pretended that the Teutons or Germans are derived from a son of Noah called
                    Thuiscon. Methodius likewise mentions Jonithus or Jonicus, a pretended son of
                    Noah.</p>
                <p part="N">St Peter calls Noah a preacher of righteousness, because before the
                    Deluge he was incessantly preaching and declaring to men, not only by his
                    discourses, but by his blameless life, and by the building of the ark, in which
                    he was employed six score years, that the wrath of God was ready to descend upon
                    them. But his preaching had no effect, since, when the Deluge came, it found
                    mankind plunged in all their former enormities.</p>
                <p part="N">Several learned men have observed, that the Heathens confounded Saturn,
                    Deucalion, Ogyges, the god Coelus or Uranus, Janus, Proteus, Prometheus, and
                    others, with Noah. The wife of Noah is called Noriah by the Gnostics; and the
                    fable of Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha is manifestly a corruption of the history
                    of Noah.</p>
