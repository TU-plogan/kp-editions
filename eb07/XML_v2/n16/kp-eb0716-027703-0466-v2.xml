                    in England, and in other parts of Europe, after rains, both in spring and
                    autumn. Very large spots of it are seen in gravelly sods, and particularly on
                    the tops of hills and on open downs, and it is often found on gravel walks. It
                    is met with in some of the old authors, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >ηostoch,</hi> as in Paracelsus and others; and the alchemists fancied there
                    was something wonderful in it, and that it would afford a menstrnum for gold.
                    Nostoch is said to be a word synonymous with <hi rend="italic">Jaculuιn alicujus

                    the meteors which we often see, and call <hi rend="italic">falling-stars.</hi>
                    Hence the country people in Sweden have called it <hi rend="italic">sky
                        fall</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in England it is known by the name of
                        <hi rend="italic">witched butter,</hi> in common with some of the gelatinous
                    liver-worts.</p>
                <p part="N">Paracelsus, Helmont, and others, however, ranked it with the <hi

                    chemical analysis of it given, by Μ. Geoffroy, in the Memoirs of the Academy of
                    Sciences for 1708, and is there said to yield, besides an acid phlegm, a portion
                    of concrete volatile salt and some fixed salt. The distilled water from it was
                    believed by some to possess singular virtues in allaying pains of the joints;
                    but there is certainly no ground for attributing to it any extraordinary
                    qualities. Since the days of Paracelsus it has been considered as a vegetable
                    production; but the botanists have had difficulty in assigning to it its place
                    or genus in their several systems.</p>
                <p part="N">Naturalists had, however, for some years begun to doubt whether the
                    substance in question was of a vegetable or animal nature, when at length the
                    latter opinion received a strong corroboration from the observations of Mr Platt
                    of Oxford, in a letter printed in the Gentleman’s Magazine for 1776.</p>
                <p part="N">“From a child,” says he, “I remember seeing the meteors shooting in the
                    air, which appearance, by my comrades, was called <hi rend="italic"
                        >star-shooting,</hi> believing the stars no larger than their apparent
                    magnitude. This jelly-like substance, mentioned in your magazine, was believed
                    to be the dross of these meteors, and took the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >star-shot,</hi> which passed for certain with me till I had arrived at the
                    age of twenty-four, when I was engaged in business that required my frequently
                    passing over both meadows and pasture-grounds, where in spring and autumn I saw
                    many portions of this supposed alga or nostoch, but never more than one or two
                    contiguous, mostly near the water, when the meadows were or had been just before
                    flooded. My conjectures were various, until I saw a crow pecking of something in
                    a field, which I heard to cry; when turning my horse to the place, I found a
                    frog of the common size, which the crow (of the carrion kind) would soon have
                    killed and gorged, had I not disturbed her, and chased her away.</p>
                <p part="N">“About this time I found in a meadow the bowels of a frog indigested,
                    and compact as the chitterlings of a calf or pig, but white as the paper I write
                    upon, though not translucid. I took it up and placed it in a paper exposed to
                    the air, leaving it in some grass where I found it, till my return that way in
                    three days’ time, when I saw it changed to that tremulous jelly-like substance,
                    the alga or star-shot. I was much pleased with this discovery, and took it home
                    in my pocket wrapped in a paper, where I showed it to a society of young persons
                    of which I was <hi rend="italic">a</hi> member, who agreed with my sentiments of
                    its being the indigestible part of a frog disgorged by some bird of prey.,</p>
                <p part="N">“To corroborate my sentiments of this alga being the bowels of a frog, I
                    luckily saw some of it lying by' the side of a brook, where I lighted and took
                    it up, and to my great surprise found attached to the jelly the head, heart,
                    Iiyer, and one leg of the frog, which had been, I presume, disgorged by some
                    carrion crow, who frequented the flooded grounds to pick up worms and other
                    vermine. There was also some of it found on an apple-tree at Wyston Ma∏∙- na,
                    near Leicester, where I then lived, which, no doubt, was disgorged by some
                    owl.”</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Darwin, in his Poem on the Loves of the Plants, is of the same
                    opinion with Mr Platt, that these gelatinous substances are of an animal nature;
                    and that the different appearances they put on are owing to various
                    circumstances, viz. the different birds who feed on frogs, the quantity they
                    devour at a time, and the state of digestion before they are voided.</p>
