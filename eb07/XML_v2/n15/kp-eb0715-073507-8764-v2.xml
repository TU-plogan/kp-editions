                    obscurity, and rivalled Belisarius in heroism, under the reign of the Emperor
                    Justinian. From the domestic service of the palace, and the administration of
                    the private revenue, he was suddenly advanced to the head of an army; and he is
                    ranked amongst the few eunuchs who have rescued what Lord Byron contemptuously
                    calls “the third sex” from the contempt and hatred of mankind. A feeble
                    diminutive body concealed the soul of a statesman and a warrior. His youth had
                    been employed in the management of the loom and the distaff, in the cares of the
                    household, and in the service of female luxury; but, whilst his hands were busy,
                    he secretly exercised the faculties of a vigorous and a discern ing mind. A
                    stranger to the schools and the camp, he made it his study in the palace to
                    dissemble, to flatter, and to persuade; and as soon as he approached the person
                    of the emperor, Justinian listened with surprise and pleasure to the manly
                    counsels of his chamberlain and private treasurer. The talents of Narses were
                    tried and improved in frequent embassies. He also led an army into Italy,
                    acquired a practical knowledge of the war and the country, and presumed to rival
                    the genius of Belisarius. Twelve years after his return, the eunuch was selected
                    to achieve the conquest which had been left imperfect by the first of the Roman
                    generals. Instead of being dazzled by vanity or ambition, he seriously declared,
                    that unless he were provided with an adequate force, he would never consent to
                    risk his own glory and that of his sovereign. Justinian granted to the favourite
                    what he might have denied to the hero; the Gothic war was rekindled from its
                    ashes; and the preparations were not unworthy of the ancient majesty of the
                    empire. Narses defeated the Goths, the Franks, and the Alamanni; the Italian
                    cities opened their gates to the conqueror, who entered the capital in triumph;
                    and, having established the seat of his government at Ravenna, he continued to
                    govern Italy under the title of exarch during fifteen years. His virtues, we are
                    informed, were stained with avarice; and in this provincial reign he accumulated
                    a treasure of gold and silver which surpassed the modesty of a private fortune.
                    His government was oppressive and unpopular; and the general discontent was
                    expressed with freedom by the deputies of Rome. Before the throne of Justinian
                    they boldly declared that their Gothic servitude had been more tolerable than
                    the despotism of a Greek eunuch; and that unless their tyrant were instantly
                    removed, they would consult their own happiness in the choice of a new master.
                    His disgrace was thus the effect of popular disaffection; and his death, though
                    in an extreme old age, was unseasonable and premature, since his genius alone
                    could have repaired the last and fatal error of his life. He died about the year
                    567, and, as some say, though it does not appear very probable, at the advanced
                    age of ninety-five.</p>
