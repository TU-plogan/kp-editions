                    celebrated German chronicler, was born at Hamburg about the middle of the
                    fifteenth century. Having finished his studies, he set out upon his travels, in
                    the course of which he visited several parts of Europe, attending the
                    prelections of the most distinguished professors, cultivating the society of the
                    learned, and exploring public libraries, by which means he made acquisitions in
                    knowledge equally varied and extensive. He took his degree at Rostock, and on
                    that occasion supported several theses with so much distinction that he was
                    retained to teach philosophy and theology. Krantz was rector of this university
                    in 1482. But being recalled to Hamburg, he was provided with a canonry in the
                    cathedral, and divided his time between preaching and teaching theology. Elected
                    syndic of Hamburg in 1489, he assisted the same year at the assembly of Wismar,
                    where the interests of the Hanseatic towns were discussed. They deputed him to
                    proceed to France in 1497 to demand a treaty, and to England in 1499 to solicit
                    assistance against the pirates who infested the North Sea. In these different

                    sagacity, and integrity, that John king of Denmark, and Frederick duke of
                    Holstein, chose him, in 1500, to terminate the dispute which had arisen between
                    them on the subject of the province of Ditmarsen. Krantz, having been named dean
                    of his chapter in 1508, laboured with great zeal to remedy the disorders which
                    had been introduced into ecclesiastical discipline; but it is only by a forced
                    interpretation of some passages in his works, that Wolf, and after him Bayle,
                    have endeavoured to make him be considered as one of the precursors of Luther.
                    Krantz was witness to the first attacks of that reformer on the church of Rome,
                    and condemned them. He died on the 7th of December 1517, and was interred near
                    the eastern gate of his cathedral. Krantz was a very learned man; and the
                    historical works which he left behind him are useful, notwithstanding the errors
                    by which they are disfigured. Some critics have accused him of plagiarism and of
                    bad faith; but he has found numerous apologists, amongst whom may be mentioned
                    Cisner, who places him in the first rank of the writers of his age, not only for
                    the elegance of style and the clearness of method, but also for the love of
                    truth. Krantz was the author of, 1. Chronica Regnorum Aquilonarium, Daniae,
                    Sueciae, Novoagiae, Strasburg, 1546, in folio; 2. Saxonia, sive de Saxonicae
                    Gentis vetusta origine, longinquis ex-expeditionibus susceptis etc. libri xii.
                    Cologne, 1520, in folio; 3. Vandalia, sive Historia de Vandalorum vera origine,
                    variis gentibus, crebris e patria migrationibus, etc. Cologne, 1519, in folio;
                    4. Metropolis, sive Historia Ecclesiastica Saxoniae, Basil, 1548, in folio; and
                    some other works of little importance. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
