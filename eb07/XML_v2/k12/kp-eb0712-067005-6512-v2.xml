                <p part="N"><label type="entry">KALMUCKS</label>, a tribe of those wandering Tartars
                    who, in the thirteenth century, under Jenghis Khan, subdued and desolated the
                    whole breadth of Asia. The Kalmucks (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Asia)</hi> are
                    distinguished from the other nations of Asia by their peculiar physiognomy. They
                    are in general of the middle size, powerfully and well made, except in their
                    thighs and legs, which are somewhat bent. A large head, round face, dark olive
                    complexion, high and prominent cheek bones, sparkling black eyes punctured in
                    the head, and widely separated from each other, a flat broad nose scarcely
                    rising above the level of the face, and turned up, with two immense nostrils,
                    thick and fleshy lips, and exceedingly white teeth, a short chin, and a thin
                    scanty beard, with black coarse hair, complete the portrait of a Kalmuck face.
                    In many of the women, however, these harsh features are softened, and they have
                    agreeable countenances, with very delicate complexions, which are set off by
                    fine black hair; so that some of the higher classes would even be considered as
                    beauties by the Europeans. They are, like all barbarians, coarse, filthy, and
                    disgusting in their habits; they are covered with grease and vermin, and
                    slovenly and dirty in the extreme. Nor do their moral qualities make amends for
                    these defects. Morality is indeed amongst all nations upon a level with their
                    intelligence, and amongst barbarians is generally at a low ebb. The Kalmucks are
                    accordingly represented as being addicted to lying and cheating, though
                    travellers report that robberies are rare amongst them, and that a murder is
                    almost unknown. They pay great respect to old age; and, though hot in their
                    temperament, and fierce when irritated, they in general live amicably together.
                    Whoever receives a present of meat or drink divides it faithfully amongst his
                    companions; and if a relative has lost his flocks or other substance by war or
                    accident, he is sure to be liberally rewarded. According to Pallas, a Kalmuck
                    provided with a horse, with arms, and equipage, mayΥamble from one place to
                    another for three months together, without taking with him money or provisions.
                    His friends and relatives, however distant, receive him with all that
                    hospitality which distinguishes barbarous nations; and wherever he goes he meets
                    with the kindest reception, and is entertained in the best manner that their
                    circumstances afford. And a stranger, from whatever country he comes, is sure to
                    be well received by the Kalmucks. His property is faithfully kept for him the
                    moment he puts himself under the protection of his host, it being considered as
                    a crime of the deepest dye to rob any one who is a guest. These tribes, from the
                    prince to the peasant, dwell in tents, which are their only habitations, and are
                    all of a circular form, with a conical roof, and a hole at the top. They are
                    covered with felt made of camels’ hair or wool, and are constructed of cane or
                    wood. One of their encampments presents the appearance of a city, with regular
                    streets, sometimes extending a mile in length, and containing numerous shops,
                    where several of the more refined arts are carried on. Here are artificers in
                    copper, brass, and iron; also goldsmiths, who make trinkets for their women,
                    idols of gold and silver, and vessels for their altars; also others who are
                    expert at inlaid work and enamelling. Dr Clarke asserts that these oriental
                    tribes of Kalmucks have, from time immemorial, possessed the art of making
                    gunpowder. The riches of the Kalmucks consist entirely in their flocks. Their
                    habits are wholly <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> pastoral; and they never think
                    of cultivating the ground, though they inhabit extensive tracts of luxuriant
                    meadows, which are of peculiar fertility. Like all pastoral tribes, they
                    emigrate with the seasons, residing with their flocks in the mountains during
                    the summer, and descending in the winter to the verdant plains. They have few
                    camels, these being delicate and difficult to rear; and they are chiefly
                    possessed by priestsand by the richer classes. Their horses are small but very
                    swift, and are capable of enduring great fatigue, galloping for several hours
                    Successively without injury, or passing a whole day without drinking. Their
                    horned cattle arc of a beautiful shape; and their sheep are the same as those
                    which are found throughout Great Tartary. They are exceedingly fat, with large
                    tails and broad and pendent ears; but their wool is so coarse that it can only
                    be used in the manufacture of felt. They live on the milk and flesh of their
                    cattle, and have no objection to <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192946525?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6525-0671"/>horse
                    flesh. They make a fermented liquor from mare’s milk, from which they distil a
                    spirit called <hi rend="italic">koumiss,</hi> of which they are very fond. They
                    are also extremely partial to tobacco and tea. Their principal amusements are
                    hunting, wrestling, archery, and horse-racing. They are expert horsemen, being
                    trained to it from their infancy; and the women are equally skilful with the
                    men. They are, like all barbarous tribes, passionately addicted to gaming; and
                    often lose at cards all that they possess, even to their very clothes. They have
                    also chess, draughts, and backgammon; and the youth of both sexes amuse
                    themselves with singing and dancing to the two-stringed lute. Their most common
                    diseases are malignant fevers, which are greatly aggravated by their gross diet
                    and want of cleanliness. The itch, and other cutaneous diseases, are also common
                    amongst them. Their religion is pagan, and their priests, as amongst every
                    ignorant and superstitious people, are treated with the most extraordinary
                    respect. Their commerce consists entirely in the exchange of their horses and
                    cattle for com, woollen cloths, linens, copper, pewter, kitchen utensils,
                    knives, and spoons; and great numbers of them visit Astrakan for this purpose.
                    They never deal in slaves; but such prisoners as they take in war are
                    naturalized, and adopted into the tribe.</p>
                <p part="N">This powerful tribe, like all the other pastoral states of Asia, has
                    been greatly reduced, both in numbers and extent of territory, by the increasing
                    power of the civilized nations by whom they are surrounded. Before their
                    subjugation or dispersion, they were divided into three principal branches; the
                    Soonganes, the Coschotes, and the Torgots. Of these, the first were engaged in
                    almost perpetual hostilities with the Mongols and Chinese. The Coschotes, on the
                    conquest of Thibet, became subject to the Chinese; and still continue under the
                    protection of that power, except a smaller part which had retired to the Irtish,
                    and fell under the dominion of the Soonganes. The Torgots, who had separated
                    themselves from the Soonganes, settled at an early period amongst the steppes on
                    the Volga; but many of them, disgusted with the tyranny of Russia, returned in
                    great numbers in' ] 770 and 1771, over the river Ural, on the ice, and across
                    the Kirgusian steppes into Soongaria. It was in 1720 that the Kalmucks were
                    driven from Thibet; and about forty years afterwards, by the extension of Kiang
                    Long’s conquests, such as refused to submit to his authority were compelled to
                    seek for new settlements towards the west. Many of them accordingly dispersed
                    themselves in the interior parts of Asia, and amongst the cities of the Usbeck
                    Tartars; others took refuge in Russia, and some thousands fled to Siberia, but
                    the greater number submitted to the Chinese sovereignty. At present the most
                    numerous and powerful tribes of the Kalmucks inhabit the country lying between
                    the Caspian Sea, Muscovy, Samarcand, and Cashgar. Others occupy with their
                    flocks and herds both banks of the Volga, between the Irghis and the Caspian,
                    and extend their excursions on both sides of the Don and the Ural. . . <hi
