                    twelve miles from Edinburgh, lying along the margin of a bay, on the north side
                    of the Frith of Forth. It consists chiefly of a very long and spacious street,
                    well paved and lighted, in which there are many elegant houses and shops; also a
                    few smaller streets and lanes, chiefly opening into the main street. To the west
                    of the royalty, but within its boundary as fixed by the act 2 and 3 William IV.
                    cap 65, are the populous villages of Linktown, in the parish of Abbotshill, and
                    the village of West Bridge, in the parish of Kinghorn. In the year 1334,
                    Kirkcaldy was mortified by David II. to the abbey of Dunfermline; and it was
                    possessed by the abbey till the year 1450, when the commendator and monastery
                    sold it, along with its harbour, to the bailies and inhabitants. On 5th February
                    1644 it acquired a charter of erection and novodamus as a royal burgh from King
                    Charles II. By this charter he conveyed to the bailies, councillors, and
                    community, the burgh, the harbour, and lands, the extent of which has been
                    estimated at 487 acres. The amount of the revenue for the year ending 10th
                    October 1835 was L.2320. Is. 2d.; the ordinary expenditure, L.1263. 13s. 6-j¾d.;
                    casual expenditure, L.24. 5s. The debts for the burgh then amounted to L.7040.
                    Is. 6ģd., and the effects were valued at L.1854. 18s. 3∣d. The government of the
                    burgh is vested in a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, and sixteen
                    councillors, who are chosen under the act 3 and 4 William IV. cap. 76. There are
                    also seven incorporated trades. The harbour, which is pretty safe, is situated
                    near the east end of the town. In 1796 a basin or inner harbour was added to it;
                    and of late years it has been very much deepened, and otherwise improved. The
                    depth of the water at its entrance at spring tides is fifteen feet. Its basin is
                    capable of containing fifteen sail of vessels of 350 tons and under.' Its outer
                    harbour, when the deepening operations at present (1836) in progress in it are
                    completed, will contain considerably more. Though the harbour is the property of
                    the town, yet, in terms of a statute passed in 1827, it is under the management
                    of parliamentary commissioners, consisting of the provost, two bailies, dean of
                    guild, and treasurer of the burgh, and the convener of the seven incorporated
                    trades, three commissioners chosen by the prime guild or society of sailors,
                    three by the merchants, and two by the county of Fife. By a decree-arbitral
                    dated 5th March 1684, in a submission between the burghs of Kirkcaldy, Kinghorn,
                    and Burntisland, the number of Kirkcaldy boats for transporting passengers and
                    goods to and from Leith was limited to four. This decree was, on 20th December
                    1817, declared by the supreme court to be still in force; and the decision of
                    the court further provided, that the four boats to be entitled to ply on the
                    passage should be licensed by the magistrates and town council of Kirkcaldy.
                    This decree-arbitral and decision of the court has had the effect of
                    establishing a right of ferry in the town council of Kirkcaldy, which is now
                    become one of the principal sources of the town’s revenue. The ferry is at
                    present navigated by two steamers belonging to the Kinghorn ferry-trustees, who
                    hold licenses from the town council for that purpose. They make from two to
                    three trips from the ferry stations, on each side of the firth, daily. About the
                    commencement of the reign of Charles I. Kirkcaldy is said to have possessed 100
                    sail of vessels. Between the years 1644 and 1650, and shortly after, in the
                    subsequent struggle with England, in less than ten years, ninety-six of its
                    ships were said to have been taken at sea. In 1652, it appears, from Tucker’s
                    report, to have had twelve vessels, the burden of the whole of which was 582
                    tons. In the reports of the state of the royal burghs of Scotland made to the
                    commissioners appointed by the general convention holden at Edinburgh, 9th July
                    1691, it appears that in 1692 the burden of the vessels then belonging to the
                    port of Kirkcaldy was 1215 tons, and their estimated value was 45,200 merks. All
                    these were then reported to be employed in carrying coals to Holland and London,
                    except one or two, which might have freights from foreigners to the Sound or to
                    Norway. There were also four ferry boats, of the value of 500 merks, each of
                    which are stated to have been very unprofitable, since Kinghorn had built so
                    many small boats, yawls, and great boats. In 1760 the trade of the port was so
                    much depressed, that it then employed no more than one coaster of fifty, and two
                    ferry boats each of thirty tons. The number of vessels in 1792 was twenty-six,
                    the burden of which was 3700 tons register, and their value about L.30,000. The
                    shipping belonging to the town in 1836 consists of seven vessels engaged in the
                    whale fishery, eighteen in the foreign and general trade of the country, two
                    smacks engaged in the London trade, two vessels in the trade to Newcastle, two
                    in the Glasgow trade by the great canal, one in the Dun-, dee trade, and two in
                    the trade of Leith, besides two open boats. The burden of the whole amounts to
                    about 6 <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> 709 tons. There is at present a
                    custom-house in Kirkcaldy, which includes under its superintendence all the
                    ports from Aberdour on the west, to St Andrews on the east. On the 1st of
                    January 1831 the burden of the whole of the vessels belonging to these ports
                    amounted to 14,596 tons, and were navigated by 1289 seamen. There is a corn
                    stock and sample market at Kirkcaldy, which is the most extensive in the county.
                    It is held every Saturday, except on the third Saturday of February and July,
                    and first Saturday of October, when it is held on the Friday preceding these
                    days along with the horse and cattle market, which are fixed at these times. The
                    trade of Kirkcaldy consists chiefly of flax-spinning, and weaving coarse linen
                    goods, such as ticks, dowlas, checks, and sail-cloth, for home and foreign
                    consumption. The value of the goods manufactured in 1815, when the trade was
                    depressed, was estimated at L.125,981. It is now considerably increased. There
                    are at present ten spinning-mills within the new limits of the burgh, turning
                    upwards of 4895 spindles. There are also a rope-work, four bleachfields
                    connected with the town for bleaching yarn, two tan-works, four saltpans which
                    used to make annually 15,000 bushels of salt before the salt-duties were
                    repealed, a whisky distillery, two breweries for ale and porter, two iron
                    founderies, and a colliery adjacent to the burgh, at which are raised annually
                    15,000 tons of coal. The banking business of the town is managed by branches of
                    the Bank of Scotland, Glasgow Bank, Commercial Bank of Scotland, and National
                    Bank of Scotland. There is a Chamber of Commerce, or association among the
                    merchants, which was founded in 1825, for protecting the manufacturing interest,
                    and for matters of general concern. There are a subscription library and a
                    mechanics’ library. The former, instituted about twenty-five years ago, now
                    contains about 4000 volumes. There are also two news-rooms, maintained by public
                    subscription.· The public schools are maintained by the magistrates and council,
                    and consist<pb break="no" facs="nls:192947344?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-7344-0734"/> of a teacher of Latin and Greek, and a
                    teacher of English and writing. The late Mr Philip, merchant in Kirkcaldy, who
                    died in 1829, left from L.70,000 to L.80,000 for the purpose of educating and
                    clothing a hundred orphan or destitute children in Kirkcaldy, a hundred and
                    fifty in Pathhead, a hundred in Abbotshall, and fifty in Kinghorn. There is also
                    another charity, arising from a fund left by the late John Thomson, post-master,
                    partly for education, and partly for people in reduced circumstances. Besides
                    the established church, there are two meeting-houses of the United Associate
                    Synod, one of the Original Seceders, one of the Original Burgher Synod, one of
                    the Independents, one of the Baptists, and one of the Episcopalians. The
                    inhabitants of Kirkcaldy took a lively interest in all the civil and religious
                    struggles under the house of Stuart. In 1622, when the general assembly of the
                    protestant churches of France deputed Boesnage to solicit aid in this country,
                    to enable them to resist the oppression of Louis XII. the town and parish
                    contributed, by the king’s permission, a pecuniary aid of 1030 merks, for which
                    Boesnage’s receipt is engrossed in the parish records. In 1645 Kirkcaldy sent so
                    many men to contend with Montrose at Kilsyth, that his victory over them is said
                    to have made 200 widows in the town alone. About the time of the revolution in
                    1688, the inhabitants contrived to apprehend the Earl of Perth, who was the lord
                    chancellor under King James. They detained him five days under a guard of 300
                    men, and afterwards sent him, under a convoy of three boats and 200 men, to
                    Alloa, where they delivered him over to the Earl of Mar. The most eminent native
                    of Kirkcaldy was Dr Adam Smith, the author of the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of
                        Nations.</hi> The house in which he was born was taken down and rebuilt in
                    1835. Kirkcaldy unites with Dysart, Burntisland, and Kinghorn, in sending a
                    member to parliament. In 1833 the constituency of these four burghs consisted of
                    502 voters, whereof there were enrolled in Kirkcaldy 314, in Dysart 105, in
                    Burntisland 46, and in Kinghorn 37. Population in 1831, 5034.</p>
