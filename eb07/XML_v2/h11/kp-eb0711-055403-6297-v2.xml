                    eminent English mathematician and philosopher, was the son of John Hooke,
                    minister of Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight, where he was born in 1635. He very
                    early discovered a genius for mechanics, by making curious toys with great art
                    and dexterity. He was educated under Dr Busby in Westminster school, where he
                    not only acquired a competent share of Greek and Latin, together with an insight
                    into Hebrew and some other oriental languages, but also made himself master of a
                    considerable part of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> About the year
                    1653, he went to Christ-Church, Oxford, and in 1655 was introduced to the
                    Philosophical Society of that place, where, discovering his mechanicħl genius,
                    he was first employed to assist Dr Willis in his operations in chemistry, and
                    afterwards recommended to the honourable Robert Boyle, whom he served several
                    years in the same capacity. About this time he was also instructed in astronomy
                    by Dr Seth Ward, Savilian professor of that science; and henceforward he
                    distinguished himself by many noble inventions and improvements of the
                    mechanical kind. He invented several astronomical instruments, for making
                    observations both at sea and land; and was particularly serviceable to Mr Boyle
                    in completing the invention of the air-pump. Sir John Cutler having founded a
                    mechanic school in 1664, he settled an annual stipend on Mr Hooke, intrusting
                    the president, council, and fellows of the Royal Society to direct him with
                    respect to the number and subjects of his lectures; and on the 11th of January
                    1665 he was elected by that society curator of experiments for life, with an
                    additional salary. In 1666 he produced to the Royal Society a model for
                    rebuilding the city of London, destroyed by fire, with which the society was
                    well pleased; but although the lord mayor and aidermen preferred it to that of
                    the city surveyor, it was not carried into execution. As the rebuilding of the
                    city, according ţo the act of parliament, required an able person to let out the
                    ground to the proprietors, Mr Hooke was appointed one of the surveyors; and in
                    this employment he acquired most part of his estate. Mr Oldenburgh, secretary to
                    the Royal Society, having died in 1677, Mr Hooke was appointed to supply his
                    place, and began to take minutes at the meeting in October, but did not publish
                    the Transactions. In the beginning of the year 1687, his brother’s daughter, Mrs
                    Grace Hooke, who had lived with him several years, died; and he was so affected
                    with grief at her death, that he hardly ever recovered it, but was observed from
                    that time t° become less active, more melancholy, and even more cynical, than
                    ever. At the same time, a chancery suit in which he was concerned with Sir John
                    Cutler, on account of his salary for reading the Cutlerian Lectures, made him
                    very uneasy, and increased his disorder. In 1691 he was employed in forming the
                    plan of the hospital near Hoxţon, founded by Robert Ask, aiderman of London, who
                    appoint <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646310?mode=fullsize"

                    and in December the same year, Hooke was created doctor of physic by a warrant
                    from that prelate. In June 1696, the chancery suit with Sir John Cutler was
                    determined in his favour, to his inexpressible satisfaction. In the same year an
                    order was granted to him for repeating most of his experiments at the expense of
                    the Royal Society, upon a promise of his finishing the accounts, observations,
                    and deductions from them, and of perfecting the description of all the
                    instruments contrived by him; but his increasing illness and general decay
                    rendered him unable to perform the task. He continued some years in this wasting
                    condition; and languishing till he was quite emaciated, he died on the 3d of
                    March 1702, at his lodgings in Gresham College, and was buried in St Helen’s
                    Church, Bishopsgate Street.</p>
                <p part="N">In his person he exhibited but a mean appearance, being of short
                    stature, crooked, pale, lean, and of a meagre aspect, with lank brown hair,
                    which he wore very long, and hanging over his face. His temper was penurious,
                    melancholy, mistrustful; and though possessed of great philosophical knowledge,
                    he had so much ambition, that lie would be thought the only man who could invent
                    or discover. Hence it has been asserted by some that he frequently laid claim to
                    the inventions and discoveries of others, whilst he boasted of many of his own
                    which he never communicated. He wrote, 1. <hi rend="italic">Lectiones</hi><hi

                    his death were published, Posthumous Works, collected from his papers by Richard
                    Waller, secretary to the Royal Society.</p>
                <p part="N">The following is a chronological view of the inventions to which he laid
                    claim. It would be harsh to say, with regard to any of them, that he did not at
                    least think himself an inventor; with respect to several, his priority is beyond
                    dispute.</p>

                    long afterwards the regulating or balance-spring for watches.</p>
                <p part="N">1658. The double-barrelled air-pump, and the conical pendulum. His first
                    employment of the conical pendulum was not less ingenious and scientific than it
                    was original. He employed it to represent the mutual gravitation of the planets;
                    a fact which he had most systematically announced. He had shown, that a force,
                    perfectly analogous to gravity on this earth, operated on the surface of the
                    moon and of Jupiter. Considering the numerous round pits on the surface of the
                    moon, surrounded with a sort of wall, and having a little eminence in the
                    middle, as the production of volcanoes, he inferred that the ejected matter fell
                    back again to the moon, as such matter falls back again to the earth. Seeing
                    Jupiter surrounded with an atmosphere, which accompanied and therefore pressed
                    on him, as our air presses on the earth, he inferred that it was the same kind
                    of power that maintained the sun and other planets in a round form. He inferred
                    a force to the sun from the circulation round him, calling it a <hi
                        rend="italic">gravitation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and said that it was
                    not the earth which described the ellipse, but the centre of gravity of the
                    earth and moon. He therefore made a conical pendulum, the tendency of which to a
                    vertical position represented the gravitation to the sun, and which was
                    projected at right angles to the vertical plane, and showed experimentally how
                    the different proportions of the projectile and centripetal tendencies produced
                    various degrees of eccentricity in the orbit. He then added another pendulum,
                    describing a cone round the first, whilst this described a cone round the
                    vertical line in order to see what point between them described the ellipse. The
                    results of the experiment were intricate and unsatisfactory; but the thought was
                    ingenious. He candidly acknowledged that he had not discovered the true law of
                    gravitation which would produce the description of an ellipse round the focus,
                    owing to his want of due mathematical knowledge; and therefore he left this
                    investigation to his superiors. Sir Isaac Newton was the person who made the
                    discovery, after having entertained the same notions of the forces which
                    connected the bodies of the solar system, before he had any acquaintance with Dr
                    Hooke, or knew of his speculations.</p>

                    respecting respiration, the composition of the atmosphere, and the nature of
                    light, which were afterwards attributed as discoveries to Mayow and others, who,
                    though we are far from supposing that they stole their discoveries from Dr
                    Hooke, were certainly anticipated by him.</p>

                    and that in all the productions and extinctions of motion, the accumulated
                    forces were as the squares of the final or initial velocities. This doctrine he
                    announced in all its generality and importance, deducing from it the
                    consequences which John Bernoulli valued himself so highly upon, and which are
                    the chief facts produced by Leibnitz in support of his doctrine of the forces of
                    bodies in motion. But Hooke was perfectly aware of their entire correspondence
                    with the Cartesian or common doctrine, and was one of the first in applying the
                    celebrated 39th proposition of Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> to his
                    former positions on this subject, as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> mathematical

                    bodies to burn without air, because it consists of this air accompanied by its
                    heat and light in a condensed or solid state, and air supports flame because it
                    contains the same ingredients as gunpowder, that is, a nitrous spirit; that this
                    air dissolves something in the blood whilst it is exposed to it in the lungs in
                    a very expanded surface, and, when saturated with it, can no longer support life

                    their connection with harmonic sounds. A glass containing water, and excited by
                    a fiddlestick, threw the water into undulations, which were square, hexagonal,
                    octagonal, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> showing that it made vibrations
                    subordinate to the total vibration; and that the fundamental sound was

                    that some years before that period he had proposed a method of discoursing at a
                    distance, not by sound, but by sight. He then proceeds to describe a very
                    accurate and complete telegraph. But, some years previous to 1684, Amontons had
                    not invented his telegraph; so that, though the Marquis of Worcester
                    unquestionably gave the first hint of this instrument, Dr Hooke appears to have
                    first brought it to a useful state.</p>

                    earliest particulars to be met with are furnished by himself, in the following
                    modest but manly address to the Earl of Oxford, dated 7th October 1722; “My
                    Lord, the first time I had the honour to wait upon your lordship since your
                    coming to London, your lordship had the goodness to ask me what way of life I
                    was then engaged in; a certain <hi rend="italic">mauvaise honte</hi> hindered me
                    at that time from giving a direct answer. The truth is, my lord, I cannot be
                    said at present to be in any form of life, but rather to live extempore. The
                    late epidemical distemper seized me, I endeavoured to be rich, imagined for a
                    while that I was, and am in some measure happy to find myself at this instant
                    but just worth nothing. If your lordship, or any of your numerous friends, have
                    need of a servant with the bare qualifications of being able to read and write,
                    and to be honest, I shall gladly undertake any employments your lordship shall
                    not think me unworthy of. ĩ have been taught, my lord, that neither a man’s
                    natural pride, nor his self-love, is an equal judge of what is fit for him; and
                    I shall endeavour to remember that it is not the short part we act, but the
                    manner of our performance, which gains or loses us the applause of Him who is
                    finally to decide of all human actions. My lord, I am just now employed in
                    translating from the French a History of the Life of the late Archbishop of
                    Cambray; and I was thinking to beg the honour of your lordship’s name to protect
                    a work which will have so much need of it. The original is not yet published.
                    ’Tis written by the author of the Discourse upon Epic Poetry, in the new edition
                    of Tele-maque. As there are some passages in the book of a particular nature, I
                    dare not solicit your lordship to grant me the favour I have mentioned, till you
                    first have perused it. The whole is short, and pretty fairly transcribed. If
                    your lordship could find a spare hour to look it over, I would wait upon your
                    lordship with it, as it may possibly be no unpleasing entertainment. I should
                    humbly ask your lordship’s pardon for so long an address in a season of so much
                    business. But when should I be able to find a time in which your lordship’s
                    goodness is not employed ?” The translation here spoken of was afterwards
                    printed in 12mo, 1723. From this period until his death, Mr Hooke enjoyed the
                    confidence and patronage of men not less distinguished for virtue than for rank.
                    In 1730 he published a translation of Ramsay’s Travels of Cyrus, in 4to; in 1733
                    he revised a translation of the History of the Conquest of Mexico by the
                    Spaniards, by Thomas lownsend, printed in two vols. 8vo; and in the same year he
                    published, in 4to, the first volume of the Roman History, from the building of
                    Rome to the ruin of the Commonwealth, illustrated with maps and other plates. In
                    the dedication to this volume, Mr Hooke took the opportunity of “publicly
                    testifying his just esteem for a worthy friend, to whom he had been long and
                    much obliged,” by telling Mr Pope, that the displaying of his name at the head
                    of those sheets was “like the hanging out a splendid sign to catch the
                    traveller’s eye, and entice him to make trial of the entertainment the place
                    affords. But," he proceeds, “when I can write under my sign, that Mr Pope has
                    been here, and was content, who will question the goodness of the house ?” The
                    volume is introduced by Remarks on the History of the Seven Roman Kings,
                    occasioned by Sir Isaac Newton’s objections to the supposed 244 years’ duration
                    of the royal state of Rome. His nervous pen was next employed in digesting an
                    account of the conduct of the Dowager-duchess of Marlborough, from her first
                    coming to court to the year 1710, 8vo. His reward on this occasion was
                    considerable, and the reputation he acquired by the performance much greater.
                    The circumstances of this transaction are thus related by Dr Maty, in his
                    Memoirs of Lord Chesterfield (vol. i. p. 116): “The relict of the great Duke of
                    Marlborough being desirous of submitting to posterity her political conduct, as
                    well as her lord’s, applied to the Earl of Chesterfield for a proper person to
                    receive her information, and put the memoirs of her life into a proper dress. Mr
                    Hooke was recommended by him for that purpose. He accordingly waited upon the
                    duchess, while she was still in bed, oppressed by the infirmities of age. But,
                    knowing who he was, she immediately got herself lifted up, and continued
                    speaking during six hours. She delivered to him, without any notes, her account
                    in the most lively as well as the most connected manner. As she was not tired
                    herself, she would have continued longer the business of this first sitting, had
                    not she perceived that Mr Hooke was quite exhausted, and wanted refreshment as
                    well as rest. So eager was she for the completion of the work, that she insisted
                    upon Mr Hooke’s not leaving her house till he had finished it. This was done in
                    a short time; and her Grace was so well pleased with the performance, that she
                    complimented the author with a present of L.5000, a sum which far exceeded his
                    expectations. As soon as he was free, and permitted to quit the house of his
                    benefactress, he hastened to the earl to thank him for his favour, and
                    communicated to him his good fortune. The perturbation of mind he was under,
                    occasioned by the strong sense of his obligation, plainly appeared in his
                    stammering out his acknowledgments; and he who bad succeeded so well as the
                    interpreter ot her Grace’s sentiments, could scarcely utter his own.” The second
                    volume of his Roman History appeared in 1745, when Mr Hooke embraced the
                    occasion of congratulating his worthy friend the Earl of Marchmont, on “that
                    true glory, the consenting praise of the honest and the wise,” which his
                    lordship had so early acquired. To the second volume Mr Hooke added the
                    Capitoline Marbles, or Consular Kalendars, an ancient Monument accidentally
                    discovered at Rome in the year 1545, during the pontificate of Paul III. In 1758
                    Mr Hooke published, 1. Observations on the Answer of Μ. l’Abbe de Vertot to the
                    Earl of Stanhope’s Inquiry concerning the Senate of ancient Rome, dated December
                    1716; 2. A Dissertation upon the Constitution of the Roman Senate, 1743; 3. A
                    Treatise on the Roman Senate, by Dr Conyers Middleton, 1747; 4. An Essay on the
                    Roman Senate, by Dr Thomas Chapman, 1750, a work which he inscribed to Mr
                    Speaker Onslow. The third volurheof Mr Hooke’s Roman History, to the end of the
                    Gallic war, was printed under his inspection before his last illness, but did
                    not appear till after his death, which happened in 1764. 'lhe fourth and last
                    volume was published in 1771. An octavo edition of the whole work was afterwards
                    given to the world.</p>
