                    history of no animal is more interesting than that of the dog. First, his
                    intimate association with man, not only as his valuable servant and protector,
                    but as his constant and faithful companion throughout all the vicissitudes of
                    life. Secondly, from his natural endowments, not consisting solely in the
                    exquisite delicacy of one individual sense, that fineness of olfactory nerve by

                    memory with reflection that soars above instinctive preservation or
                    self-enjoyment; but qualities of the mind that absolutely stagger us in the

                    extending from the first to the last of all things, till it forms a perfect
                    whole) is placed, as Professor Harwood elegantly expresses it, “in the doubtful
                    confines of the material and spiritual worlds.” It might have been instinct that
                    enabled Ulysses’s dog to recognize him on his re-landing in Ithaca, after an
                    absence which must have set the powers of memory at defiance; and he recognized
                    him with all the acuteness and affection which instinct boasts; <hi
                        rend="italic">but what caused him to expire at his feet on the sudden dawn
                        of unexpected happiness</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> The heart of man could
                    go no further than this; and although perhaps the poet’s fiction is only present
                    to us in this instance, by what name can we call those tender affections, those
                    sincere attachments, those personal considerations, which we ourselves have
                    witnessed in these faithful creatures towards human kind? Virtue alone is too
                    cold a term, as almost every good quality to be found in animated nature is to
                    be found here; and when we reflect upon the miserable existence so often the lot
                    of this kind-hearted animal in this world, and the more than uncertainty that,
                    as Byron says, he will be <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> Denied in heaven the
                    soul he held on earth,”</p>
                <p part="N">we cannot but feel regret that he should be without his reward. But yet
                    this is a point not exactly decided upon by man ,∙ at least it has been
                    considered as a fit subject for speculation by deep and able thinkers. Mr Locke,
                    for example, doubted whether brutes survive the grave, because įthere is no hint
                    given of it in revelation; but Dr Priestley thought, if the resurrection of the
                    dead be within the proper course of nature, and there be something remaining of
                    every organized body that death does not destroy, there will be reason to
                    conclude that they will be benefited by it as well as ourselves. “The misery,”
                    says this forcible writer, and great moral philosopher, <hi rend="superscript">
                        &lt;c</hi> some animals are exposed to in this life, may induce us to think
                    that a merciful and just God will make them some recompense for it
                    hereafter.”</p>
                <p part="N">But no animal has met with more variety of respect shown towards him
                    than the dog has. By the law of Moses he was declared unclean, and was held in
                    great contempt by the Jews, as also by the Turks, and kept by both merely for
                    the purposes of scavenging their streets. In every part of the sacred writings,
                    as also in those of Greece and Rome, not only are images introduced from the
                    works of nature, and metaphors drawn from the manners and economy of animals,
                    but the names of them are applied to persons supposed to possess any of their
                    respective qualities. Thus our Saviour, adopting this concise method, applies
                    the word “dog” to men of odious character and violent temper; and, as with us at
                    present, the term of reproach, “he was a son of a dog,” was in common use among
                    the Jews. The wife Abigail (1 Samuel, xxv. 3) “was a woman of good
                    understanding, and of a beautiful countenance; but the man (Nabal) was churlish
                    and evil in his doings, and <hi rend="italic">was of the house of Caleb.”</hi>
                    But this last, says an able expounder of the Scriptures, is not a proper name.
                    Literally it is, “he was the son of a dog.” On the other hand, the idolatrous
                    Egyptians held the dog sacred, and worshipped him in their god Anubis,
                    representing the form of a man with a dog’s head, which Juvenal complains of in
                    his fifteenth satire:</p>
                <p part="N">“Oppida tota canem venerantur, nemo Dianam.”</p>
                <p part="N">Anubis, says Strabo, is also the city of dogs, the capital of the
                    Cynopolitan prefecture. “Those animals,” says he, <hi rend="superscript">
                        ti</hi> are fed there on sacred aliments, and religion has decreed them a
                    worship.” This absurd adoration is confirmed by Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus;
                    and Rome having adopted the ceremonies of Egypt, the Emperor Commodus, when
                    celebrating the Isiac feasts, shaved his head, and himself carried the dog
                    Anubis.</p>
                <p part="N">But to proceed to their origin and history. It has been justly remarked,
                    that “all dogs whatsoever, even from the terrible Boar-dog to little Flora, were
                    all one in the first creation and every virtue and faculty, size and shape,
                    which we find or improve in every dog upon earth, were originally comprehended
                    in the first parents of the species, nothing having remained constant but their
                    natural conformation; and all the variety which we now behold in them is either
                    the product of climate or the accidental effect of soil, food, or situation, and
                    very frequently the issue alone of human care, curiosity, or caprice. This we
                    take to be the case with other departments of the creation. For example, we only
                    acknowledge two sorts of pigeons, the wild and the tame. Of the first there is
                    but one, the oenas, or vinago of Ray. Of the last, the varieties are
                    innumerable. The tame and the wild goose are likewise originally of the same
                    species, the influence of domestication alone having caused the tame ones to
                    differ from the parent stock. Notwithstanding, however, the efforts and effects
                    of human industry and skill, there is fortunately a <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">plus ultra</hi> in nature which cannot be passed; and as there
                    is a distinct specific difference in all living creatures, a pigeon is still a
                    pigeon, a goose a goose, and a dog remains a dog. Still, although no human
                    device can add one new <hi rend="italic">species</hi> to the works of the
                    creation, and nature is still uniform in the main, as we have already observed,
                    in our remarks on the horse, she is always ready to meet the demands of art, a
                    fact beautifully set forth in these lines of <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi><hi

                    congeniality of its climate) has long been famous for dogs, which, on the
                    authority of Strabo (lib. iv. p. 199), were much sought after by all the
                    surrounding nations. So high indeed in repute were British dogs amongst the
                    Romans after the reduction of our <pb break="no"

                    only for excellence in the chase, but fierceness in the combat, that an officer
                    from that country was appointed to reside in the city of Winchester, for the
                    express purpose of collecting and breeding them to supply the amphitheatre, as
                    well as the imperial kennel, at Rome. Nor was this all. As a kind of earnest of
                    our present celebrity in the various sports of the field, all the neighbouring
                    countries, as Dr Campbell remarks, “have done justice to our dogs, adopted our
                    terms and names into their language, received them thankfully as presents, and,
                    when they have an opportunity, purchased them at a dear rate.”<note

                    archbishop of Rheims, to send some learned ecclesiastics into England, he
                    accompanied his letter with a present of several dogs, being the most valuable
                    he could, in those times, bestow. The congeniality of our climate has
                    contributed much to this excellence, as our dogs, hounds especially, are found
                    to degenerate in most others; which Somerville alludes to in his poem of the
                    Chase.</p>
                <p part="N">“In thee alone, fair land of liberty, Is bred the perfect hound, in

                    weak degen’rate race.”</p>
                <p part="N">We do not benefit much by research into ancient authors on the subject
                    of dogs; for although they have been much written upon, and immortalised in song
                    by Oppian, Claudian, Gratius, and others (Virgil says little about them), yet,
                    from our ignorance of the sort of animal bred in their time, and the use they
                    made of them, <hi rend="italic">as sportsmen,</hi> we can draw no parallel
                    between them and our own that would tend to a good purpose. No doubt the “canis
                        <hi rend="italic">vestigator”</hi> of Columella, and the “canis <hi
                        rend="italic">odorus”</hi> of Claudian, were of what we term a low-scenting
                    sort, as the epithets applied to them signify; but it would be difficult to
                    pronounce an opinion upon the xatfró^a/, or the aλω- -τε%∕δες, of Xenophon,
                    although the characteristic properties of good hunting hounds are very well and
                    accurately laid down by him in the third chapter of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kυvη</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    their defects in form, &amp;c. equally clearly exposed; and his observations on
                    these points might be perused with advantage by huntsmen of the present day.</p>
                <p part="N">Great encouragement has been given to the breeding of hounds in England
                    by the various monarchs who have reigned over it. Henry II. was perhaps the
                    first who made himself conspicuous in this department of the sportsman’s
                    occupation, being, as one of his historians says of him, “particularly curious
                    in his hounds, that they should be fleet, well-tongued, and consonous.” The last
                    epithet is in reference to a property not only little regarded, but nearly lost
                    now, namely, the deep tongue of the old English blood-hound, which Shakspeare
                    alludes to in his celebrated description of those “of the Spartan kind</p>
                <p part="N">“ (So flowed, so sanded, and their heads are hung With ears that sweep
                    away the morning dew. Crook-knee’d, and dewlapt, like Thessalian bulls; Slow in
                    pursuit; but match’d in mouth like bells, Each under each :)”</p>
                <p part="N">which would now be considered a disgrace to any man’s kennel, and we
                    believe nowhere to be found, bearing the faintest resemblance to the picture
                    drawn of them by this master-hand.</p>
                <p part="N">In Queen Elizabeth’s time a classification was made by Dr Caius,
                    physician to the queen, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De Cambus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Britannicis,</hi> of the different kinds of dogs peculiar to
                    Great Britain; but many of the names (the sleute or sluth hound of the Scotch,
                    for example) having since become obsolete,' they were again classed by Mr
                    Daniel, in his <hi rend="italic">Rural Sports,</hi> which work contains a full
                    and satisfactory historical account of their origin, different crosses, Ac.
                    under the following genealogical heads :—Shepherd’s Dog, Iceland Dog, Lapland
                    Dog, Siberian Dog, Hound, Terrier, Large Spaniel, Small Spaniel, Water Dog,
                    Small Water Dog, Bull Dog, Large Danish Dog, Irish Greyhound, English Greyhound,
                    and Mastiff. Taplin, in his <hi rend="italic">Sporting Dictionary,</hi>
                    expresses his surprise that the Pointer is omitted; but we consider the Pointer
                    as a dog of foreign extraction, and to our early ancestors certainly
                    unknown.</p>
                <p part="N">The original stock from which English hounds have been bred would be
                    very difficult to determine upon; but one thing is certain, namely, that the
                    several sorts with which the country once abounded have been becoming fewer and
                    fewer, in the course of the last hundred years, and now centre in three
                    varieties, namely, the Fox-hound, the Harrier, and the Beagle. The stag-hound is
                    gone, at least there is no pack of stag-hounds now kept in Great Britain, the
                    last having been disposed of and sent abroad, soon after the stag hunting
                    establishment in Devonshire was broken up, a few years ago. The beagle is also
                    become rare; and otter-hounds, such as we may conclude the %αΛ√g∕α∕ of Xenophon
                    to have been, never existed in this country, the dog used in hunting the otter
                    being the common harrier; and perhaps the parent of all, the majestic
                    blood-hound, whose</p>
                <p part="N">“Nostrils oft, if ancient fame s⅛gs true, Trace the sly felon through
                    the tainted dew,” is at present very thinly scattered, here and there only, at
                    keepers’ lodges in some of our royal forests. But we more than doubt whether a
                    true specimen of the original English blood-hound exists in England at all at
                    the present day; nor is this a matter of regret, as, unlike the rest of his
                    species, his character is said to be that of decided enmity to man. Strabo
                    describes an attack upon the Gauls by these animals, and likewise says they were
                    purchased in Britain by the Celtae, for the purposes of Avar, as well as those
                    of the chase; but it is doubtful whether the most savage of this race would
                    devour man without being trained to it, which Ave know that they were on a late
                    horrible occasion, when, as stated in Rainsford’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                        St Domingo,</hi> they Avere fed upon blood, and a figure representing a
                    negro, containing blood and entrails of beasts, was the object they Avere led to
                    pursue. In the West Indies, however, the blood-hound, under proper control, has
                    been found useful in tracing runaway negroes, as the sluth-hound of the Scotch
                    was early applied to discover the haunts of robbers; and to the same purpose
                    also on the confines of England and Wales, Avhere the borderers preyed on the
                    flocks and herds of their neighbours, whenever an opportunity offered. Of
                    deer-stealers, who Avere so numerous a century or two ago, they were likewise
                    the terror; and Avell might they have been so, for when once fairly laid upon
                    the foot of one, they seldom failed to hunt up to him. But it is in the civil
                    wars of our own country that blood-hounds are placed in the most conspicuous
                    light, particularly as available to the operations of Wallace and Bruce; and the
                    poetical historians of the two heroes allude to their services to their masters,
                    as well as to the escapes they had from those of their various enemies.</p>
                <p part="N">The distinguishing features of the English blood-hound are, long,
                    smooth, and pendulous ears, with a wide forehead, obtuse nose, expansive
                    nostrils, and deep flewed, with an awfully deep but highly sonorous tongue. The
                    prevailing colour is a reddish tan, darkening to the upper part, often with a
                    mixture of black upon the back. In short, the deep-flewed southern hare-hound,
                    now almost extinct in England, very nearly resembles the English bloodhound in
                    form and colour; and a person may picture to <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193648182?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8182-0699"/>himself the
                    latter, by supposing an animal considerably larger than the old southern hound.
                    In height he is from twenty-six to twenty-eight inches, and sometimes more. The
                    blood-hound of the West Indies is also about the same height, but differs much
                    in form. He has small, erect ears, the nose more pointed, and the hair and skin
                    hard. His countenance is ill featured and ferocious; and although not so heavy
                    as the English blood-hound, he is quite as muscular, and very active.</p>
                <p part="N">The distinguishing property of the blood-hound in chase, consists in his
                    never changing from the scent on which he is first laid; and he will hunt by the
                    shed blood of a wounded or dead animal as truly as he will by the foot, which
                    rendered him so useful in pursuit of the deer or sheep-stealer.</p>
                <p part="N">The English stag-hound, now nearly gone, is little more than a mongrel
                    blood-hound; at least it is reasonable to conclude, that the cross which
                    produced him was directly from the En gush blood-hound with some lighter animal
                    of a similar species (perhaps a greyhound, or lurcher) approximating his form,
                    to which conjecture his figure and disposition, as well as his <hi rend="italic"
                        >comparative</hi> inferiority of scent, appear to add strength. It is
                    asserted in the <hi rend="italic">Sportsman’s Cιbinet,</hi> that the stag-hound
                    “was originally an improved cross between the old English deep-tongued southern
                    hound and the fleeter fox-hound, grafted upon the basis of what was formerly
                    called, and better known by the appellation of, blood-hound.” But this assertion
                    must have been made without proper reflection; for, in the first place, a cross
                    between the deep-tongued southern and the fox-hound will not produce an animal
                    nearly so large or so Strong as the stag-hound; and, secondly, the stag-hound
                    was known in England long before the foxhound was made use of, or, indeed,
                    before there was an animal at all resembling the one which is now known by that
                    term.</p>
                <p part="N">We confess we regret the prospect of the total extinction of the English
                    stag-hound, who, although his form possessed little of that symmetry we now see
                    in the English fox-hound, was a majestic animal of his kind, and possessed the
                    property peculiar alone to the blood-hound and himself, of unerringly tracing
                    the scent he was laid upon, amongst a hundred others; which evinces a
                    superiority,, at all events a peculiarity, of nose entirely unknown to our
                    lighter hounds of any breed. The want of being able to distinguish the lhunted
                    fox from a fresh-found one is the bane of English fox-hunting; and there are not
                    wanting those who think, that in the breeding of the modern fox-hound, the minor
                    points of high form and blood are more frequently considered than they should
                    be, in preference of a regard to nose.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The Fox-Hound.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The English fox-hound of the present day is a perfect living model; but
                    how he has become such, it is in no one’s power to determine. Although we do not
                    like to apply the term of mongrel to an animal we so highly respect, yet there
                    can be no doubt of his being one of a spurious race, engrafted with care on the
                    parent stock, ιamely, <hi rend="italic">the old English blood-hound.</hi> There
                    is, we believe also, no doubt that a century and a half ago there was no animal
                    in the world resembling the present breed of fox-hound; and that the fox, when
                    hunted at all in Great Britain, was hunted by a dog much resembling what is now
                    known as the Welch harrier, rough-haired and strong, but of very far from
                    sightly appearance. As all animals, however, improve under the care and guidance
                    of man, until at length they assume the character of a distinct breed; such has
                    evidently been the case with hounds, the breeders of which have, by going from
                    better to better in their choice of the animals from which they have bred,
                    progressively arrived at the perfection we see in them. And such has been the
                    case with all our domestic animals, the breeders of which have alone attained
                    their ends by the choice of individuals of the highest excellence in their kind,
                    and by a judicious selection of size, form, and qualities likely to produce the
                    result. There can be no doubt, then, but that by pursuing this course throughout
                    a number of generations with the hound, an animal has been produced of what may
                    be called quite a new variety in the canine race, answering the description and
                    purposes of our present fox-hound. But the questions may be asked, Whence the
                    necessity for this change, and forcing, as it were, nature from her usual
                    course? Why not be content with the low-scenting, plodding hounds of our
                    forefathers, which, from the superiority of their nose, not only displayed <hi
                        rend="italic">hunting,</hi> in the strict acceptation of that term, to the
                    highest advantage, but very rarely missed the game they pursued? These questions
                    are satisfactorily answered in a few words; first, as the fox is not now found
                    by the drag, and the number of those animals is so greatly increased, the
                    necessity for this extreme tenderness of nose does not exist; and, secondly, by
                    reason of the blood of the race-horse having gradually mixed with that of our
                    hunters, the sort of hound we have been alluding to was not found to be adapted
                    to their increased speed; and particularly as, in proportion as nature lavished
                    this fine sense of smelling on the old-fashioned hound, was he given to “hang”
                    or dwell upon the scent, thereby rendering the length of a chase (which, to
                    please the present taste, should, like Chatham’s battle, be “sharp, short, and
                    decisive”) beyond the endurance of a modern sportsman. It is true, Mr Beckford,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts upon Hunting,</hi> gives an instance of a pack
                    of old-fashioned hounds, which ran in a string, as it were, one following the
                    other, and yet killing twenty-nine foxes in twenty-nine successive runs, each
                    fault being hit off by an old southern hound. But what would our hard-riding,
                    modern sportsmen think of this as pastime? Nevertheless, all who witnessed, as
                    we have done, the style of hunting of the Devonshire stag-hounds, will remember
                    that there w as a close similarity between them in chase, and the pack Mr
                    Beckford speaks of. But, as the same eminent author afterwards observes, it is
                    the dash of the fox-hound of the present day that distinguishes him from all
                    others of his genus, and hounds must now “carry a head.”</p>
                <p part="N">The breeding a pack of fox-hounds to a pitch bordering on perfection is
                    a task of no ordinary αifficulty; the best proof of which is to be found in the
                    few sportsmen who have succeeded in it. Not only is every good quality to be
                    regarded, and if possible obtained, but every fault or imperfection to be
                    avoided; and although the good qualities of hounds are very soon reckoned, their
                    faults in shape and performance present a longer catalogue. Independently of
                    shape, which combines strength with beauty, the highest virtue in a fox-hound is
                    not in the exquisiteness of his nose, but in his being true to the line his game
                    has gone, and a stout runner to the end cf a chase. But he must not only thus
                    signalize himself in chase; he must also be a patient hunter, with a cold scent,
                    or with the pack at fault. In short, to be a hard runner and a good hunter, and
                    steady on the line, which “a good hunter” implies, constitutes a perfect hound,
                    when combined with good form.</p>
                <p part="N">The faults of hounds, too often innate, can only be cured by education.
                    The greatest of all are, skirting, or not being true on the line, and throwing
                    the tongue improperly; first, without a scent, which is known by the term
                    babbling; secondly, not throwing it at all, or running mute; and, thirdly, on a
                    wrong scent, which is called running riot. The latter, however, is the least
                    vice of the two, because generally curable by the lash; but the fault of
                    skirting is too often innate; at all events, too often incurable. Thus has the
                    breeder of the ‘hound to guard against propensities as <pb break="no"

                    faults; and a late accredited writer on the subject says, “In modem times, the
                    system of hunting is so much improved, so much more attention is paid to the
                    condition of hounds and their style of work, that in this enlightened age a
                    master of hounds thinks it a reflection on his judgment if <hi rend="italic"
                        >one</hi> hound in his pack is detected in a fault.”<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Colonel Cook’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p part="N">The selection of dog and bitch to breed from is a nice point for a
                    master of hounds, or his huntsman, to decide upon; but, if he aim at excellence,
                    he must keep his eye on perfection. In no animal is perfect symmetry so
                    desirable as in a fox-hound, for without it there is no dependence on his
                    services, however good may be his nature. We will first describe him in the
                    words of a very old writer, and afterwards in those of Mr Beckford, when it will
                    appear that there is a strong resemblance in the portraits drawn by each. “His
                    head,” says the former, “ought to be of middle proportion, rather long than
                    round; his nostrils wide; his ears large; his back bowed; the fillets great; the
                    haunches large; the thighs well trussed; the ham straight; the tail big near the
                    reins, and the rest slender to the end; the leg big; the sole of the foot dry,
                    and formed like a fox’s, with the claws great.” The latter says, “There are
                    necessary points in the shape of a hound which ought always to be attended to;
                    for if he be not a perfect symmetry, he will neither run fast nor bear much
                    work; he has much to undergo, and should have strength proportioned to it. Let
                    his legs be straight as arrows; his feet round, and not too large; his shoulders
                    back; his breast rather wide than narrow; his chest deep; his back broad; his
                    head small; his neck thin; his tail thick and brushy; if he carry it well so
                    much the better.” Now the hound that would answer to either of these
                    descriptions would disgrace no man’s kennel, and one resembling the latter would
                    be an ornament to it; but with regard to the former, it must be borne in mind,
                    that it is from the -pen of a sportsman who wrote a century and half ago, when,
                    as has been before observed, there is reason to believe no animal in the perfect
                    form of the modern foxhound was to be found in this or in any other country.
                    Judges of the animal, however, will be disposed to think with us, that there is
                    much of the real character of the <hi rend="italic">hound</hi> in the sentence
                    we have quoted from this old writer; such as the long rather than round head;
                    the wide nostrils (Pliny says they should be flat, solid, and blunt); and the
                    dry, fox’s foot. But the “bowed back” appears to spoil all, unless by it is
                    meant that gentle rise in the loins which the judge of hounds admires, and
                    without which, the late Mr Chute of the Vine, in Hampshire, who hunted that
                    country for more than thirty years, gave it as his opinion, no hound was able to
                    maintain his speed for an hour over hilly and <hi rend="italic">ploughed</hi>
                    countries when “it carries ;”—a technical term for the earth clinging to the
                    foot, which it will do after a slight frost on the preceding night; necessarily
                    adding much to the natural weight of the hound. Beckford gives us the modern
                    foxhound, and perfect, with the exception of the mention of one or two material
                    points. “His chest should be deep,” says he, “and his back broad but he has
                    omitted a point much thought of by the modern sportsman, namely, <hi
                        rend="italic">the back ribs,</hi> which should also be deep, as in a
                    strong-bodied horse, of which we say, when so formed, that he has a good
                    “spur-place,” a point highly esteemed in him. Nor is either of these writers
                    sufficiently descriptive of the hinder legs of the hound; for although the
                    “large haunch and well-trussed thigh” of the former denote power and muscle,
                    nevertheless there is a length of thigh discernible in first-rate hounds, which,
                    like the “well let-down hock” of the horse, gives them much superiority <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> speed, and is also a great security against laming
                    themselves in leaping fences, which they are more apt to do when they become
                    blown, and consequently weak. ' The fore legs “<hi rend="italic">straight as
                        arrowd</hi> ’ is an admirable illustration of perfection in those parts, by
                    Beckford; for, as in a bow, or bandy-legged man, nothing is so disfiguring to a
                    hound as his having his elbows out, which is likewise a great check to speed. In
                    some countries the round, catlike foot is indispensable, and agreeable to the
                    eye in all; but we would not reject a well-shapen puppy in other respects for
                    somewhat of an open foot, provided his ancles or fetlocks were good, <hi
                        rend="italic">a point we consider of the greatest consequence to all
                        quadruped animals.</hi> The shoulders of the fox-hound should resemble those
                    of the horse—oblique, but at the same time strong; for a narrow chested hound is
                    almost certain to get shaken by hard work, and consequently unlikely to endure
                    beyond his third season.</p>
                <p part="N">As Beckford recommends the small head, we may presume the form and
                    fashion of this point began to be changed in his time, and has, we think, been
                    carried to too great an excess in the fox-hound of the present day, particularly
                    in one or two kennels (the Belvoir, for example), where very short, as well as
                    small heads, are a leading characteristic. For ourselves, we like some length of
                    head in the fox-hound, not being able to divest ourselves of the idea of a cross
                    with the pointer when we see him with a short head and a snubbed nose. Beckford
                    also says the neck should be thin. We would add, <hi rend="italic">moderately
                        thin.</hi> We dislike a thin neck in any animal but the cow or the stag; at
                    the same time we dislike a short, thick neck in a hound. His neck should be
                    moderately long and moderately thick, with the muscles clearly developed; it
                    should rise gracefully out of his shoulders, with a slight curve or crest, and,
                    to completely satisfy the eye, should be quite free from exuberances of flesh
                    and hair on the lower side of it, called by huntsmen “chitterlings” or ruffles,
                    the hound having them being termed “throaty although there are numerous
                    exceptions to this rule, as some of the best hounds England ever saw have been
                    throaty; and although we are aware that one individual instance will prove
                    neither the rule nor its exception, we can go as far back as to Mr Meynelľs
                    famous stallion hound Gusman, for as throaty, and yet as good a fox-hound as we
                    ever remember to have seen. We agree with Beckford, that the “tail,” now called
                    stern, of a hound, should be “thick,” and moderately “brushy and if well
                    carried, it is a great ornament to a fox-hound. But there is one part of it
                    which the master of a pack likes to see nearly deprived of its covering, and
                    that is its tip, which, when in that state, is an infallible proof of a hound
                    being a good, and not a slack, drawer of covers. As a perfect model we refer to
                    the portrait of Nosegay, a hound belonging to the Earl of Kintore. Plate
                    CCXCIV.</p>
                <p part="N">But to return to breeding the fox-hound. In the breeding of some
                    animals, beauty of shape is often dependent on the caprice of fashion, or the
                    taste of the breeder; but in the breeding of hounds no such latitude can be
                    given, for here beauty, or symmetry of shape, is alone in reference to utility,
                    and adaptation of parts to the purposes to which they are to be applied. Yet the
                    breeder of foxhounds has one point further to go; he must, as we before
                    remarked, guard against <hi rend="italic">propensities,</hi> which run in the
                    blood of these animals perhaps stronger than their good qualities, and will
                    sooner or later break out in their work. In the election then of a dog for a
                    bitch, or a bitch for a dog, these matters must be attentively considered; and
                    no man should breed from hounds of either sex that come under any of the
                    following denominations, viz. not of a docile sort, but very difficult to enter
                    to their game; given to run mute; to hang on a scent; or to be skirters; not <pb

                    />only not true to the line, but given to run riot either in ’ cover or in
                    chase; and, above all things, if found evidently deficient in nose, and not able
                    to run at head. Good constitution should likewise be looked to; but we would not
                    reject a stallion hound, or a brood bitch, merely for being slack drawers, or
                    for not being always at the head in chase, provided they were well bred, of good
                    form, and true to the line, in cover, and out.</p>
                <p part="N">As to the proper combination of form, that must be self-evident to the
                    breeder of hounds. If a bitch is a little high on her leg, or light, she should
                    be put to a shortlegged, strong dog, and of course <hi rend="italic">vice
                        versa;</hi> if rather light in her tongue, that defect may be remedied by an
                    opposite property in a dog. The defects in legs and feet can only be remedied by
                    such means; and fortunate is it for the owner of an otherwise perfect and
                    excellent bitch, that such remedies are at hand. Length and shortness of frame,
                    as well as coarse points, are all to be obviated and altered in the same way,
                    making allowance for the fact, that the laws of nature are not <hi rend="italic"
                        >always</hi> certain. Constitution can likewise be mended by having recourse
                    to that which is good (and none so easily detected as the dog’s); and colour
                    changed if required. In fact, as Beckford says, “It is the judicious cross that
                    makes the complete pack and it was the remark of this practical writer, and
                    therefore high authority amongst sportsmen, that “he saw no reason why the
                    breeding of hounds may not improve till improvement can go no further.” The
                    question may be asked, is not his prediction verified?</p>
                <p part="N">But the act of crossing hounds, as indeed all other animals, although
                    never thoroughly divested of chance, is one of more difficulty than most people
                    would imagine, and one indeed which, by its results, would often baffle, if not
                    puzzle, the profoundest of our modern physiologists. Our space will not admit of
                    our going at length into this intricate subject, but great mistakes, we
                    conceive, have been made by masters of fox-hounds, in breeding too much
                    in-and-in, from nearest affinities, instead of having recourse to an alien
                    cross. This was peculiarly apparent in the packs of two very celebrated masters
                    of fox-hounds, the late Sir Thomas Mostyn, Bart., and the late John Corbet, Esq.
                    of Sundorne Castle, Shropshire (the former of whom hunted Oxfordshire, and the
                    latter Warwickshire, each for upwards of thirty years), who bred in-and-in, Sir
                    Thomas from a bitch called <hi rend="italic">Lady,</hi> and her produce; and Mr
                    Corbet from a hound called <hi rend="italic">Trσjan,</hi> and his produce, to
                    the great injury of their respective packs. We are aware it is asserted that a
                    pack of fox-hounds should have the appearance and character of being of one
                    family; but this expression is not to be taken in its literal construction. It
                    is in the conformity of their character and appearance that they should bear a
                    close resemblance to each other, and not in their close consanguinity. It is
                    true, the celebrated pack of Mr Warde, the present father of the field, and a
                    master of fox-hounds for the unparalleled period of fifty-seven years, which
                    sold for two thousand guineas, only contained, in 1825, three couples of hounds
                    not of his own blood, and those the produce of one stallion hound, Mr Assheton
                    Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Reubens.</hi> But we have no proof of Mr Warde’s
                    hounds being better for adhering so closely to his own sort; on the contrary, it
                    is the opinion, we believe, of the sporting world, reluctantly admitted, in
                    consideration of the well-merited celebrity of their owner, that, latterly, the
                    slackness of this renowned pack, unrivalled in fine form, •vas to be attributed
                    to that circumstance. On the other hand, the rare but valuable combination of
                    dash and nose, a match for the cold and ungenial Oxfordshire hills, for which
                    the Duke of Beaufort’s pack has been so long conspicuous, has been traced to his
                    Grace’s late huntsman, Philip Payne (said by Colonel Cook, in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Observations on Fox-Hunting,</hi> to be “the best judge of
                    breeding hounds in the kingdom”), going from home for his blood, and sending his
                    bitches to the celebrated stallion hounds of the best kennels within his reach.
                    This, however, it must be remembered, is not within the command of every man’s
                    purse, the expenses attending sending bitches to a distance, under any
                    circumstances, being heavy; as not only must they be placed under the care of a
                    trusty servant on their journey, but there are other occult expenses attending
                    them, which none but masters of hounds are aware of. It is, however, a notorious
                    fact, that the produce of some stallion hounds, if they have a fair chance by
                    the bitch, seldom fail in turning out well; and perhaps the most signal instance
                    of “like begetting like” in this species of animal, is that of Mr Osbaldeston’s
                    Furrier having been the sire of an entire pack in that gentleman’s kennel when
                    he hunted the Quorndon country in Leicestershire, which he would occasionally
                    take to the field, amounting to more than thirty-five couples, although, as may
                    be supposed, they were generally mingled with the rest of his kennel, which at
                    that period contained a hundred couples of hounds. These Furrier hounds gave
                    little trouble in the entering of them, and proved very true line-hunters, and
                    every thing that fox-hounds should be. The annals of fox-hunting likewise record
                    similar instances of the peculiar properties of stallion hounds transmitting
                    their virtues to many succeeding generations, especially in the instances of the
                    Pychley Abelard, the Beaufort, and the New Forest Justice, Mr Ward’s Senator, Mr
                    Meynelľs Gusman, Mr Musters’s Collier, Mr Corbet’s Trojan, Lord Yarborough’s
                    Ranter, with many others of more recent days, but too numerous to mention
                    here.</p>
                <p part="N">The size, or, we should rather say, the height, of a foxhound, is a
                    point upon which there has been much difference of opinion. The long-established
                    pack of the late Mr Chute were at least three inches below the standard of his
                    neighbour Mr Villebois’s large pack; also as much below that of his Grace the
                    Duke of Cleveland, who had for many years also a large and a small pack; and at
                    least four inches lower than Mr Warde’s, in whose kennel were hounds full
                    twenty-six inches high. Various arguments are made use of by the advocates of
                    large and small hounds. Those of the former assert that they get better across a
                    deep and strongly fenced country than smaller ones; whilst the admirers of the
                    latter insist upon their being better climbers of hills, more active in cover,
                    and quicker out of it when their fox is gone; and are oftener found to be
                    perfect in form and shape. As to uniformity in size, how pleasing soever it may
                    be to the eye, it is by no means essential to the welldoing of hounds in the
                    field, and has been disregarded by some of our first sportsmen, the great Mr
                    Meynell for one, who never drafted a good hound for being over or under size;
                    neither did Mr Assheton Smith, when he succeeded to his, Mr Meynelľs, country.
                    The great object of both was to breed them with muscular power and bone,
                    combined with as much symmetry as could be obtained; and •to be equal in speed
                    and good qualities, rather than equal in height.</p>
                <p part="N">We consider the proper standard of height in fox-hounds to be from
                    twenty-one to twenty-two inches for bitches, and from twenty-three to
                    twenty-four for dog hounds. The minimum and maximum size of the last fifty years
                    would have been found in the kennels of Mr Chute and Mr Warde; the Duke of
                    Cleveland and Mr Villebois coming next to Mr Warde in what may be called the
                    maximum class. Mr Chute’s motto over his kennel door was, “multum in parvo,”
                    which was his great aim; and although very full of power, and particularly neat
                    in appearance, his hounds did not'more than average twenty-one inches. On the
                    other hand, many of Mr Warde’s bitches, the most splendid animals of their kind
                    and sex the world has ever yet seen, were better than twenty-three, and some of
                    his dog hounds twenty-six inches high, which <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193648221?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8221-0702"/>was about
                    the standard of the original Devonshire staghounds. It may be said of hounds,
                    however, as h as been said of horses, that their height has little to do wi th
                    their size, as far at least as their powers of action are concerned; and
                    doubtless in all animals that labour, a medium height is the best.</p>
                <p part="N">The amount of hounds bred annually will depend on the strength of the
                    kennel, and the number of days hunting in the week which the country they are
                    intended for requires. From sixty to eighty couples are about the complement for
                    a four-days-a-week country, which will require the breeding of a hundred couples
                    of puppies every year, allowing the usual diminution of the entry by
                    malconformation, under size, and that bane to the kennel, the distemper, which
                    often takes off a moiety of them. As the period of gestation in the female dog
                    is somewhat over two calendar months, the fox-hound bitch should, if she can be
                    spared, be put to dog in January, as then she will litter in the spring, when
                    the weather is comparatively mild (cold being destructive of young animals of
                    this sort), and the puppies will then come early into kennel, generally be of
                    good size, and powerful; and be entered without loss of time. The tips of their
                    sterns being pinched off, and their dew-claws cut, whelps should be taken to
                    their walks at about two months old; and if to one where there is plenty of milk
                    or whey, they will be the better for it. Whelps walked at butchers’ houses grow
                    to a great size, but they are apt to be heavy-shouldered and throaty, and
                    otherwise out of shape. If possible to avoid it, puppies should never be tied
                    up, as perpetually drawing at the collar-chain throws their elbows out, and
                    otherwise damages their legs, particularly by spreading their feet, and altering
                    the form of their ancles, although it is sometimes almost impossible to avoid
                    it, from their proneness to do mischief. If old bitches are bred from, they
                    should be put to young dogs, and of course <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and a bitch should not be worked for at least the last
                    month of her time; and immediately on her whelps being taken from her, a dose of
                    physic should be given her.</p>
                <p part="N">It is said that the dog in a state of nature is subject to few diseases,
                    and for these he finds his cure by an instinctive faculty; in a domesticated
                    state, however, he is subject to many, and some of an awful nature, which maybe
                    classed among the <hi rend="italic">opprobria medicorum,</hi> no certain remedy
                    being discovered for them. Amongst these is one called the distemper, not known
                    by our forefathers, but at present become a sort of periodical disorder in
                    kennels, to the destruction of thousands of young hounds annually. The first
                    symptoms of this disease are, generally, a dry husky cough; want of appetite,
                    and consequent loss of flesh; extreme dulness, and a running from the nose and
                    eyes. As the disease advances, it is attended with twitchings of the head, while
                    the animal becomes excessively weak in the loins and hinder extremities; is
                    greatly emaciated; runs at the eyes and nose, and smells very offensively. At
                    length the twitchings assume the appearance of convulsive fits, accompanied with
                    giddiness, which cause the dog to turn round; he has a constant inclination to
                    dung, with obstinate costiveness at one time, or incessant purging at another.
                    Finally, the stomach becomes extremely irritable; every thing swallowed is
                    instantly thrown up; and the dog generally dies in a spasmodic fit.</p>
                <p part="N">For the cure of this disorder many remedies have been prescribed; but as
                    none of them can be relied upon as specific, we decline giving them,<note

                    of an intelligent and experienced huntsman in the service of a noble duke,
                    accompanied by a comment upon it by a noble lord, also a practical sportsman,
                    hunting his own fox-hounds.</p>
                <p part="N">“As soon,” says the former, “as the young hounds come in from quarters,
                    a sharp look-out is kept for the distemper; and as soon as any of its symptoms
                    appear, a dose of cold-drawn castor oil is given, and the following morning a
                    dose of calomel and jalap. About seven grains of the former and twenty of the
                    latter made into a bolus, and put over their throats before they have tasted any
                    thing, and their heads coupled up above the level of their bodies for two hours,
                    so as to prevent them from vomiting up the medicine, which they are certain to
                    do if this is not carefully attended to. They are then to have their broth and
                    their meat. The oil and bolus to be repeated in a day or two as symptoms
                    require; that is to say, if the fever runs high, repeat the bolus, and, if only
                    to keep the bowels open, the oil in small quantities. Indeed the great thing is
                    attending to circumstances, and acting accordingly; as, for instance, nothing
                    can be more different than when flux attends the distemper, and when fits and
                    obstinate costiveness is the case. I believe, however, that at first a good
                    scouring in both cases is of service. In flux, of course, don’t repeat the
                    calomel, but take moderate means to stop it, as flux in a minor degree tends to
                    keep off both fever and fits. To allay the flux, arrow-root, or boiled milk and
                    flour porridge. There is no doubt that laudanum is the surest method to stop it,
                    but then it is sure to end with fits. Fits at the beginning are no bad sign, and
                    at the end nothing can be worse. I never either approved of bleeding or vomiting
                    in the distemper; the first weakening too much, the latter creating and adding
                    to the irritableness of their stomachs.”</p>
                <p part="N">“With the foregoing plain, sensible, and simple treatment,” says the
                    noble lord in his comment on the foregoing observations, “my junior experience
                    perfectly agrees with the opinion of; but I revert to what he justly adds about
                    ‘ circumstances,’ and differ with him about the bleeding, as I think a good
                    scouring out, and bleeding, before any thing symptomatic of the disease has
                    fairly begun, highly commendable. But, <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> for
                    instance, if you bleed after the disease has fairly taken root, the lungs, nine
                    cases in ten, being affected, it is ten to one you kill the dog; but if done
                    early in the day, I cannot but think it is of much service, prevents fever, and
                    in many cases makes the disease less violent. I think perhaps the treatment of
                    whelps, after they come in from their healthy walks to the close confinement of
                    sometimes an ill-kept kennel, is the cause of the distemper taking more violent
                    hold of ,them than it otherwise would do; and amongst the hundred pretended
                    receipts of many huntsmen, the remark is a justly correct one, of what <hi
                        rend="italic">may</hi> cure one dog will kill another. But here and his ‘
                    circumstances’ put you right. What might be advisable would be this: As soon as
                    your puppies come in, look them attentively over; divide the well-walked whelps
                    from those that have been ill walked; bleed and scour well out the fat lot,
                    paying of course attention to their diet, cleanliness, and exercise; and cherish
                    the poor lot by the best food, giving them the castor oil without the calomel or
                    the lancet. But a lot of well-bred fox-hound whelps are not to be left to the
                    care of a whipper-in or a boiler, unless he is a perfectly sober, attentive,
                    experienced man; for in this disease in the animal, aş in the human species, the
                    patient must be most attentively and closely watched.” <pb break="no"

                    and the cooking of it, is such as man might not only not reject, if necessity
                    compelled him to have recourse to it, but such as he would thrive and do well
                    upon. It is a common expression, that “any thing will do for dogs,” and
                    experience informs us they will exist upon very miserable fare; but hounds, <hi
                        rend="italic">to be in condition,</hi> must have every thing good of its
                    kind, and also well cooked. Were a master of hounds, or huntsman, of the present
                    day, to follow Beckford’s advice, of putting his hounds to a horse fresh killed,
                    after a hard day, his brother sportsmen would think him mad; nor is there
                    scarcely any thing now used in our first-rate kennels but the best oatmeal
                    (Scotch or Irish is the best), one year old, and well-boiled horse flesh, quite
                    free from taint. The meal is put into the copper when the water boils, and
                    should be boiled up a second time, and, in all, for at least two hours; for
                    nothing is worse for the wind of hounds than meal not thoroughly boiled. When
                    taken out of the boiler, it forms a substance resembling coarse rice pudding;
                    and when the fresh flesh, which is shredded, and the broth in which it is
                    boiled, are added to it in the trough, and very well mixed, it forms the best
                    and highest food that can be given to hounds. In some kennels, after the example
                    of that famous huntsman the late Thomas Oldacre, the meal and flesh are boiled
                    up together, with the idea that more of the virtue of the flesh is then imparted
                    to the meal than when it is merely mixed with the broth; but the practice is not
                    general. But such is the difference of constitution in hounds, and the aptitude
                    of some, over others, to gain flesh, or become foul, persons who are particular
                    as to the condition of their pack have troughs filled accordingly, that is, one
                    with thinner food than another, for hounds of the former description. No animal
                    in the world is so soon up and down in his condition as the dog; and, strange as
                    it may appear, the effect of two or three extra mouthfuls of thick meat will be
                    visible on some hounds on the second day after they have eaten them.
                    Nevertheless, the dog being strictly a carnivorous animal, cannot stand hard
                    work without flesh, which he should have a fair allowance of once a day,
                    according as his constitution may require it. Some masters of hounds, however
                    (the justly celebrated Mr Ralph Lambton one of them), do not feed with flesh on
                    the day before hunting, giving only meal and broth; and this on the supposition
                    that the faculty of scent is more delicately susceptible without it. Young
                    hounds lately come from walks should be fed twice in the day, as they do not
                    always, at first, take to kennel food.</p>
                <p part="N">Colonel Cook is thus explicit and correct on the subject of feeding
                    hounds, and their condition, the result of many years experience, and great
                    attention to the kennel. ’ * It is quite certain,” says he, “a hound too high in
                    condition cannot run a burst, neither can a poor half-starved one kill an
                    afternoon fox; a hound, therefore, cannot be considered as fit to be brought
                    out, if he is either too high or too low. I like to see their ribs, but their
                    loins should be well filled up, and they should be hollow in their flanks: he
                    that is full in the flanks is sure to be fat in the inside, and consequently not
                    fit for work. The feeding of hounds, and the bringing them to cover, able to run
                    a burst, or kill an afternoon fox, is not altogether a thing so easy as some
                    people imagine; in fact, it requires nearly as much trouble to get a hound into
                    condition as it does a horse; and if the greatest attention is not paid to this
                    particular, you cannot expect to catch many foxes. It is the condition of a
                    hound which gives him the advantage over the animal he hunts. Nevertheless their
                    constitutions diffe as much as those of the human species; some requir∣ thick
                    food, others thin; the same quantity which may b requisite for Ranter, if given
                    to Rallywood, would rende him unable to run a yard. Some time before huntin (say
                    about three weeks), they should have plenty of wall ing exercise, and salts
                    given them once a week. If hound is at any time very foul, the following receipt
                    i very efficacious :—Three grains of AEthiops mineral, fiv grains of calomel,
                    made into a ball: the hound must c course be carefully kept from cold
                    water.”</p>
                <p part="N">In the summer time, when hounds are out of work, the do not require
                    flesh more than twice a week, and succu lent vegetables in their food areat this
                    time useful. The are also physicked and bled at the close of one season, an&lt;
                    before the commencement of the next; and, if necessary dressed over with a
                    sulphureous mixture during the idL months. But some owners of hounds, and
                    huntsmen object to dressing them, conceiving that it opens then pores too much,
                    and subjects them to rheumatic affec tions.</p>
                <p part="N">One recent and great improvement in kennel disciplin¢ is, a small
                    reservoir of water within the walls, of sufficient depth to cleanse the legs of
                    hounds, but not to wel their bodies, which they are made to walk through
                    immediately on their coming home. Upon being turned intc their lodging room,
                    they commence licking themselves dry, which, as a dog’s tongue is proverbially
                    called his “doctor,” is most beneficial to their feet, by clearing them of sand
                    or gravel, as well as healing any trifling wounds which they may have received.
                    In the Duke of Cleveland’s kennel, this reservoir is filled with broth, which,
                    in addition to its healing properties, induces hounds to lick their feet still
                    more than water does. In flinty countries, the feet of hounds are very
                    frequently wounded, which is a great disadvantage to those a little inclined to
                    do wrong, as they are compelled to miss their turn, and so get above themselves.
                    It also obliges a gentleman to keep a larger number of hounds than this country
                    would otherwise require.</p>
                <p part="N">Hounds are fed on the day before hunting about eleven o’clock <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a. μ.,</hi> but some delicate feeders require to be let
                    into the troughs a second time. After hunting, they are fed as soon as they have
                    licked themselves dry, which, by the warmth that arises from their bodies when
                    shut up, is very soon effected; and in the summer time it is reckoned safer to
                    feed them in the evening, as they then rest quieter throughout the night, and
                    are less disposed to quarrel.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Colour of Hounds.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Independently of the justness and elegance of figure in animals, which
                    adapt them to the uses or ends of their creation, nature has been profuse in the
                    adornment of the surface of their bodies by various beautiful colours. But in
                    proof that the Creator never errs from his design in any of the qualities he has
                    communicated to his creatures, and that he adorns not merely for the sake of
                    ornament alone, these beauties conferred upon them are found greatly to
                    contribute to their well-being; for with them they have received the
                    consciousness of possessing, and a desire to preserve them. In fact, it is this
                    which attaches them so closely to their being, and renders them so attentive to
                    cleanse, ornament, and take care of themselves, as we every day see they do; and
                    to preserve, in all its lustre, the enamel which nature has given them. And we
                    may <hi rend="italic">go</hi> even one step farther than this. An. accurate
                    observer of animals will perceive, that they are not only conscious of their own
                    beauty, but are capable of beholding and admiring it in others. This is
                    undoubtedly the case with regard to both sexes of the same species: never are
                    they so atten <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648247?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-8247-0704"/>tive to display the graces which nature has
                    bestowed upon them, never are they so ostentatious, as when they are together,
                    which is evident from their gambols and frolics; and, if we may judge of them
                    from our own feelings, how greatly must this disposition contribute to their
                    mutual felicity.</p>
                <p part="N">In no animal is variety of colours more conspicuous than in hounds, and
                    it adds greatly to their appearance when we see them in a body in the kennel,
                    but still more so in the field. The prevailing ones with the fox-hound are
                    these: Tan (not common); black (not common); black and white and tan (the most
                    common); milk white (not common); red (very rare); blue (the same). Next come
                    the blended, or mixed colours, known in the kennel as “pies.” There is the red
                    pie; the blue pie; the yellow pie; the grey pie; the lemon pie (very handsome);
                    the hare pie; and the badger pie, which last is very characteristic of the
                    fox-hound. The fox-hound is sometimes ticked, that is, his coat is dotted with
                    small white specks on a dark ground, but he is rarely what is called “mottled”
                    (motley); and, we believe, what is known by <hi rend="italic">“a</hi> blue
                    mottled hound” is not to be found among fox-hounds, being peculiar to harriers
                    and beagles. There was for many years a pack of “blue mottled” harriers kept
                    near Croydon, in Surrey.</p>
                <p part="N">It is asserted that the original colour of the English fox-hound was
                    fallow, or pale yellow (Shakspeare speaks of a fallow <hi rend="italic"
                        >greyhound)</hi>; and we are inclined to this opinion from its being spoken
                    of in several old works upon hunting, as the “best colour for hounds that hunt
                    the hart or roe ;” and there can be no doubt of our fox-hounds being originally
                    descended from that breed of dog, be it what it may. As we know that a
                    recurrence to original colour frequently takes place in animals and 15irds,
                    after its disappearance throughout several generations, this may probably
                    account for the various pied hounds we see in kennels, the produce of hounds of
                    distinct colours, perhaps merely black and white, and often of those nearly
                    black. Moreover, at Ashdown Park, in Berkshire, an old seat of the Craven
                    family, there is a picture of a pack of fox-hounds, above a hundred years old,
                    in which every hound is either fallow coloured or red.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The Tongue, or Cry of Hounds.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">During the early stages of mental progress, the ear is of more
                    importance to man than the eye. Indeed at all times sounds, by association,
                    become the signs of ideas; and the great variety in the voice of nature must
                    have been designed to meet the peculiar tastes and purposes of the countless
                    multitudes that dwell on the face of the earth. That the cry of hounds is a
                    voluntary noise, proceeding from a powerful organic impulse, is quite apparent,
                    as is also the purpose for which the impulse is given; namely, to announce their
                    having discovered the scent of an animal, either obnoxious to their notice, or
                    desirable as food, and by calling their straggling companions together, and
                    uniting their forces, the better to enable them to secure their prey. On the
                    other hand, here is mercy shown to the prey they are in pursuit of. The tongue
                    of the hound gives notice of his approach; and he does not pounce upon his
                    victim as the silent greyhound does, which Gratius, in his poem on coursing,
                    alludes to in the following verse :—</p>
                <p part="N">“Sic canis illa suos taciturna supervenit hostes.”</p>
                <p part="N">But the cry of hounds, melodious and heart-cheering as it even now is,
                    has lost much of its poetical interest, from the change man has made in the
                    natural organization of the animal from which it proceeds; and we shall never
                    again hear of a master of a pack, after the manner of Ad- ' dison’s knight,
                    returning a hound that had been given to him as an “excellent bass,” whereas the
                    note he wanted was a “counter-tenor.” The great Beckford, however, was something
                    of the worthy knight’s opinion; for he says, in his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts
                        upon Hunting,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">If</hi> we
                    attended more to the variety of the notes frequently to be met with in the
                    tongues of hounds, it might greatly add to the harmony of the pack.” This is
                    well in theory. The natural organization of the dog is musical; he is, in fact,
                    a victim to musical sensibility; and we may reasonably suppose that the notes of
                    his companions in the chase may be as pleasing to himself as to his huntsman;
                    but we more than doubt whether a huntsman of this day would draft a highly-bred
                    and beautiful young bitch, as good too as she looks to be, merely because her
                    light, fox-hunting tongue might be somewhat drowned, and now and then lost, in
                    the general chorus of the pack. He would rather say, “<hi rend="italic">Let
                        every tongue be α fox,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N"><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        phrase.</p></note> and I’ll leave the rest to chance.” But, on a good day
                    for hearing it, what <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> sound is more delightful and
                    animating than that of hounds in full cry, in the deep recesses of an
                    echo-giving wood? Neither would those writers who have availed themselves of the
                    beauty and sublimity which allusions to sounds in nature stamp on their various
                    compositions, have at all descended from their eminence if they had, like
                    Shakspeare, delighted as much in bringing the soul in contact with such a sound
                    as this, as with the rolling of the thunder, or the howling of the storm.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The Age of Hounds.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The dog exhibits no exact criteria of age after the first two years,
                    during which time the whiteness and evenness of his teeth are a pretty certain
                    test of his not exceeding that period. An old hound, however, cannot be mistaken
                    if only looked in the face, where he shows old age nearly as distinctly as man.
                    As to the length of services of hounds, that depends upon circumstances. Few are
                    found in a kennel after their eighth year, and <hi rend="italic">very few</hi>
                    after their ninth; and not many hard-working hounds can “run up,” or keep pace
                    with the rest, after their fifth season at most. Hounds are in their prime in
                    the third and fourth years; and although there are a few instances, such as Sir
                    Richard Sulton’s Lucifer, the Beaufort Nector, and the Cheshire Villager, of
                    their hunting in their twelfth, eleventh, and tenth year, the average of their
                    work cannot, we fear, be placed beyond four seasons. Old hounds are useful in
                    the field, but when they cannot run up with the pack, they should be drafted.
                    The perfection of a pack consists in the great body of it being composed of
                    hounds <hi rend="italic">quite in their prime.</hi><hi rend="italic">Separation
                        of the Sexes.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The separation of the sexes in the kennel <hi rend="italic">and in the
                        field</hi> is one of the late innovations in the sporting world, and
                    generally considered as a good one. In the first place, it pleases the eye to
                    see a pack of hounds nearly all of a size, which cannot be the case when it is
                    composed of dogs and bitches mixed; and the character of the animal is likewise
                    more uniformly displayed when confined to one individual sex. Secondly, by the
                    total separation of dogs and bitches in the kennel and in the field, the former
                    are less inclined to quarrel, and the latter are more at their ease, than when
                    subject to the constant, and, at times, importunate solicitations, of the male
                    sex. Of their performances in the field, however, when taken into it separately,
                    some difference of opinion exists; and each <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193648260?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8260-0705"/>sex has its
                    advocates. With a good fox before them, and a warm scent, bitches are decidedly
                    quicker, and more off hand in their work, than dog hounds; but with a colder

                    are superior in “<hi rend="italic">dash”</hi> which, Beckford says, is the
                    distinctive characteristic of a fox-hound, we bejieve is universally
                    acknowledged; and a celebrated master of hounds,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Sir Bellingham Graham, Bart, of
                            Norton Conyers, Yorkshire.</p></note> who hunted them himself several
                    seasons in Leicestershire, has been heard frequently to say, that if his kennel
                    would have afforded it, he would never have taken a dog hound into the field.
                    That, in the canine race, the female has more of elegance and symmetry of form,
                    consequently more of speed, than the male, is evident to a common observer; but
                    there is nothing to lead us to the conclusion, that, in the natural endowment of
                    the senses, any superiority exists. It is however remarkable, that the Latins,
                    when speaking of hunting, or “sporting dogs,” as we call them, generally use the
                    feminine gender, one instance of which is to be found in the second ode of the
                    fifth book of Horace <hi rend="italic">(multa</hi><hi rend="italic">cane),</hi>
                    which ode every sportsman ought to read, as it gives so pleasing a picture of a
                    country life.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Names.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The naming of hounds and horses has nearly exhausted human invention, as
                    well as classical research. Beckford furnishes a list of more than eight hundred
                    names for hounds, alphabetically arranged. But the naming of hounds is somewhat
                    under metrical control; for it is not only confined to words of two and three
                    syllables, but their quantity, or rather their time, must be consulted. For
                    example, a dactyl, as <hi rend="italic">Lucifer,</hi> answers well for the
                    latter; but who could holloa to <hi rend="italic">Aurora?</hi> a trochee, or an
                    iambus, is necessary for the former, the spondee dwelling too long on the tongue
                    to be applied smartly to a hound. But there ought to be a nomenclator, as of
                    old, at every kennel door; for it is but few persons unconnected with a pack
                    that can recollect their names until after a rather long acquaintance with them,
                    from the great similarity of form, character; as well as sometimes of colour,"
                    in old-established kennels. “How is it possible,” said a young master of
                    fox-hounds a few years ago, <hi rend="superscript"> li</hi> that I should
                    distinguish every hound in my kennel by his name, when I find <hi rend="italic"
                        >three</hi> spots on one side of their body, and <hi rend="italic">five</hi>
                    perhaps on the other ?” There have been, however, and still are, persons who can
                    see a large kennel of hounds <hi rend="italic">once</hi> drawn to their feeding
                    troughs, and call them all by their names afterwards, the result alone of a keen
                    and practised eye.</p>
                <p part="N">The price of hounds is strangely altered within the space of half a
                    century, or less; and on this subject we cannot do better than quote Colonel
                    Cook. “Hounds,” says he (p. 6), “have always been much undervalued; we sometimes
                    hear of eight hundred or even a thousand guineas as the price of a hunter, and
                    the sum of three or four hundred is often considered as a mere trifle; whereas a
                    pack of hounds, <hi rend="italic">on which every thing depends,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     smallcaps"> ∖nvls</hi> only considered
                    worth a few hundreds. Yet Shakspeare himself appears to have known the value of
                    a hound; for in his “Induction” to the <hi rend="italic">Taming of the
                        Shrew,</hi> a nobleman returned from hunting thus speaks of his hounds with
                    delight to his huntsman:</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Nobleman.</hi> Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my
                    hounds; Brach Merriman,—the poor cur is emboss’d, And couple Clowder with the
                    deep-raouth’d brach.</p>
                <p part="N">Saw’st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good, At the hedge-corner, in
                    the coldest fault?</p>
                <p part="N">I would not lose the dog for <hi rend="italic">twenty pound.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Huntsman.</hi> Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord; He cried
                    upon it at the meerest loss, And twice to-day pick’d out the dullest scent;
                    Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</p>
                <p part="N">“The sum of twenty pounds for a single hound in Shakspeare’s time,”
                    continues the colonel, “and that not the best in the pack either, was no
                    inconsiderable price. I am not alluding to <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> a lot
                    of curs ;’ but surely a well-bred, established pack of fox-hounds, including
                    brood bitches, and puppies at walk, must be cheap at a thousand or twelve
                    hundred pounds.”</p>
                <p part="N">Now the value of anything is what it will fetch; and how far an
                    established pack of fox-hounds is cheap at a thousand or twelve hundred pounds,
                    is a matter <hi rend="italic">of</hi> consideration with reference to
                    concomitant circumstances; but that they will have cost the seller a great deal
                    more, there can be no doubt. We should put the average price at something less
                    than either of the above sums, although, within the last dozen years, several
                    packs have been sold for the former sum; and the justly renowned one of Mr
                    Warde, the present Father of the Field, fetched two thousand guineas; and the
                    late Lord Middleton gave Mr Osbaldeston the same sum for ten couples of hounds
                    out of his kennel.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The Harrier.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The modern harrier bears no greater resemblance to the one in use fifty
                    years back, than the hunter of the present day to that ridden by our
                    grandfathers. In fact, he is now nothing less than the fox-hound in miniature,
                    which it is the endeavour of all breeders to have him. Their qualities also are
                    as opposite as their form, the one delighting to dwell upon the scent, the other
                    a little inclined, perhaps, to the other extreme. But the taste of the day for
                    all sports of the field would not endure the tedious exactness of the old
                    psalm-singing harrier; and not only in point of diversion, but on the score of
                    the <hi rend="italic">pot,</hi> the balance is greatly in favour of the improved
                    variety. Before the old-fashioned harrier, the hare had time to play all sorts
                    of tricks, to double on her foil, and so stain the ground that she often escaped
                    by such means; whereas the modern hound, if the scent be tolerably good, forces
                    her from her foil to fly the country, and very often beyond her knowledge, when
                    a good straightforward run is the almost invariable result. The observation of
                    Mr Beckford holds good here. He could not, he said, imagine a hound too <hi
                        rend="italic">well</hi> bred to show sport, and kill his game; but he could
                    readily conceive the reverse, when the game ran stout and well.</p>
                <p part="N">To Sir John Dashwood King, Bart, of West Wycombe Park, Bucks, is the
                    credit due for what may be termed the living model of the present improved
                    harrier; and so characteristically stamped are his sort of hound, now widely
                    spread, that they are recognised by a sportsman at the first glance. Their
                    standard height did not exceed eighteen inches, and therefore, in that respect,
                    they were not an overmatch for their game; but from the great equality of their
                    size and speed, combined with rare hunting qualities, they killed more hares,
                    with good runs, than any other pack in the kingdom, and for many, many years in
                    succession certainly “bore the bell.” Sir John kept them more than thirty years,
                    at Bourton-on-the-Hill, Gloucestershire, near the four-shire stone on the Oxford
                    and Worcester road, where his father kept them before him; hunting partly in the
                    vales of Warwickshire and Worcestershire, and partly over the Cotswold Hills,
                    which latter country is famous for the stoutness of its hares, frequently
                    standing an hour before this celebrated pack, after having been driven beyond<pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193648273?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8273-0706"/>
                    their knowledge by their <hi rend="italic">pressing</hi> method of hunting up to
                    them, a method quite unpractised by the old long-eared harrier. The parent stock
                    of this pack was a small fox-hound from the Duke of Grafton’s kennel, called
                    Tyrant, whose blood, form, and character, were strikingly apparent throughout;
                    and so great was its celebrity, that it fetched the highest price ever known to
                    be given for harriers, namely, seven hundred guineas, by Lord Soudes of
                    Rockingham Castle, Northamptonshire. Sir John, however, deserved success. He
                    bred upwards of seventy couples of hounds every year, and had an establishment
                    of horses, &amp;c. nearly equal to fox-hounds. The harehounds bred for many
                    years by Mr Yeatman of Stock House, Dorsetshire (who lately resigned the
                    Blackmore vale country, in which he hunted foxes), came next to Sir John’s in
                    the true form and character of the modern harrier.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The Stag-Hound.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The English stag-hound is now known only by name, as there are none of
                    the breed kept for the purpose of hunting the wild stag; and such deer as are
                    turned out before his majesty’s, and the few other packs that follow this game,
                    are hunted by fox-hounds of the highest blood that can be procured. And the
                    change is a good one; for although the English stag-hound was a noble animal of
                    his kind, he was not sufficiently speedy, nor perfect in his work, to satisfy
                    the present taste, and he was likewise too much given to dwell on the scent in
                    chase, as well as of very delicate constitution in kennel. He is originally
                    supposed to be the produce of the old English blood-hound, by a cross of some
                    kind of greyhound, such as the Highland deer-greyhound, approximating his own
                    form. At all events, it is certain that the former, the blood-hound, was the dog
                    first made use of in hunting deer in England; and it is probable that, as the
                    taste for following hounds on horseback increased, a turn of speed was given to
                    the original breed by a cross with a speedier sort. We may add, the old
                    paintings of English stag-hunting favour this hypothesis.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The Beagle.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">This variety of the dog is now nearly extinct, and for the same cause as
                    the stag-hound. Time is at present considered as too precious to afford an hour
                    at least, and perhaps two, to the hunting down one hare, which is now
                    accomplished in a more off-hand manner, in twenty minutes. To an admirer of
                    nature, however, and of the endowments given to inferior animals, the busy,
                    intelligent, and highly-gifted beagle certainly affords a treat. His form, also,
                    when not out at his elbows, is handsome in the extreme, and his perseverance in
                    chase is exceeded by none. But he has one of the greatest faults that hounds can
                    possess; he is noisy, and dwells upon the scent, whilst his game is flying the
                    country before him. In fact, his only use or value now is (independently of
                    being looked at and admired, for he is a perfect animal of his kind), to
                    accompany a brace of greyhounds when a hare is wanted, and not ready at hand.
                    There is, however, one pack of beagles kept in Dorsetshire, known as the
                    Mountain Harriers, whose performances are much spoken of in the sporting
                    world.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The Greyhound.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The greyhound has now lost his place in the catalogue of the dogs used
                    in chase, neither can be classed as such, since man has deprived him of the
                    necessary faculty of smell; but he was held in such high estimation in the
                    middle ages, as to be considered as the peculiar companion of a gentleman. He
                    never went abroad without these dogs; the hawk which he bore upon his fist, and
                    the greyhounds which ran before him, were certain testimonies of his rank; and
                    in the ancient pipe rolls, payments appear to have been often made in these
                    valuable animals. But at no period of his existence was the greyhound the
                    symmetrically elegant animal we now see him, nor possessed of nearly so much
                    speed; neither was the diversion of the leash at any time carried on with so
                    much spirit as within the space of the last thirty years, in various parts of
                    Great Britain. But the necessity for, or rather the cause of, the change in the
                    form of the greyhound, may be traced to his being no longer, as formerly, made
                    use of to course and pull down deer, but chiefly to exhibit his speed at our
                    different spirited coursing meetings, for the various prizes contended for, as
                    also in private matches.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">Courser s Manual or Stud Book,</hi> by Thomas
                    Goodlake, Esq. (1828), has the following interesting passages on the alteration
                    effected in this species of dog. “In the days of Elizabeth,” says the author,
                    “the greyhound seems to have been a fine and effective animal, but approaching
                    more to the bony, wire-haired make of the Highland greyhound represented in the
                    pictures of Edwin Landseer, and deficient in the symmetry and fine glossy coat
                    which mark a high-bred kennel of modern times. It is probable, that during the
                    early part of the seventeenth century, judicious crosses were made, partly from
                    the beautiful Italian greyhounds, which we often see in family pictures,
                    accompanying our fair ancestresses in their parks and plaisances, and partly
                    from the stouter breed of dogs represented in Flemish hunting-pieces; and that
                    even Persia and Arabia, whose greyhounds are not to be despised in point of form
                    and speed, contributed their quota of blood; as it is shown by the history of
                    Cromwell’s Coffin Nail, that the wealthier gentry of that period spared no
                    expense or pains in improving the more highly-prized breeds of sporting animals.
                    If we mistake not, some of the pictures of Charles the First contain portraits
                    of greyhounds approaching nearly in point of coat and shape to the present
                    breed.”</p>
                <p part="N">Speaking of the late Lord Orford, who, with respect to modern coursing,
                    laid the foundation-stone of the celebrity to which it has arrived, and who,
                    besides being celebrated for his greyhounds, established the first coursing club
                    that we read of, at Swaffham in Norfolk, in the year 1776, the same writer says,
                    “A few anecdotes of this noble patron of coursing may not be uninteresting. He
                    was passionately fond of the sport; and as he was a man who never would do
                    things by halves, but was zealous beyond measure in succeeding in whatever he
                    undertook, he may be said to have made as much progress as possible in
                    perfecting the breed of the greyhound, and encouraging an emulative spirit in
                    coursing amongst his opulent neighbours, from the time he took it up till his
                    death. Indeed, his extensive property, and his influence as lord-lieutenant of
                    Norfolk, gave him the greatest means of accomplishing his favourite object. He
                    could command such an immensity of private quarters, or walks as they are
                    generally called, for greyhounds, that he bred largely, and few possessed the
                    same advantages of selection. He is recorded as. having at one time fifty brace
                    of greyhounds; and it was his fixed rule never to part with a single whelp till
                    he had had a fair trial of his speed; consequently he had chances beyond almost
                    any other individual, of having a collection of very superior dogs. Intent on
                    obtaining as much perfection in the breed as possible, he introduced every
                    experimental cross, from the English lurcher to the Italian greyhound. He it was
                    that first thought of the cross with the English bull-dog, in which he
                    persevered in opposition to every opinion, until, after breeding òn for seven
                    removes, he found himself in possession of the best greyhounds at the time ever
                    known; and he considered that this cross produced the small ear, the rat-tail,
                    the fine, thin, silky <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648286?mode=fullsize"

                    which the high-bred greyhound should possess, preferring death to relinquishing
                    the chase.” There is something curiously analogous in the sense conveyed by the
                    concluding words of this extract. His lordship fell dead from his horse
                    immediately after witnessing the triumph of his famous bitch Czarina, in a match
                    at Swaffham, having been in vain admonished on the impropriety of taking the
                    field in his then indifferent state of health; and his memory is introduced as a
                    toast at most coursing meetings, as father and patron of the sport.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">The Terrier.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The terrier is no longer the accompaniment to a pack of fox-hounds, and
                    for the best of all reasons,—foxes are not nearly so often digged for as
                    formerly; and his only use was, by his bay, to inform the diggers whereabouts
                    the fox lay; and we suppose he took his name from his being so eager to get
                    under ground. There is also a second reason why he is better left at home. He
                    was seldom steady from <hi rend="italic">icing, if</hi> he was from <hi
                        rend="italic">foot,</hi> and thus often the cause of riot. It was, however,
                    a matter of astonishment to behold those which were very highly bred, making
                    their way, as they did, to the end of the longest chases, over strong and wet
                    countries, as well as through the thickest covers, and so often making their
                    appearance at the end of them. At all events, if left behind, they were sure to
                    find their way home in the course of the night, whatever the distance might be.
                    One peculiarity of form was essential to their being sure of getting up to their
                    fox, viz. not too full in the shoulder; and those whose colour was pure white,
                    and who were broken-haired, were generally most esteemed by huntsmen. It was
                    often their lot to lose their life, by scratching up the earth behind them, and
                    cutting off their means of retreat; and they were now and then killed by a fox,
                    the latter a rare occurrence. They were commonly entered to a badger, whose bite
                    is more dangerous than that of a fox.</p>
