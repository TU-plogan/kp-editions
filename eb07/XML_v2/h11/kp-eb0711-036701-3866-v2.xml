                    of the Earl of Peterborough, who had commanded in Spain; and being the same year
                    made master of Drury-lane Theatre, he wrote his first tragedy, called <hi
                        rend="italic">Elfred,</hi> or the Fair Inconstant. In 1710, he became master
                    of the opera-house in the Haymarket, and wrote an opera called Rinaldo, which
                    met with great success, being the first that Handel set to music after he came
                    to England. Unfortunately for Mr Hill, he was a projector as well as poet, and
                    in 1715 obtained a patent for extracting oil from beech-nuts; an undertaking
                    which miscarried after engaging his attention for three years. He was also
                    concerned in the first attempt to settle the colony of Georgia, from which he
                    never reaped any advantage; and in 1728 he made a journey into the Highlands of
                    Scotland, in prosecution of a scheme of applying the woods there to
                    ship-building; but in this he also lost his labour. Mr Hill seems to have lived
                    in perfect harmony with all the writers of bis time, except Mr Pope, with whom
                    he had a short paper war, occasioned by that gentleman’s introducing him in the
                    Dunciad as one of the competitors for the prize offered by the goddess of
                    Dulness. Mr Hill, amongst many other pieces, also wrote one called <hi
                        rend="italic">The Northern Star,</hi> upon the actions of Peter the Great;
                    and for this he was several years afterwards complimented with a gold medal from
                    the Empress Catharine, agreeably to the czar’s desire before his death. His last
                    production was <hi rend="italic">Merope,</hi> which was brought upon the stage
                    in Drury Lane by Mr Garrick. He died on the 8th of February 1749, and after his
                    decease four volumes of his works in prose and verse were published in octavo,
                    and his dramatic works in two volumes.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Hill,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir John,</hi> a
                    voluminous writer, and singular character, was born about the year 1716. He was
                    originally bred an apothecary; but his having married early, and without a
                    fortune, made him very soon look around for other resources than his profession
                    supplied. In the year 1746, he translated from the Greek a small tract by
                    Theophrastus, θn Gems, which he published by subscription; and which, oeιng well
                    executed, procured him friends, reputation, and money. Encouraged by this, he
                    engaged in works of greater extent and importance. The first he undertook was a
                    General Natural History, in three vols, folio. He next engaged, in conjunction
                    with George Lewis Scott, in furbishing a Supplement to Chambers’s Dictionary. He
                    at the same time started the British Magazine; and whilst he was engaged in a
                    great number of works, some of which would seem to have claimed the continued
                    attention of a whole life, he carried on a daily essay, under the title of
                    Inspector. Amidst this hurry of business, Mr Hill was so laborious and ready in
                    all his undertakings, and was withal so exact an economist of his time, that for
                    many years he scarcely ever missed a public amusement, where, whilst he relaxed
                    from the severer pursuits of study, he gleaned up articles of information for
                    his periodical works. It would not be easy to trace Mr Hill through all his
                    various pursuits in life. He obtained his doctor’s degree from the university of
                    St Andrews. A quarrel he had with the Royal Society, for being refused admission
                    as a member, provoked him to ridicule that learned body, in a review of the
                    works of the Royal Society, 4to, 1751. This, together with his writing upon all
                    subjects without reserve, made him şink in the estimation of the public nearly
                    at the same rate at which he had ascended. He found, as usual, however,
                    resources in his own invention. He applied himself to the preparation of certain
                    simple medicines, as the essence of water-dock, tincture of valerian, balsam of
                    honey, and the like. The well-known simplicity of these medicines made the
                    public judge favourably of their effects, insomuch that they had a rapid sale,
                    and önce more enabled the doctor to figure in that style of life which was so
                    congenial to his inclination. He obtained the patronage of the Earl of Bute,
                    through whose interest he acquired the management of the royal gardens at Kew;
                    and, to wind up the whole of an extraordinary life, having a little before his
                    death seized an opportunity to introduce himself to the knowledge of the king of
                    Sweden, that monarch invested him with the order of knighthood, which he had not
                    the happiness of enjoying above two years. He died near the close of the year
                    1775.</p>
