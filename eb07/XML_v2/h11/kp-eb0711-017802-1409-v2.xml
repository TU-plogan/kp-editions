                <p part="N"><label type="entry">HAZLITT, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>,
                    a very distinguished writer on miscellaneous subjects, was a native of
                    Shropshire, and the son of an Unitarian clergyman. The date of his birth has not
                    been ascertained; but he received his education at the College at Hackney,
                    belonging to the religious persuasion with which his father was connected. After
                    finishing his academical studies, Mr Hazlitt commenced life as a painter, and by
                    this means gained such a knowledge of the principles of art as qualified him for
                    criticising works of that description, in which he greatly excelled. That he
                    would ever have become eminent as an artist is doubtful; for his love for the
                    fine arts was throughout his life intense; and if he had felt himself capable of
                    producing a work which might have raised him to fame, it seems highly probable
                    that he would have persevered. However, some of his copies from pictures in the
                    Louvre, by Titian and Raffaelle, have been spoken of as spirited and beautiful.
                    Mr Hazlitt was induced, from some cause or other, to quit the pencil for the
                    pen. His first acknowledged literary production was an essay on the “Principles
                    of Human Action;” a work in which he displayed considerable originality and
                    acuteness. In 1808 he published, in two vols. 8vo, “The Eloquence of the British
                    Senate,” being a selection of the best speeches of the most distinguished
                    parliamentary orators from the beginning of the reign of Charles I. to the
                    present time, with notes, biographical, critical, and explanatory. Shortly after
                    this work appeared, Mr Hazlitt obtained an introduction to Mr Perry, then editor
                    of the Morning Chronicle newspaper, by whom he was engaged to report
                    parliamentary speeches, and furnish original articles. To this newspaper he
                    contributed a series of able theatrical and dramatic criticisms. As a political
                    writer he is said to have showed himself somewhat intemperate, and his
                    compositions required to be carefully weeded of strong expressions. In the art
                    of reporting he is said to have displayed but little skill; indeed, a man of his
                    peculiar temperament was not likely to submit to the drudgery which that
                    occupation requires before excellence can be attained. Accordingly, a separation
                    took place between him and Mr Perry; and, besides being engaged upon another
                    morning paper, he was employed by the booksellers in contributing to various
                    periodical publications.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1810 appeared a work of his entitled a “New and Improved English
                    Grammar, for the use of Schools,” in which the discoveries of Mr Horne Tooke,
                    and other modern writers, on the formation of language, are incorporated. This
                    work was printed in 12mo, with another upon the same subject; and an abridgment
                    of it appeared in 1812. In 1817 appeared “The Round Table,” a collection of
                    Essays on Literature, Men, and Manners. These papers had already been published
                    in a periodical work, in a series of weekly essays. During the same year, his
                    “Characters of Shakspeare’s Plays” appeared in one volume 8vo; and in 1518 he
                    published a “View of the English Stage,” containing a series of dramatic
                    criticisms. Mr Hazlitt was in 1818 engaged to deliver, at the Surrey
                    Institution, lectures upon English poetry, which he after? wards published in
                    one vol. 8vo. He subsequently gave to the world, at different intervals, “Table
                    Talk;” the “Spirit of the Age,” being criticisms upon the talents and character
                    of the most conspicuous men of the day; and “The Plain Speaker,” being a
                    collection of articles of his which had previously appeared in different
                    periodical works. He also published “Political Essays and Sketches of Public
                    Characters ;” an “Account of British Galleries of Art;” a “Letter to William
                    Gifford, Esq. ;” “Wine and Walnuts, or after-dinner chit-chat,” two vols. 8vo;
                    the “Literature of the Elizabethan Age ;” the “Modern Pygmalion ;” and the “Life
                    of Napoleon,” in four volumes. This last is his largest and most elaborate
                    production; and although strongly tinged with party feeling, and partaking more
                    of a series of reflections upon events than a minute detail of them, it is a
                    work of much power, and evinces no ordinary degree of philosophical penetration.
                    His last works were, “Notes of a Journey through France and Italy,” and
                    “Conversations of James Northcote, Esq.,” the latter of which appeared at the
                    moment of his death, which took place at London, on the 18th of September 1830.
                    He was twice married, and left an only son. Amongst the periodical works to
                    which Mr Hazlitt lent the assistance of his pen, was the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Edinburgh lieview,</hi> to which he contributed various articles, some of
                    them possessing extraordinary merit. The article on the “Fine Arts” in this work
                    was also written by him.</p>
                <p part="N">The writings of Mr Hazlitt display much originality and genius, united
                    with great critical acuteness and brilliancy of fancy. In the fine arts, the
                    drama, and dramatic literature, he was considered as one of the ablest critics
                    of the day. But he was rather acute than profound; and he displayed an excessive
                    fondness for paradox, united with a somewhat prejudiced adherence to his own
                    opinions. He was impatient of mental drudgery; and in his haste to reach
                    conclusions, he often dispensed with the labour of previous investigation. Hence
                    the theories which he proposes are seldom brought out with that elaboration and
                    logical precision which carries conviction. There is also a want of sequence or
                    continuity in his style; and he rarely produces a strong or lasting impression
                    upon the mind of the reader. He gives, in abrupt and strikihg sentences, the
                    results of his thoughts; but he does not, by means of proof, convincingly
                    develope his critical doctrines. In reasoning to establish any given point, his
                    arguments do not naturally grow out of each other; and his sentences, though
                    brilliant, and, when taken separately, pregnant with meaning, are only connected
                    together by a very obscure chain of relation. There seems to have been a want of
                    proportion, of balance, and of harmony in his powers. His mind was essentially
                    imaginative, and, aspiring after ideal beauty and goodness, he frequently fell
                    into extravagance and mysticism. His imagination was powerful, and he possessed
                    a rich store of ideas, which were profusely scattered over every page he wrote,
                    without much regard to either order or propriety. He is said to have read but
                    little; but this can only apply to him in the latter years of his life. That he
                    had read attentively the standard English authors, is evident from his writings;
                        <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641422?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-1422-0179"/>and that they had made a strong impression
                    upon his mind; is evinced by the frequency with which he quotes them, sometimes
                    to the detriment of his style, which, in consequence, assumes an appearance of
                    patchwork. In politics, Mr Hazlitt warmly espoused liberal principles; and the
                    ardour with which he wrote in their defence exposed him to much contumely and
                    ridicule. His prejudices were strong; and he displayed considerable caustic
                    bitterness of style, when personally attacked. He was, we believe, himself
                    rarely the aggressor; and although wayward and self-willed, his temper is
                    represented as being placable and mild. An able writer thus speaks of him: “His
                    mind resembles the ‘ rich stronde’ which Spencer has so nobly described, and to
                    which he has himself likened the age of Elizabeth, where treasures of every
                    description lie, without order, in inexhaustible profusion. Noble masses of
                    exquisite marble are there, which might be fashioned to support a glorious
                    temple; and gems of peerless lustre, which would adorn the holiest shrine. He
                    has no lack of the deepest feelings, the profounđest sentiments of humanity, or
                    the loftiest aspirations after ideal good. But there are no great leading
                    principles of taste to give singleness to his aims, nor any central points in
                    his mind, around which his feelings may revolve, and his imaginations cluster.
                    There is no sufficient distinction between his intellectual and his imaginative
                    faculties. He confounds the truths of imagination with those of fact, the
                    processes of argument with those of feeling, the immunities of intellect with
                    those of virtue. Hence the seeming inconsistency of many of his doctrines.”<note

                    But with all these drawbacks and imperfections, Mr Hazlitt was a powerful and an
                    eloquent writer; and whether his opinions are just or profound, no one can deny
                    that they are strikingly expressed. His article upon the Fine Arts, in this
                    work, is one of the ablest and most striking that the subject ever called forth,
                    and would alone entitle him to high distinction amongst the writers of his time.
                    His lectures on the dramatic literature of the age of Elizabeth form his best
                    work of literary criticism. His admiration for the writers of that period was
                    intense, and he descants upon their beauties with the most eloquent and joyous
                    enthusiasm. But his Life of Napoleon, with all its manifold imperfections, is
                    perhaps his greatest work, and will probably remain the most enduring record of
                    the strength and versatility of his genius. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r.
