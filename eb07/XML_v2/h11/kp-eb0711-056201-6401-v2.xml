                    Ο. one of the most celebrated of the Roman lyric poets, who was born on the 8th
                    of December, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 65, and died at the age of
                    fifty-seven, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 8. He was the son of a freedman of
                    Venusia, a small village on the confines of Apulia and Lucania. His father’s
                    employment seems to have been that of an auctioneer <hi rend="italic">(Sat.</hi>
                    i. 6, 86); but he possessed also a small landed property, which, however, he
                    soon abandoned to proceed to Rome, where he had a better opportunity of
                    attending to the education of his son. The studies of the young poet were
                    directed by the most eminent scholars of which Rome could then boast, and
                    amongst others by Orbillius Pupillus, a celebrated philosopher. Towards his
                    twentieth year Horace followed the custom which was then prevalent amongst the
                    young Romans, and proceeded to Athens with the view of studying under the
                    philosophers which that city still produced. He seems first to have directed his
                    attention to the doctrines of the Academic School, though he was afterwards
                    captivated by the more congenial philosophy of the Epicureans; and the general
                    complexion of his life seems to have been influenced by this predilection,
                    though, towards its close, he seems to have leaned a little towards the sterner
                    and nobler creed of the Porch. He does not, however, acknowledge himself as the
                    partisan of any peculiar system <hi rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> i. 1, 13), but,
                    like most of the eminent Romans of his time, was of the Eclectic School, which
                    pretended to be a selection of the more reasonable doctrines of all the others.
                    The murder of Caesar, and the disturbances which ensued <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.
                        c.</hi> 43), interrupted the philosophical studies of Horace. His feelings
                    led him to support the cause of freedom, and he became a tribune in the army of
                    Brutus; but his conduct at the battle of Philippi, which he has himself
                    characterised with equal candour and naïveté, showed that he was not qualified
                    to distinguish himself in the career of arms. He took advantage of the amnesty
                    which the conqueror found it politic to grant after this unsuccessful attempt at
                    resistance, and returned to his native country, where he found little cause of
                    satisfaction either in the political aspect of the times, or in the events which
                    had taken place in his own family. The death of his father had left him to his
                    own resources, and his small patrimony had been confiscated in consequence of
                    the part which he had taken in public affairs. It was about this time that he
                    seems first to have attracted notice by his poetical genius, and to have become
                    acquainted with the poets Virgil and Varius. Through their interest he was
                    introduced to Maecenas and Augustus, who not only admitted him to their intimate
                    friendship, but presented the poet with a small property in the country of the
                    Sabines, where he spent the greater part of his life in the quiet enjoyment of
                    rural happiness. Here he composed most of those works which have immortalized
                    his name.</p>
                <p part="N">The works of Horace are of two kinds; lyric and didactic. To the first
                    class belong the Odes, and in the latter we reckon the Satires and Epistles,
                    which are often distinguished by the general name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sermones</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Eclogae.</hi> (See Bentley, <hi
                        rend="italic">Prafat. ed. Horat.}</hi> Though Horace was only pursuing the
                    path in which he had been preceded by Lucilius, still we must consider the
                    appearance of his Satires as constituting a new era in this particular species
                    of composition. The overthrow of the Roman republic, and the consequent check
                    given to freedom of speech, the change which had taken place in political
                    affairs, and the personal connection of the poet with Augustus, Maecenas, and
                    the other distinguished men of the emperor’s court, may well be supposed to have
                    been little calculated to produce a satire of the peculiar character and freedom
                    of Lucilius. Satire of such a kind was not only impracticable, but would have
                    been without interest and without effect from the change which had taken place
                    in the modes of thinking amongst the Romans. Such a change could not escape the
                    notice of a man so clear headed and well acquainted with the world as the poet;
                    the acts of men around him seemed to him to be the result of folly, and in this
                    ridiculous light he presents them before us in his Satires. The object which he
                    had in view was not so much to lash with all the power of indignant virtue the
                    crimes of mankind, and thereby to procure their amendment, as, by the employment
                    of the most delicate irony, and by laughter and ridicule, to draw them to the
                    path of virtue. It was in this way alone that he could hope to improve the
                    character of his contemporaries. The Satires of Horace supply in some degree the
                    absence of all pure Roman comedy, representative of their actual life and
                    manners. They may be considered as a mirror, in which the details of private
                    life, and the every-day transactions of the times, are faithfully reflected. The
                    Epistles resemble the Satires in character, except that they teach more directly
                    lessons of virtue and morality.</p>
                <p part="N">Horace was a poet in his philosophy, and a philosopher in his poetry. He
                    viewed the one through the medium of the imagination, and attempered the other
                    with the sober spirit of truth. His observation is intuitive and unerring, his
                    ridicule keen but not envenomed; he laughs at human follies without attempting
                    to depreciate or degrade human nature; his sarcasms, though cutting, are felt to
                    be just as well as polished; and we recognise in him the Democritus of poetry,
                    who employed ridicule as an instrument of correction, not of malice. Hence his
                    writings, with which we are familiar from boyhood, carry with them attractions
                    which are felt in every period of life, and in almost every rank of society.
                    They charm alike by the harmony of the numbers, the purity of the diction, the
                    correctness of the imagery, and the justness of the sentiments. They exhilarate
                    the gay, and interest the serious, according to the nature of the subject upon
                    which the poet exercises his power. Professing neither the precision of
                    analysis, nor the copiousness of system, they possess advantages which analysis
                    and system rarely attain. They exhibit human imperfections as these really are,
                    and human excellence as it practically ought to be; they develope every
                    principle of virtue in morals, and point out every modification of decorum in
                    manners; they please without the glare of ornament, and instruct without the
                    formality of precept. These exquisite compositions are the productions of a mind
                    enlightened by study, and invigorated by observation; they are comprehensive,
                    but not visionary; delicate, but not fastidious; in them sagacity is unwarped by
                    prejudice, and generosity uncramped by suspicion. They are distinguished by
                    diction always adapted to the sentiment, and by efforts nicely proportioned to
                    the occasion. They exhibit elegance without affectation, sublimity without
                    bombast, satire without buffoonery, philosophy without mysticism. Hence it is
                    that the writings of Horace are more extensively read, more clearly understood,
                    and more acutely relished, than those of almost any other ancient author; they
                    are perfect models of their kind, and will pass down to the most distant
                    posterity as among the most finished and faultless productions of the classic
                    muse.</p>
                <p part="N">Numerous editions have been published of his works, but the best are
                    those by Gesner, Lips. 1752, 1772; Bentley, Cantab. 17] 1; Doring, Lips. 1803;
                    Fea, Rom. 1811; to which may be added the more recent editions of Wakefield,
                    Hunter, and Mitscherlich. The first four books of the Odes have been translated
                    into English verse by ‘Wrangham (Lond. 1820), and the Satires and Epistles by
                    Dunster (1712).</p>
