                        >Antiquity,</hi> the judges of the court of <hi rend="italic">Helioea.</hi>
                    They were so called, according to some authors, from a Greek word which
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">to assemble in a great number</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> but, according to others, from another word which signifies <hi
                        rend="italic">the sun,</hi> because they held their assemblies <hi
                        rend="italic">sub dio.</hi> They composed not only the most numerous, but
                    likewise the most important of the Athenian tribunals; for their province was
                    either to explain obscure laws, or to give new vigour and authority to those
                    which had been violated. The Thesmothetae convoked the assembly of the
                    Heliastae, which sometimes amounted to a thousand, sometimes to fifteen hundred,
                    judges. Mr Blanchard is of opinion, that, to make up this number, the
                    Thesmothetae sometimes summoned those of each tribe who had last quitted the
                    public offices they had exercised in another court. But, however this may be, it
                    appears that the assemblies of the Heliastae were not frequent, as they would
                    have interrupted the jurisdiction of the stated tribunals and the common course
                    of affairs.</p>
                <p part="N">The Thesmothetae paid to each member of this assembly, for his
                    attendance, three oboli, which are equal to two Roman sesterces, or to half a
                    drachma. Hence Aristophanes terms them “the brothers of the triobolus.” They
                    were likewise condemned to pay a fine if they came too late; and if they did not
                    present themselves till after the orators had begun to speak, they were not
                    admitted. Their attendance was requited out of the public treasury, and their
                    pay was called <hi rend="italic">misthοs heliasticοs.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The assembly met, at first, according to Aristophanes, at the rising of
                    the sun. If the judges were obliged to meet under cover on account of frost and
                    snow, they had <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641851?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-1851-0212"/>a fire; but there is not a passage in any
                    ancient author which informs us of the place where these assemblies were held
                    either in the rigorous or in the mild season. We only learn that there was a
                    double enclosure around the assembly, that it might not be disturbed. The first
                    was a kind of arbour-work, from space to space, separated by doors, over which
                    were painted in red the ten or twelve first letters of the,Greek alphabet, which
                    directed the entrance of the officers who composed the tribunal, each of them
                    entering under the letter which distinguished his tribe. The beadles of the
                    court, to whom they showed the wand which had been sent them by the Thesmothetae
                    as a summons to meet, examined its mark to see if it was authentic, and then
                    introduced them. The second enclosure, which was at the distance of twenty feet
                    from the former, was a rope or cord, that the people who stood round the first
                    enclosure, and were desirous to see what passed within the second, might not be
                    prevented from gratifying thcir curiosity at a proper distance. Thus the
                    attention of the judges was not interrupted by the concourse of the multitude,
                    many of whom were heated by views of interest or of party.</p>
                <p part="N">To each of the members of the assembly were distributed two pieces of
                    copper; one of which was perforated, not certainly that it might be
                    distinguished from the other by feeling, for these assemblies met at the rising
                    and were dissolved at the setting of the sun. Those pieces of copper had been
                    substituted for little sea-shells, which were at first in use. The Thesmothetae
                    read the names of those who were to compose the assembly, and each man took his
                    place as he was called. The Thesmothetae were then sent for, whose function it
                    was to observe prodigies and to superintend the sacrifices; and if they gave
                    their sanction, the deliberations were begun. It is well known that the officers
                    called <hi rend="italic">Exegetoe</hi> were often corrupted by those who were
                    interested in the debates of the assembly, and that they excited tumults sueh as
                    were raised by the Roman tribunes in the popular assemblies convoked by the
                    consuls.</p>
                <p part="N">Of all the monuments which remain relating to the Heliastae, the most
                    curious is the oath which those judges took before the Thesmothetae. Demosthenes
                    has preserved it in his oration against Timocrates, who having been bribed by
                    those who had been intrusted with the effects taken on board a vessel of
                    Naucratis, and refused to give an account of them, got a law passed, by which an
                    enlargement was granted to prisoners for public debts on giving bail.
                    Demosthenes, on making his oration against that law, ordered the oath of the
                    Heliastae to be read aloud, as a perpetual auxiliary to his arguments, and
                    happily calculated to interest the multitude and inflame their passions. This
                    oath was in these terms: “I will judge according to the laws an*d decrees of the
                    people of Athens, and of the senate of five hundred. I will never give my vote
                    for the establishment of a tyrant, or of an oligarchy; nor will I ever give my
                    approbation to an opinion prejudicial to the liberty or to the union of the
                    people of Athens. I will not second those persons who may propose a reduction of
                    private debts, or a distribution of the lands or houses of the Athenians. I will
                    not recall exiles, or endeavour to procure a pardon for those who shall be
                    condemned to die. Nor will 1 force those to retire whom the laws and the
                    suffrages of the people shall permit to remain in their country. I will not give
                    my vote to any candidate for a public function, who gives not an account of his
                    conduct in the office which he has previously filled; nor will I presume to
                    solicit any trust from the commonwealth without subjecting myself to this
                    condition, which 1 mean as obligatory to the nine archons, to the chief of
                    religious matters, to those who are balloted on the same day with the nine
                    archons, to the herald, the ambassador, and the other officers of their court. I
                    will not suffer the same man to hold the same office twice, or to hold two
                    offices in the same year. I will not accept any present, either myself or by
                    another, either directly or indirectly, as a member of the Heliastic assembly. I
                    solemnly declare that I am thirty years old. I will be equally attentive and
                    impartial to the accuser and the accused; I will give my sentence rigorously,
                    according to evidence. Thus I swear, by Jupiter, by Neptune, and by Ceres, to
                    act. And if I violate any of my engagements, I imprecate from these deities ruin
                    on myself and my family; and I request them to grant me every kind of prosperity
                    if I am faithful to my oath.”</p>
                <p part="N">Here we have one of the motives of the meeting of this assembly stated.
                    Aristotle informs us of another, which was by the public authority deputed to
                    them, namely, to elect a magistrate in the room of one deceased. It is
                    surprising that Pausanias, who enters so often into details, gives us no
                    particular account of this assembly. All that he says of it is, that the most
                    numerous of the Athenian assemblies was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Helice.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">We are informed by Diogenes Laertius, in his life of Solon, that it was
                    before one of these Heliastic assemblies that Pisistratus presented himself,
                    covered with wounds and contusions self-inflicted, to excite the indignation of
                    the people against his pretended enemies, who, jealous, as he alleged, of the
                    popularity he had acquired by asserting the rights of his poorer
                    fellow-citizens, in opposition to the men in power, had attacked him whilst he
                    was hunting, and had wounded him in that barbarous manner. His design succeeded,
                    and a guard was appointed him, by the assistance of which he acquired the
                    sovereignty or tyranny of Athens, and kept it during thirty-three years. The
                    power of the assembly appeared remarkably on that occasion; for Solon, who was
                    present, opposed it with all his efforts, but did not succeed.</p>
                <p part="N">As to the manner in which the judges gave their suffrages, there was a
                    sort of vessel covered with an osier mat, in which there were placed two urns,
                    the one of copper, the other of wood. In the lid of these urns there was an
                    oblong hole, which was large at the top, and became narrower downwards, as we
                    see in some old boxes of our churches. The suffrages which condemned the accused
                    person were thrown into the wooden urn, which was termed <hi rend="italic"
                        >hyrios,</hi> whilst that of copper, named <hi rend="italic">ahyros,</hi>
                    received those which absolved him.</p>
                <p part="N">Aristotle observes, that Solon, whose aim was to make his people happy,
                    and who found an aristocracy established by the election of the nine archons,
                    annual officers, whose power was almost absolute, tempered their sovereignty, by
                    instituting the privilege of appealing from <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to the
                    people, who were to be assembled by lot to give their suffrage, after having
                    taken the oath of the Heliastae, in a place near the Panathenaeum, where Hissus
                    had in former days calmed a sedition of the people, and bound them to unanimity
                    by an oath. It has likewise been remarked, that Apollo was not invoked in the
                    oath of the Heliastae, as in the oaths of the other judges. We have observed,
                    that he who took the oath of the Heliastae engaged that he would not be
                    corrupted by solicitation or money. Those who violated this part of their oath
                    were condemned to pay a severe fine. The decemvirs at Rome made such corruption
                    a capital crime. But Asconius remarks, that the punishment denounced against
                    them was mitigated in later times; and that they were expelled the senate, or
                    banished for a certain time, according to the degree of their guilt.</p>
