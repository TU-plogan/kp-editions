                    and, from its affinity or attraction for all other matter, universally
                    distributed amongst the particles of bodies, in quantities proportional to their
                    mutual attractions, or, as it has been termed, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >capacities</hi> of different substances for heat; whilst its tendency to
                    diffuse itself amongst contiguous bodies has been explained on the supposition
                    of its own particles being repellent of each other. The other opinion, which has
                    been maintained by Bacon, Boyle, and several other philosophers, considers heat
                    as a mere quality of matter, and ascribes it to a vibratory movement among the
                    intimate particles of bodies; an idea which was adopted by Rumford, to explain
                    his curious experiments on the excitation and communication of heat by friction.
                    This opinion, however, seems vague and unsatisfactory. If we say that heat is
                    motion amongst the particles of matter, still we have no explanation of the
                    manner in which this motion is produced; for we cannot conceive any movement
                    without an impulse, nor an impulse without a material agent. Heat pervades all
                    sorts of matter: it remains in some circumstances dormant, or, as it is termed,
                        <hi rend="italic">latent,</hi> and may be again elicited from bodies by
                    various means. Did it consist in vibrations or motions of the particles of other
                    matter, it should pervade elastic bodies with the greatest celerity; which we
                    know not to be the fact. It will, for instance, pervade a rod of lead, or of the
                    softest copper, far more readily than an equal length of glass or of marble. If
                    we mingle together equal quantities of water at different temperatures, the
                    resulting temperature will be an exact mean between the extremes. But if heat
                    consisted in such vibrations, there ought to have been a loss of heat, as in all
                    other communicated motions. If we mix together equal quantities of different
                    substances at different temperatures, the resultant temperature is not a mean:
                    one body has lost more heat than the other has appeared to gain, or a part of
                    the heat of the one has become latent in the other, and that in a constant ratio
                    to the power of each substance of absorbing heat, as tried by comparing each
                    with a third body in the same manner. It is very difficult to conceive this
                    species of interchange, if heat merely consisted in vibrations amongst the
                    particles of matter. Still more difficult is it to conceive how a permanent
                    temperature could subsist among a great system of bodies, as the planets, if
                    heat were nothing more than a vibration of the particles of bodies; for the
                    original impulse ought to diminish with each communication.</p>
                <p part="N">It is possible, however, to modify this theory, by supposing that heat
                    is produced not merely by the motions of the particles of the heated substance,
                    but by the vibrations or undulations of a very subtile matter existing in all
                    bodies. This will approximate the vibratory theory to that which has been
                    generally considered as its antagonist, will accord 1 well with some recently
                    discovered facts, and will assimilate the vibratory hypothesis of heat to the
                    undulations ' now so generally received as explanatory of the phenomena of
                    light, to which heat has so intimate a relation.</p>
                <p part="N">Caloric, like light, has been proved to be capable of radiation, of
                    reflection, and refraction, whilst recent investigations have distinctly proved
                    that refracted heat is susceptible of polarisation. But it is transmitted,
                    reflected, refracted, and polarised by different substances in a different
                    manner and degree from light; and hence some have inferred that light and heat
                    are not the same agent, but are produced by different kinds of matter. Other
                    philosophers have regarded them as modifications of the same matter, depending
                    on the greater celerity or velocity of the undulations that produce them. Such
                    speculations, however, are not yet susceptible of any direct proof; and, in the
                    present state of our knowledge, it is safer to consider light and heat as
                    produced by different but intimately connected agents.</p>
                <p part="N">These views lead us to the conclusion that the phenomena of caloric are
                    owing to the movements of a subtile matter, universally diffused throughout
                    other bodieş, the particles of which are strongly repellent of each other, and
                    have an affinity for those of all other bodies, differing in force according to
                    each kind of matter. We may further conceive, that heat or caloric is the cause
                    why the particles of the most solid bodies are not in absolute contact. If we
                    diminish the temperature of a bar of iron, for instance, it shrinks in all its
                    dimensions, z. e. its particles approximate; and the more we reduce the
                    temperature, the nearer they approach. Each particle of matter would seem to be
                    surrounded with an atmosphere of heat, which remains <hi rend="italic"
                        >latent</hi> or quiescent, until disturbed by the approach of bodies of a
                    different temperature, when the vibrations or undulations of the subtile matter
                    of heat are induced, by the tendency of this matter to produce an equilibrium of
                    temperature; and then we become sensible of the existence of heat.</p>
                <p part="N">The subtilty of the matter of heat is such, that we cannot ascertain its
                    accumulation in any body by the nicest balance; its fluidity may be considered
                    as proved by the ease with which it insinuates itself amongst the particles of
                    matter; its affinity for other matter is shown by its being universally
                    contained in all bodies, in proportions differing in each kind of substance; its
                    repulsion amongst its own particles is proved by its tendency to exist in a
                    state of equilibrium in contiguous bodies.</p>
                <p part="N">Our knowledge of the laws which regulate the distribution of caloric was
                    very imperfect when we possessed no other measure of heat than our sensations.
                    The susceptibility of the sense of touch varies in different individuals, and in
                    the same individual at different times. We can even make the same object feel
                    warm and cold to the same person, by previously cooling one hand, whilst the
                    other is immersed in a warm fluid. Hence sensation could never afford any
                    tolerable measure of varying degrees of heat; and we are indebted for more
                    accurate notions on the subject to the invention of <hi rend="italic"
                        >thermometers.</hi> The principle of these instruments depends on the
                    expansion of solids, fluids, or gaseous bodies by heat, and their subsequent
                    contraction on cooling. The construction of these useful instruments will be
                    described under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Thermometer.</hi> It will be
                    here sufficient to state, that though the thermometer affords us indications of
                    the changes in the sensible heat of bodies, it does not give us any information
                    respecting their latent caloric, nor the absolute quantity of heat <pb

                    />they may contain. This mustbe sought for by other modes, which we shall
                    shortly explain, after we have considered the modes in which caloric is diffused
                    amongst bodies, and its general effects on different kinds of matter.</p>
                <p part="N">SECT. II. DIFFUSION OF HEAT.</p>
                <p part="N">The tendency of heat to diffuse itself equally amongst bodies is so
                    great, that we are unable permanently to accumulate it in any substance. All
                    that can be effected in this way by the most skilful contrivances, is to produce
                    some retardation of this dissipation. The mode in which it is diffused through
                    solids, liquids, and gases, is different, and demands a separate
                    consideration.</p>
                <p part="N">I. <hi rend="italic">Diffusion of Heat by Communication.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">1. <hi rend="italic">Diffusion in Solids.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    When we place a heated solid in contact with a colder body, the superabundant
                    caloric of the first immediately begins to flow into the latter. The nearest
                    particles are first heated, and they communicate a portion of their caloric to
                    the second series, and these last to a third, until both bodies acquire a common
                    temperature; and this equilibrium will be established amongst all contiguous
                    bodies. If a bar of iron twenty inches long be heated at one end, it will
                    require four minutes for the smallest sensible increase of temperature to be
                    perceived at the other. Biot has endeavoured to ascertain the rate of this
                    transmission. He employed a bar of iron several feet in length, and bent into a
                    right angle, at one end of which a steady heat of 216° Fahrenheit was applied.
                    Thermometers were placed in holes drilled for tlιe purpose, at intervals of four
                    inches along the top of the bar. In four hours all the thermometers became
                    stationary, the difference between the first and second = 21° ∙50j between the
                    second and third, = 11° ∙25; between the third and fourth, = 7° ∙25; between the
                    fourth and fifth, = 5°; between the fifth and sixth, = 4°; between the sixth and
                    seventh (beyond which no sensible effect was perceptible), = 1° ∙75; which,
                    allowing for the unavoidable errors in such investigations, would show, that,
                    taking the distances in arithmetical progression, the decrease of temperature
                    follows a geometrical ratio in penetrating solids. In such cases, the heat seems
                    to be communicated from particle to particle, and is said to be <hi
                        rend="italic">conducted</hi> through the body.</p>
                <p part="N">All bodies do not <hi rend="italic">conduct</hi> heat with equal
                    celerity. If we place equal thermometers on equal cubes of metal, ivory, marble,
                    and glass, heated by the same source, we shall find that the thermometer placed
                    on the metal will rise soonest; next, that placed on the marble, then those on
                    the ivory and the glass. The most dense bodies conduct heat, in general, more
                    readily than rarer bodies; but experiment shows that their conducting power is
                    not always in the ratio of their density, but probably depends also on their
                    affinity for caloric. Spongy and light bodies are found to be extremely bad
                    conductors of caloric. Silk, cotton, and wool, are especially so; and hence
                    their utility in preserving our animal heat in cold climates. Count Rumford made
                    a series of experiments on the conducting power of different substances of this
                    nature, and found that raw silk, fur, and eider-down, were remarkably bad
                    conductors of heat. They give to us the sensation of warmth, not by
                    communicating heat to our surface, but because their bad conducting power
                    prevents the waste of our animal heat by the ambient air. Their stopping the
                    transmission of heat seems partly to depend on the air they entangle; for, by
                    twisting them, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> by expelling a portion of the air
                    contained in such bodies, their conducting power is increased,</p>
                <p part="N">The facility with which bodies conduct heat is not exactly in proportion
                    to any of their sensible qualities, but is more nearly in the direct ratio of
                    their density than any other quality. This may be ascribed to the greater
                    intensity of the repulsive energy of the atmospheres of caloric surrounding each
                    particle of dense bodies (by reason of their greater proximity) conveying each
                    fresh addition of temperature with greater celerity through such substances. But
                    if we conceive “heat to be a material agent,” this quickness of conducting power
                    may also be modified by the different degrees of affinity between caloric and
                    each kind of matter. However this may be, scarcely any two substances conduct
                    heat with equal facility. Solids conduct much more readily than liquids. Of the
                    former, the best conductors are the metals; and amongst these, the very best are
                    gold, silver, platinum, and copper, whilst iron and lead are among the worst.
                    The rapidity with which silver conducts away heat is well illustrated by
                    wrapping a piece of muslin smoothly round a spoon of that metal, when the muslin
                    may be held in the flame of a candle or a lamp, so as to boil water in the
                    spoon, without burning the muslin.</p>

                    The extreme slowness with which liquids conduct heat is shown by a beautiful
                    experiment of Count Rumford. Freeze a little water in the bottom of a tube, and
                    then pour water over the ice: by inclining the tube, the flame of a lamp may be
                    applied to the surface of the liquid, so as to cause it to boil; and by slowly
                    moving the flame towards the ice, we may raise the water to ebullition in
                    successive portions; yet this ebullition will almost reach the ice before it
                    shows any signs of melting. The same fact is exhibited by fixing an air
                    thermometer in a vessel filled with water to one or two tenths of an inch above
                    the ball of the thermometer, and pouring a little aether on the surface of the
                    water. On kindling the aether, it will burn with a copious flame, without
                    affecting in the slightest degree the submersed thermometer. This extreme
                    slowness of liquids in conducting heat induced Count Rumford to suppose that
                    they were absolute nonconductors of caloric; but this inference is not warranted
                    by his own experiments, and was fully refuted by the investigations of Hope,
                    Murray, and Traill, which proved, that though liquids conduct heat slowly <hi

                        >non-conductors</hi> of caloric.</p>
                <p part="N">If, however, we apply heat to the lower part of a vessel containing any
                    liquid, it rapidly acquires a higher temperature. This, however, is in a

                    the <hi rend="italic">transportation</hi> of its particles in quick succession.
                    In this case the particles nearest the heating cause become specifically lighter
                    by receiving heat; they therefore ascend through the fluid, to which they impart
                    part of their caloric, while their place is supplied by another series of
                    particles, which become heated, and ascend in their turn; and this succession
                    continues until, by these rapid changes, the whole body of the fluid attains its
                    boiling point, if the heat be sufficient for that purpose. These motions may be
                    rendered visible by throwing into the vessel a few particles of matter a little
                    heavier than water, such as powdered amber.</p>
                <p part="N">It is by this transportation of their particles that liquids are

                    conducting power of gases is not so easily ascertained, because it is difficult
                    to separate their conducting power from the effect of radiation of heat through
                    them. The experiments of Professor Sir John Leslie and of Dr Dalton, however,
                    decidedly show a difference in the conducting power of gases, which is also more
                    nearly in the direct ratio of their specific gravity than of their other
                    properties; hydrogen having the lowest conducting power, atmospheric air one
                    considerably higher, and carbonic acid the greatest of all the gases subjected
                    to this examination.</p>
                <p part="N">The difference of bodies in conducting heat is a most important subject,
                    as on it depends not only many of our contrivances to concentrate artificial
                    heat, and apply it to numerous purposes in the useful arts, as the obtaining of
                    metals from their ores; but on it also depend the methods of defending our
                    bodies against external cold. The living system has within itself the power of
                    supporting a nearly equable temperature, notwithstanding the perpetual tendency
                    of contiguous bodies to a common temperature; but if the naked surface be
                    exposed to the elements in our climate, the heat of the body would soon be
                    reduced below what is consistent with health or comfort. To preserve the animal
                    heat, we surround our bodies with bad conductors of caloric, such as woollen,
                    silk, or cotton; and the more imperfectly these defences conduct heat, the less
                    will our temperature be reduced. Hence the worst conducting substances are the
                    most suitable garments for a cold climate; and, in hot latitudes, the comfort of
                    man requires that the coverings of his body should be of the kind that would
                    most rapidly abstract his redundant animal heat.</p>
                <p part="N">Nature has beautifully adapted the covering of the lower animals to the
                    climates they inhabit. The thick fur of the Greenland bear, the musk ox, and the
                    arctic hare, adapts them to the rigours of their native climate; whilst the
                    short and sleek hair of the antelope, the giraffe, the leopard, and the lion,
                    proclaims them denizens of the warmer regions of the earth. Even in the same
                    species inhabiting a changeable climate, nature adapts their covering to the
                    season. The glossy sleekness of the horse, and of our domestic cattle,
                    diminishes toward the close of autumn. The bear, the fox, and the weasels of
                    northern regions, assume a longer and more shaggy coat on the approach of
                    winter; and the sheep, which in Europe is covered with a thick fine wool, an
                    extremely bad conductor of heat, in the burning plains of Africa is clothed only
                    by a short and coarse hair, that presents comparatively a «mall obstacle to the
                    evolution of animal heat.</p>
                <p part="N">In the vegetable kingdom a similar care is bestowed to defend plants
                    from excessive cold. Plants of cold climates, which are perennial, are protected
                    by a considerable thickness of bark; a substance which experiment proves to be a
                    bad conductor of heat. In high latitudes they are further defended against the
                    excessive cold of the climate by a spongy covering of snow, which, until it
                    begin to melt, is found to be a very bad conductor of heat; and therefore tends
                    to preserve the juices of plants from being frozen. Thus trees are more seldom
                    killed by the freezing of their sap, when a fall of snow has preceded an intense
                    frost; an accident not uncommon, even in the temperate climates of the earth, in
                    a long continuance of what is termed a <hi rend="italic">black frost.</hi>
                    Recent voyages of discovery have also shown that the Esquimaux find the
                    excessive rigour of their inhospitable climate very endurable in houses built
                    of'frozen snow.</p>
                <p part="N">II. <hi rend="italic">Diffusion of Heat by Radiation.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The diffusion of heat by the means already noticed is a <hi
                        rend="superscript"> v</hi> comparatively slow process, and is limited to
                    bodies in contact with each other. But heat is capable of being diffused among
                    bodies not in contact. A heated body suspended <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi>
                    emits its excess of heat in all directions; and in air, though much of its
                    caloric apparently passes off with the ascending currents which it produces in
                    the ambient air, the emanations of heat also pass off in directions contrary to
                    these aerial currents. Thus a person standing before a fire perceives its
                    warmth, though a light body like a feather will show that there is a current of
                    air perpetually flowing toward the fire. This emission of heat is termed <hi
                        rend="italic">radiation,</hi> and is analogous to the emanations of light
                    from a luminous object; each point of the heated surface emitting divergent
                    rays, which are subject to the same modifications as those of light, by
                    reflection from polished surfaces, and by refraction through transparent
                    media.</p>
                <p part="N">When the rays of heat fall on a bright metallic surface, they are* <hi
                        rend="italic">reflected.</hi> As early as 1682, Mariotte showed that “the
                    heat of a fire is reflected from a burning mirror, so as to be sensible in its
                    focus; but that it is intercepted by a plate of glass interposed between the
                    mirror and the fire.” The next important step was made by Lambert, who
                    discovered that the heat might be so increased, by employing two concave
                    mirrors, and a charcoal fire placed in the focus of the one, that a combustible
                    might be kindled in the focus of the other. But the most successful cultivator
                    of this branch of science during the last century was Scheele of Sweden, who
                    proved that metallic surfaces are the most powerful reflectors of radiant
                    caloric; that glass is far inferior in this respect; that if we cover the
                    surface of the metallic mirror with a film of lamp-black, it does not reflect
                    heat, but actually absorbs it; that radiant heat is separated from light by
                    interposing screens of glass; and that it passes through air, without suffering
                    any obstruction from the direction of the aerial currents through which it
                    radiates.</p>
                <p part="N">Saussure and Pictet repeated the experiments of Lambert. They showed the
                    instantaneous transmission of heat by radiation; that it was in such experiments
                    material to place the heated body and the thermometer in the focus of each
                    mirror; and that, a very little beyond the focus, the effect was trifling,
                    although the thermometer was nearer the heated body. When the heated body was a
                    red-hot cannon bullet, combustibles were speedily kindled in the focus of the
                    other mirror at the distance of several feet. These researches were greatly
                    extended by Pictet, who showed that a flask of hot water radiated heat which
                    could be concentrated in the focus of a metallic mirror, and thus rendered
                    sensible by a thermometer, showing that the invisible rays of heat might be
                    reflected, as well as those emanated from a hot luminous body.</p>
                <p part="N">The experiments on radiant heat may be exhibited by means of a pair of
                    concave mirrors of well-polished tinned iron, hammered into segments of spheres
                    of about one foot in diameter; but still better with mirrors of thick brass
                    plate, hammered, on Sir John Leslie’s plan, into a parabolic form. The writer of
                    this possesses a pair twenty-two inches in diameter, hammered into a parabolic
                    curve with surprising accuracy, by Mr Alexander Kilpatrick of Edinburgh, with
                    which he has repeatedly melted lead by collecting the sun’s rays in one of them.
                    This form of mirror is the best; because the rays which fall on the mirror
                    parallel to its axis are reflected, not divergingly, but so as to meet in the
                    focus of the parabola.</p>
                <p part="N">Pictet found the sensibility of the thermometer much increased by
                    painting its ball black; and he showed that glass screens intercepted the rays
                    of caloric from burning bodies or a heated bullet; but it was found that the

                <p part="N">Such was the state of our knowledge of radiant heat, when our veteran
                    astronomer, Sir William Herschel, discovered, toward the close of the last
                    century, that rays of heat exist, independently of those of light, in the solar
                    spectrum. When he received the solar rays through a prism of flint-glass, he
                    found that a row of delicate thermometers placed in the coloured spectrum were
                    differently affected at its two extremities. In the violet ray it only rose 2°,
                    in the red ray it rose 7°; but his most interesting discovery was, that half an
                    inch beyond the red ray it was still hotter. These very important results were
                    fully confirmed by Sir Henry Englefield. In one of Englefielďs experiments, the
                    following results were obtained :—In the blue rays, in 3' the thermometer rose
                    2°; in the green, in 3' it = 4°; in the yellow, in S' it = 6°; in the middle of
                    the red, in 2'∙5 it = 16°; in the outer edge of the red, in 2'∙5 it = 17° ∙5;
                    and beyond the spectrum, in 2'∙5 it = 18°. When the bulbs of the thermometers
                    were previously blacked, the full red ray raised the thermometer in three
                    minutes 22°; and jnst beyond the spectrum it rose 33°. Even half an inch beyond
                    the spectrum altogether, the rise was 6° more than in the red ray.</p>
                <p part="N">These experiments show that the refrangibility of the rays of heat and
                    light are different, and that the former are less refrangible than the
                    latter.</p>
                <p part="N">The experiments of Berard and of Leslie confirmed the fact, that the
                    point of greatest heat in the solar spectrum is in the red rays; and Leslie
                    states the result of his experiments to have made the difference between the
                    violet and red as one to sixteen; but neither of these philosophers detected any
                    heat altogether beyond the spectrum. The conclusions of Herschel have, however,
                    been confirmed by more recent investigations; and Śeebeck has shown that prisms
                    of different substances produce a different refraction of the rays of heat. With
                    a hollow prism filled with water, the greatest heat is in the full yellow light;
                    with sulphuric acid it is in the orange; with crown glass it is in the dark
                    limit of the red.</p>
                <p part="N">We may here state, that not long after Herschel’s discovery, Ritter,
                    Wollaston, and Beckmann, simultaneously discovered the existence of other
                    invisible rays in the solar spectrum, which are only known by their chemical
                    effects in decomposing some metallic saline compounds, aš the nitrate of silver.
                    These <hi rend="italic">chemical rays</hi> are the most refrangible of all, and
                    exist in greatest abundance toward the violet end of the spectrum, and even
                    entirely beyond it. Thus the solar spectrum would seem to consist of three
                    species of rays, the luminous, the calorific, and the chemical; all differing in
                    their refrangibility, and in their apparent effects: and if we consider white
                    light as composed of red, yellow, and blue rays, we have five kinds of rays in
                    the solar beam, three of which are visible, and two invisible. In the solar
                    beams these are intimately blended, but may be in some degree separated by
                    refraction through diaphanous prisms. The separation of the luminous and
                    calorific rays may be made by black opake bodies, through which the sun’s heat
                    will penetrate without admitting a single ray of light. The sun’s rays, however,
                    pass through all transparent media, without a separation of light and heat.
                    Glass and ice intercept the rays of terrestrial heat, the first partially, the
                    latter wholly; yet the sun’s rays passing through and collected in the focus of
                    a lens of glass, produce the most intense heat; and Scoresby and others have
                    shown, that a lens of <hi rend="italic">ice</hi> will concentrate the sun’s
                    rays, so as to ignite inflammable substances.</p>
                <p part="N">The publication of Sir John Leslie’s <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the
                        Nature of Heat,</hi> in 1804, forms an important era in the history of the
                    radiation of caloric. This very original and able philosopher, by the simplicity
                    and delicacy of his apparatus, and the ingenuity of ĥis well-devised
                    experiments, did more than has been accomplished by any other individual to
                    develop the laws which regulate the transmission and reception of this
                    mysterious agent; and his work will remain a land-mark in the history of this
                    branch of physical science. In his experiments, a single mirror only was
                    employed; and the source of heat generally used was a cube or square canister of
                    tinned iron placed before the mirror, at the distance of three or four feet,
                    whilst the ball of an air thermometer was placed in the focus of the mirror. The
                    air thermometer employed by him was his own modification of that figured by
                    Sturmius. <hi rend="italic">{Colleg. Curios,</hi> p. 53, 1676.)</p>

                    inches, and were filled with boiling water. When the polished side was turned
                    toward the thermometer, placed at four feet from the mirror, the increase of
                    temperature was no more than 12°; when the glass side was presented, the
                    differential thermometer under the same circumstances rose to 90°; when the
                    papered side was the radiating surface, the temperature was 98°, and the painted
                    side indicated 100°; when the polish of the planished side was destroyed, by
                    ploughing it in one direction with a finetoothed plane, its propelling or

                    file, its effect was as much as 26°. On covering one of the surfaces smoothly
                    with gold and silver leaf, the effect was about equal to the surface of polished
                    tin; a plate of polished iron gave 15°; a surface of fresh lead 19°; but when
                    the same became tarnished, its effect was equal to 45°; and painting it with red
                    oxide of lead raised it to 80° w An amalgam of mercury and tin, when fresh, gave
                    no more than 20°.</p>
                <p part="N">Leslie then investigated the relative <hi rend="italic">receiving
                        power</hi> of different surfaces, by coating the <hi rend="italic">sentient
                        ball</hi> of the differential thermometer with different substances. When
                    that ball was smoothly coated with tinfoil, the effect of the blackened side of
                    the canister was only 2°∙5, or about one fifth of what it produced on the naked
                    ball; and he found, that of either side of the canister the effect was now just
                    one fifth of that observed with the naked ball. On the other hand, when the ball
                    was covered with a coat of china ink, or formed of a black enamel, the effect of
                    either side of the canister was greatly increased.</p>
                <p part="N">The power of surfaces in reflecting heat was also investigated. In fact,
                    it was shown by the last series of experiments with the coated ball; but he
                    proved it also by varying the reflecting surface. When a glass concave mirror,
                    two feet in diameter, was substituted for the metal reflector, the effect of the
                    blackened side of the canister on the naked ball was but just perceptible; and
                    if a film of china ink be spread over the surface of the mirror, even this
                    slight effect totally disappears. If, however, the concave surface of the glass
                    mirror be smoothly coated with tinfoil, the effect of the black side of the
                    canister <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641487?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-1487-0184"/> will be ten times more than with the naked
                    glass surface. Removing the silvering from the back of the mirror produced no
                    effect on its reflecting the calorific rays, neither was this affected by
                    roughening the back of the mirror. Hence Leslie infers, that reflection of heat
                    takes place at the surface of the glass mirror, or principally so.</p>
                <p part="N">A polished tin reflector had its power diminished one third by being
                    coated as smoothly as possible with tinfoil, evidently by the imperfection of
                    the smoothness of its surface. Scratching its surface with sand-paper diminishes
                    its effect one tenth; and he found that the mirror seemed to have its reflecting
                    power more impaired when the scratches were all in one direction, than when they
                    crossed. A film of tallow on the surface of the mirror reduced the effect of the
                    blackened side from 100° to 8°; but if held before the fire until all that could
                    be thus removed had run off, the effect of that side rose to 37°. When the
                    surface of the mirror was covered with a very thin iridescent film of isinglass,
                    the blackened surface gave an effect of 80°; but when that film was only <hi
                        rend="subscript"> τu</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of an inch, the
                    effect was reduced to 15°.</p>
                <p part="N">The results of his experiments with other reflecting surfaces gave the
                    following proportions :—A reflector of polished brass = 100°, of the same coated
                    with tinfoil = 85°, of steel = 70°, of fresh lead = 60°, of glass = 10° ∕</p>
                <p part="N">The inference from these investigations is, that the reflecting power of
                    various surfaces bears some inverse proportion to their propelling and absorbing
                    powers. The numerical results of Leslie’s experiments would give the ratio
                    between metallic surfaces and glass, in reflecting power as ten to one; in
                    propelling power as one to eight; in absorbing power as one to five. It was,
                    however, supposed that some minute circumstances, of which it is difficult to
                    estimate the effect, interfered in the two last processes, and that the
                    propelling and absorbing powers are equal in all bodies: we shall find this to
                    be incorrect.</p>
                <p part="N">One of the most interesting parts of Leslie’s investigations was the
                    effect of screens of different kinds, interposed between the sources of heat and
                    the thermometer. When he interposed a screen of tinfoil, the effect of the
                    blackened side of the canister was 0°; a thin sheet of crown-glass was = 20°; a
                    sheet of common writing paper, placed about two inches from the cube, was = 23°.
                    If the screen of any material was placed one foot from the cube, the effect was
                    only one thirtieth of what it was at the distance of two inches. From this he
                    inferred, that the screen prevents all transmission of radiant heat until it
                    becomes itself heated; and then it radiates from its other surface toward the
                    thermometer. This was confirmed by substituting a plate of ice (a substance the
                    temperature of which cannot rise above 32° F.) for the screen, when the effect
                    was 0°. This view he considered as confirmed by his beautiful contrivance of the
                        <hi rend="italic">double</hi> or compound screen. He coated one side of two
                    plates of glass with tinfoil; when the coated sides were outermost, the
                    thermometer did not rise; when the glass surfaces were outwards, the thermometer
                    rose to 18°. He blackened one surface of two plates of tinned iron; when the
                    blackened surfaces were outwards, the effect was 23°; but if the plates were
                    separated from each other, the thermometer fell back to its former station. When
                    the tinned surfaces were outermost, the thermometer was not at all affected.</p>
                <p part="N">Leslie included his whole apparatus in a trough of water, in such a way
                    as to be able to fill the canister with hot water after the whole was adjusted;
                    but there was no radiation of caloric.</p>
                <p part="N">The inference which this philosopher drew from his investigations is,
                    that heat is an elastic substance, extremely fluid and active; and he advanced
                    strong arguments against the theory which ascribes all the phenomena of heat to
                    vibrations in the particles of matter. (<hi rend="italic">Vide Inquiry,</hi> p.
                    139 to 150.) Yet he is disposed to consider the phenomena of radiation as
                    depending on certain undulations, produced by radiating surfaces in the ambient
                    air. This view has been ably combated by the late Dr Murray, with the sagacity
                    which distinguished that philosopher. But the limits of the present article will
                    not allow us to enter into this part of the subject, for which we must refer the
                    reader to Leslie’s <hi rend="italic">Inquiry,</hi> and Murray’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Chemistry.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The more usually-received theory of radiation is, that from heated
                    bodies emanate rays of caloric in all directions, which proceed through gaseous
                    bodies with little or no sensible interruption, and with amazing velocity; that
                    these rays are absorbed by dark and rough surfaces, and are reflected by
                    polished bright surfaces.</p>
                <p part="N">There is, however, one curious experiment, which is rather difficult of
                    explanation, namely, the seeming <hi rend="italic">radiation of cold.</hi> The
                    Florentine philosophers of the <hi rend="italic">Academia del Cimento</hi>
                    found, that when a mass of snow was placed in the focus of one mirror, the
                    thermometer placed in the focus of the other sunk, or indicated cold. This
                    subject has been investigated by Pictet and by Leslie. The latter observed that
                    his canister, filled with snow, produced the greatest effect when its blackened
                    side was towards the thermometer and the mirror, and the least when its polished
                    side was in that direction. The effect of screens, in retarding the influence of
                    the cold body, he found analogous to their effect on the radiation from the hot
                    water.</p>
                <p part="N">These facts were considered by Leslie as proving the existence of what
                    he denominated cold pulses from the snow towards the mirror, “on the wings of
                    the ambient air;” but the explanation of Pictet appears to account for it well,
                    without the necessity of inferring the existence of frigorifie particles, which
                    is a highly improbable supposition. On this view, radiation is considered as
                    only taking place amongst bodies unequally heated. He conceived that bodies at
                    the same temperature do not radiate heat to each other, because in this state
                    caloric exists in them all in an equality of tension; but when a cool body is
                    introduced, all radiate heat towards it, and consequently their temperature
                    falls. Hence radiation is nothing more than the tendency of caloric to establish
                    an equilibrium of temperature. The rays of heat enter into the snow from the
                    surrounding matter, and, amongst others, from the thermometer, which is now a
                    radiating body; and these collected in the mirror pass in right lines to the
                    snow, with a celerity in proportion to their absorption by the cold body. Hence
                    the caloric of the thermometer will more rapidly leave it when the blackened
                    side of the cold canister, that is, its most absorbent side, is turned to the
                    thermometer.</p>
                <p part="N">Leslie explains this phenomenon by his theory of aerial pulsations. He
                    considers the cold surface as abstracting part of the caloric of the contiguous
                    stratum of air, which induces a momentary contraction of'that portion; and this
                    contraction produces pulsations, accompanied by a discharge of heat, in a
                    continued chain from the thermometer and the mirror to the snow.</p>
                <p part="N">The effect of surface oη the refrigeration of bodies, an important part
                    of the consequences of radiation, has been ably examined both by Sir John Leslie
                    and Count Rumford. The experiments of both show, that to preserve the heat of
                    any liquid, a bright metallic vessel is the best; and Rumford has pointed out
                    many important economical purposes to which these principles may be applied.
                    Thus, where it is of consequence to preserve the heat of liquids, of steam, or
                    of hot air, they should be conveyed in vessels and tubes of polished metal. On
                    the other hand, if we wish to have the greatest radiant heat from a stove or
                    grate, its surface next the room should be dark and rough, as these are the most
                    favourable for radiating heat into the apartment. The same principles show why a
                    silver <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641500?mode=fullsize"

                    longer warm, than a china one.</p>
                <p part="N">' One of the most beautiful applications of the principle of the
                    radiation of heat, is Dr Wells’ explanation of the phenomena of dew and
                    hoar-frost. Dr Wilson of Glasgow had observed, that bodies upon which dew and
                    hoarfrost formed, were always <hi rend="italic">colder</hi> than the surrounding
                    air. This cold he ascribed to these depositions; but an attentive examination of
                    facts led Dr Wells to draw an opposite conclusion, and to infer that the
                    coldness of the bodies was the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of the deposition of
                    dew and hoar-frost. This he successfully established, by proving that, before
                    any dew formed, the surface on which it condensed was uniformly cooler than the
                    ambient air. And it was reserved for this accomplished man to offer a theory of
                    those meteors, complete in almost all its parts, and perfectly satisfactory. He
                    ascribed it to the radiation of heat, without any return from the air to the
                    surface of the earth. He observed, that it was chiefly in serene, clear nights,
                    that dew was formed; that exposure to the open clear sky favoured the formation
                    of dew; and that cloudy skies were unfavourable to its formation. These
                    phenomena he beautifully. explained on the theory of radiation. The upper
                    regions of the atmosphere are well known to be the abodes of perpetual
                    congelation, as is seen whenever mountains reach a certain altitude, differing,
                    it is true, in different climates, but yet invariable over the earth. When we
                    have a clear atmosphere at night, the surface of the earth rapidly parts with
                    the heat it had acquired during the day, by radiation to the superior regions,
                    whence it can receive no heat in return. In this case, the empyrean regions act
                    the part of the snow in the Florentine experiment; and the earth’s surface may
                    represent the thermometer. But if fleecy clouds intervene, they act the part of
                    screens, intercepting the passage of radiant caloric from the earth, and
                    consequently retarding the nocturnal cooling of its surface. Air at an increased
                    temperature contains more water than cool air, and on the reduction of its
                    temperature deposits its surplus water. Now, as the radiation from the earth’s
                    surface cools it more rapidly than the air during serene nights, its temperature
                    rapidly falls, as the thermometer shows; and the consequence is the cooling of
                    the stratum of air in immediate contact with the ground, and the deposition of
                    its superabundant moisture, in the form of dew or hoarfrost, according to the
                    celerity and intensity of the refrigeration.</p>
                <p part="N">This theory is experimentally proved by placing substances absorbent of
                    moisture, along with thermometers, below and above screens, and then noting the
                    temperature and the increase of weight. If, for instance, a light table, about
                    three feet high, be placed in a garden on a clear night, and a few grains of
                    wool, previously weighed, be laid under the table, and as much on its upper
                    surface, with a thermometer by each parcel of wool, it will be found that the
                    upper thermometer will indicate the greatest degree of cold, and the wool on the
                    table will have imbibed much more moisture than that below. The table, in such
                    experiments, acts the part of clouds in intercepting the discharge of radiant
                    heat, and preventing the cooling of the earth’s surface. The theory agrees with
                    the fact, that dew is heaviest in our climate in serene nights, after a hot day;
                    and that the dews of hot climates are far heavier than with us, so as, in clear
                    weather, in the south of Europe, to drench the clothes of persons exposed to the
                    air about sunset. The slight anomalies which sometimes occur in such experiments
                    are easily explicable by the different <hi rend="italic">conducting power</hi>
                    of substances in regard to heat, by which the influence of radiation may be in
                    some degree modified; but undoubtedly the principal effect is due to <hi

                <p part="N">The influence of a clear sky in reducing the temperature of the earth’s
                    surface, and the effect of clouds in preventing this change, are beautifully

                    but if a passing cloud cross the zenith, even momentarily, the movement of the
                    fluid in its stem immediately shows an increase of temperature. If one walk in a
                    clear night, with this instrument in one hand and a parasol in the other, it may
                    be kept in a perpetual state of fluctuation, by alternately projecting it beyond

                <p part="N">The radiant heat afforded by the sun’s rays is the most important
                    phenomenon of this class. Light and heat are in these rays so united, that
                    experiment would seem to prove the one to be always in proportion to the other.
                    This is by no means the case with the light and heat of common combustibles, or
                    what we may term <hi rend="italic">terrestrial,</hi> in contradistinction to <hi
                        rend="italic">solar</hi> emanations of light. Phosphorus gives an intense
                    light during combustion, but a feeble heat; whilst hydrogen, which has a very
                    feeble light, excites a high temperature by its combustion. Solar light and
                    heat, on the other hand, are uniformly proportional. There are more marked
                    differences between solar and terrestrial radiant heat. Screens of glass greatly
                    interrupt the passage of the latter, but do not sensibly intercept that of the
                    sun. A plate of the most diaphanous ice totally intercepts terrestrial radiant
                    caloric, but does not impede the sun’s heating rays. This has, with considerable
                    reason, been supposed to depend on the different velocities of the two species
                    of calorific emanations. Sir John Leslie considered “that the phenomena of solar

                <p part="N">For thirty years after the publication of Leslie’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Experimental Inquiry,</hi> little appears to have been attempted on this
                    subject, until within a recent period, when the experimental researches of
                    Melloni and of Nobili, particularly of the former, opened a beautiful field of
                    investigation, which has already been cultivated with success by Professor James
                    Forbes of Edinburgh. Melloni has, by means of a thermo-magnetic combination,
                    invented a very delicate test of minute degrees of heat, wholly inappreciable by
                    any thermometer, and has successfully applied it to investigate the laws of
                    radiant heat. By uniting fifty small bars of antimony and bismuth into one
                    bundle, about three fourths of an inch square, and about 1∙17 inch in length,
                    and connecting this with a galvanometer, he obtained an apparatus so sensible to
                    heat, that the warmth radiating from the human hand, at the distance of several
                    inches from the. end of the bars, is indicated by the deviation of the needle of
                    the galvanometer.</p>
                <p part="N">Melloni’s instrument is represented in the adjoining figure, where a
                    firm sole of wood is seen, provided with a groove m which the different parts of
                    the apparatus slide to adjust <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641513?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-1513-0186"/>their relative distances. A is the bundle of
                    metallic bars, enclosed in a square case of brass; B is the source of the heat;
                    C, D are the wires proceeding from the bars, to convey their thermo-magnetism to
                    the nearly neutralized needle or galvanometer, which is not here represented; G
                    is the stage for occasionally supporting various substances, the effect of which
                    on the calorific rays it is intended to ascertain; FF are screens of brass,
                    moveable on joints, for cutting off at pleasure the radiant heat, or for
                    obviating the influence of extraneous sources of heat. In F is a hole through
                    which the heat radiates to A when the screen is removed.</p>
                <p part="N">This apparatus has been employed by Melloni to investigate the laws of
                    radiant heat; and he has not only confirmed the general results of Leslie, but
                    extended greatly our knowledge of this mysterious agent.</p>
                <p part="N">Melloni found, that the radiant and absorbent power of surfaces were not
                    always proportional, as the following tables show.</p>

                <p part="N">This experiment proves,</p>
                <p part="N">1. That bodies do not always agree in their emitting and absorbent
                    powers, though generally nearly so.</p>
                <p part="N">2. That their absorbent power varies very remarkably with the origin and
                    intensity of the calorific rays.</p>
                <p part="N">3. That they approach each other more and more in their power of
                    emitting and absorbing rays of heat, when the temperature approaches that of
                    boiling water; and that, when exactly at that temperature, the emitting and
                    absorbing powers coincide.</p>
                <p part="N">With respect to the <hi rend="italic">reflection</hi> of radiant heat,
                    he has shown, that it is equally reflected by metallic surfaces, from whatever
                    source it emanates.</p>
                <p part="N">But Melloni’s most original experiments are those on the transmission of
                    radiant heat through various transparent media.</p>
                <p part="N">1. He showed that radiant heat is intercepted in a greater or less
                    degree by all diaphanous bodies, in proportion to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >lowness</hi> of the temperature of the radiating body.</p>
                <p part="N">2. That of two bodies unequally diaphanous, it may happen that the
                    thickest and least diaphanous may transmit most radiant heat. Thus he showed
                    that a thin plate of very transparent alum, placed on the stage G, transmitted
                    four times less heat than a plate of almost opake quartz, about 100 tiŋaes as
                    thick; but he found that in the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> substance the
                    transmission of radiant heat is diminished by ' the thickness of the plate
                    interposed, and this diminution is proportional to· the lowness of the
                    temperature of the radiant body.</p>
                <p part="N">3. That there are combinations of two media, which allow a notable
                    quantity of light to pass, but totally intercept radiant heat; whilst others
                    transmit heat, but wholly intercept light.</p>
                <p part="N">4. That in traversing a transparent plate, radiant heat undergoes
                    certain modifications, variable with the nature of the plate; a change which
                    renders it more or less susceptible ultimately of being transmitted through
                    other diaphanous substances. Melloni instances this last property <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">mi</hi> glass, in crystallized citric acid, and in
                    alum.</p>
                <p part="N">Delaroche had inferred, from his experiments, that it was a general law
                    of radiant heat, that the permeability of plates to this agent depended upon the
                    intensity of the source of the caloric; and in this way he explained the instant
                    permeability of glass and ice to the calorific rays of the sun, whilst they
                    retarded those from terrestrial sources of heat; butMelloni has discovered one
                    substance which he found to be equally pervious to heat, from whatever
                    terrestrial source, whether proceeding from the brightest flame, or from water
                    far below the boiling point.</p>
                <p part="N">The power of penetrating glass and other media increasing in proportion
                    as the radiating heat approaches the state of light, had been used by Delaroche
                    as au argument for their identity; but the anomaly of rock-salt destroys the
                    universality of the supposed law on which the argument is founded. Yet Mrs
                    Somerville has ingeniously employed the unlooked-for analogy between light and
                    heat, in the equal transmission of the latter, however eliminated, through
                    rock-salt, as an argument for their being modifications of the same principle.
                    The condition of visibility or invisibility, she contends, may depend on the
                    construction of our eyes, not on the nature of the agent producing the
                    sensations of vision and of heat.</p>
                <p part="N">“The sense of seeing, like that of hearing, may be confined within
                    certain limits; the chemical rays beyond the violent end of the spectrum may be
                    too rapid, or not sufficiently excursive in their vibrations to be visible to

                    not be sufficiently rapid, or too extensive, in their undulations, to affect our

                <p part="N">She has traced the analogies between light and heat in their reflection
                    by polished surfaces, their refraction through transparent media, with their

                    publication of her beautiful essay on the connection of the physical sciences,
                    Professor Forbes has drawn the analogy closer, as we shall presently see.</p>

                    caloric is susceptible of refraction; and when it arrives at the second surface
                    of the refracting angle, with a certain obliquity, it is, like light, reflected
                    toward the interior of the prism, and issues at the opposite face.</p>

                <p part="N">Melloni, however, failed to detect the polarisation of radiant heat:
                    indeed, he states that the direction in <pb break="no"

                    slice crystallized bodies does not exert any influence upon the quantity of
                    radiant heat immediately transmitted by them; and adds, that radiant heat is <hi
                        rend="italic">not polarised</hi> by transmission through tourmaline. In
                    this, however, Melloni was deceived; and it was reserved for our countryman
                    Professor Forbes of Edinburgh to complete the analogy between light and heat, by
                    demonstrating the polarisation of the latter.</p>
                <p part="N">Since the characteristic phenomenon which marks the polarisation of
                    light is its variable susceptibility as to reflection or transmission, under
                    circumstances in which common light would be reflected or transmitted, it will
                    appear that the correlative fact in the case of heat would be indicated by a
                    diminished effect on the thermometer, where the intensity of light, under
                    similar circumstances, would be a <hi rend="italic">minimum,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The importance of establishing this effect
                    with regard to heat is far greater than the mere addition of such facts to our
                    knowledge; for, as the corresponding facts in the instance of light have been
                    completely brought into the domain of <hi rend="italic">analysis</hi> by
                    Fresnel, the polarisation of heat must be considered as almost decisive of its
                    nature.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Forbes employed Melloni’s apparatus; and by interposing two plates of
                    tourmaline, cut parallel to the axis of the crystal, and mounted on two slips of
                    thin glass, he made a series of successive observations under the two conditions
                    of the axes parallel and perpendicular to each other. Two measures of intensity
                    in the position in which least light is transmitted were noted, and in the
                    following table this position is indicated by <hi rend="italic">dark</hi><hi

                <p part="N">The most convenient way of polarising heat is by transmitting it through
                    a bundle of extremely thin laminae of mica, inclined to the incident ray at the
                    polarising angle; mica having the property of transmitting heat very readily.
                    The amount of polarisation is indicated by the relative quantities of heat
                    reaching the pile, or thermo-magnetic combination of the instrument, through a
                    second bundle of thin plates of mica, placed alternately in a parallel or
                    perpendicular position to the first. With such an apparatus Mr Forbes
                    demonstrated, in the most decisive manner, the polarisation of heat; and
                    obtained this effect, even with water below 200° F. as the source of heat. The
                    quantity polarised, however, always bears a proportion to the temperature of the

                    succeeded by the use of reflecting surfaces of mica, as in the corresponding
                    case of light.</p>
                <p part="N">Ί he success of these investigations, and the analogy of light, led him
                    to the more delicate problem of the <hi rend="italic">depolarisation</hi> of
                    heat by plates of mica. By interposing a film of mica between the two bundles of
                    mica plates already mentioned, having their planes of incidence at right angles
                    to each other, and marking the difference of the heat transmitted to the
                    galvanometer, when the principal section of the film of mica was parallel to the
                    plane of primitive polarisation, or inclined to it at an angle of 45°, he
                    succeeded in demonstrating the polarisation of the rays of heat, even when heat
                    without light was employed. In these experiments, when the principal section
                    coincided with the plane of polarisation, the depolarising effect was <hi
                        rend="italic">nil;</hi> but when it was inclined at the angle of 45°, he
                    obtained the following proportions in one series of experiments.</p>
                <p part="N">100: 118:: — 100: 120 — 100: 120 — 100:113 —</p>
                <p part="N">The depolarisation is still more marked with incandescent platinum; as
                    the results were</p>
                <p part="N">100: 126 — 100: 138 — 100: 138.</p>
                <p part="N">One of the most striking proofs of the depolarising power of mica is
                    obtained, when the two bundles of mica plates are crossed, so as to intercept
                    most heat, and we interpose a very thin plate or film of mica as above
                    mentioned; then the galvanometer moves towards zero, or the thin plate evidently
                    stops more heat than it depolarises; but if we substitute a much thicker plate
                    of mica for the film, the instrument will indicate a higher temperature than
                    when no mica at all is interposed, or the thick plate depolarises more heat than
                    it intercepts.</p>
                <p part="N">These experiments were varied in a great variety of ways, so as to
                    establish the fact of the depolarisation of heat; and if we admit that it
                    depends on a similar cause to the analogous phenomena of light, it follows that
                    the rays of caloric are susceptible also of <hi rend="italic">double
                        refraction;</hi> that the two pencils are polarised in opposite planes, and
                    that they become capable of <hi rend="italic">interference</hi> by the action of
                    the analysing plate.</p>
                <p part="N">These curious facts would indicate at least a great similarity between
                    light and heat; and the concluding observations of Professor. Forbes’s paper <hi
                        rend="italic">(Edin. Phil. Trans.</hi> xiii.) tend to confirm their
                    identity..</p>
                <p part="N">SECT. III.—GENERAL EFFECTS OF CALORIC.</p>
                <p part="N">The general effects of heat applied to other matter are, expansion,
                    fluidity, vaporization, and incandescence. The <hi rend="italic">most</hi>
                    general effect of heat, however, is,</p>
                <p part="N">1. <hi rend="italic">Expansion.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">When a body is heated, it expands in all its dimensions; but when the
                    heat is withdrawn, the body returns to its original size. This is well shown by
                    having a turned rod of metal, loosely fitted to a gage, to ascertain its length,
                    and provided with a hole which first allows it, when cold, to pass through. This
                    expansion is small in solids, but has been most accurately measured by
                    philosophers, for <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641539?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-1539-0188"/>the important purposes of ascertaining with
                    precision the true length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in any latitude, and
                    for obtaining a perfect standard of length. This difficult subject engaged the
                    attention of Ellicot, Smeaton, Roy, Troughton, Lavoisier, and Laplace. The
                    latest experiments were made by the two last-mentioned philosophers, and were
                    first published by Biot in the following table, which shows the expansion which
                    different solids sustain, in passing from the freezing to the boiling point of
                    water, in fractions of their own lengths.</p>

                <p part="N">The inequality of the expansion of fluids by heat has long been known to
                    form an obstacle to the accuracy of thermometers. Deluc found, that of all
                    fluids mercury was the most equable in its expansions, which is probably owing
                    to the great distance between its freezing and boiling points; for it is found
                    that those liquids which have a low boiling point are the most irregular in
                    their expansion at ordinary temperatures; and hence alcohol is not a suitable
                    fluid for thermometers.</p>
                <p part="N">The expansibility of liquids is not in proportion to their density; but
                    it is more nearly in the inverse ratio of their density than of any other known
                    property.</p>
                <p part="N">The expansion of gases by heat is much more considerable than that of
                    the other two forms of matter.</p>
                <p part="N">The higher increasing ratio in the expansibility of liquids with their
                    augmenting temperature, than in solids, led philosophers at first to infer, that
                    the inequalities of the gaseous bodies, in this respect, would be still more
                    considerable; but the elaborate researches of General Roy have disproved this
                    idea; and some experiments of the late Dr Murray of Edinburgh, and of Dr Dalton,
                    would rather indicate a <hi rend="italic">decrease</hi> in the ratio with the
                    increased temperature. This, however, may probably be owing to the imperfection
                    of our best thermometers, and to the difficulty of estimating the expansions of
                    the glass containing the air examined.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Dalton has ascertained that all gases expand equally by equal
                    increments of heat; a conclusion which has been confirmed by Gay-Lussac. They
                    have shown that, between the freezing and boiling point of water, 100 cubic
                    inches of atmospheric air expand to 137∙50, that with hydrogen the result was
                    137∙52, with oxygen gas 137∙48, and with nitrogen 137∙49; differences so slight
                    as to be within the probable limits of experimental error.</p>
                <p part="N">The force opposed to expansion would appear to be cohesion. Expansion is
                    least in solids where the cohesion is strongest; it is more considerable in
                    liquids where the cohesion is greatly weakened; and it is greatest in gases, in
                    which cohesion is wholly overcome.</p>
                <p part="N">The expansion of bodies by heat, and their contraction on the reduction
                    of the temperature, would show that the atoms of bodies are not in absolute
                    contact. In fact, we may suppose them surrounded by <hi rend="italic"
                        >atmospheres of heat,</hi> which prevent, by the repulsive energy of
                    caloric, their absolute contact; whilst the force of cohesion limits the
                    diffusive influence of the contained caloric. In some, the superior force of
                    cohesion gives rise to solidity. When more heat is introduced, the cohesion is
                    weakened, and the body becomes a liquid; and a further addition of caloric
                    destroys cohesion altogether, separates the atoms, and the body becomes a
                    gas.</p>
                <p part="N">The expansion of bodies by heat proves the mutual repulsion of their
                    particles; but this limits the repulsive energy of heat to insensible distances.
                    In 1824, Libri endeavoured to prove, from the movements of globules of water
                    along fine wires, that the repulsive power of heat was exerted also at sensible
                    distances. But his experiments are not conclusive; for the motions may have
                    arisen from the formation of vapour at one end of the globule. Fresnel attempted
                    to prove this point by bringing discs of foil or of mica, on the end of a
                    delicately suspended magnet, into contact with fixed discs <hi rend="italic">in
                        vacuo,</hi> and marking the effect of heat collected from the sun’s rays.
                    The moveable discs sensibly receded; but this may have arisen from some change
                    produced by the heat in the form of the discs. Professor Forbes has happily
                        applied<pb break="no" facs="nls:193641552?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-1552-0189"/> the repulsive energy of heat acting at <hi
                        rend="italic">sensible distances,</hi> to explain the curious vibrations of
                    the metal bars in Trevelyan’s experiments. Still more lately Professor Powell of
                    Cambridge has demonstrated the repulsion of heat at sensible distances <hi
                        rend="italic">(Phil. Trans,</hi> for 1834), by the changes produced, on the
                    approximation of a heated body, in the Newtonian coloured rings of plates of
                    glass which are pressed together. When, for instance, a flat plate is laid on a
                    slightly convex surface of glass, the rings appear. On bringing a heated body
                    near the upper surface of the plates, the rings instantly contract, and again
                    enlarge on withdrawing the heated body. On repeating the experiment with the
                    colours formed under the base of a prism placed on a lens of small convexity, he
                    found the repulsion of heat acting at distances, which Sir J. Herschel has
                    calculated at τ⅛θth of an inch.</p>
                <p part="N">Expansion is so general an effect of heat, that there are only two known
                    exceptions, viz. in clay, and in water -at a certain limited range of
                    temperature. It is well known that porcelain clay contracts in baking, and ever
                    afterwards retains its contracted dimensions. It was this quality which induced
                    Wedgwood to employ its contractions as a pyrometer. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Thermometer</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrometer.)</hi>-This property,
                    however, seemingly depends on heat producing in the heterogeneous substance
                    clay, a more intimate union of its parts, or a partial conversion of this
                    mechanical mixture into a chemical compound.</p>
                <p part="N">The exception of water between 42° and 32° Fahrenheit, is, however,
                    real. When water is cooled down from the ordinary temperature, say 60°, it
                    regularly contracts by the cooling, until it has attained 42°; but whilst
                    passing from that point down to its freezing point, it continues to expand
                    gradually^ until converted into ice.</p>
                <p part="N">The important purposes which this constitution of water serves in the
                    economy of nature, the immense quantity of heat which is by this contrivance
                    saved to our lakes and other collections of water, are strikingly pointed out by
                    Count Rumford in his Essays; and this peculiarity in water has been confirmed by
                    the well-devised experiments of Professor Hope and Dr Murray.</p>
                <p part="N">Many liquids at the moment of congelation <hi rend="italic">expand,</hi>
                    from the crystalline arrangement of their parts. This is familiarly known in the
                    floating of ice in water, in the bursting of water pipes by frost, and in the
                    splitting of masses of rock by the congelation of the water which has insinuated
                    itself into their fissures. This force is well known to be enormous, as was
                    shown by the experiments of the Florentine academicians, of Huygens, and of
                    Major Williams at Quebec (see <hi rend="italic">Edin. Phil.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Trans.).</hi> The same cause produces the expansion of cast
                    iron at the moment of becoming solid; and it is to this property that we are
                    indebted for the sharpness of the casts obtained from this metal. In these
                    instances we do not find an exception to the law of contraction by diminished
                    heat. It is wholly owing to a crystalline arrangement of the particles, by which
                    interstices are left between them, and consequently the solid occupies more
                    space than if solidification took place without crystallization. Hence lead
                    expands not in cooling, though cast iron does.</p>
                <p part="N">Many operations in the arts depend on the contraction of metals as they
                    cool. It is in this way that the tyers of coach wheels are fitted tightly to the
                    fellies. The expansion of metals by heat seemed at one time to form an
                    insurmountable bar to the perfection of the going of a pendulum clock; but the
                    ingenuity of an English artist showed how, by a combination of bars of metals of
                    unequal expansibility, this property might be applied to keep the pendulum, at
                    all temperatures, of precisely the same length. This first produced the gridiron
                    pendulum; and more lately the compensation pendulum, with a mercurial cistern at
                    the end of a metallic rod. Similar principles have been successfully applied to
                    the balance-wheels of pocket chronometers.</p>

                <p part="N">When solids are heated, they first expand, and then melt. This is a very
                    general effect of caloric, the exceptions to which are disappearing, as we
                    discover new sources of intense temperature. The oxyhydrogen blowpipe has fused
                    almost all the most refractory substances; and the sun’s rays collected by
                    immense lenses, or metallic mirrors, have melted, or even dissipated in vapour,
                    many bodies, which were long regarded as incapable of fusion. We are therefore
                    entitled to regard solidity as the natural state of all matter, and its two
                    other modifications as resulting from its union with caloric.</p>
                <p part="N">Those bodies always fused at the ordinary temperatures are no exception
                    to this law, since, by artificial cold, we have reduced most of them to a solid
                    state. Thus mercury, at about — 40° of Fahrenheit, becomes a solid metal with
                    the lustre of silver; and alcohol, which has not yet been frozen, may be
                    considered as having its melting point lower than any yet discovered artificial
                    cold. The point at which bodies become fluid differs widely in different
                    substances, but remains uniformly the same in the same fluid under similar
                    circumstances. Thus ice always melts at 32°.</p>
                <p part="N">It was long believed, that when solids began to melt, they were
                    converted into liquids by a small increase of heat; and that they might again
                    return to the solid state by a small diminution of their temperature. An
                    attentive consideration of the process of liquefaction convinced the celebrated
                    Dr Joseph Black of the insufficiency of the commonly-received opinion; and he
                    promulgated in 1757 more philosophic views of this subject, which he illustrated
                    by a beautifully simple experiment.</p>
                <p part="N">He introduced equal quantities of water into two thin glass flasks of
                    the same form and weight. One of them he froze, by placing it in a freezing
                    mixture; the other he reduced by similar means to the temperature of 32°, or its
                    freezing point, but without allowing it to become solid. When removed from the
                    freezing mixture, the flask of ice soon acquired the same temperature as the
                    ice-cold water, and both were suspended in a room at 47°. In half an hour the
                    thermometer in the ice-cold water had risen to 40°, but it required twenty-one
                    half-hours to raise the temperature of the flask which had been frozen to the
                    same point. As both were exposed to the same medium, equal quantities of heat
                    must have been imparted to each in equal times; but it required twenty-one times
                    as long to raise the frozen flask 8°, as sufficed to impart 8° to the ice-cold
                    water. Dr Black inquired what had become of this quantity of caloric, which was
                    not indicated by any rise in the thermometer? He inferred that it had entered
                    into the ice during its liquefaction; and as the quantity so absorbed was not
                    indicated by the thermometer, he denominated it <hi rend="italic">Latent
                        Heat.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In repeating the experiment with much
                    care, he found that a pound of ice required twenty times as long to rise through
                    7°, as did as much ice-cold water; and therefore inferred, that during the
                    conversion of that ice into water, as much heat disappears, or is absorbed, as
                    would have elevated a pound of ice-cold water 140°. This absorption of heat
                    during liquefaction is easily shown. If we add a pound of boiling water to a
                    pound of ice, the temperature of the mixture will still remain at 32°; but if to
                    a pound of water at 32°, we add a pound of boiling water at 212°, the
                    temperature of the mixture will be found about J 22°, or a mean between the
                    extremes of temperature.</p>
                <p part="N">Similar absorptions of heat take place during the melt» ing of tallow,
                    bees-wax, and of the metals.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641565?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1565-0190"/>
                <p part="N">When liquid bodies congeal, or become solid, their latent heat is again
                    given out.</p>
                <p part="N">It is possible, by nice management, to cool down water considerably
                    below its freezing point. The principal circumstance necessary for this
                    experiment is to leave it at perfect rest, in an atmosphere from 10° to 15°
                    below 32° (Dalton succeeded in this way in cooling water as low as 5° without
                    freezing); but on slightly agitating it, the water suddenly freezes; and if a
                    thermometer has been suspended in it, the instrument suddenly rises to 32°,
                    owing to the conversion of latent into sensible heat.</p>
                <p part="N">Another experiment shows this fact in a striking point of view. Into a
                    glass flask introduce a mixture of sulphate of soda and water, in such
                    proportions that it will form a saturated solution about the point of
                    ebullition. When this is heated to that point, pour a little oil on its surface,
                    introduce a thermometer, and remove it from the fire. When quite cold, drop into
                    it a small crystal of sulphate of soda, and the solution will speedily
                    crystallize into a solid mass, during the formation of which the thermometer
                    will be seen to rise, indicating the evolution of sensible heat, during the
                    conversion of the liquid into a solid.</p>
                <p part="N">The absorption of sensible caloric on the liquefaction of bodies forms
                    the basis of most of the processes by which we obtain artificial cold. When to
                    some salts, such as sulphate of soda, we add nitrous acid diluted with an equal
                    part of water, the salt rapidly melts, and the temperature is reduced to the
                    beginning of Fahrenheit’s scale. Diluted acid added to snow rapidly melts it,
                    and the temperature is greatly reduced. A mixture of common salt and snow, which
                    is the mixture generally employed to procure ice-cream, will sink the
                    temperature to the beginning of Fahrenheit’s scale. Dry muriate of lime added to
                    dry snow will reduce the temperature, during their liquefaction, so low as to
                    freeze mercury. In all these instances it is the absorption of heat caused by
                    the liquefaction, or the conversion of sensible into latent caloric, that
                    produces the cold.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Black applied his theory of latent heat to explain many phenomena.
                    The ductility of a body appears to be owing to the presence of latent caloric;
                    for if we hammer a piece of iron smartly, it becomes intensely hot, by parting
                    with its latent caloric, and at the same time has its ductility greatly
                    impaired. This ductility is only restored by again heating the metal in the
                    fire, by which it re-acquires latent heat, that may again be forced out by a
                    repetition of the hammering.</p>
                <p part="N">The absorption of heat by bodies whilst melting is an important law in
                    the economy of nature. Had it merely been necessary, for the immediate
                    conversion of ice or snow into water, to raise the atmospheric temperature a few
                    degrees, the sudden formation of water would have deluged the earth on every
                    occurrence of a thaw. On the other hand, had the slightest lowering of the
                    temperature of the air below 32° been all that was requisite to convert water
                    into ice, the sudden expansion of the congealing juices of vegetables must have
                    burst their sap-vessels, and rent asunder the strongest ornaments of the forest.
                    But the law of the gradual absorption and emanation of caloric during these
                    transitions from the solid to the liquid, and from the liquid to the solid
                    state, produces those changes tranquilly and beneficially. The melting snow
                    gradually augments the sources which fertilize the valleys; whilst the soil,
                    loosened by the expansion produced by the previous frost, when softened by the
                    succeeding thaw, is fitted for the reception of the roots of plants.</p>
                <p part="N">The influence of these processes on climate is not inconsiderable. The
                    absorption of heat during the liquefaction of ice on tropical mountains, sends
                    down into the heated valleys copious sources of cool water, which by its
                    immediate contact, and still more by its evaporation, assuages the fervour of a
                    broiling climate; and in high la- ' titudes the caloric, eliminated on the
                    freezing of water,, tends to mitigate the rigours of an arctic winter.</p>
                <p part="N">3. <hi rend="italic">Vaporization.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">When liquids are heated, the first effect is expansion; but if the
                    application of heat be continued, they assume the aeriform state, or pass into
                        <hi rend="italic">vapour</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when the caloric
                    iŝ abstracted, they again assume the liquid form. When water is heated to 212°
                    Fahrenheit, it boils, and is converted into an invisible aeriform fluid, which
                    remains perfectly transparent and colourless as longas its temperature is not
                    below 212°; but what in common language is called steam, is this elastic fluid
                    partially recondenseđ into water, by the loss of a portion of its heat. The
                    invisible elastic vapour is capable of occupying space and expelling atmospheric
                    air, as is shown by corking a flask when boiling, and opening it underwater;
                    when the flask will be suddenly entirely filled with the water, which condenses
                    the steam.</p>
                <p part="N">Liquids, however, pass also into vapour by a more gradual process. If
                    exposed to the air, water, for instance, gradually disappears; and if the
                    process be carried on under a glass vessel, the included air becomes charged
                    with moisture, which may be again abstracted from it by dry quicklime, or other
                    substance having a strong affinity for water. The process by which liquids are
                    thus converted into vapour is termed <hi rend="italic">Spontaneous
                        Evaporation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> an important operation in nature,
                    as on it depends the charging of the atmosphere with water, for the formation of
                    clouds, mist, rain, and dew; all elastic fluids, however, are not capable of
                    being condensed into liquids by any decrease of temperature we can command.
                    Thus, no artificial cold has hitherto been discovered capable of converting
                    atmospheric air into a liquid.</p>
                <p part="N">The common property of all aeriform fluids is <hi rend="italic"
                        >elasticity,</hi> or^the tendency, when forcibly compressed, to resume their
                    former bulk. Thus, if we throw air, by means of a forcing pump, into an
                    air-tight cistern, provided with a small orifice commanded by a stop-cock; on
                    opening the latter, the air will issue out with great force, until the air has
                    regained its former volume.</p>
                <p part="N">But vapours, or those aeriform bodies which are not permanently elastic,
                    may, by strong pressure, even whilst their temperature is above their vaporific
                    point, be condensed into liquids.</p>
                <p part="N">The elasticity of all aeriform bodies is increased by augmentation of
                    temperature. In atmospheric air this increase has been found equal to ψ⅛θth of
                    its volume for every 1° Fahrenheit; and the elasticity of steam, or the vapour
                    of water, is nearly doubled by 30° of increased temperature above 212.</p>
                <p part="N">We are indebted to the celebrated Dr Dalton for accurate ideas as to the
                    elasticity of aeriform bodies at different temperatures. He showed that the
                    vapour of water, under a barometrical pressure of thirty inches at the boiling
                    point, is just equal to the elasticity of atmospheric air under the same
                    pressure; that the ratio of increase is rather less than a geometrical series,
                    when the temperature is taken in an arithmetical progression; and, what was less
                    obvious; that the elasticity of all vapours is precisely the same with the
                    elasticity of the vapour of water, at the same number of degrees above the
                    boiling point of each liquid. Thus water, under a mean barometrical pressure,
                    boils at 212°; and the elasticity of its steam at 220°, or 8° above its boiling
                    point, was found by Dalton to be = 34∙99 inches: alcohol boils at 175°, and the
                    elasticity of its vapour at 183°, or 8° above its boiling point, is just =
                    34&gt;∙99.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641578?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1578-0191"/>
                <p part="N">The bulk of a body is very much increased by its conversion into vapour.
                    Dr Black and Mr Watt made experiments to ascertain this increase. They boiled
                    water in a flask, and, as the last drop was converted into steam, accurately
                    closed the flask, which was then carefully weighed; on opening the flask below
                    the surface of water, the quantity of water which rushed in was easily
                    ascertained by a second weighing of the flask. The mean of several experiments
                    showed that water, in the state of vapour, occupied 1800 times the space it
                    filled as water. When heat is applied to solids, its first effect is expansion,
                    next liquefaction, and, lastly, conversion into vapour. A few solids pass at
                    once into the state of vapour, as carbonate of ammonia.</p>
                <p part="N">Different liquids acquire different degrees of heat for their
                    vaporization. Thus aether becomes vapour at 104°, alcohol at 175°, water at
                    212°, and mercury requires a temperature about 692°. The vaporific point,
                    however, remains constantly the same, in the same liquid, under the same
                    barometric pressure. If, however, we diminish the pressure, the liquid will boil
                    at a lower temperature. This is easily shown by the air-pump, in the exhausted
                    receiver of which aether will boil at a temperature considerably below the
                    freezing point of water. It is also strikingly exhibited by the following
                    experiment: If a portion of water, say two.ounces, be boiled in a flask capable
                    of holding eight or ten, and if it be corked whilst briskly boiling, a vacuum
                    will be formed on its surface, by the condensation of its vapour, on removing it
                    from the lamp. As the steam condenses, the liquid in the flask will begin to
                    boil more briskly as the flask cools; and if ŵe pour <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>
                    water on this flask, the more will the pressure of the vapour in the flask be
                    removed', and the more violently will the contained water boil. If now we pour
                        <hi rend="italic">boiling</hi> water on the flask, more steam will be
                    formed, and the boiling will cease, but will be again renewed on a second
                    application of the <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> water. This may be alternated for
                    several times if the flask be well corked.</p>
                <p part="N">As the boiling point of liquids varies exactly in the ratio of the
                    barometrical pressure, it is obvious that the height of mountains may be
                    ascertained by noting the thermometrical degree at which liquids boil on them. A
                    portable instrument, constructed for this purpose, was devised by the Reverend
                    F. Wollaston.</p>
                <p part="N">We cannot heat any liquid beyond its boiling point in an open vessel.
                    Water placed on the fire soon rises to 212°, but a thermometer plunged in it
                    remains at this point, however long it boils; but if the vessel be provided with
                    a steam-tight cover, the temperature of the liquid may be much increased,
                    according to the strength of the vessel. The elasticity of the steam in such
                    cases is enormous; and experiments with steam under high pressure are hazardous,
                    unless the vessel be of great thickness. The Marquis of Worcester seems to have
                    burst a cannon by this means; and the frequent explosions of steam-engine
                    boilers is a familiar instance of the same. Dr Black and Mr Watt heated water in
                    a strong copper vessel to 400°; and in some of Perkins’ experiments lead was
                    melted, it is said, in water subjected to strong pressure; yet in an open vessel
                    we cannot heat water to more than 212°.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Black sagaciously and happily applied his doctrine of <hi
                        rend="italic">latent heat</hi> to explain the conversion of liquids into
                    vapour. He remarked, that when a kettle was placed on the fire it şoon rose to
                    212°; but though the same hcat continued to be applied, it rose no higher. In
                    one of his beautifully simple and conclusive experiments, a vessel containing
                    some water, at temperature 50°, was placed on a red-hot iron plate; in four
                    minutes it began to boil, but it required twenty minutes to convert the whole
                    into vapour. In the first four minutes it had acquired an increase of 162° of
                    tem perature; and as the hcat was uniform during the whole time of the
                    experiment, it must have received an equal quantity of heat during the whole
                    interval; or, during the other sixteen minutes, 810° must have flowed into it,
                    yet during the whole time a thermometer in it rose no higher than 212°. Black
                    naturally inferred that this large quan tity of heat, which disappeared, had
                    entered into the vapour in a <hi rend="italic">latent form.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">A series of experiments were undertaken by him, and by his friend Mr
                    Watt, from which they inferred, that when water is converted into steam, it
                    unites with 940° of heat, which the thermometer docs not indicate; or, in
                    Black’s phraseology, that quantity becomes <hi rend="italic">latent</hi> in the
                    steam. This determination nearly coincides with the experiments of Lavoisier,

                <p part="N">The absorption of heat during the formation of vapour is easily
                    demonstrated. A piece of muslin moistened with any liquid, laid on the bulb of a
                    thermometer, sinks the temperature; and if that liquid be very evaporable, the
                    temperature thus produced will be low in proportion. The evaporation of aether
                    will freeze water under the receiver of the air-pump; and the evaporation of the
                    fluid called sulphuret of carbon is so rapid, that, in a well-exhausted
                    receiver, it will freeze the mercury in the bulb of the thermometer.</p>
                <p part="N">A liquid may even, by particular management, be frozen by its own
                    evaporation. This is the principle of Wollaston’s philosophic toy, called the
                        <hi rend="italic">cryophorus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it was
                    ingeniously applied to an important practical purpose by the late Sir John
                    Leslie, viz. the production of ice at a cheap rate in all climates. The
                    apparatus employed by this philosopher is a powerful air-pump, which can at once
                    exhaust from three to six flat receivers about twelve inches in diameter. These
                    are fitted to different plates, each connected with the pump, and each provided
                    with its own stop-cock. A shallow glass dish, nearly the width of the receiver,
                    intended to hold a thin stratum of sulphuric acid, is introduced under each
                    receiver, and a cup of porous earthenware, supported on a glass tripod about an
                    inch above the surface of the acid, is under each receiver. Water is to be
                    poured into this cup, which is to be placed on its tripod, and the whole covered
                    by the receiver. By working the air-pump, each receiver may be exhausted in
                    succession. The withdrawing of the atmospheric pressure causes the rapid
                    evaporation of the water, the vapour of which is immediately absorbed by the
                    sulphuric acid; and thus the vacuum is sustained. The latent heat necessary for
                    the conversion of the water into steam or vapour is derived from the water
                    itself; its temperature therefore falls; and the absorption of the vapour by the
                    acįd, as quickly as it is formed, keeps up the vacuum, and speedily reduces the
                    whole water to the freezing point, when it soon forms a cake of icc. By a
                    full-sized machine of this kind, about a quarter of an hour’s labour will set
                    the process in full operation; and within the period of an hour afterwards six
                    pounds of solid ice may be obtained. During this process, the water loses only
                    about one fiftieth of its bulk; and the acid will be sufficiently strong for
                    repeated operations of the same kind.</p>
                <p part="N">Leslie showed, that any substance which is powerfully absorbent of
                    watery vapour, may be substituted for the acid; and he found that highly toasted
                        <hi rend="italic">oat meal,</hi> or well-dried powder of <hi rend="italic"
                        >greenstone,</hi> had very considerable power to produce ice, when employed
                    instead of sulphuric acid. He even showed, that by enclosing a globule of
                    mercury in a small pyriform mass of ice, suspended over the acid in a good
                    vacuum, the mercury might easily be frozen.</p>

                    steam. The elegant distillatory apparatus figured (No. 46) in Henry’s Chemistry
                    readily proves this. In an experiment with a similar apparatus, the condensation
                    ol one ounce of steam heated eight ounces of water from 60° to 180°; that is,
                    the whole water gained 120° of temperature; consequently that ounce of steam had
                    lost as much caloric as would have elevated an ounce of any fluid, capable of
                    being so heated, to 960°.</p>
                <p part="N">The same phenomena attend the condensation of all other vapours; and we
                    are to regard the discovery of Black, <hi rend="italic">that during the
                        conversion of solids into liquids, or of liquids into vapours, heat is
                        absorbed, which is again given out on their</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    both in its practical application, and in explaining the phenomena of
                    nature.</p>
                <p part="N">With regard to those aeriform bodies which we cannot condense, or, as
                    they are called in chemical language, permanently elastic fluids or <hi
                        rend="italic">gases,</hi> we have every reason to consider them but as
                    vapours, of which the po⅛t of generation is so low, that we have not yet found
                    any means of exhibiting them in their unelastic state. This view is supported by
                    analogy, and by recent discoveries. Some of the gases which a few years ago were
                    reckoned permanently elastic, have been, by a great pressure, reduced to the
                    state of liquids. This has been shown in the case of chlorine, muriatic acid,
                    ammonia, and carbonic acid. It can also be shown that gases contain latent
                    caloric. Thus, if we suddenly compress atmospheric air in a small tube fitted
                    with a piston, so much heat is given out as to ignite touchwood. The sudden
                    expansion of air, too, is always attended with the absorption of heat. Thus, on
                    discharging an air-gun, the sudden expansion of the air produces a sensible
                    degree of coolness in the condenser.</p>
                <p part="N">The same facts are shown when chemical action of the gases with each
                    other produces condensation, or when they are evolved from their
                    combinations.</p>
                <p part="N">The qualities of vapour are applied to many important purposes in the
                    useful arts; and, on account of its economical fitness, the vapour of water, or
                        <hi rend="italic">steam,</hi> is that almost always employed.</p>
                <p part="N">The application of steam to domestic purposes is familiar to all; and it
                    is frequently employed to communicate an equable heat, when a temperature above
                    212° would be injurious or dangerous. Thus steam, confined in metallic tubes, is
                    used to dry some delicate articles of manufacture; and in some instances, where
                    there is risk of explosion from even a moderate increase of temperature, the
                    same contrivance is adopted. Steam has also been employed to warm apartments. It
                    is employed to heat the dye-vats in calico-printing, and other species of
                    dyeing, and has likewise been used for h¢nting warm baths. For these last
                    purposes, the steam is usually allowed to escape into the fluid to be heated by
                    numerous small apertures in pipes coiled in the bottom of the vessel; which may
                    thus be made of less costly materials than if it were necessary to subject it to
                    the fire.</p>
                <p part="N">The most important application of steam, however, is as a moving power

                <p part="N">When the temperature of a body is raised to a certain pitch, it begins
                    to emit light as well as heat; and this is termed <hi rend="italic"
                        >incandescence,</hi> or glowing heat; a designation preferable to <hi

                        >combustion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a process totally different from
                    that treated of in this section, inasmuch as it is accompanied by important
                    chemical changes in the body acted on; whereas incandescence may be repeated
                    innumerable times with the same body, merely by raising its temperature. The
                    point at which this takes place would seem to be the same in all bodies, and has
                    been approximated by Newton; but as the determination depends on the acuteness
                    of the eye, and the degree of obscurity in the apartment where the experiment is
                    made, it is not easily fixed. According to his calculations, a good eye can
                    perceive a body faintly luminous about 635° Fahrenheit; it shines with a full
                    red in the dark about 752°, it is luminous in twilight at 884°, and glows in
                    broad day-light when its temperature has reached 1000°. The experiments of
                    Irvine, who found that mercury, which boils at 660°, is not in the slightest
                    degree luminous at that point, prove that Newton fixed the point of
                    incandescence too low. On the other hand, the determination of Wedgwood appears
                    too high. In general the point of incandescence may be stated at about 800°
                    Fahr. Its lowest pitch is at first a dull red, which becomes a full red with an
                    increased temperature, or the least refrangible rays first meet the eye; if the
                    heat be increased, these rays become mingled with the yellow; and, when the
                    temperature is raised to the utmost, all the other rays of the spectrum are
                    evolved in the proportions which constitute <hi rend="italic">white
                    light.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">All solids which are not volatilized by heat may be rendered
                    incandescent; and all liquids may be heated to redness, provided we can repress
                    their volatility. But it has been doubted whether gases be capable of
                    incandescence. Dr Fordyce had remarked that the extremity of the flame of a
                    blowpipe, which was itself invisible, heated a thin rod of glass to a white
                    heat; and some experiments of Mr T. Wedgwood prove that air, heated in a bent
                    tube passing through a crucible filled with red-hot sand, was not luminous,
                    although a gold wire suspended in the heated air became red. The speculations of
                    Sir Humphry Davy on flame show that his opinion inclined to consider flame as
                    luminous gases; but in all such cases there is reason to consider the light as
                    derived from the combustible. Incandescence can be excited by the mere
                    percussion of hard bodies against each other. Thus, two pieces of quartz struck
                    together will produce light; the same will take place with two fragments of
                    porcelain; and the light produced by the collision of flint and steel is partly
                    incandescence, partly a species of combustion of the steel.</p>
                <p part="N">It has been supposed that incandescence affords a probable evidence of
                    the identity or convertibility of heat into light. But this is not a legitimate
                    deduction; for we may conceive that light and heat, though two distinct fluids,
                    may have an intimate affinity for each other, or a tendency to unite, that both
                    may exist united in all matter, that heat is most easily separated by percussion
                    and friction, but that, when the percussion is violent, both are given out.</p>

                    But it is very different with dissimilar bodies, which can be shown to contain
                    unequal quantities of heat at the same temperature. The following is the method
                    of proving these positions. If we mix a pound of water at 40° with a pound of

                <p part="N">But if we mingle a pound of water at temperature 112° with a pound of
                    mercury at 40°, the resultant temperature will not be 76°, the mean, but 109°.
                    Here the temperature of the water has only been diminished 3°, yet that of the
                    mercury has risen 69°. If we reverse the experiment, and take water at 40° and
                    mercury at 112°, the product will be 43°; the mercury losing 69°, whilst the
                    water only acquires 3°; or the same quantity of heat which can elevate the
                    temperature of mercury 23° will only augment that of water l <hi

                    oil, Dr Thomson has shown <hi rend="italic">{System of Chemistry)</hi> that the
                    quantity of caloric which will elevate the temperature of the oil 2° can only
                    raise that of water 1°.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Black was undoubtedly the first who promulgated the idea of the
                    absorption of heat during liquefaction and the formation of vapour; and this
                    doctrine was publicly taught in his lectures in Glasgow university from 1757 to
                    1764. His pupil, Dr Irvine, continued these experiments at his suggestion, and
                    ascribed the absorption to a change in the <hi rend="italic">capacity for
                        heat.</hi> These experiments were made between 1765 and 1770; and in 1779 Dr
                    Adair Crawford published his treatise on <hi rend="italic">Animal Heat,</hi> in
                    which the capacities of numerous substances are given, which were corrected in
                    his edition of 1788, from the results of most elaborate experiments. Professor
                    Wilcke of Stockholm published some valuable experiments on the same subject, in
                    the Stockholm Transactions for 1781. This philosopher introduced the term <hi
                        rend="italic">specific heat</hi> for what Irvine named <hi rend="italic"
                        >capacity for heat.</hi> Various experiments on the same subject were made
                    by Lavoisier and Laplace, with the instrument called a <hi rend="italic"
                        >calorimeter,</hi> in which the specific caloric was estimated by the
                    quantity of snow melted by different substances heated to the same pitch. The
                    subject of experiment in their investigations was introduced into a wire cage
                    suspended within a vessel of tinned iron. This vessel was filled with snow or
                    ice; and to secure that snow from being melted by the external air, the vessel
                    containing it was placed within another exterior case, and the space between
                    them also filled with snow; and the whole covered by a lid, likewise covered
                    with snow. Thus, if water in passing from 2l2° to 32° melted one pound of ice,
                    and the same weight of oil melted a half pound; if the specific caloric of water
                    be termed 1∙0, that of oil will be 0∙5.</p>
                <p part="N">A considerable series of experiments on this· curious subject were made
                    by Dr Dalton <hi rend="italic">{New System of Chemical Philosophy).</hi> In
                    these investigations Dalton pursued a method, also employed by Leslie, namely,
                    to observe the comparative rates of cooling, as was proposed by Meyer. This
                    would be preferable to the other modes of ascertaining the specific caloric,
                    were we sure that the cooling of bodies is not influenced by other circumstances
                    than their capacity; but in this method it is difficult to obviate the effects
                    of radiation and conducting power on refrigeration. In all these determinations
                    there are to be foynd discrepancies inseparable from the difficulties attending
                    such delicate investigations; but they have sufficient accordance when we
                    attempt to estimate the capacities of solids and of liquids. It is a far more
                    difficult and delicate problem to determine the specific caloric of gaseous
                    bodies, from the minute quantities of matter to be operated on in such
                    experiments, and the difficulty of obviating the chance of accidental error
                    where the changes of temperature are necessarily very minute. Crawford found the
                    difference in the specific heat of the gases rarely to exceed <hi

                    the same metal, and furnished with stop-cocks, and an adapting piece, to be
                    screwed to an air-pump. One of these was filled with the gas to be tried, and
                    the other was exhausted of air. Each ball had cemented into it a very delicate
                    thermometer; both were heated to the same pitch by exposure to the same source
                    of heat, conveyed by cylinders surrounded with warm water. They were then
                    simultaneously plunged into separate vessels containing each equal quantities of
                    cold water, and the elevation of temperature of the water in both vessels
                    ascertained by delicate thermometers, indicating as small a change as j⅛th of a
                    degree of Fahrenheit. The temperature communicated by the vacuum being
                    subtracted from that given out by the other ball, the difference exhibited the
                    heat communicated by the included air alone; and the accuracy of the method was
                    afterwards tested by again comparing them when the exhausted vessel was filled
                    with atmospheric air.</p>
                <p part="N">The specific caloric of gases has been again investigated by Berard and
                    Delaroche in 1813. They passed a current of each gas, at a given temperature,
                    through a spiral tube, fixed in a cylinder of thin copper filled with water and
                    then closed. The temperature communicated, by the passage of the gases from a
                    gasometer through the spiral, to the surrounding medium in a given time, being
                    proportional to the excess of temperature each gas acquires from the source of
                    heat above that of the medium in the cylinder, the comparative specific heat of
                    each gas may be ascertained.</p>
                <p part="N">For the success of such experiments the current of gas must be uniform,
                    and the temperature of the gas, when entering and escaping from the cylinder,
                    must be accurately ascertained, as well as that of the water in the copper
                    vessel.</p>
                <p part="N">The conclusions of these philosophers are directly at variance with
                    those of Crawford, and, indeed, would tend to overturn some of the most
                    important points of the philosophy of heat now generally received. But these
                    experiments, though highly ingenious, are not more satisfactory than those of
                    Crawford. The only objection to his conclusions is derived from the smallness of
                    the quantities operated upon in his experiments; but the simplicity of his
                    apparatus, the delicacy of his instruments, and the apparent care of his
                    manipulations, more than fully counterbalance that objection; whilst the
                    complexity of the apparatus of Berard and Delaroche, the acknowledged difficulty
                    of keeping up an equable current through the spiral tube, the impossibility of
                    obviating in such investigations the influence of changes in the medium during
                    the experiments, and the nicety requisite to ascertain the temperature of the
                    entering and escaping currents, present sources of error of which it is almost
                    impossible to estimate the amount. On these grounds we may consider the
                    conclusions of Crawford as not yet overturned.</p>
                <p part="N">The deductions of these gentlemen would lead to the conclusion that all
                    the gases, with the exception of hydrogen, have an inferior specific gravity to
                    water; and they even make steaín <hi rend="italic">inferior</hi> in capacity to
                    water in the ratio of 847 to 1000. If this last were true, instead of an
                    absorption of heat when steam is generated, we should have an extrication of
                    caloric from it; and water in the <hi rend="italic">worm-tub</hi> of a still, or
                    in the <hi rend="italic">condensing-bach</hi> of a steam-engine, ought not to
                    increase in temperature. It may be added, that more recently the conclusions of
                    Berard and Delaroche have been controverted by Delarive; and his experiments, as
                    well as those of Clement, support the opinions of Crawford.</p>

                    same temperature, when perfectly freed from moisture, have the same specific
                    heat; and that when they are saturated with water, their specific caloric is a
                    certain ascending arithmetical ratio, in proportion to the quantity of moisture
                    they contain. These views are rendered not improbable by the well-ascertained
                    fact, that the elasticities of all the gases are the same at the same
                    temperature.</p>
                <p part="N">The capacities of bodies are more nearly in the inverse ratio of their
                    density, than of any other sensible property. Thus solids in general have less
                    capacity for caloric than liquids, and liquids less than vapours or gaseous
                    bodies. In the same body a change of capacity accompanies a change of volume.
                    Thus gases compressed have their capacity diminished, and heat is extricated;
                    and when they expand, their capacity is increased, which is the cause of the
                    coldness felt on a sudden expansion of the air. Crawford endeavoured to show
                    that this was also the case with liquids; but his experiments are scarcely to be
                    relied on as establishing that point. The contraction of Wedgwood’s pyrometrical
                    pieces would seem to diminish sensibly their capacity for heat. The capacity of
                    bodies is not, however, exactly in the inverse ratio of their density, which
                    probably arises from the effect of density on capacity for heat being modified
                    by a difference in the force of affinity between caloric and various substances.
                    There seems also to be some relation between capacity and power for conducting
                    heat, as the former is nearly in the inverse ratio of the latter. If these views
                    be correct, we may assume that the capacity of all bodies for caloric is
                    directly as their volume and their affinity for heat, and inversely as their
                    conducting power and their density.</p>
                <p part="N">When a body changes its form of existence, its capacity for heat is also
                    changed. When a solid is melted, its capacity is increased, and the specific
                    heat of the same substance is still further increased when it is converted into
                    vapour. Thus, according to the best experiments, the capacity of ice is 0∙9000,
                    that of water being 1∙000, and that of steam 1∙500.</p>
                <p part="N">This important law was applied by Dr Irvine to explain the liquefaction
                    of solids. Dr Black regarded the liquefaction as owing to the absorption of
                    heat; Dr Irvine ascribed this absorption to a change in the capacity of the
                    body. The first ascribed the melting of the solid to the absorption of the heat,
                    whilst the other attributed the absorption to the change of form. As the change
                    of form and the absorption or extrication of caloric are in such cases
                    simultaneous, it is obvious that the question cannot be decided by direct
                    experiment. It has been objected to Irvine’s theory that it assigns no cause for
                    the change of form, whilst Black’s ascribes the change to the ingress of
                    caloric. On the other hand, Black’s theory does not explain why the heat is
                    absorbed. When we heat a solid, the first effect is expansion, and this
                    expansion keeping pace with the increasing temperature, a point will be attained
                    when the expansion has so far overcome the cohesion of the solid that its
                    particles move freely among each other, that is, when the body will become
                    liquid. Thus far the change may be attributed to sensible heat; but the capacity
                    of the body for heat has all the time been increasing, and, to satisfy this
                    increased capacity, sensible heat has become latent. This appears the simplest
                    view of the subject, ascribing the change of capacity to the expansion by the
                    sensible heat; and the difference between the solid and fluid states may be
                    conceived to depend on the prevalence of one of two opposing forms, the cohesive
                    attraction of the particles of matter for each other, and the repulsive energy
                    of caloric.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Black has supposed that latent heat is retained in bodies by an
                    affinity superior to that between sensible caloric and the particles of matter,
                    and liquefaction is ascribed to this more intimate union. This opinion is
                    scarcely perhaps reconcilable with the immediate effect of mixing ice cooled to
                    20° and water a little above the freezing point, when the water parts with its
                    latent heat to raise the temperature of the ice; or with the effect of
                    mechanical pressure in causing gases to part with their latent caloric.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Absolute Quantity of Heat in Bodies.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">It will be sufficiently obvious, that neither by the thermometer nor by
                    the capacity of bodies do we determine the whole heat which they contain at any
                    temperature. The first is evidently nothing more than an indication of changes
                    in a scale, of which the two extremes are unknown; the last mode affords us but
                    the relative quantity of caloric required to elevate the temperature of other
                    bodies compared to water, but it does not point out how many degrees any given
                    temperature is above that point at which a body is deprived of all its heat.
                    Irvine appears to have first conceived the idea of ascertaining by calculation
                    the absolute zero, or deprivation of all heat, on the supposition that the whole
                    heat in any body is proportional to its capacity. If this be granted, the whole
                    caloric it contains at a given temperature may be found by ascertaining the
                    quantity of heat it absorbs when passing from the solid to the liquid state.
                    Thus ice has the capacity of 9 to water as 10, and, when both are at temperature
                    32°, water will contain one tenth more heat than the same weight of ice; but
                    this excess is given out when water freezes, and as much is again absorbed when
                    it melts. According to Black’s experiment, ice absorbs as much caloric, whilst
                    passing into water, as would elevate an equal quantity of ice-cold water 140°
                    Fahrenheit. Therefore 10 × 140 = 1400°, will give the <hi rend="italic">natural
                        zero,</hi> or the point of the absolute deprivation of heat Almost the same
                    result is obtained by comparing the capacity of steam and water, viz. 1∙0 and 1
                    ’ 5. Water, in passing into steam, absorbs 940° of sensible heat, and 940 × 1∙5
                    = 1410.</p>
                <p part="N">The following general formula, as applicable to this investigation, is
                    given by Professor Robison in his notes on Black’s Lectures. Let the capacity of
                    water be 1. Let the quantity of water be W, and its temperature be <hi

                <p part="N">The accuracy of this conclusion, however, depends on three points:
                    first, the perfect determination of the specific heat of water, and of its two
                    other forms of existence, to which it is probably impossible to obtain any more
                    than an approximation; secondly, on the assumption that the whole heat of bodies
                    is retained in them by their capacity; and, lastly, on the supposition that
                    while the body retains its form of existence, its capacity remains unchanged.
                    Until these points be established, the theory is but an amusing speculation, in
                    which the estimates oí other philosophers do not materially differ from those oí
                    Irvine. Rumford, from experiments on the heat extricated by the combination of
                    hydrogen and oxygen, placed the natural zero at 1552° Fahrenheit below the
                    freezing point; Gadolin, from the cold produced by dissolving muriate of soda in
                    water, inferred it to be at — 1432°.</p>

                    combustibles may thus be fired; and if the lens be large, it produces the most
                    intense temperature we can command. In the focus of the powerful lens made in
                    London for Mr Parker (which measured three feet in diameter, three inches thick
                    at the centre, and weighed 212 lbs.), the most infusible metals were instantly
                    melted and dissipated in vapour, and most stony substances were vitrified.
                    Another, constructed at Paris, is described in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Memoires</hi> of the French academy. Lenses of great power have been also
                    made of two curved plates of glass joined together, and filled with spirit of
                    wine. A remarkable lens of this sort, formed by bending two plates of glass on a
                    parabolic mold, and filling the cavity between them with ninety quarts of
                    spirit, was constructed by Rossini of Gratz, in Styria. The diameter of the
                    plates was 3 feet 3 inches, and they were united by a strong ring of metal. The
                    whole was mounted on a heliostat, which, with the lens complete, weighed 550
                    lbs. This fine instrument cost about L.1000j but became, a few years ago, the
                    property of the French government for L.338. In its focus a diamond was
                    instantly kindled and dissipated; and a piece of platinum, twenty-nine grains in
                    weight, was melted and thrown into violent ebullition.</p>
                <p part="N">Concave metallic mirrors are capable also of concentrating the sun’s
                    rays, so as to produce a powerful heat. Mirrors of hammered brass, or tinned
                    iron, are used for experiments on the radiation of heat. It was by some
                    combination of mirrors that Archimedes is said to have fired the Roman fleet at
                    the siege of Syracuse; and Kircher, having found a description in Tzetzes, of
                    the device of Archimedes, from which it would seem that the mirrors were placed
                    on <hi rend="italic">hinges,</hi> in order to adjust them to a focus,
                    constructed a compound burning mirror of this kind possessing considerable
                    power; but Buffon, by combining as many as 168 plane glass mirrors, six inches
                    broad, showed that silver might be fused at the distance of sixty feet by such
                    an instrument.</p>
                <p part="N">2. The capability of friction between two solids to excite heat is well
                    known. In Rumford’s experiments water was made to boil by the friction in boring
                    a cannon; and the simple experiment of rubbing a smooth metallic button on a
                    board, by which much heat is produced, is familiar to every school-boy. The
                    firing of carriagewheels, and of different kinds of machinery, whose parts,
                    moving against each other, are not well oiled, is well known. This extrication
                    of heat takes place <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> as well as in the air, and
                    appears to be owing to the compression employed forcing the particles of the
                    solid more closely together, and extricating their latent caloric. Berthollet
                    showed that this extrication of caloric is not unlimited, as Rumford erroneously
                    supposed; but that, if we repeatedly compress any body, the quantity of heat
                    extricated rapidly diminishes by each application of the compressing force.</p>
                <p part="N">Percussion acts in precisely the same manner. A piece of iron, by smart
                    hammering on an anvil, may become so hot as to fire combustibles. This process
                    evidently diminishes the capacity of the iron for heat, its specific gravity
                    becomes greater, and the loss of its latent heat renders it stiff and brittle. A
                    similar change takes place in <hi rend="italic">wiredrawing</hi> metals; so
                    that, to restore pliability and ductility, we must subject them to the fire,
                    which restores their latent heat, and renders them again ductile.</p>
                <p part="N">3. Chemical action is a fruitful source of increase of temperature. If
                    we mingle together equal parts of sulphuric acid and water, or of alcohol and of
                    water, the ' bulk of the mixture diminishes, and heat is given out. The
                    temperature produced by chemical action will often ignite inflammables. Thus a
                    drop of sulphuric acid on a mixture of chlorate of potassa and sugar will set
                    the mixture on fire. Indeed, the process of combustion, the great source of
                    artificial heat, is nothing more than the chemical union of the oxygen of the
                    air with the combustible body. The source of the temperature is the liberation
                    of the latent heat of the oxygen, on its entering into union with the
                    carbonaceous matter of the fuel; and the increase of the temperature is in
                    proportion to the air consumed in a given time. If we wish a higher temperature,
                    we increase the quantity of air that passes through the fuel; hence the utility
                    of bellows, and of the blowpipe, in exciting a higher temperature than the
                    spontaneous combustion of the burning body would afford.</p>
                <p part="N">The construction of furnaces for the melting of metals depends on this
                    principle; namely, that of causing a large quantity of air to pass through the
                    fire in a short period.</p>
                <p part="N">The heating of apartments by an open fire-place partly depends on
                    somewhat different principles. We must not only secure a proper draught of air
                    up the chimney to consume the fuel, but we must secure the <hi rend="italic"
                        >radiation of heat</hi> into the room. Dark and rough surfaces radiate much
                    of their communicated heat; and therefore, when any part of the grate is
                    intended to afford the heat it receives from the fire to the air of the room, it
                    should be of cast iron with some pattern on its surface, not of bright polished
                    metal. This also forms the best material for a stove; but in open fire-places
                    the heating of the apartment not only depends on what is radiated into the room,
                    but also on what is <hi rend="italic">reflected.</hi> As bright surfaces reflect
                    best, the <hi rend="italic">covings of</hi> the grate should be of bright and
                    polished metal, and placed at about an angle of 45° to the back of the grate. By
                    this disposition the heat of the fire, falling on the covings, is reflected at
                    the same angle into the room; and we thus obtain a more considerable effect from
                    the same expenditure of fuel.</p>
                <p part="N">For large apartments, and for public buildings, heat has been more
                    effectually conveyed by the hot-air stoves of Dr Murray, and of Mr Strutt as
                    improved by Sylvester. The principle of these inventions is to heat a current of
                    air, by passing it between an interior <hi rend="italic">cockle</hi> or furnace
                    containing the fuel, and an exterior case, at the distance of a few inches from
                    the cockle. The air so heated is admitted into the space to be warmed, and
                    diffuses an equable warmth through the building. The only objection to hot air
                    so introduced is the empyreumatic odour which the heat of the cockle, when not
                    well managed, is apt to communicate to the air. But this objection is obviated
                    by the contrivance of Mr Perkins, in which hot water is made to circulate
                    through wrought iron tubes; and when more heat is required, these tubes are
                    coiled up in several convolutions in the place where the most heat is wanted. In
                    this city, the large premises of Messrs Cadell and Company, booksellers, are so
                    heated; and the General Register House will in a short period be warmed by a
                    similar apparatus.</p>
                <p part="N">2. <hi rend="italic">Artificial Means of Diminishing
                    Temperature.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">There are three methods by which we can cool bodies; by placing them in
                    contact with colder substances, by the evaporation of liquids, and by the
                    liquefaction of solids.</p>
                <p part="N">1. The first method is very familiar, and dépends on the tendency of
                    caloric to an <hi rend="italic">equilibrium</hi> in contiguous bodies.</p>
                <p part="N">2. The conversion of a body into vapour causes, by the increase of its
                    capacity for heat, an absorption of caloric.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641643?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1643-0196"/>
                <p part="N">Thus the evaporation of water from the ball of a thermometer causes the
                    mercury to fall. If we apply a still more evaporable fluid, aether, the fall of
                    the thermometer will be still lower; and, if we accelerate this process by an
                    air-pump, the cold produced will be intense; the degree of the absorption of
                    heat, or, in other words, the production of cold, being in proportion to the
                    quickness of the evaporation.</p>
                <p part="N">. 3. The most powerful means of reducing temperature is by what are
                    termed <hi rend="italic">freezing mixtures.</hi> All these depend on the rapid
                    melting of solids by the addition of various substances. Many experiments have
                    been made on this subject by Lowitz of Petersburg, and by Mr Walker of
                    Cambridge. Salts are the solids most commonly used, and they are in general
                    either mixed with snow or with acids. Thus, if we mix common salt and snow
                    together, the temperature falls to 0° of Fahrenheit. If we pour two ounces of
                    nitric acid diluted with an equal quantity of water on three ounces of sulphate
                    of soda, the temperature sinks below the beginning of Fahrenheit’s scale. Equal
                    parts of strong muriatic acid and of snow will produce a cold of — 30°
                    Fahrenheit; and the same proportions of diluted sulphuric acid and snow, if
                    previously cooled down to 20°, will cause the freezing of mercury, reducing the
                    temperature to — 60°. Dry muriate of lime and dry powdery snow, in the
                    proportions of two of the former to one of the latter, if previously cooled by
                    immersion in salt and snow, will sink the temperature to — 66°; and three parts
                    of muriate of lime and two of snow, similarly treated, will reduce the
                    temperature to — 73°.</p>
                <p part="N">In all these experiments, it is the sudden conversion of sensible into,
                    latent heat that lowers the temperature of the mixtures; the substances assume
                    the liquid form, their capacity for heat is increased, and the disappearance of
                    the sensible heat is manifested by the sinking of the thermometer.</p>
                <p part="N">3. <hi rend="italic">Natural Variations of Temperature.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The temperature of the earth is affected by the absorption of the solar
                    rays. The revolution of the earth on its axis brinġs successive portions of its
                    surface under the immediate influence of the sun, and this portion is greatly
                    extended on either side of the equator by the beautifully simple yet stupendous
                    contrivance of the inclination of that axis to the plane of its orbit. These
                    causes produce variations in natural temperature; and as they are uniform and
                    constant in their operation, the temperature of any place is liable to little
                    change, if compared for a series of years, however subject to inequalities in
                    short intervals of time.</p>
                <p part="N">The mean temperature of any climate cannot be ascertained by a few
                    observations on the heat of the air; but experience has shown that the mean
                    temperature of the month of April, in our latitudes, will afford a near
                    approximation to that of the whole year. The surface of the ground absorbs the
                    heat of the sun, and becomes thereby warmed; but much of the heat so acquired is
                    lost by radiation during the night, as we have already explained. The surplus
                    heat is slowly transmitted downwards. The experiments made by Mr Ferguson, at
                    Raith, in Fifeshire, by burying very large thermometers at different depths in
                    his garden, showed that during summer the increasing heat penetrated through the
                    ground about five feet each month, or about two inches daily; so that the whole
                    heat of the summer six months would penetrate to about thirty feet, which agrees
                    remarkably with the experiments made by Saussure on the banks of the Arve, near
                    Geneva. There the heat of summer took six months to penetrate thirty-one feet;
                    and beyond that depth the temperature of the earth underwent no change from the
                    summer’s heat or the winter’s cold. Hence deep caves, or springs whose sources
                    are from a considerable depth, may be considered' as affording a tolerable
                    approximation to the mean annual temperature of the places where they occur.
                    This, however, is not always true. The writer of this article, during several
                    years, occasionally took the temperature of the largest spring in Great Britain,
                        <hi rend="italic">St Winifred's,</hi> at Holywell, in Flintshire; and the
                    temperature of its water was always considerably higher than 50°, the mean
                    temperature . of that part of the island. In three successive years it was about
                    57°, and never but once, after heavy rain, observed so low as 55°, whilst
                    another very copious contiguous spring, the sacred well of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Einnon Asa,</hi> was no more than 50°.</p>
                <p part="N">Latitude must exert a great influence on the temperature of the earth,
                    as is sufficiently obvious; but the extremes of temperature, at different times,
                    in the same place, are less within the tropics than toward the polar limits of
                    the temperate and in the frigid zones; for the difference of heat at different
                    seasons must be less, in those regions where the sun is twice vertical annually,
                    than in higher latitudes.</p>
                <p part="N">There are two other causes which exert no small influence on the heat of
                    a climate, the vicinity of the ocean, and elevation above its level.</p>
                <p part="N">From the enormous mass of the ocean, its waters, except in the vicinity
                    of land or polar ices, have a remarkable uniformity of temperature in almost
                    every climate; and hence the ocean may be considered as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >great equalizer of heat</hi> over the globe, tending to mitigate the
                    fervour of tropical climates, and the rigour of the polar regions.</p>
                <p part="N">When cold air sweeps over the surface of the ocean, it tends to cool the
                    particles of water at the surface; but by this process their specific gravity is
                    increased, and they sink, whilst their place is supplied by fresh particles from
                    below, which, becoming cooled in their turn, give rise to internal motions in
                    the water. From its immense mass, it is evident that no partial application of
                    cold air can reduce the mean temperature of its whole waters; and hence we find
                    that the temperature of islands in our latitudes is not so low in winter as that
                    of continents under the same parallel. Thus, the severity of winter in Britain
                    bears no proportion to that of France or Germany in the same parallels of
                    latitude. The most northern of the Orkney Islands is nearly in the latitude of
                    Petersburg, yet in the former a continued frost for three or four days is a rare
                    occurrence, whilst in the latter the rapid and spacious Neva is completely
                    frozen over for several months every season.</p>
                <p part="N">On the other hand, the ocean exerts a great influence in mitigating the
                    heat of tropical regions. It is true that when the upper-particles of water
                    become heated, the internal motions from unequal temperature cease; but the
                    rarefaction produced sets a current in motion, which, aided by the trade winds,
                    becomes very manifest amongst the West Indian islands in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gulf Stream</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the place of which is supplied by
                    currents of cooler water perpetually setting in from the polar regions. But this
                    is not all. The temperature of the atmosphere is mightily diminished by the
                    increased evaporation from the water in warm latitudes; and we have seen, that
                    during this conversion of water into vapour, as much heat becomes latent as
                    would raise the temperature of an equal quantity of other matter by at least
                    900° Fahrenheit. Hence tropical islands are less warm than continents under the
                    same parallel; and the intersection of continents by gulfs and seas tends to
                    mitigate the extremes of temperature. The extended form of the old continent
                    towards the eastern regions of Asia renders the inequalities of temperature much
                    greater than under the same parallels in Europe. Thus, at <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193641656?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1656-0197"/>Pekin, the
                    thermometer in winter often descends far below the.freezing point, and averages,
                    during the night, for several months, 20° Fahrenheit: yet this place is under
                    the same parallel of latitude as the finest provinces of Southern Italy and the
                    centre of Spain.</p>
                <p part="N">But of all the causes influencing the temperature of a country, there is
                    none more important than that of elevation above the level of the sea. In every
                    climate, as is well known, the temperature diminishes as we rise in the
                    atmosphere; and if mountains be very lofty, their summits are the abode of
                    perpetual winter. This is best explained by the fact, that as we rarefy air, its
                    capacity for caloric is increased; the consequence of which is, that its
                    temperature falls as its sensible is converted into latent heat. In passing
                    through air, the sun’s rays do not sensibly heat it; but when they impinge on
                    the opake surface of the earth, they are retained, raise its temperature, and a
                    part of this increased heat is communicated to the contiguous stratum of air,
                    which expands, ascends, and has its place supplied by a cooler stratum, which
                    ascends in its turn. Thus the earth warms the air near the surface; but as the
                    pressure of the column of air diminishes by its ascent, its redundant heat
                    becomes latent as the volume of the air augments; so that, at moderate
                    elevations, the atmosphere receives no genial influence from the warmth imparted
                    to the earth; and very lofty mountains, in all climates, are covered with
                    perennial snow, and where the temperature is steadily below the freezing point,
                    there is perpetual congelation. The point at which this takes place is different
                    in different latitudes. The limit is highest under the equator, and descends as
                    we approach the poles. It is obvious too that the influence of the seasons,
                    especially in those countries where there is a great difference between the
                    temperature of summer and winter, will alter the limit of perpetual congelation.
                    In such climates it will fluctuate with the seasons between two points, which
                    form what are termed the <hi rend="italic">higher and lower limits</hi> of
                    congelation. The difference between these limits is least in tropical regions,
                    but increases toward the poles. This circumstance is of great importance,
                    inasmuch as it influences the formation of the stupendous glaciers, which excite
                    the curiosity and admiration of the traveller, in the elevated regions of the
                    temperate, and on the acclivities of the arctic circle.</p>
                <p part="N">The ascent of heated air from the heated surface of the earth might be
                    supposed to warm the superior regions of the atmosphere, were not this
                    counteracted by the increased capacity of rarefied air for heat, by which much
                    more is absorbed than the ascending air can carry with it; but, on the other
                    hand, the too great loss of heat in the lower strata of air is provided against,
                    by the change of capacity which takes place as cool air descends to supply the
                    place of that which has ascended. Its density is increased by increasing
                    pressure, consequently its capacity for heat is diminished; and the heat thus
                    extricated is imparted to the contiguous strata of air. That these two processes
                    counterbalance each other is very obvious, from the uniformity of mean
                    temperature in any spot.</p>
                <p part="N">The influence of elevation above the level of the sea is capable of
                    countervailing the effect of low latitudes on the vegetable productions of such
                    regions. Tournefort had remarked the succession of plants on the ascent of Mount
                    Ararat, which gave him, in Armenia, the vegetable forms of different parts of
                    Europe. In Wahlenberg’s <hi rend="italic">Flora Lap-pθiiica,</hi> this
                    distribution of vegetable forms into zones is well characterized. The same is
                    remarked iń Ramonďs examination of the botany of the Pyrenees; and the
                    illustrious traveller Humboldt has given a striking illustration of the same
                    distribution, in his examination of the equinoctial Andes. After rising through
                    various parallel belts or zones of vegetation, each marked by some
                    characteristic plants, if the mountains be sufficiently high, in all latitudes
                    we arrive at the region of stunted shrubs, and of Alpine plants and grasses,

                <p part="N">These various causes affecting natural temperature render it impossible
                    to estimate the mean heat of any country by its latitude; and as every formula
                    hitherto devised for calculating the mean temperature of any region is now found
                    to be erroneous, it is only by multiplied observations that we can arrive at any
                    accurate conclusion. In the mean time Humboldt has conferred a great favour on
                    meteorological science by his admirable paper <hi rend="italic">On Isothermal
                        Lines, and the Distribution of Heat over the Globe.</hi> Setting aside all
                    hypothetical views, he has traced on a chart, from the best meteorological
                    observations, lines of <hi rend="italic">equal temperatures</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> so that at a glance we can trace the places which are
                    found to have the same mean temperature. From this map we immediately perceive
                    how widely these isothermal lines differ from the parallels of latitude; and we
                    remark, that the isothermal lines of Western Europe sink to a far lower latitude
                    as they recede on either hand. Thus, the isothermal line of temperature 54° ∙4
                    in France, in longitude 0. 37. east, passes through latitude 45. 46. north; but
                    in China, in longitude 116. 27. east, passes near Pekin, in latitude 39. 54.
                    north; and in longitude 104. west, near the mouth of Columbia River, in America,
                    it passes through 44. 40. north. The isothermal lines, however, on the eastern
                    side of the Rocky Mountains, descend still lower, compared to their position in
                    Europe, as the following table shows :—</p>

                <p part="N">In both continents the most rapid decrease of mean temperature is
                    between the parallels of latitude 40° and 45°; a circumstance which, Humboldt
                    justly remarks, has undoubtedly had a happy influence on the civilization and
                    industry of the people inhabiting that zone, because these slight variations of
                    latitude produce considerable changes in the vegetable productions that become
                    objects of rural economy; and when contiguous countries differ much in their
                    products, it stimulates the industry of each, and gives vigour to commercial
                    intercourse; circumstances highly conducive to civilization.</p>
