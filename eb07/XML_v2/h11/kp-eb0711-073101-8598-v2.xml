                    long abstinence from food when the body is in a healthy state. The following
                    useful observations upon hunger or famine are extracted from a paper by Dr
                    Percival in the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester
                        Transactions.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In a state of famine, life may be protracted, with less pain and misery,
                    by means of a moderate allowance of water. For the acrimony and putrefaction of
                    the humours are obviated by such dilution; the small vessels are kept permeable;
                    and the lungs are furnished with that moisture which is essential to the
                    performance of their functions. Fontanus, a writer of respectable authority in
                    the estimation of Morgagni, relates the history of a woman who obstinately
                    refused to take any sustenance, except twice, during the space of fifty days, at
                    the end of which period she died. But he adds, that she used water by way of
                    drink, though in small quantity. Redi, who made many experiments (cruel and
                    unjustifiable in our opinion) to ascertain the effects of fasting on fowls,
                    observed that none were able to support life beyond the ninth day to whom drink
                    was denied, whercas one indulged with water lived more than twenty days.</p>
                <p part="N">Hippocrates has observed, that children are more affected by abstinence
                    than young persons, these more than the middle-aged, and the middle-aged more
                    than old men. The power to endure famine, however, must depend no less upon the
                    state of health and strength than upon the age of the sufferer. There are also
                    particular constitutions which do not suffer much pain from the calls of hunger.
                    Dr Percival was informed by a young physician from Geneva, that when he was a
                    student at Montpellier he fasted three nights and four days, with no other
                    refreshment than a pint of water daily. His hunger was keen, but never painful,
                    during the first and second days of his abstinence; and the two following days
                    he perceived only a faintness when he attempted either bodily or mental
                    exertion. A sense of coldness was diffused over his whole frame, but more
                    particularly affected the extremities. His mind was in a very unusual state of
                    pusillanimity; and he experienced a great tendency to tears whenever he
                    recollected the circumstance which had been the occasion of his fasting. During
                    the whole period, the alvine excretions were suppressed, but not those by the
                    kidneys; and at the close of it his skin became tinged with a shade of yellow.
                    The first food he took was veal broth, which had something of an intoxicating
                    effect, producing a glow of warmth, and raising his spirits, so as to render him
                    ashamed of his despondency. Perhaps, in the case of Sextius Baculus, as recorded
                    in the Commentaries of Caesar (lib. vi.), the extraordinary courage and prowess
                    which he suddenly exerted might be aided by the exhilarating effect of
                    sustenance, which, under such circumstances, it is probable he would no longer
                    decline. The fact, however, evinces that neither his sickness nor the sensations
                    of hunger had been so violent as much to impair his strength of body or vigour
                    of mind. Pomponius Atticus, the celebrated friend of Cicero, who put a voluntary
                    end to his life in the seventy-seventh year of his age by refusing all food,
                    appears to have experienced ease from his disorder, rather than any acute
                    sufferings, by famine. “Sic cum biduo cibo se abstinuisset, subito febris
                    decessit, leviorque morbus esse coepit; tamen propositum nihilo secius peregit.
                    Itaque die quinto, postquam id consilium inierat, decessit.”<note

                    conjectured that he did not wholly deny himself the use of water, or of some

                    the evidence of numerous melancholy facts to show’ that the pressure of want is
                    agonizing to the human frame. “I have talked,” says an ingenious writer,<note

                    in its extremity, and who was the only person that had not lost his senses when
                    they received accidental relief. He assured me his pains at first were so great
                    as to be often tempted to eat a part of one of the men who died, and which the
                    rest of his crew actually for some time lived upon. He said that, during the
                    continuance of this paroxysm, he found his pains insupportable, and was desirous
                    at one time of anticipating that death which he thought inevitable. But his
                    pains, he said, gradually decreased after the sixth day (for they had water in
                    the ship, which kept them alive so long), and then he was in a state rather of
                    languor than desire; nor did he much wish for food, except when he saw others
                    eating; and that for a while revived his appetite, though with diminished
                    importunity. The latter part of the time, when his health was almost destroyed,
                    a thousand strange images rose upon his mind, and every one of his senses began
                    to bring him wrong information. The most fragrant perfumes appeared to him to
                    have a fetid smell; and every thing he looked at took a greenish hue, and
                    sometimes a yellow. When he was presented with food by the ship’s company that
                    took him and his men up, four of whom died shortly after, he could not help
                    looking upon it with loathing instead of desire; and it was not till after four
                    days that his stomach was brought to its natural tone, when the violence of his
                    appetite returned with a sort of canine eagerness.”</p>
                <p part="N">To those who by their occupations are exposed to such dreadful
                    calamities, it is of serious importance to be instructed in the means of
                    alleviating them. The American Indians are said to use a composition of the
                    juice of tobacco, and the shells of snails, cockles, and oysters calcined,
                    whenever they undertake a long journey, and are likely to be destitute of
                    provisions. It is probable the shells are not burned into quicklime, but only so
                    as to destroy their tenacity, and to render them fit for lévigation. The mass is
                    dried, and formed into pills of a proper size to be held between the gum and
                    lip, which, being gradually dissolved and swallowed, deaden the sensations both
                    of hunger and of thirst. Tobacco, by its narcotic quality, seems well adapted to
                    counteract the uneasy impressions which the gastric juice makes on the nerves of
                    the stomach when it is empty; and the combination of testaceous powder with it
                    may tend to correct the secretion that is supposed to be the chief agent in
                    digestion, and which, if not acid, is always united with acidity. Certain at
                    least it is, that their operation is both grateful and salutary; for we find the
                    luxurious inhabitants of the East Indies mix them with the betel-nut, to the
                    chewing of which they are universally and immoderately addicted. Perhaps such
                    absorbents may be usefully applied, both to divide the doses and to moderate the
                    virulence of the tobacco. For, in the internal exhibition of this plant, much
                    caution is required, as it produces sickness, vertigo, cold clammy sweats, and a
                    train of other formidable symptoms, when taken in too large a quantity. During
                    the time of war, the impressed sailors frequently bring on these maladies that
                    they may be admitted into the hospitals, and released from servitude. It would
                    be an easy and safe experiment to ascertain the efficacy and to adjust the
                    ingredients of the Indian composition mentioned; and there is reason to believe
                    that the trial would be in some degree successful; for it is known that smoking
                    tobacco gives relief to those habitual pains of the stomach which appear to
                    arise from the irritation of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648611?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-8611-0732"/>the gastric secretion. The like effect is
                    sometimes produced by increasing the flow of saliva, and swallowing what is thus
                    discharged. And Dr Percival has related the case of a gentleman who used to
                    masticate, many hours daily, a piece of lead, which being neither hard, friable,
                    nor offensive to the palate, suited his purpose, as he thought, better than any
                    other substance. He continued the custom for many years, deriving great ease
                    from it, and suffering no sensible injury from the poisonous quality of the
                    metal. On mentioning this fact to a navy surgeon, the doctor was told that the
                    sailors, when in hot climates, are wont to mitigate thirst by rolling a bullet
                    in their mouths. A more innocent mean, the doctor observes, might be devised;
                    but the efficacy of this evinces, that the salivary glands are for awhile
                    capable of furnishing a substitute for drink. When a scarcity of water occurs at
                    sea, Dr Franklin has advised that the mariners should bathe themselves in tubs
                    of salt water. For, in pursuing the amusement of swimming, he observed, that
                    however thirsty he was before immersion, he never continued so afterwards; and
                    that, though he soaked himself several hours in the day, and several days
                    successively, in salt water, he perceived not, in consequence of it, the least
                    taste of saltness in his mouth. He also further suggests, that the same good
                    effect might perhaps be derived from dipping the sailors’ apparel in the sea,
                    and expresses a confidence that no danger of catching cold would ensue.</p>
                <p part="N">To prevent the calamity of famine at sea, it has been proposed by Dr
                    Lind, that the powder of salep should constitute part of the provisions of every
                    ship’s company. This powder and portable soup, dissolved in boiling water, form
                    a rich thick jelly; and an ounce of each of these articles furnishes one day’s
                    subsistence to a healthy full-grown man. Indeed, from Dr Percival’s experiments
                    it appears, that salep contains more nutritious matter, in proportion to its
                    bulk, than any other vegetable production now used as food. It has the property
                    also of concealing the nauseous taste of salt water; and consequently may be of
                    great advantage at sea, when the stock of fresh water is so far consumed that
                    the mariners are put upon short allowance. By the same mucilaginous quality, it
                    covers the offensiveness, and even in some measure corrects the acrimony, of
                    salted and putrescent meats. But, as a preservative against hunger, salep would
                    be most efficaciously combined with an equal weight of beef suet. By swallowing
                    little balls of this lubricating compound at proper intervals, the coats of the
                    stomach would be defended from irritation; and as oils and mucilages are highly
                    nutritive, of slow digestion, and indisposed to pass off by perspiration, they
                    arc peculiarly well adapted to support life in small quantities. This
                    composition is superior in simplicity, and perhaps equal in efficacy, to the
                    following one, so much extolled by Avicenna the celebrated Arabian physician, to
                    whom we are indebted for the introduction of rhubarb, cassia, tamarinds, and
                    senna, into the materia medica. “Take sweet almonds and beef suet, of each one
                    pound; of the oil of violets two ounces; and of the roots of marshmallows one
                    ounce; bray these ingredients together in a mortar, and form the mass into
                    boluses about the size of a common nut.” Animal fat is singularly powerful in
                    assuaging the most acute sensations of thirst, as appears from the narrative of
                    the sufferings experienced by those who w ere confined in the black hole at
                    Calcutta. A hundred and forty-six persons, exhausted by fatigue and military
                    duty, were there thrust together into a chamber of eighteen cubic feet, having
                    only two windows, strongly barred with iron, from which, in a close sultry
                    night, and in such a climate as that of Bengal, little or no circulation of
                    fresh air could be enjoyed. In a few minutes these unhappy wretches fell into
                    suctι a profuse perspiration, that an idea can hardly be formed of it; and this
                    again was succeeded by a raging thirst, which increased in proportion as the
                    body was drained of its moisture. Water, water, became the universal cry; and an
                    old soldier on the outside, through pity, furnished them with a few skinfuls of
                    it. But these scanty supplies, like sprinklings thrown on the fire, served only
                    to feed and increase the flame. From this experience of its effects, Mr Holwell,
                    their chief, determined to drink no more, and kept his mouth moist by sucking
                    the perspiration out of his shirt sleeves, and catching the drops as they fell
                    from his head and face. “You cannot imagine,” says he, “how unhappy I was if any
                    of them escaped me.” He came into the prison without his coat, the season being
                    too hot to bear it; and one of his miserable companions, observing the expedient
                    he had hit upon of allaying his thirst, robbed him from time to time of a
                    considerable part of his store. This plunderer, whom he found to be a young
                    gentleman in the service of the East India Company, afterwards acknowledged that
                    he owed his life to the many comfortable draughts which he derived from him.
                    Before Mr Holwell adopted this mode of relief, he had attempted, in an
                    ungovernable fit of thirst, to drink his own urine; but it was so intensely
                    bitter that a second taste could not be endured; whereas, he assures us, no
                    Bristol water could be more soft and pleasant than his perspiration. And this,
                    we may presume, consisted chiefly of animal fat, melted by excessive heat, and
                    exuding from the cellular membrane through the pores of the skin.</p>
                <p part="N">Persons who have been accustomed to animal food are soon reduced when
                    supplied only with the farinacea. Several years ago, to determine the
                    comparative nutritive powers of different substances, an ingenious young
                    physician, as Dr Percival informs us, made a variety of experiments on himself,
                    to which he unfortunately fell a sacrifice. He lived a month upon bread and
                    water; and under this regimen of diet he every day diminished much in his
                    weight.</p>
                <p part="N">In attempts to recover those who have suffered under the calamities of
                    famine, great circumspection is required. Warmth, cordials, and food, are the
                    means to be employed; and it is evident that these may prove too powerful in
                    their operation, if not administered with caution and judgment. For the body, by
                    long fasting, is reduced to a state of more than infantile debility; the minuter
                    vessels of the brain, and of the other organs, collapse for want of fluids to
                    distend them; the stomach and intestines shrink in their capacity; and the heart
                    languidly vibrates, having scarcely sufficient energy to propel the scanty
                    current of blood. Under such circumstances, a proper application of heat seems
                    an essential measure, and may be effected by placing on each side a healthy man
                    in contact with the patient. Pediluvia or fomentations may also be used with
                    advantage. The temperature of these should be lower than that of the human body,
                    and gradually increased according to the effects of their stimulus. New milk,
                    weak broth, or water gruel, ought to be employed both for the one and the other;
                    as nutriment may be conveyed into the system this way, by passages probably the
                    most pervious in a state of fasting, if not too long protracted. “A lad at

                    morning, and again at ten; and he was found to have gained near thirty ounces in
                    weight in the course of an hour, though he had only drank half a glass of wine
                    in the interval. The wine probably stimulated the action of the nervous system,
                    and incited nature, exhausted by abstinence, to open the absorbent <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193648624?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8624-0733"
                    />pores of the whole body, nι order to suck in some nourishment from the air.”
                    But no such absorption as this can be expected in a state of extreme weakness
                    and emaciation gradually induced, because the lymphatics must partake of the
                    general want of tone and energy. And notwithstanding the salutary effects of
                    wine in the case of the jockey, who, it is likely, had been reduced by sweating
                    as well as by abstinence, such a stimulant might prove dangerous, and even
                    fatal, in other cases. It appears safer to advise the exhibition of cordials in
                    very small doses, and at first considerably diluted. Slender wine whey will
                    perhaps best answer this purpose, and afford, at the same time, an easy and
                    pleasant nourishment. When the stomach has been a little strengthened, an egg
                    may be mixed with the whey, or administered under some other agreeable form. The
                    yolk of one was, to Cornaro, sufficient for a meal; and the narrative of this
                    noble Venetian, in whom a fever was excited by the addition of only two ounces
                    of food to his daily allowance, shows that the return to a full diet should be
                    conducted with great caution, and by very slow gradations.</p>
