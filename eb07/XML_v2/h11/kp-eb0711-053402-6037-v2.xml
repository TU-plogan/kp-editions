                    Denmark, one of those by which the king becomes a member of the Germanic
                    confederacy. It was an ancient duchy, and the termination of the ancient German
                    empire, from the year 811 till its dissolution. It is bounded on the north by
                    Sleswick, from which it is separated by the river Eider and the Sleswick Canal;
                    on the north-east and east by the Baltic Sea; on the south-east by the territory
                    of Lubeck and the duchy of Lauenburg; on the south by the Elbe and the state of
                    Hamburg; and on the west by the German Ocean. The province extends over 3260
                    square miles, and comprehends fourteen cities, twenty-two market-towns, 141
                    parishes, with 486 villages, and 374,750 inhabitants. The population are of the
                    Saxon race, and speak the common platt Deutch, but the educated portion of the
                    people speak the German language; their speech, as well as their manners and
                    customs, seem to have borrowed little from the Danes, though they have for many
                    centuries been a part of the same kingdom.</p>
                <p part="N">The soil is upon the whole fruitful; for though, in the centre of the
                    province, there is a long strip of poor sand, scarcely worth cultivation, yet on
                    both sides the land is highly productive. The western side, especially near the
                    shore, consists of some of the best meadow-land in Europe, on which are fattened
                    those fine oxen the meat of which is known by the name Hamburg beef, and much of
                    it is exported from that city, as well as from Altona. When, in the course of
                    husbandry, these lands are broken up, they produce abundant crops of oats, and
                    some very tolerable wheat. On the eastern side, upon the Baltic, is much
                    excellent arable land, and tolerably well managed, yielding the best of butter,
                    with some wheat and barley; but the principal corn grown is rye. It may be said
                    of Holstein, that it is the best agricultural district in the north of Germany.
                    The climate is, however, cold, raw, and changeable, which is injurious to its
                    rural husbandry.</p>
                <p part="N">The trade of the province is considerable. On every part of the coasts
                    of both seas the fisheries afford much occupation. The number of ships belonging
                    to the several ports of Altona, Kiel, Flensburg, and Gluckstadt, creates and
                    employs many most valuable seamen. The chief trade consists of the export of
                    corn, butter, cheese, bacon, cured fish, rape-seed, honey, and wax. The
                    Greenland fishery is carried on from Altona. The import trade chiefly arises
                    from the Danish colonies in the West Indies, the produce of which is brought to
                    Altona or Flensburg.</p>
                <p part="N">The manufactures are of small amount, excepting that of building and
                    equipping ships. There are some small establishments for making paper, cutlery,
                    copper articles, and common ironmongery. The shores of the Baltic present very
                    picturesque scenes, from the deep indentations of the εea (called <hi
                        rend="italic">fiorde)</hi> into the land, where they spread out and resemble
                    lakes, and are bordered by woods rising gradually to the tops of the hills. From
                    the eastern side of this country, in the district of Engeland, according to
                    tradition, Hengist and Horsa, two of the princes, sailed on their expedition to
                    our island.</p>
