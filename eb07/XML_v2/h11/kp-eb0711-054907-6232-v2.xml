                    the southern part of the North American continent, and province of Yucutan. It
                    is situated between the parallels of 17. and 19. north latitude, and 88. and 90.
                    west longitude, on a peninsula which forms the Bay oťCampeachy on the west and
                    the Bay of Honduras on the east. Its name is derived from the Spanish term
                    Hondura, which signifies depth, and was originally given to the coast by its
                    discoverers, on account of the great depth of water along the shore. According
                    to the best geographical authorities, the line which embraces this settlement
                    commences at the mouth of the Rio Grande, or Hondo, whose course it at first
                    follows, and afterwards runs parallel with it for thirty miles. It then turns
                    south, and passes through the New River Lake, in a straight line, to the river

                    southerly direction, it meets the head of the Libun, whose course it pursues to
                    the sea. The whole settlement embraces an area of 62,750 square miles.</p>
                <p part="N">This coast was discovered by Columbus in the year 1502, but little that
                    can be relied upon is known of its early settlement. The abundance and fine
                    quality of the· wood, particularly mahogany and logwood, seem first to have
                    drawn attention to it; and at a pretty early period it was occasionally resorted
                    to by wood-cutters. But the· first permanent establishment of British
                    wood-cutters was made at Cape Cartoche, by some adventurers from Jamaica, whose
                    numbers increasing, they extended as far south as the river Balize, and as far
                    west as the neigh <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646245?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-6245-0550"/>bourhood of Campeachy. The Spaniards, however,
                    did not quietly submit to this usurpation of their territorial dominion. Several
                    expeditions were fitted out against the settlers, but they were uniformly
                    unsuccessful; and on two occasions, in 1659 and 1678, so complete was their
                    discomfiture, that the town of Campeachy itself was taken b} the
                    logwood-cutters, with only the assistance of the seamen engaged in the trade.
                    This last repulse occurred eight years after a treaty had been concluded with
                    Spain, by which the territorial right of Britain to the occupancy of Honduras
                    was generally, although not specifically, embraced. The successes of the
                    settlers aroused the jealousy of the Spaniards, and led to a renewed discussion
                    of their right to the territory which they occupied. This would appear to have
                    been again generally admitted; but the Spaniards finally succeeded in driving
                    the woodmen from the Campeachy shore, and confining them to the limits which we
                    have already defined. An attempt was again made in 1718 to dispossess the
                    British of the territory on the river Balize; but the firmness of the
                    woodcutters detcrre.d the Castilians from effecting any thing, except the
                    erection of a fortification, which in a few years they abandoned. In 1754 an
                    expedition was undertaken to exterminate the colony; but by a treaty of peace
                    concluded in the year 1763, the Spaniards were compelled to admit the right of
                    occupancy to the British colonists, which, however, they subsequently attempted
                    to annul. In 1779 the Spaniards again attacked the settlement, and after
                    destroying property to a considerable amount, they took a number of the
                    colonists prisoners, and marched them off in irons to Merida, whence they were
                    shipped to the Havannah, and there confined till 1782. In 1784 Britain obtained
                    from Spain a specific grant of “the lands allotted for the cutting of logwood,”
                    by which Honduras became as much a territorial occupancy of the British crown,
                    as Jamaica or any other of our colonial possessions. The last attack on the
                    settlement was made during the war in 1798, but the expedition, which consisted
                    of 3000 men, was gallantly repulsed; and since that period the colony has
                    remained undisturbed by foreign aggression.</p>
                <p part="N">The coast of the Bay of Honduras is low, and the shore is studded with a
                    number of low islands or keys, which, however, are verdant. As we recede from
                    the coast, the land rises into a bold and lofty country, interspersed with
                    rivers and lagoons, and covered with gigantic forests. The inland frontier is
                    formed by an immense chain of mountains, which are also covered with
                    impenetrable forests and brushwood. Through this rocky barrier there is only one
                    pass, namely, that leading to Peten. It is merely a pathway, which might be
                    defended by a few men. The lagoons or sheets of water, and the falls and rapids
                    of the rivers, constitute sublime and beautiful features in the general aspect
                    of the country. The river and lagoon of Manatee, which is situated ten leagues
                    south of Balize, is considered as extremely grand. At about a mile from the
                    mouth of the river is the lagoon, a magnificent sheet of water, extending for
                    several leagues in a northerly direction. In many places immense mountains
                    ascend from its margin, overtopping large valleys and wood ranges of great
                    extent, where the tiger, antelope, armadillo, quash, opossum, racoon, and
                    several species of deer, abound. Amongst the feathered tribes there are numbers
                    of quails, plovers, pigeons, pheasants, and wild turkeys. The deficiency of
                    streams amongst the mountain ridges is supplied by the presence of large marshy
                    spots or shallow ponds, the banks of which are frequented by almost every
                    species of water game. Fish abound during a great part of the year in these
                    ponds, but the latter dry up i∏ the season of drought, and then vast flocks of
                    sea-fowl congregate around them to prey upon the fish which have been left dry
                    by the evaporation ι)f the waters. The alligator is also a frequent visitor;
                    and, to partake of this repast thus yearly provided for him, he has been known
                    to traverse trackless wilds, and make long journeys into the interior. Eight or
                    ten miles from the lakes the rapids begin, and the high rocky banks of the river
                    assume a romantic and beautiful appearance. Further on there is a cataract of
                    about a quarter of a mile in length, and of considerable acclivity. A cluster of
                    beautiful caves, through which the river winds its way, and beneath which the
                    traveller must pass, is next reached. They have been described as equally
                    singular and grand:—“These magnificent natural excavations of the mountains are
                    semicircular at the entrance, and about five yards in diameter. Within the cave
                    the arch rises to the height of a hundred feet, and leads to another low arch,
                    which, being passed, a second cavern of large size opens, beyond which is a
                    third with a circular orifice, through which the river enters. During the floods
                    the mouths of the caverns are filled with water, which boils up with prodigious
                    fury, and thus detains travellers many days before they can pass through the
                    caves or tunnels. In the rainy season, as the water inereases on the upper or
                    inland sides of the mountains, the river forces its passage through the
                    interstices and openings in its sides with tremendous noise, forming an
                    indescribably grand cascade of from forty to fifty feet high, issuing from an
                    hundred orifices.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">“There are also magnificent caves in the river Libun∙ eight or
                            ten days’ journey from Balize; and some interesting caverns exist in the
                            creeks or arms of the old river.”</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">The country is technically divided into the Pine and the Cahoun ridges.
                    The soil of the former has a substratum of loose reddish sand, and its
                    indigenous products consist of those varieties of vegetation the assimilative
                    powers of which are strong and perennial. Extensive prairies expand over this
                    soil, and the pine, from which it derives its name, is extremely abundant. The
                    soil of the Cahoun ridge consists of a deep loam, capable of growing every
                    species of European as well as of tropical aliment. Its fertility occasions the
                    growth of much brushwood, and it is covered with the wild cotton and other
                    gigantic trees.</p>
                <p part="N">Fruits, spontaneously produced, are exceedingly abundant, and consist of
                    oranges of excellent quality, shaddocks, limes, mangoes, melons, pine-apples,
                    water-melons, avocato pears, cashew, cocoa-nuts, and many others. They are all
                    found in the neighbourhood of Balize, but are sometimes brought in large
                    quantities from more elevated plantations. The mahogany and logwood trees are at
                    present the staples of Honduras. The former is found best in elevated
                    situations; and growing generally solitary, it is discernible at a great
                    distance, from the yellow hue of its foliage. It is cut down at about twelve
                    feet from the ground, and when felled, the logs arc dragged to the banks of the
                    streams and floated down in rafts. It is said that the boughs and limbs afford
                    the finest wood, but the size is principally looked to in Britain. The logwood
                    is found in low swampy grounds, growing contiguous to fresh water creeks and
                    lakes, on the edges of which the roots, the most valuable part of the wood,
                    ramify. They are felled during the dry season, and carried off when the wet
                    season has laid the ground under water. There is another valuable tree called
                    the <hi rend="italic">pinus occidentalis,</hi> which grows to the height of
                    sixty feet, and covers many thousand acres of country. It contains an immense
                    quantity of tar and turpentine, and might be turned to good account were the
                    vexatious duties on colonial timber removed. The pine- <pb break="no"

                    of course highly inflammable, and in this respect it is very valuable to the
                    poor, who make torches of it. It likewise powerfully resists decay, and is in
                    consequence much used by builders. The cahoun, or cohoon tree as it is
                    pronounced, is valuable on account of an oil which it yields. This unctuous
                    product, when unadulterated, is almost colourless, destitute of any disagreeable
                    taste, and when burned as a lamp oil it emits a beautiful palish flame without
                    smoke or smell. There are various other kinds of wood of beautiful vein and
                    close texture, such as ironwood, clay-wood, rosewood, palmaletta, and the like.
                    Amongst minerals, veins of fine marble and mountains of alabaster are known to
                    exist. Several valuable specimens of crystals have been found, and gold has at
                    various periods been detected; but no pains were ever taken to ascertain whence
                    it proceeded. Labouring Creek, which lies on the Balize, about one hundred miles
                    inland, is remarkable for the petrifying properties possessed by its waters.
                    They have also a powerful cathartic effect on strangers, and when applied
                    externally to an ulcer, have a healing property.</p>
                <p part="N">The country abounds with all kinds of animals fit for the food of man.
                    Except in very rough weather, the supply of salt-water fish of excellent quality
                    is abundant. The common green turtle, when in a healthy condition, is a staple
                    commodity in the market. It is often five feet long, and weighs from 200 to 250
                    lbs.</p>
                <p part="N">Balize, the capital of the settlement, is divided into two parts by the
                    river of the same name. The part of the town which is situated upon the south or
                    right bank of the river, along the eastern edge of a point of land, is
                    completely insulated by a canal on its western side, which runs across from a
                    small arm of the sea, and bounds the town on its south side. The houses are
                    about 500 in number, and are in general well built, spacious, and even elegant.
                    They are for the most part constructed of wood, and raised ten feet from the
                    ground. The two parts of the town are connected by a bridge, which was built in
                    1818. It is twenty feet in width, and its span is 220 feet. It is entirely
                    constructed of wood, and is well secured by balustrades on each side. The
                    streets of Balize are regular, running parallel north and south, and intersected
                    by others. The main one runs in a north-easterly direction to the bridge from
                    the government-house, which is situated on the south-east point or angle of the
                    island on the right bank of the river, and bounded on the south and east by the
                    sea. Behind the government-house is the church, on tlιe east side of the main
                    street. The whole town is embowered in groves and avenues of the cocoa-nut and
                    tamarind trees. Fort George is situated about half a mile from the river, on a
                    small low islet.</p>
                <p part="N">The climate in the neighbourhood of Balize is generally moist. July is
                    the hottest and dryest month of the year, and then the maximum heat is 83°, the
                    medium 82°, and the minimum 80° of Fahrenheit. The great heat, however, is
                    tempered by the sea breezes, which almost constantly prevail. During the wet
                    seasons the thermometer sinks to 60°, and the variation in the temperature is
                    sometimes very great. But the climate is by no means unhealthy; indeed it is
                    asserted in the Honduras Almanack that it is more favourable to European
                    constitutions than any other climate under the tropics. Where temperance and
                    regularity are observed, the average duration of human life will not be less in
                    Honduras than it is in this country.</p>
                <p part="N">There are various classes of society in this settlement, including
                    Europeans, coloured people, Indians, and Mosquito men. The blacks of Honduras
                    are distinct from the aborigines of the country, being of African descent. In
                    general they are inclined to indulge those low propensities which are exhibited
                    in a state of barbarism. A few of them, either from national usage or other
                    causes, show an utter aversion to spirituous liquors, but by far the greater
                    proportion are guilty of the most beastly excesses in this respect. Having been
                    derived from various regions, they still retain all their national
                    peculiarities; and, to keep themselves distinct from every other tribe, each
                    nation selects one individual, on whom the rest of his people bestow the title
                    of king, and who exercises over them a certain degree of authority. The blacks,
                    as a body, have upon the whole little intelligence, and their dulness of
                    comprehension is remarkable. It is asserted, however, in the Honduras Almanack,
                    the best authority on this point, that some of the blacks exhibit an originality
                    of talent and a degree of mental activity little inferior to their European
                    brethren. They are much attached to their country, and with a native of his own
                    land a Honduras black will share his last plantain. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >coloured</hi> population has resulted from the intercourse of Europeans
                    with Africans or Indians. They of course, morally speaking, assume a medium
                    status, and partake more or less of the qualities of black and white, according
                    to their distance from either. The <hi rend="italic">Mosquito</hi> shore men
                    abound in the colony. They are remarkable for a fine muscular formation of body,
                    but in their countenances they exhibit an utter destitution of intelligence, and
                    their habits are most barbarous. They acknowledge the existence of a good and
                    evil spirit; and the little power of thought which they possess is displayed in
                    their conduct towards their deities. The good spirit is neglected, because, say
                    they, his goodness is so great that nothing is to be feared from his wrath,
                    whilst, on the other hand, the evil spirit is propitiated, in order to deprecate
                    his malevolence. The whole wealth of a Mosquito man consists in his canoe,
                    paddle, and harpoon. With these he satisfies the cravings of nature, and his
                    grovelling nature asks for no more. The <hi rend="italic">Indians,</hi> the real
                    aborigines of the place, are a timid, inoffensive race, apparently more under
                    the influence of instinct than of reason. They perform the most astonishing
                    journeys through woods as trackless as the sea, and impervious to all but
                    themselves, with infallible correctness of direction and amazing rapidity.
                    Although free from vindictive or malicious propensities, they are addicted to
                    drunkenness to an excessive degree.</p>
                <p part="N">In religious matters Honduras forms part of the bishopric of Jamaica,
                    and facilities are afforded by the establishment for religious instruction.
                    There is a well-endowed school attached to it, conducted on the Madras system,
                    and the average daily attendance of children is above a hundred. There are
                    likewise two mission schools, and considerable benefit has already been reaped
                    from these institutions. Not one of the least is the change of sentiment which
                    has taken place with regard to marriage. Only a few years back this ceremony was
                    little regarded, and virtue and decency were absolutely despised. A better
                    feeling, however, is now beginning to prevail, of which the legislature has
                    taken advantage; and, for the encouragement of public morals, great facilities
                    to the marriages of the lower orders of blacks have been afforded by recent laws
                    and regulations. Petty larceny, and misdemeanours resulting from intemperance,
                    frequently occur; but atrocious crimes are happily seldom perpetrated. In the
                    mechanical arts the blacks display little or no ingenuity, but the coloured
                    people, approaching nearer to the European standard of mind, are considerably
                    above the negroes in this respect. In architectural designs, however, and other
                    arts by which domestic comforts are enhanced, the whites alone are to be

                    stoecadoed huts of the most primitive construction, but now there are many

                    are made; and these become laws to be enforced by the executive part of the

                    magistrates are in number seven, and annually elected by the inhabitants. In
                    them the power is vested, and they conduct the whole public business of the
                    colony, without receiving any remuneration for their services. The

                    aides-de-camp and staff. The following table exhibits the revenue and

                <p part="N">It will be perceived that the revenue of this colony has very materially
                    increased, and it would still increase were the interest of this settlement more
                    attended to at home. Its resources are very great, and were emigration properly
                    encouraged, it would soon become of vast importance both in a political and in a
                    commercial point of view, more especially as there are still uncultivated many
                    thousand square miles of the richest soil. Trade is yet in its infancy, but the
                    value of the imports in 1830 was L.234,379, and of the exports L.316,151,
                    employing a shipping inwards of 13,918 tons, and outwards of 16,351 tons,
                    independently of a large coasting trade, which is on the increase. The following
