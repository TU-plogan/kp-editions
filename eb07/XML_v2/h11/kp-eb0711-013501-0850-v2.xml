                    voyage of discovery along the western coast of Africa, but at what period it was
                    made is not known with any degree of certainty. The different writers who have
                    examined the point have fixed him at various periods between 1000 and 300 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>; but we are inclined to agree with Rennell, who
                    thinks he must have lived about 570 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> The
                    principal object of this expedition is set forth in the journal, which begins
                    with these words :—“It was decreed by the Carthaginians that Hanno should
                    undertake a voyage beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and found Libyphoenician
                    cities. He accordingly sailed with sixty ships, of fifty oars each, and a body
                    of men and women to the number of thirty thousand, and provisions and other
                    necessaries.” It is much to be regretted that this curious remnant of antiquity
                    should have been exceedingly brief, and that it should not have come down to ns
                    in its original form, for it is evidently a mere abstract of a larger work. Some
                    indeed have endeavoured to strip it of all pretensions to credit, and to rank it
                    with the Arabian tales; but though some of the stories may have the appearance
                    of fable, such as <hi rend="italic">fiery torrents,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >women covered with hair,</hi> the facts which are susceptible of
                    verification, either by the test of geography, or a comparison with the
                    descriptions of travellers, are of too consistent a nature to allow us to doubt
                    that the voyage was really undertaken. It would appear that the first city was
                    founded at no great distance from the Strait of Gibraltar, the rest to the north
                    of Cape Bojador. This voyage extended a little to the south of Sierra Leone; but
                    we must refer the reader to the writers who have examined the subject, for a
                    detailed account of his geographical statements. The title of the Periplus is
                    “An Account of the Voyage of Hanno, commander of the Carthaginians, round the
                    parts of Libya beyond the Pillars of Hercules, which he deposited in the Temple
                    of Saturn.” It has been published by Hudson <hi rend="italic">{Geogr. Min.</hi>
                    vol. i.), and Falconer (Oxford, 1797), with an English translation and
                    explanations; also by Kluge, <hi rend="italic">Hannonis Navigatio, textum
                        critice recogn. et adnotat. illustravit,</hi> Leip. 1829. The following
                    authors have also published commentaries on the voyage, viz. Bochart,
                    Campomanes, Dodwell, Bougainville, Gosselin, Heeren, and Rennell.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Hanno,</hi> a senator of Carthage, who headed the
                    party Opposed to the warlike policy of the Barcine faction. He was first
                    appointed to the command of the troops in the interior of Africa, and was
                    successful in reducing Hecatompylos, with the adjoining country. W’hen the
                    mercenary troops which had been employed in the first Punic war became clamorous
                    for their arrears of pay, and at last ventured to make open war on Carthage,
                    Hanno was appointed to the command of the forces to be employed against them.
                    His talents, however, seem to have been by no means fitted for the field, and
                    affairs assumed such a threatening aspect under his mismanagement, that the
                    Carthaginians began to be alarmed for the very existence of their state. They
                    therefore appointed as his colleague Hamilcar Barcas; but the enmity which
                    existed between the generals completely neutralised the good that might have
                    been derived from their abilities. At last, however, the dangerous position of
                    affairs compelled them to forget their differences, and to unite cordially in
                    resisting their common enemy. (Polyb. i. 73-88.)</p>
                <p part="N">He continued during his whole life to be the advocate of peace, in
                    opposition to the ambitious policy of Hannibal; and when that general sent his
                    brother Mago, after the battle of Cannae, to obtain reinforcements, Hanno
                    exerted all his influence to prevent this request being granted, and even
                    proposed that Hannibal should be given up to the Romans. (Liv. xxi. 3, 9; xxiii.
                    13.)</p>
