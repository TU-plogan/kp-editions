                    Portuguese ecclesiastic, was descended of a noble family, and born at Lisbon in
                    the year 1500. He was educated at the University of Salamanca, and afterwards
                    studied at Paris and Bologna. On his return to Portugal he gradually rose till
                    he obtained the bishopric of Sylves, to which he was appointed by Catharine of
                    Austria, regent of the kingdom in the minority of Dom Sebastian. At the request
                    of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, he wrote his history of King Emanuel, and the
                    expedition of Gama, which his great contemporary Camoens made the subject of his
                    Lusiad. It is remarkable that the history of Osorius and the epic poem of
                    Camoens were published in the same year, 1572. But the fate of these two great
                    authors was very different. The poet was suffered to perish in poverty, under
                    the reign of that same Henry who patronised the historian; yet, allowing for the
                    difference of their professions, they possessed a certain similarity of mind.
                    Even in the priest Osorius there appear many traces of that high and heroic
                    spirit which animated the soldier Camoens, particularly in the pleasure with
                    which he seems to describe the martial manners of his countrymen under the reign
                    of Emanuel. “In that age,” says he, “poverty and sadness were banished from
                    Portugal. Complaints were never heard; but every place, from the court to the
                    cottage, resounded with mirth and music. Illicit love was unknown; nor would the
                    ladies listen to the most honourable addresses of such youths as had not
                    signalized themselves in war. No young man about court, however noble by birth,
                    was permitted to wear the dress of manhood till he had passed over into Africa,
                    and thence brought back with him some animal esteemed for its rarity; and such
                    was the hardy education of the nobility in that age, that many of them travelled
                    everywhere in quest of adventures.” This is a striking picture of the manners of
                    chivalry, to which Portugal owed much of its glory in that splendid period.
                    There is one particular in the character of Osorius, which, considering his age
                    and country, deserves the highest encomium; and that is his tolerant spirit. In
                    the first book of his history he speaks of Emanuel’s cruel persecution of the
                    Jews in the following ge-. nerous and exalted language: “This,” says he, “was
                    authorized neither by law nor by religion. Can men be compelled to believe what
                    they reject with abhorrence? Do you take upon you to restrain the liberty of the
                    will, or to fetter the understanding? Such an attempt must be unsuccessful; and
                    is not acceptable to Christ, who expects from man devotion of the heart, and not
                    that formal worship which is the offspring of pains and penalties. He wishes
                    them to study his religion, and accept it from conviction, not from terror; for
                    who does not see that forced belief is mere hypocrisy ?” Osorius is said to have
                    used many arguments to dissuade Dorn Sebastian from undertaking his unfortunate
                    expedition into Africa, and to have felt so deeply the miseries which befell the
                    Portuguese after that fatal event, that his grief was supposed to have
                    accelerated his death. He died in the year 1580, happy, says De Thou, who
                    celebrates him as a model of Christian virtue, that he died just before the
                    Spanish army entered Portugal, and thus escaped being a witness to the
                    desolation of his country. His various works were published at Rome in 1592, by
                    his nephew Osorius, in four volumes folio, with a life of their author. Amongst
                    these there are two remarkable productions; the first, an Admonition to Queen
                    Elizabeth, exhorting her to return into the bosom of the Church of Rome; and the
                    second, an Essay on Glory, written with such classical purity, as to give birth
                    to a report that it was not the composition of Osorius, but the last work of
                    Cicero on that subject.</p>
