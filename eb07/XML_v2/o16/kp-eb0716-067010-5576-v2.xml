                <p part="N"><label type="entry">OTWAY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, an
                    eminent tragic poet, was the son of Mr Humphrey Otway, rector of Woolbeding, in
                    Sussex, and was born at Trottin, in that county, on the 3d of March 1651. He
                    received the rudiments of his education at Winchester school, and in 1669 was
                    entered a commoner of Christ-Church; but, from whatever cause, he left the
                    university without a degree, and proceeded to London, where he commenced player.
                    In 1672, he made his first appearance on the stage in the character of the king
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Forced Marriage,</hi> though with indifferent success,
                    and soon found that he was not likely to gain much reputation as an actor. This
                    inability to shine on the stage Otway shared with Shakspeare and Jonson, as he
                    likewise shared some of their excellencies. It seems reasonable to expect,
                    indeed, that a great dramatic poet should without difficulty become a great
                    actor; that he who can feel might also express; that the man who can excite
                    passion should be able to exhibit readily its external modes and indications.
                    But experience has fully proved that, whatever be the affinity of these powers,
                    one of them may be possessed in a great degree by a person who has very little
                    of the other; and that they either depend on different faculties, or a different
                    use of the same faculty. The actor must possess a pliancy of mien, a flexibility
                    of countenance, and a variety of intonation, in which the poet may easily be
                    supposed deficient; or the attention of each may have been differently employed,
                    the poet considering thought and the player action, the one watching the heart
                    and the other contemplating the expression of the countenance.</p>
                <p part="N">Otway, however, though sensible of his inability to attract notice as an
                    actor, felt conscious of possessing powers which qualified him for becoming a
                    dramatic author; and, under this impression, his very first attempt was made in
                    the highest department of the art. His tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Alcibiades</hi> was acted at the Theatre Royal in 1675, though with what
                    measure of success we are not informed. The story is taken from Nepos and
                    Plutarch; but in certain points he departs from history in order to accommodate
                    the character<pb break="no" facs="nls:194565589?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0716-5589-0671"/> of his hero to the effect which he wished to
                    produce. <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos,</hi> another tragedy in heroic verse,
                    founded on St Real’s novel of the same name, and the Spanish chronicles of the
                    life of Philip 1I., was performed in 1676, and appears to have succeeded much
                    better than any other of his plays. For many years indeed it was more applauded
                    and followed than either <hi rend="italic">Venice Preserved</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">The Orphan;</hi> and it is even asserted that it was played
                    for thirty nights together, though this may reasonably be doubted. At any rate,
                    it was very successful, and brought more money than any preceding tragedy.<note

                    taken from Molière; which were acted together with considerable success, the
                    custom of annexing farces to plays having about that time been introduced. His
                    comedy of <hi rend="italic">Friendship in Fashion,</hi> which appeared in 1678,
                    had also some success, though it seems doubtful whether the author was at this
                    time in London, as he certainly went abroad during the year 1677.</p>
                <p part="N">The occasion of his going abroad will be immediately explained. Johnson,
                    however, in introducing this circumstance, observes: “Want of morals, or of
                    decency, did not in those days exclude any man from the company of the wealthy
                    and the gay, if he brought with him any powers of entertainment; and Otway is
                    said to have been at this time a favourite companion of the dissolute wits. But
                    as he who desires no virtue in his companion has no virtue in himself, those
                    whom Otway frequented had no purpose of doing more for him than to pay his
                    reckoning. They desired only to drink and laugh; their fondness was without
                    benevolence, and their familiarity without friendship.” Men of wit received at
                    that time no favour from tlιe great except that of sharing their riots, from
                    which they were dismissed again to their own narrow circumstances; and thus they
                    languished in poverty without support, and often without resource. But some
                    exception must, nevertheless, be made. The Earl of Plymouth, a natural son of
                    the king, procured Otway a cornet’s commission in some troops which were then,
                    1677, destined for Flanders. But the poet did not prosper in his military
                    capacity. The society of dissolute wits had but ill qualified him for submitting
                    to the restraints of discipline, or observing that regularity which the laws of
                    the service required; and hence, having left his commission behind him, he
                    returned to London, where he resumed his dramatic labours.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1680, he produced <hi rend="italic">Cuius Marius,</hi> a tragedy,
                    which had some success, probably from the circumstance of the author having
                    availed himself of the excitement that then prevailed about the Popish Plot;
                    and, in the dissensions of Marius and Sylla, endeavoured to shadow forth the
                    proceedings of the factions in the reign of Charles I. But a higher degree of
                    fame awaited him from his next tragedy, <hi rend="italic">The Orphan,</hi> which
                    appeared the same year. This, as Johnson observes, is one of the few pieces
                    which have kept possession of the stage, and pleased through all the
                    vicissitudes of dramatic taste and fashion. It is a domestic tragedy, drawn from
                    middle life, and its whole power is upon the affections. <hi rend="italic">The
                        Soldier’s Fortune,</hi> and its second part, <hi rend="italic">The
                        Atheist,</hi> produced respectively in 1681 and 1684, were both successful,
                    being far better suited to the manners of that age than to those of the present.
                    The incidents and characters may, for the most part, be traced to other plays,
                    and neither is in any respect worthy of the genius which, in 1682, gave to
                    dramatic literature <hi rend="italic">Venice Preserved,</hi> a tragedy, the fame
                    of which, like that of <hi rend="italic">The Orphan,</hi> is secure against all
                    the caprices of taste and fashion, whilst it displays still higher powers of
                    poetry and of expression. The striking passages are familiar to all, and its
                    faults as well as its excellencies seem to have been rightly appreciated by the
                    public. It is, in fact, the production of a man not very attentive to decency,
                    nor over zealous for virtue, but of one who conceived forcibly, and drew
                    originally by consulting nature in his own breast. Besides the plays already
                    mentioned, he wrote the miscellaneous poems inserted in Johnson’s series of the
                    poets; and he translated from the French a History of the Triumvirate.</p>
                <p part="N">But Otway's career was destined to be a short one. He died before
                    completing his thirty-fourth year, on the 14th of April 1685, in a manner which
                    has been variously represented; but, according to every account, in
                    circumstances of the deepest distress. “Having,” says Johnson, “been compelled
                    by his necessities to contract debts, and hunted, as is supposed, by the
                    terriers of the law, he retired to a public-house on Tower Hill, where he is
                    said to have died of want; or, as is related by one of his biographers, by
                    swallowing, after a long fast, a piece of bread which charity had supplied. He
                    went out, as is reported, almost naked, in the rage of hunger, and finding a
                    gentleman in a neighbouring coffee-house, asked him for a shilling. The
                    gentleman gave him a guinea, and Otway going away bought a roll, and was choked
                    with the first mouthful. All this, I hope,” adds Johnson, “is not true; and
                    there is this ground of better hope, that Pope, who lived near enough to be well
                    informed, relates, in Spence’s Memorials, that he died of fever caught by
                    violent pursuit of a <hi rend="italic">thief</hi> who had <hi rend="italic"
                        >robbed</hi> one of his friends. But that indigence, and its concomitants,
                    sorrow and despondency, pressed hard upon him, has never been denied, whatever
                    immediate cause might bring him to the grave.” Pope’s account of Otway’s death
                    was first related by Warton in the notes to his Essay on that poet; and it
                    differs in several particulars from the version of it given by Johnson. It would
                    appear that an intimate friend of Otway’s having been <hi rend="italic"
                        >murdered</hi> in the street, the poet pursued the murderer on foot as far
                    as Dover, where he was seized with a fever, occasioned by the fatigue, which
                    afterwards carried him to his grave in London. By this account the robber is a
                    murderer; and as Warton was more correct in stating facts than Johnson, it is
                    probable that he relates the story exactly as he heard it. But it may
                    nevertheless be traced to Spence, who, it seems, was informed by Dennis, the
                    critic, that Otway had a friend, named Blakiston, who was shot in the street;
                    that the murderer having fled towards Dover, Otway pursued him; and that, on his
                    return, having drunk water when violently heated, he caught the fever which
                    caused his death. Dennis, however, in the preface to his Observations on Pope’s
                    Translation of Homer, 1717, 8vo, says merely that Otway died in an alehouse; a
                    statement which is not inconsistent with the preceding account, as, in point of
                    fact, he generally lived in one. As to the story of the guinea and the loaf, it
                    rests upon no sufficient authority, and may probably have been introduced to
                    heighten the picture of the poet’s distress, about which, unfortunately, there
                    can be no doubt whatever. Some, however, are inclined to think that both
                    accounts might be true. But this cannot be, for the supposition of Otway having
                    died of fever, occasioned by fatigue, or by drinking cold water when violently
                    heated, is <pb break="no" facs="nls:194565602?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0716-5602-0672"/> altogether inconsistent with the story of his
                    running half naked into the street in the rage of hunger, and being choked with
                    the first mouthful of the bread purchased with the money that had been
                    charitably given him. No one ever heard or knew of a patient in high fever being
                    seized with raging hunger, and greedily devouring the first morsel of bread he
                    could procure. The idea is altogether absurd.</p>
                <p part="N">When Otway first began to rise in reputation, Dryden spoke slightingly
                    of his performances; but afterwards, when <hi rend="italic">The Orphan</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Venice Preserved</hi> had established his fame, fully
                    acknowledged their merits. “To express the .passions which are seated in the
                    heart by outward signs,” says he in his preface to Dufresnoy, “is one great
                    precept of the painters, and very difficult to perform. In poetry the very same
                    passions and motions of the mind are to be .expressed; and in this consists the
                    principal difficulty, as well as the excellency, of that art. This, says
                    Dufresnoy, is the gift of Jupiter; and, to speak in the same heathen language,
                    we call it the gift of our Apollo, not to be obtained by pains or study, if we
                    are not born to it. For the motions which are studied are never so natural as
                    those which break out in the height of a real passion. Mr Otway possessed this
                    part as thoroughly as any of the ancients or moderns. I will not defend every
                    thing in his <hi rend="italic">Venice Preserved</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    I must bear this testimony to his memory, that the passions are truly touched in
                    it, though perhaps there is somewhat to be desired both in the grounds of them,
                    and in the height and elegancy of the expression. But <hi rend="italic">nature
                        is there,</hi> which is the greatest beauty.” This is high, and, at the same
                    time, discriminating praise. Otway’s power consisted in moving the passions and
                    touching the heart. All the fountains of feeling were at his command, and he
                    could throw them open at his pleasure. His mastery over the emotions as well as
                    the passions of the soul was unrivalled. But he had not much cultivated
                    versification, nor replenished his mind with general knowledge; and hence his
                    numbers are sometimes harsh, and his allusions neither rich, varied, nor
                    striking. “Nature,” however, “is there,” and her presence atones for every
                    deficiency.</p>
                <p part="N">It appears that Otway, when he died, had about him the copy of a tragedy
                    which he had sold for a trifle to Bentley the bookseller. An advertisement which
                    appeared in L’Estrange’s <hi rend="italic">Observator</hi> for the 27th November
                    and the 4th December 1686, in which a reward is offered to any person who “can
                    give notice in whose hands the copy lies,” leaves no doubt whatever of the fact.
                    The play in question, however, seems to have been irrecoverably lost; for the
                    tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">Heroic Friendship,</hi> which was printed in
                    1719, and attributed to Otway, is evidently no production of bis. It never was
                    acted, nor deserved to be acted. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi
