                    eminent and learned dissenting minister, was born in 1616, at Hadham, in
                    Oxfordshire, of which place his father was vicar. He made such surprising
                    proficiency in learning, that at twelve years of age he was admitted into
                    Queen’s College, Oxford; and in 1635 he was made master of arts. Having
                    disapproved of the new regulations introduced by Archbishop Laud, the
                    chancellor, he refused to comply with them, and in 1637 was obliged to leave the
                    university. When he took orders he became chaplain to Sir Robert Dormer of
                    Ascot, in Oxfordshire, and was at the same time tutor to his eldest son. He was
                    afterwards chaplain to John Lord Lovelace of Hurley, in Berkshire. When the
                    civil war broke out, he openly espoused the eause of the parliament; which was
                    so resented by an unele who had intended to leave him his estate, that he
                    discarded him, and left it to another. Yet though Lord Lovelace joined the king,
                    he treated his chaplain with great civility; but on his taking the field with
                    the royal army, Mr Owen went to London, and soon afterwards joined the
                    nonconformists. In the year 1642 he published his book entitled a Display of
                    Arminianism, which laid the foundation of his future advancement. The committee
                    for purging the church of scandalous ministers were so pleased with this work,
                    that Mr White, their chairman, sent him a presentation to the living of Fordham
                    in Essex; but after he had been there about a year and a half, the patron,
                    hearing that the sequestered incumbent was dead, presented another to the
                    living, upon whieh the Earl of Warwick gave Mr Owen the living of Coggeshal. He
                    had not, however, been long at that town before he left the Presbyterians, and,
                    joining the Independents, formed a church there. He was sent for several times
                    to preach before the parliament, particularly on the 28th of February 1648-49,
                    the day' of humiliation for the intended expedition to Ireland. Cromwell, who
                    was present at this last discourse, and had never heard him before, was so
                    extremely pleased with it that he desired the preacher to accompany him into
                    Ireland, at the same time offering to provide him with a residence in the
                    College of Dublin. Mr Owen accepted the offer, but returned in about half a
                    year. Soon afterwards Cromwell sent him into Scotland, <pb break="no"

                    returned from thence after about half a year’s residence at Edinburgh. He was
                    then promoted to the deanery of Christ-Church, Oxford, whither he went in 1651;
                    and Cromwell, being now chancellor of the university, nominated him his
                    vice-chancellor. The next year he was created doctor of divinity by diploma. Dr
                    Owen held the post of vice-chancellor five years, during which he behaved with
                    the greatest moderation; for, although often solicited, he never molested the
                    meeting of the royalists at the house of Dr Willis the physician, where divine
                    service was performed according to the liturgy of the Church of England; and
                    though he was a commissioner for ejecting scandalous ministers, he frequently
                    overruled his brethren in favour of those royalists who were distinguished by
                    their merit. At the death of Cromwell he was removed from the
                    vice-chancellorship; and at the Restoration he was ejected from his deanery of
                    Christ-Church. But he had provided himself a comfortable retreat at an estate he
                    had purchased at Hadham. He now employed himself in preaching as often as he had
                    an opportunity, and in writing books; one of which, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Fiat Lux,</hi> falling into the hands of Lord Clarendon, he was so pleased
                    with it, or from policy pretended to be so, that he sent for Dr Owen, and
                    acknowledging the service he had done by it to the Protestant religion, offered
                    to prefer him in the church if he would conform; but he respectfully desired to
                    be excused. His moderation secured him respect from persons of opposite
                    principles; and in the number of his friends were Dr Wilkins, bishop of Chester,
                    and Dr Barlow, bishop of London. He died at Ealing in 1683. His works are
                    printed in seven volumes folio.</p>
