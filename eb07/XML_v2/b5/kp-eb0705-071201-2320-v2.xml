                    In almost all countries the rites of sepulture have been looked upon as a debt
                    so sacred, that those who neglected to discharge it were thought infamous. Hence
                    the Romans called themyWα, and the Greeks <hi rend="italic">νόμιμα, δίκαια,
                        οΰια,</hi> words implying the inviolable obligation which nature has laid
                    upon the living to perform the obsequies of the dead. Nor need we wonder that
                    the ancient Greeks and Romans were extremely solicitous about the interment of
                    their deceased friends, seeing they were strongly persuaded that their souls
                    could not be admitted into the Elysian fields till their bodies had been
                    committed to the earth; and if it happened that they never obtained the rites of
                    burial, they were excluded from the happy mansions for the term of a hundred
                    years. For this reason it was considered as a duty incumbent upon all travellers
                    who happened to meet with a dead body in their way, to cast dust or mould upon
                    it three times; and of these, one portion at least was cast upon the head. The
                    ancients likewise considered it as a great misfortune if they were not laid in
                    the sepulchres of their fathers; for which reason the ashes of those who died in
                    foreign countries were usually brought home and interred with those of their
                    ancestors. But notwithstanding the great care in the burials of the dead, there
                    were some persons whom they thought unworthy of the last office, and to whom
                    therefore they refused it; namely, public or private enemies; such as betrayed
                    or conspired against their country; tyrants, who were always looked upon as
                    enemies to their country; villains guilty of sacrilege; such as died in debt,
                    whose bodies belonged to their creditors; and offenders who had suffered capital
                    punishment.</p>
                <p part="N">Of those who were allowed the rites of burial, some were distinguished
                    by particular circumstances of disgrace attending their interment. Thus persons
                    killed by lightning were buried apart by themselves, being thought odious to the
                    gods; those who wasted their patrimony forfeited the right of being buried in
                    the sepulchres of their fathers; and those who were guilty of self-murder were
                    privately deposited in the ground, without the accustomed solemnities. Among the
                    Jews the privilege of burial was denied only to self-murderers, who were thrown
                    out to rot upon the ground. In the Christian church, though good men always
                    desired the privilege of interment, yet they were not, like the heathens, so
                    concerned for their bodies as to think it any detriment to them if either the
                    barbarity of an enemy or some other accident deprived them of this privilege.
                    The primitive Christian church denied the more solemn rites of burial only to
                    the unbaptized, to self-murderers, and to excommunicated persons who continued
                    obstinate and impenitent in contempt of the censures of the church.</p>
                <p part="N">The place of burial among the Jews was never particularly determined.
                    1hey had graves in the town and country, upon the highways, in gardens, and upon
                    mountains. Among the Greeks the temples were made repositories for the dead in
                    the primitive ages; yet the general custom in later ages with them, as well as
                    with the Romans and other heathen nations, was to bury their dead without their
                    cities, and chiefly by the highways. Among the primitive Christians burying in
                    cities was not allowed for the first three centuries, nor in churches for many
                    ages after. Dead bodies were first deposited in the atrium or church-yard, and
                    in the porches and porticoes of the church; and hereditary burying-places were
                    forbidden till the twelfth century. »</p>
