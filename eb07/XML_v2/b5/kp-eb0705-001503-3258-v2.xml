                        <hi rend="italic">Borow,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Burgh,</hi> is a term
                    frequently used for a town or corporation which is not a city.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Borough,</hi> in the original Saxon <hi
                        rend="italic">borge</hi> or <hi rend="italic">borgh,</hi> is by some
                    supposed to have primarily meant a tithing or company consisting of ten
                    families, who were bound and combined together as sureties for one another.
                    Afterwards, as Verstegan informs us, borough came to signify a town that had
                    something of a wall or inclosure about it; so that all places which amongst our
                    ancestors had the denomination of borough, were one way or other fenced or
                    fortified, being, as it were, σugχo∕. But in latter times this appellation was
                    also bestowed on several of the <hi rend="italic">villce insigniores,</hi> or
                    country towns of more than ordinary note, though not walled.</p>
                <p part="N">The ancient Saxons, according to Spelman, gave the name of burghs to
                    what in other countries were called cities. But different canons being made for
                    removing the episcopal sees from villages and small towns to the chief cities,
                    the term <hi rend="italic">city</hi> came to be attributed to episcopal towns,
                    whilst that of borough included all the rest, even although they had the
                    appearance of cities, as being governed by mayors, having bye-laws of their own
                    making, sending representatives to parliament, and being fortified with a wall
                    and castle, and the like.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Royal</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Boroughs</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Burghs,</hi> in Scotland, are corporations originally
                    created for the advantage of trade, in virtue of charters granted by several of
                    their kings, and having the privilege of sending commissioners to represent them
                    in parliament, besides other peculiar privileges. The royal burghs are not only
                    so many distinct corporations, but also constitute one entire body, governed by,
                    and accountable to, a general court, anciently called <hi rend="italic">the
                        court of four boroughs,</hi> which was held yearly, to treat and determine
                    concerning matters relating to the common interest. The four burghs which
                    composed this court were, Edinburgh, Stirling, Roxburgh, and Berwick; but the
                    two last falling into the hands of the English, Linlithgow and Lanark were
                    substituted in their room, with a saving to the former whenever they should
                    return to their allegiance. But this court not being sufficient to answer the
                    necessities of the royal burghs, they were all empowered under James III., in
                    1487, to send commissioners to a yearly convention' of their own, which was then
                    appointed to be held at Inverkeithing, but is now held at Edinburgh, under the
                    denomination of the Convention of Royal Burghs, which was vested with great
                    powers, and had for its object the benefit of trade, and the interest of the
                    burghs generally.</p>
