                <p part="N"><label type="entry">DEVOTION</label><hi rend="italic">(JDevotio),</hi> a
                    sincere and ardent worship of the Deity.</p>
                <p part="N">Devotion, as defined by Jurieu, is a softening and yielding of the
                    heart, with an internal consolation, which the souls of believers feel in the
                    practice or exercise of piety. By devotion is also understood certain religious
                    practices which a person makes it a rule to discharge regularly; and with
                    reason, if the exactitude be founded on solid piety; otherwise it is vanity or
                    superstition. That devotion is vain and trifling which would accommodate itself
                    both to God and to the world.</p>
                <p part="N">The character of devotion has frequently suffered from the forbidding
                    air which has been thrown over it, by the narrowness of bigotry on the one hand,
                    or the gloom of superstition on the other. When free, cheerful, and generous
                    minds have not had occasion to see it accompanied with those feelings of delight
                    and benevolence which naturally attend it, they are apt to be prejudiced against
                    piety at large, by mistaking this ungracious appearance for its genuine form.
                    Nor has the rant of vulgar enthusiasts contributed little to beget and
                    strengthen the same aversion in persons of a cool and speculative temper, who
                    have happened to meet among religionists of a certain strain with such images
                    and phrases as ill suit the rational, pure, and spiritual nature of true
                    devotion. It may likewise be remarked, on the other hand, that people of taste
                    and sensibility have not unfrequently been disgusted with the insipid style too
                    often employed on such subjects, by those who possess neither, or who purposely
                    avoid every thing of the kind, from an aim at simplicity misunderstood, or
                    perhaps from a fear of being thought too zealous in an age of fashionable
                    indifference and false refinement.</p>
                <p part="N">Wherever the vital and unadulterated spirit of Christian devotion
                    prevails, its immediate object will be to please him whom we were made to
                    please, by adoring his perfections; by admiring his works and ways; by
                    entertaining with reverence and complacence the various intimations of his
                    pleasure, especially those contained in holy writ; by acknowledging, our
                    absolute dependence and infinite obligations; by confessing and lamenting the
                    disorders of our nature and the transgressions of our lives; by imploring his
                    grace and mercy through Jesus Christ; by interceding for our brethren of
                    mankind; by praying for the propagation and embellishment of truth,
                    righteousness, and peace on earth; in fine, by longing for a more entire
                    conformity to the will of God, and breathing after the everlasting enjoyment of
                    his favour. The effects of such a spirit habitually cherished, and feelingly
                    expressed before him, with conceptions more or less enlarged and elevated, in
                    language more or less emphatical and accurate sententious or diffuse, must
                    surely be important and happy. Amongst these effects may be reckoned, a profound
                    humility in the sight of God, a high veneration for his presence and attributes,
                    an ardent zeal for his worship and honour, an affectionate faith in the Saviour
                    of the world, a constant imitation of his divine example, a diffusive charity
                    for men of all denominations, a generous and unwearied self-denial for the sake
                    of virtue and society, a total resignation to Providence, an increasing esteem
                    for the gospel, with clearer and firmer hopes of that immortal life which it
                    alone has brought clearly to light.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Devotion,</hi> among the Romans, was a kind of
                    sacrifice or ceremony, by which they consecrated themselves to the service of
                    some person. The ancients had a notion that the life of one might be ransomed by
                    the death of another; and hence such devotions became frequent for the lives of
                    the emperors. Devotion to any particular person was unknown among the Romans
                    till the time of Augustus. The very day after the title of Augustus had been
                    conferred upon Octavius. Pacuvius, a tribune of the people, publicly declared
                    that he would devote himself to Augustus, and obey him at the expense of his
                    life, as was the practice among barbarous nations, if he were commanded. His
                    example was immediately followed by all the rest, till at length it became an
                    established custom never to go to salute the emperor without declaring that they
                    were devoted to him. Before this the practice of the Romans was that of devoting
                    themselves to their country.</p>
