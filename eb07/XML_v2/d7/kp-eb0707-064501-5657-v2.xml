                    communication, and to employ peculiar methods and artifices in imparting
                    knowledge. The invention and employment of means calculated to attain these
                    purposes constitutes a particular art, having for its object the instruction of
                    the deaf and dumb; an art which, though it has not hitherto been dignified by
                    any specific appellation, is so highly interesting in a moral as well as
                    philosophical point of view, that we conceive it incumbent upon us to present
                    our readers with some account of the principles on which it is founded, and of
                    the methods which experience has shown to be the most successful.</p>
                <p part="N">The proportion of children born deaf, and who must as a necessary
                    consequence remain mute, was formerly supposed to be much smaller than it really
                    is; as appears from the great number of cases which have presented themselves to
                    notice, since the formation of various establishments for the express purpose of
                    their instruction. The celebrity which the Abbé de l’Epée acquired at Paris for
                    his success in this art drew forth into view a multitude of persons of this
                    description, much greater than had ever before beer suspected to exist. It was
                    discovered that about two hundred deaf and dumb persons were living in Paris
                    alone; a number which, calculating from the proportional population, would give
                    above three thousand for the whole of France before the revolution. The same
                    apparent increase has been remarked in every town where similar institutions
                    have been formed; whence we may conclude that this congenital defect is by no
                    means unfrequent.</p>
                <p part="N">It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the incapacity of speech in
                    such persons as are designated by the term of <hi rend="italic">deaf and
                        dumb,</hi> results altogether from the want of the sense of hearing, and not
                    from any physical imperfection in the organs of speech. Some fanciful writers,
                    indeed, have ascribed it to an alleged sympathy between the organs of hearing
                    and the organs of speech, by which the disease or defect of the former is
                    communicated to the latter; but for this notion there does not appear to be the
                    slightest foundation. All who are deaf from birth must necessarily be dumb; that
                    is, they must be incapable of using language, the sound of which they have never
                    had the perception of, and which they consequently could never attempt to
                    imitate. From a strange inattention to this circumstance, it was usual, even
                    with parents who noticed the slowness of their progress in comparison with other
                    children, to ascribe it to a natural imbecility of intellect, which, they took
                    it for granted, was equally irremediable with the organic defect from which it
                    originated, and effectually precluded all attempt at instruction, and all hope
                    of rendering them useful members of society. Their minds were accordingly
                    suffered to remain without culture; they were abandoned to themselves, degraded
                    from the privileges of men, and exiled from the community of rational beings. To
                    such a culpable extent was this prejudice carried, that it has been the practice
                    in some countries to destroy as monsters all children who remained at three
                    years old incapable of either hearing or speaking. In France the very birth of
                    such children was accounted a sort of disgrace to the family from which they
                    sprung; and the duties of humanity were deemed to extend no further in their
                    behalf, than to the maintenance of their animal existence, whilst they were
                    carefully secluded from the eyes of the world, either within the walls of a
                    convent, or in some hidden asylum in the country. Abandoned thus early to their
                    fate, and regarded as little better than idiots, it is not surprising that their
                    future behaviour should have been such as might seem to justify the narrow views
                    which had prompted this ungenerous treatment. All motives to exertion being
                    withheld, and all desire of improvement being repressed, the faculties soon
                    languished, and became paralysed, for want of proper objects on which they could
                    be exercised; and in time the man sunk to the condition of the brute.</p>
                <p part="N">That the neglect and oblivion to which these wretched outcasts of
                    humanity were consigned, were founded on very mistaken notions of their mental
                    powers, has since been fully proved by a great number of instances in which the
                    exertions of benevolent and persevering instructors to convey to them knowledge
                    of various kinds have been crowned with the most signal success. Yet the
                    enterprise has still appeared one of the boldest and most arduous that could
                    well be attempted, and every instance of success excited much astonishment even
                    in persons of great knowledge and scientific attainments. So impressed was Dr
                    Johnson, for example, with the notion of its extraordinary difficulty, that he
                    represents the education of the deaf and dumb as a great philosophical
                    curiosity. The study of the means by which these effects are produced must
                    therefore be highly curious in itself, as throwing light upon that science,
                    which is interesting above all others, namely, the science of the human mind.
                    But it has yet a higher claim to our attention, as being directed to a purpose
                    of great and immediate practical utility. What object can be more worthy of
                    praise, or more congenial to a benevolent heart, than the redemption of a
                    kindred spirit from the degraded and forlorn condition to which it appeared to
                    have been doomed? What occupation can be more delightful in itself than to
                    awaken the dormant powers of the mind, to usher a new world to its acquaintance,
                    to furnish it with the instruments and materials of thought, to open unbounded
                    channels of intercourse with the living and the dead, to inspire the soul with
                    fresh powers as well as motives to exertion, and, by supplying unlimited sources
                    of intellectual and moral improvement, to place within its reach the purest and
                    most elevated enjoyments of which our nature is susceptible?</p>
                <p part="N">Before entering into the detail of the particular methods adapted to
                    convey instruction to the deaf and dumb, it will be necessary to inquire more
                    precisely what is the general end we should propose to ourselves in their
                    education, and what are the leading objects to which our endeavours ought, in
                    conformity with this end, to be directed. And it appears to us, that the great
                    and fundamental object should be, to qualify our pupils to hold ready
                    communication with the rest of the world, that is, with persons who, having the
                    faculties of hearing and speech, employ the current language of the country for
                    purposes of mutual intercourse. They must, above all things, be <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194755670?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5670-0646"/>taught the
                    use of ordinary language, both as an instrument for expressing their own
                    thoughts, and for understanding those of others. This qualification, it is
                    evident, is absolutely essential to their becoming members of that community
                    from which, by nature, they would have been excluded, and to which it is our
                    chief aim to restore them: it is essential to their deriving advantage from, or
                    being of any utility to that community, a reciprocation of interests in which
                    consists the true value and dignity of human nature. It is the only foundation
                    on which they can hereafter build any solid acquirement. Once masters of
                    language, they possess the key to all the sciences, and have access to every
                    species of human knowledge; and their future progress will be proportional to
                    their own diligence, and will be impeded by no obstacles except those which
                    their own exertions are competent to remove.</p>
                <p part="N">Language, or the ordinary medium of communication between men, is either
                    spoken or written. To enable the deaf and dumb to speak, so as to be perfectly
                    understood by others, and to enable themselves to understand readily what is
                    said by persons speaking to them, is doubtless the ultimate stage of perfection
                    in the art which we are considering, and would in fact be nearly equivalent to a
                    restoration of the privileges which nature had refused them. But whether we
                    regard such perfection as attainable, and as worth the pains requisite for
                    success, or whether we limit our views to more moderate qualifications, the
                    knowledge of written language must still be an indispensable preliminary in
                    every system of education. Let us first, therefore, direct our attention to the
                    means of communicating to the deaf and dumb this fundamental acquisition. For
                    this purpose it will be necessary to have a clear view of the real nature of the
                    class of ideas we are proposing to instil into the mind of our pupil, and of the
                    real condition of that mind by which they are to be received.</p>
                <p part="N">Speech, being the expression of ideas by oral sounds formed into words,
                    is by far the most ready and universal mode of communication among mankind, and
                    must therefore have long preceded the invention of written language, which has
                    accordingly been formed upon the model of speech. Writing, instead of being the
                    direct sign of ideas, as is the case with hieroglyphical characters, or, more
                    properly speaking, rude portraits of external objects, consists of symbols of
                    the particular sounds composing oral language. Written words are in fact the
                    signs of other signs; the one set of signs being addressed to the ear, and the
                    other to the eye. The perceptions of hearing are intermediate links of
                    association between the visible appearances of the written characters, and the
                    ideas they are intended to convey to the mind. This circumstance is the source
                    of the principal difficulties which stand in the way of all instruction to one
                    who is deaf and dumb, one in whom these intermediate perceptions can have no
                    existence, whilst a very different process must be employed for establishing in
                    his mind a connection between ideas and certain signs; because, for want of this
                    step in the process, he is incompetent to trace any regular correspondence or
                    appropriate adaptation of these signs to the ideas they are designed to
                    represent. To an ordinary child, whose ear is already familiar with the name of
                    an object as spoken, and in whose mind the association of the sound with the
                    corresponding idea is firmly established, the learning the use of the letters
                    expressive of such sound is a comparatively easy step in his education. The
                    infant lisping for the first time in broken and faultering accents the endearing
                    name of its parent and its nurse, has in fact made a prodigious stride; he has
                    already entered into human society, and has begun to participate in its
                    blessings. His stock <hi rend="italic">of</hi> words daily increases; he feels
                    the value of his new acquisition; his ideas multiply; his powers are developed.
                    Pleasure animates his efforts, and attends every stage of his progress. To learn
                    his native tongue is a sport; to repeat what he has learned is ever a fresh
                    source of delight. The mighty task is accomplished without any extraordinary
                    interference on the part of the instructor, or laborious effort on that of the
                    pupil. Who would dream of appointing a master to supersede nature in teaching
                    the infant to speak? In this act, as in that of walking and running, the scholar
                    of nature, where all around unconsciously aid her iu the work, will be found the
                    best proficient. Far different is the lot of that hapless and solitary being,
                    who, born without the sense of hearing, is doomed to eternal silence, and is
                    shut out from the inspiring influence of social intercourse. Debarred from the
                    chief avenue to information at this early and critical period of his
                    intellectual growth, the blandishments of his nurse, the caresses of his
                    parents, the accents of praise or blame, the cry of pain or pleasure, in vain
                    salute his ear. He is already but half a human being. Insulated from the main
                    portion of the world, he must live chiefly within himself; his untutored mind
                    must be left to its own slender resources in the acquisition of knowledge; and
                    his progress must therefore be both slow and limited. He is an eagle whose
                    unfledged wings have been clipped, and who stalks on the ground, unconscious
                    that his inheritance lies in another element.</p>
                <p part="N">So deeply rooted do the associations become, which are thus established
                    in our infancy, between ideas and sounds, that we cannot easily perceive how
                    much we have owed to them, and how much of our subsequent acquisitions has been
                    founded upon them; nor can we readily place ourselves in the situation of a
                    child bereft of these advantages, so as to understand the nature and force of
                    the difficulties with which he has to contend in every step of his progress. We
                    might suppose, if we had not attended to these considerations, that the whole
                    business of the tutor of the deaf and dumb would be to point out the words to
                    his pupil, while he, <hi rend="italic">by some other means,</hi> communicated to
                    him the ideas of which they are the representatives. It might be presumed that,
                    by frequent repetition of the same process, the pupil could not fail to learn to
                    connect the two together in his mind, and that he would have no occasion to
                    trouble himself with whatever sounds the rest of the world might associate with
                    these written characters; sounds which, as to him they have no existence, so
                    neither do they anywise concern him; and which may be regarded but as useless
                    stepping-stones in forming a communication which he is enabled to accomplish at
                    a single stride.</p>
                <p part="N">If such be the illusions into which a prejudice natural to every one
                    tends to betray us, a little reflection on the laws by which associations
                    between ideas are established in the mind will be sufficient to dispel them.
                    There is manifestly a great difference in the comparative facility with which
                    ideas of different kinds become associated in the mind; and since memory
                    consists in the strength and permanence of the associations, there is
                    consequently a great difference in the facility with which different kinds of
                    ideas become impressed and retained in the memory. Some ideas unite immediately,
                    as by a natural affinity, and cannot afterwards be disjoined. In other cases the
                    connection is remote and difficult, and the ideas, like grains of sand, refuse
                    to adhere together. Some intermedium must be found, which may cement and
                    consolidate their union. Some analogy or relation must connect every new idea
                    with a former idea already existing in the mind, before it can become the
                    subject of recollection. The facility with which such connections can be formed
                    will depend much upon the number and variety of ideas already in store, as well
                    as upon the ease <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755683?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-5683-0647"/> with which the successive transitions can be
                    made from one to another. In casual and apparently arbitrary associations, there
                    exist always a number of invisible links that compose the chain of connection;
                    and the facility with which these links can be formed determines the readiness
                    of the association. We recollect a new name that we see written, from its
                    resemblance to some other name previously known; but it is by means of the sound
                    which it would have when pronounced that this association is effected. That this
                    is the case will soon become apparent, when we reflect on the difficulty
                    experienced in retaining new and barbarous words, of which the pronunciation is
                    difficult or grating to the ear. That we learn them by the ear more than by the
                    eye, is also shown by the difficulty we should find in recollecting an arbitrary
                    combination of the same number of consonants, which would of course not admit of
                    being pronounced as a word. We should in this case be driven to the expedient of
                    interposing vowels, in order, as it were, to give them breath, and transfer the
                    task from the eye to the ear; although it is evident that the addition of these
                    vowels would increase the number of things to be remembered. All this will
                    appear in a still stronger light, if we impose upon ourselves the task of
                    learning by heart a set of characters equally familiar to us with the letters of
                    the alphabet, but which do not afford a similar resource, at least not in so
                    direct a manner. Let us, for instance, open a book of logarithmic tables, and
                    try to learn a page or two by heart; we shall soon be sufficiently convinced of
                    the arduous nature of the undertaking. Just so it is with the deaf and dumb. The
                    printed letters of a book are to them so many separate ciphers, distinguished
                    indeed from each other by their form, but having no perceptible medium of
                    association, and of which the apparently endless variety of combination, like
                    those of the figures of logarithms, are sufficient to perplex the most sagacious
                    observer, and baffle the most retentive memory. ∙ To them all distinctions into
                    vowels and consonants, into long and short syllables, all the varieties of
                    metre, and all the harmony of verse, have no existence; these belong to
                    creatures of another world, from which they are doomed to an eternal exclusion.
                    No wonder, therefore, that their own untutored efforts should be utterly
                    inadequate to give them the remotest conception of the use of language; and that
                    the records of history have never exhibited to us a single instance of a person
                    deaf from birth, or even having lost the hearing at an early age, who has taught
                    himself to read or write a single word.</p>
                <p part="N">But the deaf and dumb child lies under the further disadvantage of
                    possessing a smaller stock of ideas to set out with than other children. His
                    faculties of observation lιave been less called into play, and the sphere of
                    their operation has been more limited. The task of the instructor is, in this
                    instance, analogous to that of the agriculturist who redeems a savage land,
                    which the plough has never loosened, and where the soil has not been fertilized
                    by previous vegetation. He has to sow the first seed it has yet received, and
                    must watch with anxious solicitude every stage of its growth and fructification.
                    Deprived at the outset of the ordinary resources of communication, what means
                    are we to employ in order to awaken the attention of our pupil, and how can we
                    make him sensible of the object of our endeavours, and animate him to those
                    exertions which are necessary to their success, and which habitual indolence
                    have probably rendered difficult and irksome?</p>
                <p part="N">But resources yet remain; and art has triumphed over all these
                    obstacles, numerous*and formidable as they may appear. The deaf and dumb child
                    has in truth still the means of acquiring a large stock of ideas of a certain
                    class, and has a certain range of expedients by which he communicates with
                    others. When we read the exaggerated statement which some authors have given of
                    the deficiencies of such children, we can easily discern the influence of
                    preconceived theory in distorting obvious facts, and the false colouring which
                    they have derived from a vivid imagination. “What,” says Sicard, “is the
                    condition of the deaf and dumb child considered in himself, and before any
                    species of education has begun to establish connections between him and the rest
                    of his species, or with that great family to which he appertains by his external
                    form? He is a perfect nullity in that community; a living automaton; a statue
                    like the one imagined by Bonnet, and after him by Condillac; a statue in which
                    every sense in succession has yet to bc unlocked, and dirceted to its proper
                    objects, in order to supply the want of that one of which he is so unhappily
                    deprived. His actions being limited to mere physical movements, prior to the
                    removal of the envelope which cramped and confined his reason, he is not endued
                    even with that instinct which is allotted to the brutes, and which is their only
                    guide. He is therefore to be considered merely as a kind of walking machine, of
                    which the organization, with regard to the effects that result from it, is
                    inferior to that of animals. To denominate him a savage, is to assign him a
                    higher rank than appertains to his miserable condition; for he is not even on a
                    level with the savage, either in moral relations, which, to a certain extent,
                    exist among all savages, or in means of intercourse with his fellow-creatures.
                    With regard to the latter, indeed, he is much inferior to the savage, who can
                    always communicate with others by language, however rude and inarticulate may be
                    the sounds which compose it. These sounds are the means of fixing ideas in the
                    mind, and afford the medium of comparison among those ideas, whence result
                    combinations, judgments, and reasonings. Being destitute of these means of
                    communication, and of these signs which fix and determine the power of
                    recollection, all the impressions he receives are transitory, and the images
                    fugitive; nothing remains in his mind to which he can refcr what is passing
                    within him, and which can serve as a term of comparison. His ideas can only
                    consist of such as result from direct impressions; none can be derived from
                    reflection. So that, being unable ever to combine two such ideas together, for
                    want of the signs by which they could be laid hold of and retained, it is
                    impossible for him to arrive at even the simplest process of reasoning.”
                    Condillac had already advanced the same doctrine, and had even gone the length
                    of asserting that the deaf and dumb from birth could have no power of memory,
                    because they were deprived of those artificial signs by which alone the
                    associations could be fixed and rendered permanent. He compares their minds to
                    those of brute animals, and even believes that they are equally incapable of
                    carrying on any train of reasoning.</p>
                <p part="N">But the results of observation arc quite at variance with these
                    conclusions, derived from speculative reasoning. The real education of the deaf
                    and dumb child, like that of him who is possessed of hearing, may be said to
                    commence from the period of its birth. Dr Watson judiciously observes, that
                    “persons born deaf are in fact neither depressed below nor raised above the
                    general scale of human nature, as regards their dispositions and powers either
                    of body or mind. They are human beings, individually differing from their kind
                    only by an accidental defect. This defect is not such as to disturb the course
                    of nature in the first stage of the growth of the mental faculties, though,
                    while it operates as a bar to the acquisition of language, it retards and almost
                    precludes their expansion after this stagŧ.” The whole of the visible and
                    tangible <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755696?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-5696-0648"/> worlds are still open to them; hearing at so
                    early an age can give them comparatively but little assistance in acquiring the
                    knowledge of external objects; and it is always some time before the discovery
                    is made of their being insensible to sound. Still their sensibility expands;
                    their affections are called into play; their passions are excited nearly as in
                    other children, though the means may be somewhat different. The visible marks of
                    attention the child receives from those around, their caresses, their smiles,
                    and their frowns, all make their corresponding impressions on its tender mind;
                    it lives in the looks of those on whom it is dependent. Its whole attention
                    being turned to the study of these visible appearances, the only language which
                    it has to learn, its proficiency in the interpretation of these appearances is
                    comparatively greater. The gestures of its parent it acknowledges by responsive
                    gesticulations, and expresses in this primitive language of nature all its
                    feelings, conditions, and passions. Far from being the living automaton
                    delineated in the closet by theorising metaphysicians, it differs but little in
                    early infancy from other children; and has even some advantages in the superior
                    quickness of the eye, in the more expressive play of the features, and in the
                    more ready apprehension of the slightest look or gesture it observes in others.
                    It is remarkable, indeed, that the defect of hearing is generally not discovered
                    till at an advanced period. Though the child remains mute, the real cause is not
                    readily acknowledged. Doubts and fears may indeed be entertained; but hope is
                    kept alive by parental fondness, and inspires a thousand excuses. A year or two
                    thus slips away, when it is gradually remarked, that when a want is to be made
                    known, or an approval or aversion expressed, it is done by a motion of the hand,
                    head, or countenance; and in place of the loquacious and engaging prattle usual
                    at his age, there is silence, or only inarticulate sounds. At times he is
                    pensive and cheerless, no doubt feeling the disappointments necessarily
                    resulting from incapacity to make himself fully understood by those about him,
                    who, possessing a more perfect medium of mental intercourse, are too apt to be
                    inattentive to the signs and gestures of the little mute. Yet his mind, instead
                    of presenting a total blank, is in fact furnished with a multitude of ideas,
                    arranged indeed after his own peculiar method, but still affording an extensive
                    foundation for future attainments. Already has he established a species of
                    intercourse with those around him, by the language of pantomime, derived from
                    nature, and improved by his own ingenuity. Already does this simple language
                    comprehend the use of nouns, pronouns, verbs, and above all interjections,
                    though he is totally unconscious of the nature or existence of these grammatical
                    distinctions; just as he has moved and jumped, without being aware that he was
                    effecting these actions by means of muscles and tendons, ligaments and
                    bones.</p>
                <p part="N">It is therefore in the study of this species of pantomime, which is the
                    native language of the deaf and dumb, that the first duty of the instructor
                    consists. He must, in truth, begin by taking lessons from lχi.s pupil, and
                    condescend to learn his language, in order to qualify himself for teaching him
                    his own. He must study to familiarize himself with this language, by frequent
                    intercourse with his pupil, and engage his affections by repeated offices of
                    kindness. No better preparation can be devised for the exercises which are to
                    follow, than this intercourse of the heart and interchange of confidence.
                    Curiosity, a principle of action in which deaf and dumb children are generally
                    by no means deficient, and which the judicious tutor will be careful to
                    stimulate and sustain, will give him a strong hold in directing their exertions.
                    On the other hand, they are very apt to be discouraged by the consciousness of
                    their own inferiority, and are thrown into despondency at the idea of the
                    immense interval which they feel must ever separate them from others. This
                    feeling it is our duty to soften as much as possible, by removing the occasions
                    which may give rise to it, and diverting the attention to more cheering views of
                    their own powers, and to the prospect of their advancement. Perhaps it is even
                    better, in many cases, that the truth should be in some degree disguised, and
                    that they should be left, at least at first, in ignorance of the extent of the
                    disadvantages they labour under. For this reason, we should not be disposed to
                    adopt the plan practised by the Abbé de l’Epée, in order to explain to them the
                    nature and uses of that sense which they do not inherit. The expedient which be
                    hit upon for this purpose may be briefly described. Having collected his pupils
                    round a large tub full of water, which was allowed to subside till perfectly at
                    rest, he let fall into it perpendicularly an ivory ball, directing their
                    attention to the undulations of the water, which struck against the sides of the
                    vessel. He then moved a hand-screen backwards and forwards rapidly in a room, so
                    as to put in motion-feathers, or other light bodies, floating in the air at some
                    distance; and explained to them that the room is as full of air as the tub was
                    of water, and that the air set in motion strikes the sides of the room, as the
                    waves did those of the tub. He next took up a repeating watch, and applying the
                    fingers of his pupils to the hammer, made them feel the rapid succession of
                    strokes which it produced. He now informed them that the ear of every person
                    contains an apparatus of the same kind; and that the air, in its passage from
                    the body which has set it in motion, enters the ear and sets in motion the
                    little hammer which is placed there. He gave his pupils to understand, that the
                    reason why they do not hear is because they have no such hammer in their ears,
                    or because its motions are impeded, or the part on which it strikes is void of
                    sensibility. “Whenever,” says he, “I have given this explanation, I have
                    observed it to make very different impressions on different individuals. Some
                    expressed great delight at having acquired the knowledge of what hearing
                    consisted in. Others became affected with profound melancholy on learning that
                    either they were destitute of so useful an instrument as this hammer, or that
                    the one they had could not be used. The first two girls to whom this information
                    had been imparted could not conceal their ill-humour on finding that the
                    house-cat and the canary bird had each their little hammers in the ears, while
                    they themselves had none.”</p>
                <p part="N">The first and most important lesson to be taught to our pupil is, that
                    written words have a meaning, and suggest to all persons of education the same
                    definite idea. In teaching him the meaning of words, we should follow as much as
                    possible the natural order in wdιich they are generally acquired by those who
                    have the sense of hearing. The first and simplest kind of knowledge is that
                    which relates to the material w 0rld. We must commence, therefore, by
                    instructing him in the names of external objects, beginning with those that are
                    best known to him, and oftenest recur to his view. The name of an object of this
                    kind, such as <hi rend="italic">hat,</hi> may be written in large letters on a
                    board; and the attention <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the child being directed
                    alternately to the name and to the object itself, which is to be presented to it
                    at the same time, he will gradually be brought to understand that a certain
                    relation exists between them, though what that relation is, we are not to expect
                    that he will as yet be able to comprehend. The idea of this relation w ill
                    become more distinct when a similar process has been followed with regard to
                    several other names. Occasionally we may find it difficult to convey by this
                    means the least notion that the one is the <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194755709?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5709-0649"/>sign of the
                    other; the child being unable to conceive how what appears to him to be an
                    irregular collection of crooked lines, bearing no resemblance in form to the
                    object pointed out in connection with them, can serve as its type. Experience,
                    derived from the observations we may lead him to make, will, however, gradually
                    teach him this lesson. Sufficient has been done to excite his attention; let us
                    now, in his presence, call upon other children, more advanced in their
                    education, to direct their eye upon these mysterious characters, of which the
                    immediate consequence will be their pointing to the object. The effect produced
                    by the word will be observed by the attentive pupil, and will make its due
                    impression. Let three or four words be written at the same time on the board,
                    and the corresponding objects placed on an adjoining table. On each of these
                    words being pointed out to the advanced child, he will bring the proper article
                    from the table. We shall now have an opportunity of ascertaining how far the
                    proceeding has been understood by the younger pupil, by repeating the experiment
                    on himself. If he lay hold of the proper object, it is clear that our meaning
                    has been understood, and that the first step, the most difficult of all, has
                    been accomplished.</p>
                <p part="N">Care must all this while be taken that our pupil impute not to any
                    circumstance or quality in the words shown to him, different from that of their
                    form, the significancy which he finds them to possess. We must show him, for
                    instance, that their particular situation on the board is not the circumstance
                    from which it derives its meaning. This we can do by changing the order of the
                    words, or by writing them on paper, and in different modes, preserving always
                    the same precise form of the letters. It is evident that in these preliminary
                    exercises we should give the preference to very short words, such as box, pen,
                    shoe, cap, ring, and the like. The association between the name and the object
                    should be strengthened by frequent repetition, and also by occasionally varying
                    the mode of impressing it. The process we have just described, for instance,
                    should sometimes be reversed, the child being required to point out the name
                    when the object is shown to him. In fact, we should neglect no means of assuring
                    ourselves that we are fully and perfectly understood, and that the associations
                    we are labouring to establish are firmly rivettcd in his mind.</p>
                <p part="N">We are, however, by no means to trust to a single associating principle
                    in establishing these essential connections; we should multiply as much as
                    possible the ligaments which compose the union. The child, while learning
                    written words, should be made to copy them himself, so that, by dwelling upon
                    their forms sufficiently, they may make an indelible impression on his mind. We
                    should from time to time show him the objects, and require him to write their
                    names himself. In these preliminary lessons it is obvious that much assistance
                    may occasionally be derived from drawings of the objects we may wish to point
                    out, but which may not be immediately at hand. The Abbé Sicard has availed
                    himself, with much ingenuity, of this mode of denoting objects as an
                    introduction to the use of written words.</p>
                <p part="N">He begins, for instance, by tracing the outline of a familiar object,
                    such as a key, on a black board, with a chalk pencil; and placing the object
                    itself before the eye of his pupil, he will readily understand the resemblance
                    of the design with ŵhat it is meant to represent. He does the same with oth <hi
                        rend="subscript"> l</hi> er objects, and exercises his pupil in pointing out
                    the objects denoted by each drawing, which of course is to him a mere amusement.
                    He next writes the name of each object within the outline of the figure on the
                    board, and, after effacing the outlines, so that nothing but the words remain,
                    signifies to the pupil that he is still to consider what he now sees as the
                    representation of the drawing, that is, of the object denoted by the drawing.
                    These methods, which are susceptible of variation according to circumstances and
                    the ingenuity of the instructor, are to be understood as applicable only to the
                    early lessons; for, after the pupil has once thoroughly understood the value and
                    use of words, all the drawings on the slate should be laid aside, and the more
                    useful medium of written language should be exclusively resorted to.</p>
                <p part="N">With regard to the choice of objects, of which the names may compose the
                    first lessons, we should select those to begin with which are of immediate
                    interest and utility, such as the different parts of the body, articles of dress
                    and of furniture, and common instruments in most frequent use. We should see
                    that every thing that is learned is learned perfectly, by frequently going over
                    the same lesson, so that they may all be deeply engraven on the memory. We must
                    recollect that repetition is the principal means of impressing the memory; and
                    this is the more necessary in the case of the deaf and dumb, as a principal
                    barrier to their acquisition of language consists in their having few means of
                    reviewing words and phrases but by direct instruction or prescribed study.</p>
                <p part="N">But our pupil is not always confined to his apartment; and he can hardly
                    take a step beyond its threshold without meeting with something that he knows
                    very well by sight, and of which it will be useful to him to know the name. We
                    cannot remove it into our school-room, to teach him its name there; nor can we
                    very conveniently carry our writing tablets with us on all occasions. Engravings
                    of such objects will, however, readily supply us with the means of extending our
                    instructions to them also, and, by furnishing us in small compass with the lines
                    that bound their visible appearances in perspective order, will enable us to
                    preserve the remembrance of them, and to keep them in readiness for every
                    purpose. Association will at once recall to our minds the properties that
                    manifest themselves to our other senses, and enable us to read and interpret
                    this picture-language as we would any other collection of artificial signs. A
                    vocabulary, on the plan originally recommended by Locke, consisting of “those
                    words standing for things which are known and distinguished by their outward
                    shapes, accompanied by draughts and prints,” will therefore be of great utility,
                    and shorten the labour both of the teacher and learner. For this express
                    purpose, Dr Watson has had a set of plates engraved, containing delineations of
                    objects most generally met with and commonly known. These engravings arc annexed
                    to his book of <hi rend="italic">Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb,</hi> and
                    represent above six hundred different objects, being comprised in eighty octavo
                    pages. They are accompanied by a printed vocabulary, consisting of the names of
                    all the objects thus represented, as also of most of the words explained in the
                    earlier lessons, before the engravings are had recourse to. The first time of
                    going through this vocabulary, the heads or generic names under which the
                    objects are classed are not regarded; but, in a subsequent revision, these are
                    particularly attended to, and their relations to the subordinate specific names
                    are fully explained.</p>
                <p part="N">The analysis of words into letters is the next step of importance in the
                    early education of the deaf and dumb. It should follow almost immediately upon
                    their complete comprehension of the use of words. They should be shown, as soon
                    as they have learned a small stock of words, that these words are formed from a
                    certain limited number of characters, or letters of the alphabet. Various modes
                    of familiarizing them with this knowledge may be adopted. One of the most simple
                    is, to have each letter written on a small piece of card, of which a number,
                    disposed in parcels, and arranged in proper order, may be <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194755722?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5722-0650"/>contained
                    in a box. After making the child observe a written word that he already knows,
                    we should point out to him the first letter, and take out the same letter from
                    the box; then indicating to him the next, we may conduct his hand to the proper
                    letter in the box, and continue this operation till the word is completed. He
                    will soon reject our assistance, and seek the letters for himself. By practising
                    a little in this way, he will very soon have learned the alphabet, and will
                    understand its use, and will be able, of his own accord, to compose known words
                    with the letters thus furnished him. He must all this time be diligently
                    exercised in writing, so as to acquire facility in forming and joining letters
                    in a running hand. He must be taught the various forms of letters, according to
                    the different ways in which they are used, and the purposes to which they are
                    applied. The capital, small, and double letters, both in the Roman and Italic
                    types, must be perfectly learned, by frequent and daily practice. Writing being
                    an operation to which deafness offers no impediment, nothing particular need be
                    said respecting the method of teaching it. It is proper, however, to remark,
                    that it cannot be taught too early, as, agreeably to the observations formerly
                    made, every variation in the mode of exercising the attention to any set of
                    objects is of material assistance to the memory of those objects.</p>
                <p part="N">It will also be advantageous to instruct our pupil, as soon as he is
                    familiar with the use of letters, in another mode of visible communication, very
                    easy to be acquired, namely, by the manual alphabet, as it is called; that is,
                    the expression of letters by different positions of the fingers. This art is
                    valuable on many accounts; in the first place, as being a very quick and ready
                    means of communication; and, secondly, as it is a method very generally
                    understood and practised by other persons besides the deaf and dumb. This art of
                    talking with the fingers is commonly learned at school, and is easily retained,
                    or recovered if lost. It furnishes a substitute for the pencil, or pen and ink,
                    when the materials for writing are not at hand. The deaf and dumb, when properly
                    instructed, can converse with the utmost rapidity by this method; habit enables
                    them to follow with the eye motions which, to others, would be too rapid for
                    observation; they readily catch at the meaning of a word or question before it
                    is half spelt.</p>
                <p part="N">In the common methods of indicating letters by the fingers, both hands
                    are employed. Some persons have thought it would be attended with advantages, in
                    point <hi rend="italic">of</hi> convenience, to contrive a manual alphabet that
                    would require the use of one hand only. Periere claims the invention of this
                    method, to which he has given the pompous name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dactylology,</hi> a term which the Abbé de ī’Epée proposes to change to <hi
                        rend="italic">Dactylolαly.</hi> It appears, from a book published near two
                    centuries ago, in which are engravings of different positions of the fingers of
                    one hand, representing the several letters, that this method was well known at
                    that time in Spain. Sicard, in his <hi rend="italic">Cours d'Instruction</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">d'un Sourd-Muet de Naissance,</hi> has given a plate of the
                    manual alphabet employed in this institution. It would appear, however, to be a
                    considerable objection to this single-handed alphabet, that it is not in general
                    use among other persons, so that it cannot assist the deaf and dumb beyond the
                    precincts of his school. These alphabets are, however, so easily acquired, that
                    it must always be worth while for him to learn them both.</p>
                <p part="N">There is yet another mode of visible intercourse, still quicker in its
                    operation than the former, and which it may occasionally be very convenient to
                    employ. It is that of indicating the forms of the letters by the point of the
                    finger moved in the air, constituting, as it were, an aerial writing, which, by
                    a little use, is quickly followed with the eye. It must be recollected that, to
                    a spectator who stands before us, the writing would appear reversed if traced in
                    the ordinary manner. This must be remedied by the letters being written in a
                    reversed form, a method which may be readily acquired by practising before a
                    looking-glass. If the person to whom we addressed ourselves were behind us,
                    there would evidently be no necessity for this artifice, since the motions of
                    the fingers would be seen by him in the same aspect as by ourselves. By means
                    somewhat similar, namely, by tracing the letters with the finger on any part of
                    the body, such as the hand or the back of the person with whom we wish to
                    communicate, we may easily converse with him in the dark, a situation in which
                    the deaf are peculiarly helpless.</p>
                <p part="N">Having proceeded thus far in our instructions, having taught our pupil
                    the use and conventional meaning of words, having familiarized him by the
                    various modes of writing and reading, with their visible appearances, and put
                    him in possession of a copious vocabulary of the names of objects of common
                    occurrence, we may be considered as having achieved tþe most difficult, and,
                    certainly, the most important part of our task. There yet, however, remains much
                    to be done. Substantives are all that lie at present knows; but the expression
                    of thought and passion, the affirmation or denial of the relations between
                    ideas, demand words of another class, or, as they are called, other parts of
                    speech. The most natural order of proceeding would seem to be that of teaching
                    him next the use of adjectives, and the relation in which they stand to
                    substantives. A few examples of adjectives, denoting sensible properties of
                    objects, such as those of colour and form, connected with substances that
                    possess these properties, will very soon give them this knowledge, and enable
                    them to apply these adjectives properly. The meaning of pronouns and of verbs
                    are next to be pointed out, with their various modifications of person, number,
                    and tense. All this should, in our opinion, be taught wholly by examples; for
                    which purpose, short and simple sentences should be selected, of which the
                    meaning may readily be conveyed by the assistance of pantomimic language, and
                    will soon be collected by the pupil himself, whose sagacity in observing the
                    occasions on which such expressions are employed will lead him to the discovery
                    by a natural process of induction.</p>
                <p part="N">A method proceeding on a diametrically opposite principle has been
                    adopted by teachers of the first eminence on the Continent, who insist upon the
                    necessity of teaching the deaf and dumb all the parts of speech, one after
                    another, with critical and philological precision, and in exact conformity with
                    the order of the analysis of the different classes of words. They appear to
                    forget that, in the case of ordinary children, nature pursues a very different
                    course. These learn their native language in a short period, without all the
                    technical apparatus of the pedagogue. The study of the rules of grammar is more
                    especially useful in teaching a new language to a person who is already
                    conversant with his own. The business of the teacher is here, indeed, reduced
                    chiefly to that of translation; whilst the substance is the same, it is the form
                    only that is varied. Dr Watson is decidedly of opinion that, naming perceptions
                    as they arise, without regard to metaphysical or grammatical distinctions, is
                    the only sure and direct road to the acquisition of a language by those who have
                    only the natural language of gesture and feature to assist them in acquiring it.
                    For let it be strictly borne in mind, that the analogy between the natural deaf
                    and those who hear, in learning a language, holds only with respect to the first
                    language, or the mother tongue. There can be very little in common with them, in
                    the learning of a foreign or dead language, by the latter; for in this case the
                        <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755735?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-5735-0651"/> mother tongue always serves to explain the
                    terms of the language to be acquired, an advantage of which the deaf and dumb
                    are totally deprived; and yct, if we compare the progress they make with that
                    generally made by young scholars in what are termed the learned languages, in
                    the same length of time, we shall, for the most part, have reason to draw a
                    conclusion in favour of the plan of following nature in teaching a language. It
                    should not, however, be forgotten, that, fairly to estimate the attainments of a
                    deaf scholar, he should rather be compared, though subject to great
                    disadvantages, to a child of an age equal to the length of time he has been
                    under tuition, than to a youth having all his faculties who has been long at
                    school.</p>
                <p part="N">Whilst proceeding through the vocabulary of substantives, we are
                    recommended by the same judicious author, in order to give variety to the
                    lessons, to teach the pronouns, personal and demonstrative, &amp;c. at suitable
                    intervals, always making the learner write the words with his own hand. Then the
                    verbs <hi rend="italic">to be, to have,</hi> and the other auxiliaries, are to
                    be learned or varied according to third persons, joined to nominative cases, as,
                        <hi rend="italic">I am, he has,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning of all these is
                    learned by application in examples. When he says <hi rend="italic">1,</hi> he
                    points to himself; when he says <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> he points to the
                    person teaching him; <hi rend="italic">he,</hi> to a third person, &amp;c.
                    Nothing is more obvious to the eye than number as a property of things; we,
                    therefore, easily learn to count <hi rend="italic">one, two, three,</hi>
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">These preliminaries being settled, we proceed to the construction of
                    short sentences, without learning the rules of syntax. Thus, for instance, we
                    may say, <hi rend="italic">this is my pen, that is your pen, that is his pen,
                        these are our pens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">I have one body, I have
                        two hands,</hi> &amp;c. showing the meaning by pointing out the objects and
                    their relations already perceived by and familiar to the learner, though he
                    could not express them. By way of practice, he is taught to change the
                    substantive, till he can himself give examples, and rightly apply all the words
                    in such sentences, which, in general, he is not a little proud to do. Examples
                    might be multiplied indefinitely in the application of each of the parts of
                    speech, but enough have already been shown in illustration of the general
                    principle of the process. In all cases, examples should be furnished to the
                    learner till the effect intended be produced on his mind; that is, till it
                    appears by examples given by himself that he rightly applies the word intended
                    to be illustrated. These exercises should be introduced as reliefs to the less
                    amusing, but, in the first instance, more important business of learning the
                    vocabulary.</p>
                <p part="N">The system of instruction we have already alluded to, as opposed to the
                    simple process now detailed, is founded upon the employment of a peculiar medium
                    of communication between the teacher and his pupils. This medium, totally
                    different and independent of ordinary language, is formed by a set of artificial
                    signs for the expression of ideas, consisting, not of words, but of certain
                    gestures assumed by convention as the representative of those ideas. These signs
                    may, indeed, be considered as being virtually words, though wearing a different
                    form. They in fact perform to the deaf all the functions of words, since every
                    word in the language is represented in this system by its peculiar and
                    appropriate gesture. In instructing the deaf and dumb according to this method,
                    care is taken that, on their learning the meaning of any written word, the
                    particular gesticulation appropriated to it shall be learned in conjunction with
                    the word. The Abbé de ľEpée, the original contriver of this system, which has
                    been adopted and extended by his successor the Abbé Sicard, gives the following
                    account of the circumstances which first turned his attention to the subject,
                    and paved the way to the invention.</p>
                <p part="N">Two sisters, both deaf and dumb, resided at Paris in a street opposite
                    to the society entitled <hi rend="italic">Les Peres de la</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Chrétienne.</hi> Father Fanin, one of the associates of that community, had
                    attempted, but in a way not sufficiently methodical, to supply the deficiencies
                    of instruction to which the loss of the faculties of hearing and of speech had
                    subjected them; but he was unfortunately carried off by a premature death before
                    his labour had rewarded him with any degree of success. The two sisters, as well
                    as their mother, were inconsolable for the loss they had suffered, when a
                    fortunate accident introduced to them a person eminently qualified to fill the
                    place of him they mourned for. The Abbé de ľEpée had occasion to call at their
                    house. The mother was out, and while he was waiting her return, he put some
                    questions to the young ladies; but their eyes remained fixed on their work, and
                    they gave no answer. In vain did he renew his questions; they were still silent.
                    Not suspecting that the ears of those whom he was addressing were closed to all
                    earthly sound, he was lost in conjecture at the insensibility they manifested,
                    when the mother arrived, and the mystery was resolved. So strong was the
                    impression produced by this incident, that his thoughts were, from that moment,
                    bent upon devising means of restoring to those unhappy young women the faculties
                    of speech, and the means of intellectual intercourse. After meditating long on
                    the subject, it occurred to him that every language is but an assemblage of
                    signs, in the same manner as a series of drawings is a collection of figures,
                    the representations of a multitude of objects. Gestures are also signs; and we
                    may figure every thing by gestures, as we paint every thing by colours, or
                    express every thing by words. Every object has a form, and every form is capable
                    of being imitated. Actions strike our sight, and wc are competent to delineate
                    and describe them accurately by imitative gestures alone. Words are but
                    conventional signs. Why should not gestures serve the very same purposes? Why
                    may there not be framed a language of gestures as there has been a language of
                    words?</p>
                <p part="N">Full of these impressions, the abbé was not long without revisiting the
                    family who had inspired him with so much interest; it is easy to imagine the joy
                    his presence gave them. He was eager to try the success of his newly invented
                    imitative art. He began his drawings, his gesticulations, his writings,
                    conceiving he had but to teach a new language; while, in fact, hc had first to
                    form minds wholly uncultivated. Severe were the toils and the difficulties, and
                    bitter the disappointments, he had to encounter in these first essays. He showed
                    his pupils merely letters, which he taught them to imitate; but nothing like
                    ideas could in this way ever reach their minds; the act of imitation had been
                    purely mechanical. Even when the objects themselves, denoted by words, were
                    pointed out, still no conception of the relation in which they stood to each
                    other was formed; for written words were not images. It was not enough that the
                    abbé had invented gestures to correspond with every word in the language; the
                    necessary medium of communication was still wanting; he had no fulcrum for his
                    apparatus to rest upon; and he was moving in a world placed beyond the narrow
                    sphere of their conceptions. He was striving to teach a foreign language by a
                    grammar written in that very language, without reflecting that an idiom, the
                    words and the syntax of which are alike unknown, cannot be taught but by the aid
                    of a dialect with which it is capable of being compared. No such comparative
                    grammar exists for those whose ideas are limited to what may be suggested by
                    transient sensations, resulting from instinctive wants. In leading his pupils to
                    write words as signs, he was endeavouring to lead them to what they did not
                    know, by setting<pb break="no" facs="nls:194755748?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-5748-0652"/> out from what was equally unknown. He
                    succeeded, it is true, in enabling them to transcribe whole pages of the most
                    abstract disquisitions by the intermedium of gestures; but these gestures, which
                    they had mechanically associated with certain characters, conveyed to them no
                    notions of the real signification of those characters; for, as in every language
                    words are but conventional signs, it is clear that, before their meaning could
                    have been agreed upon, there must have existed some prior language mutually
                    understood by the parties making the agreement.</p>
                <p part="N">Notwithstanding the radical and glaring defects of De ľEpée’s method,
                    which must have precluded it from ever being of the slightest utility to those
                    who followed it, the ostentatious display of that kind of success he obtained,
                    and which was of a nature particularly calculated to impose upon a superficial
                    observer, excited the astonishment and applause of a host of spectators; and
                    being seconded by the impulse of his religious zeal and beneficent charity, it
                    soon raised him to a high degree of reputation. His fame spread itself all over
                    Europe, and his lectures and exhibitions attracted everywhere crowds of
                    enthusiastic admirers. There were not wanting persons, however, who saw through
                    the delusion. At a public exhibition of the pupils of the Abbé Storck, who were
                    taught according to this method at Vienna, Mr Nicolai, an academician of Berlin,
                    proposed to the abbé to require one of his pupils to describe in writing the
                    action he was about to perform. The challenge being accepted, the academician
                    struck his breast with his hand, upon which the deaf and dumb boy immediately
                    wrote the words, <hi rend="italic">hand, breast.</hi> Mr Nicolai withdrew,
                    satisfied with this proof of total failure. It was evident that, notwithstanding
                    all this parade of learning, and their quickness in writing down any question,
                    together with its answer, both had been equally dictated by their master, in the
                    same language of gesture, but without any corresponding ideas, or the exertion
                    of any intellectual faculty, except that of memory. They were utterly incapable
                    of composing a single sentence of their own accord; and it was found,
                    accordingly, that their spontaneous answers to the questions asked them were
                    limited to the monosyllables <hi rend="italic">yes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >no,</hi> of which it is even doubtful whether they fully understood the
                    meaning. It is more easy to conceive than to describe the disappointment which
                    the parents must have felt at the discovery of the real ignorance of their
                    children after so many years of instruction, and after the brilliant manner in
                    which they acquitted themselves in their public probations. The secret is,
                    indeed, betrayed in some letters of the Abbé de ľEpée, published by Sicard, in a
                    note to the work already referred to, in which he avows that his views of
                    education were limited to the mechanical qualifications necessary to enable his
                    pupils to perform their parts in a public exhibition, namely, that of writing
                    words upon certain gestures being made to them, without the least intelligence
                    of their import, and of course without the power of employing these words,
                    either as instruments of thought, or as vehicles of meaning.</p>
                <p part="N">The Abbé Sicard, who had been for some time the assistant, and was
                    afterwards the successor, of De ľEpée, whilst he retained the system of
                    artificial signs contrived by the latter, soon discovered that the intellectual
                    education of his pupils should be the chief object of his efforts, and, in the
                    pursuit of this object, struck out for himself a new path. An opportunity soon
                    occurred for the development of his plan, by his appointment as teacher to a
                    school which had been recently established at Bordeaux, by the Archbishop Μ.
                    Champion de Cicé; and among the first pupils presented to him for admission, was
                    a boy and his sister, belonging to a numerous and indigent family, of whom five
                    were deaf and dumb. They lived in an obscure cottage in a remote part of the
                    country; and the sole occupation of John Massĩeu, the name of the boy, had been
                    to tend his father’s flock of sheep, amidst heaths and forests; and whatever
                    habits he had contracted were those of a savage life. On being brought to
                    Bordeaux, for the purpose, as he thought, of looking after other flocks, his
                    astonishment and alarm at the new objects he beheld were extreme. His suspicions
                    were awakened by every look directed towards him, and he shrunk from all
                    intercourse with those who sought his confidence. His dull and vacant
                    countenance, his timid and embarrassed air, his frigid and sullen reserve, all
                    denoted a being unsusceptible of education. By judicious management, the
                    prospect brightened; his faculties were developed; his intellectual powers were
                    gradually excited and exercised; his capacity for receiving instruction
                    expanded, and he made rapid strides in the acquisition of every kind of
                    knowledge. He is at present distinguished by his intelligence, acuteness, and
                    general information; and is not only conversant with literature, but expresses
                    himself with facility, clearness, and elegance. Sicard has detailed in his work
                    the several steps of his instruction, as a model of his general method; of
                    which, however, after what has been already said, only a short notice will be
                    sufficient</p>
                <p part="N">The object of his first lessons is to teach his pupil the relation
                    between the names of objects and the objects themselves; the analysis of words
                    into the letters of the alphabet; and the particular gesture which he is to
                    attach to each word as its distinctive sign. He then explains the meaning of
                    collective words, as distinguished from those denoting individual objects or
                    parts of objects. Thence he proceeds to general terms, applicable in common to a
                    number of individuals, and to generic names comprehending a number of species;
                    and, lastly, ascends to the most general and abstract words, such as <hi
                        rend="italic">being, thing, object.</hi> The qualities which are expressions
                    of the accidents, variations, and modifications of objects, and are denoted by
                    adjectives, are next taught. He endeavours to make his pupil conceive these
                    qualities, in the first place, as inherent in the objects themselves, and next
                    as being capable of being detached, by a mental operation, from such objects,
                    though, in fact, they have no existence but as united with them. We shall here
                    give a specimen of the contrivances he had recourse to in assisting his pupils
                    to understand such abstract conceptions. Taking seven pieces of paper, each
                    white on one side, and coloured on the other with one of the primitive colours,
                    he places them on a table, before a black board, with their white sides
                    uppermost. He then writes the word PAPER on the board, leaving sufficient
                    intervals between the letters for the insertion of other letters. Then turning
                    the sheet painted blue, so that the coloured side is now uppermost, he writes
                    the word <hi rend="smallcaps">blub</hi> between the letters of the former word,
                    but in smaller characters, thus, <hi rend="smallcaps">PbAlPuEeR.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The same thing is done successively with regard to the other sheets of
                    paper, inserting the name of its respective colour between the letters of the
                    word PAPER, which is repeated for that purpose. This being finished, the blue
                    sheet is again turned down, so that its white side is presented; upon which the
                    smaller letters, composing the w ord <hi rend="italic">blue,</hi> are effaced,
                    while the other letters, P, A, P, E, R, are allowed to remain. By this process
                    the pupil is taught to consider the quality as part of the object, or as
                    inherent in it. In like manner, he proceeds with other adjectives, such as <hi
                        rend="italic">round, square,</hi> and the like, expressing the form of
                    objects; writing them in the intervals of the letters composing the name of the
                    respective objects; effacing them, and substituting others, according as the
                    form of the object is varied.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755761?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5761-0653"/>
                <p part="N">In order to lead his pupil to form the abstraction of the quality thus
                    expressed, that is, to the use of the adjective as a separate word ready to be
                    applied to different substantives, he employs the following diagram, the
                    different lines of which he traces before his eyes, in order to point out the
                    steps by which he is to arrive at this abstraction.</p>

                    he leads them to the system of conjugation, and to all the shades of tenses
                    adopted in various languages. The various significations and inflections of
                    pronouns, with the corresponding affections of verbs, in regard to number and
                    person, are conveyed to the minds of the deaf and dumb, by contrivances very
                    analogous to the preceding, and which need not be dwelt upon, after the example
                    already given. They proceed upon the general principle of connecting together by
                    lines the words, denoting the ideas, which are the component parts of other
                    ideas, so as to express their union; and writing in the place where the lines
                    unite, or, in place of the other words in a similar diagram, the name of the
                    compound idea. Another part of Sicarďs system is the employment of a system of
                    ciphers, written on the top of every word or member of a sentence, according to
                    the office it performs in that sentence; by the help of which his pupils are
                    better enabled to analyze it into its essential parts, distinguishing the name
                    of the object which is cither acting or receiving an action, the verb and its
                    regimen, direct, indirect, or circumstantial, and thus comprehending and
                    displaying every part of speech. Thus he instructs his pupils in the science of
                    universal grammar, applicable to the primitive expressions of signs, as well as
                    to all spoken and written languages.</p>
                <p part="N">Of the system of artificial signs, which is represented by Sicard as the
                    essential groundwork of all this knowledge, and as the principle means of
                    imparting it, there is much room to doubt the practical advantage. To the praise
                    of ingenuity its author has certainly a claim; but it can scarcely be regarded
                    as any approach to a philosophical language, being as much founded in metaphor
                    and distant analogies as any existing language. With speech it cannot bear any
                    comparison in point of quickness, for the modulations of the voice arc capable
                    of being executed with a rapidity far exceeding that of gestures. There is,
                    besides, hardly any mode of fixing the idea of a gesture by some visible type,
                    as there is that of sound by writing, which serves at all times to renew the
                    impression with perfect correctness. Hence the difficulty of forming a
                    vocabulary of gestures, even to those already in possession of the use of
                    written language, of which we must, of course, suppose our pupils ignorant.
                    These gestures, it is pretended, are engrafted on the natural language of
                    pantomime; but this natural language can carry us but a very little way in the
                    expression of thought. Every action, the visible part of which can be imitated
                    by gesture, admits easily of being so expressed; as the action of eating, by
                    lifting the hand to the mouth, followed by the motion of the jaws; and of
                    sleeping, by closing the eyes and reclining the head. The expression of
                    different passions, of approbation or disapprobation, of surprise, of inquiry,
                    &amp;c. may all be signified very intelligibly by modifications of the
                    countenance. It is in this simple manner, observes Dr Watson, that two or more
                    deaf and dumb persons arc enabled to hold instant converse with each other,
                    though brought together for the first time from the most distant parts. Thus far
                    these signs may be termed <hi rend="italic">natural</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    but the naturally deaf do not stop here with this language of pantomime. When
                    they are fortunate enough to meet with attentive companions, especially where
                    two or more deaf persons happen to be brought up together, it is astonishing
                    what approaches they will make towards the construction of an artificial
                    language. By an arbitrary sign, fixed by common consent, or accidentally hit
                    upon, they will designate a person or a thing, and only that particular person
                    or thing, by this sign, which is ever after used by them as a proper name. It is
                    remarkable, that, although in the first instances of inventing or applying these
                    sign-names, if they may be so called, they are guided by some prominent, but
                    perhaps by no means permanently distinguishing mark; such as, in the case of a
                    person, a particular article of dress being worn, the first time of becoming
                    acquainted, an accidental wound, though it leave no scar, a peculiarity of
                    manner, and the like; yet, after having fixed upon it, they never vary,
                    notwithstanding the peculiarity that guided their choice should have long ceased
                    to be observable in the person of the individual they have so designated. Nor
                    will they fix upon the same sign for another of their acquaintance, though, at
                    the time of first meeting him, he may have the same mark about him which they
                    had used to specify a former person. This fully proves that they regard the sign
                    merely as a proper name; and they receive it as such from one another, without
                    inquiry as to its origin. Thus, supposing a person, the first time he should be
                    particularly taken notice of by one who is deaf and dumb, had accidentally cut
                    his face, and wore a patch, it is a hundred to one that this would, from
                    henceforward, be his distinguishing mark, unless some one else of the deaf
                    person’s acquaintance had already been so distinguished. The wound might be
                    cured, and the patch removed; but the deaf person would uniformly put the end of
                    his finger to the part of the face where the patch had been worn, when he wanted
                    to point him out. And lest those to whom he might be desirous of afterwards
                    communicating something concerning this person should not comprehend him, he
                    will not fail to introduce him to them by repeatedly pointing to him, and then
                    to the mark by which he means to describe him, till he thinks he has
                    sufficiently engaged their attention. By similar contrivances, places and
                    things, as well as persons, nay, even qualities and circumstances, are
                    distinguished by the deaf, in an astonishing manner. To attempt in words a
                    description of those signs would be endless, because they are various as the
                    fancies and circumstances of their inventors. Yet being grafted on the parent
                    stock of natural and universal signs, they may in some measure be regarded as
                    different dialects of the same language.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755774?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5774-0654"/>
                <p part="N">Hence every one who undertakes the arduous task of teaching the deaf and
                    dumb, should sedulously turn his attention to the study of that language termed
                        <hi rend="italic">natural,</hi> where it consists of gesture and feature, in
                    order to enable him to comprehend, as far as possible, the signs of his
                    scholars, which at first more or less differ from one another, as they more or
                    less resemble those signs universally intelligible. Of how much importance it is
                    to the teacher to understand these signs, will readily be apprehended, if any
                    one will attempt either to teach or learn a language, without having another
                    common to master and scholar. But never let any thing so chimerical be thought
                    of as an attempt to turn master to the deaf and dumb in the art of forming
                    signs. What should we expect from an European who should undertake to teach his
                    own regular, copious, and polished language to a South Sea Islander, who was
                    henceforward to live among Europeans, and whose scanty vocabulary extended only
                    to a very few words, barely sufficient to enable him to express, in a rude
                    manner, what was required by the uniformity of his condition and the paucity of
                    his thoughts? Should we suspect that the teacher would set about new-modelling,
                    methodizing, and enlarging this rude and imperfect language, as the readiest
                    method of making the islander acquainted with the European tongue, especially
                    when this new-modelled language, after all the pains bestowed in forming and
                    teaching it, could be of no manner of use but to assist the intercourse between
                    these two persons? If this supposition appear ridiculous, how much more fanciful
                    and useless is an attempt to methodize signs for the instruction of the deaf and
                    dumb. Would it not be a more natural and rational mode of procedure for the
                    teacher to begin by watching the objects and occasions to which the scholar
                    applied the words of his barbarous speech, that by knowing these he might
                    gradually substitute the words of the language to be taught, using the <hi
                        rend="italic">former</hi> only as an introduction to the latter? It should
                    never be lost sight of, that deaf people are not educated to live always among
                    persons in their own unfortunate situation. Were this the case, indeed, an
                    artificial language of methodized signs might be of important use. But as they
                    are intended to mix with their fellow beings, in social habits and necessary
                    avocations, we have to open a channel to this intercourse; and this cannot be
                    done so effectually by any other means as by teaching them the language of the
                    country where they reside.</p>
                <p part="N">To these judicious remarks of Dr Watson may be added the consideration,
                    that our object in educating the deaf and dumb is not so much to make them acute
                    grammarians and subtile metaphysicians, as to render them useful members of
                    society. Experience shows that the more simple and ordinary modes of instruction
                    will effect this latter purpose in less time, and with better success, than the
                    former can be accomplished by the complex and elaborate system we have been
                    considering.</p>
                <p part="N">Another most important branch of the education of the deaf and dumb
                    remains to be considered, namely, the teaching them to speak, and to understand
                    what is spoken , by others, by observing the motion of their lips. That any
                    person, without the guidance of the sense of hearing, should be enabled, merely
                    by studying the position and action of the organs of voice, to utter articulate
                    sounds with any tolerable perfection, would at first view appear scarcely
                    credible. Experience however has shown, that the task, though laborious and
                    tedious, is not attended with this extreme difficulty. Even the earliest
                    attempts of those who have cultivated this art appear to have been as completely
                    successful as those of modern instructors. Great patience and perseverance would
                    seem to be the qualities chiefly necessary to ensure success in ordinary cases.
                    When we talk of success, however, it must be stated, that a wide difference must
                    ever remain perceptible between the speech of the deaf and of those who hear.
                    This artificial speech is evidently laborious and constrained, conveying
                    frequently the idea of pain as well as of effort As it cannot be regulated by
                    the ear of the speaker, it is often too loud, and generally monotonous, harsh,
                    and discordant. It is often, from this cause, scarcely intelligible, except to
                    those who arc accustomed to its tones. It is only, indeed, to such as are in
                    habits of daily intercourse wιLh them, that it fully answers the purpose for
                    which that gift was bestowed on man, namely, the communication of thought.</p>
                <p part="N">It may, indeed, be a matter of some doubt, whether these advantages,
                    limited as they must necessarily be, are a sufficient compensation for the time
                    and labour consumed in their attainment, and which might perhaps be better
                    employed. The decision of this question, as far as it concerns any particular
                    individual, must, however, depend in a great measure on peculiar circumstances,
                    such as his condition in life and future destination. The Abbé Sicard, perhaps
                    from a predilection for the method of artificial signs, renounced the pursuit of
                    this object, as not worth the pains, and as interfering with his general plan.
                    In Great Britain this art has been at all times cultivated with more assiduity
                    and with greater success than on the Continent. The experience of Dr Watson is
                    decidedly in favour of its utility. In support of his opinion he states one
                    argument, which must doubtless be allowed to have considerable weight. The more
                    numerous are the means of association, he justly observes, the more perfect will
                    be the recollection, or, in other terms, the more frequent the recurrence of
                    words, and their corresponding ideas to the mind. Thus, persons who can hear,
                    speak, read, and write, retain a discourse much better, and have far greater
                    facility in expressing themselves, than persons who possess only two of these
                    faculties; that is, illiterate persons, who can hear and speak, but who cannot
                    read nor write. Now as deaf and dumb persons, educated without articulation, can
                    only have two of the means, viz. the third and fourth; that is, the impressions
                    made upon the eye by characters, and the action of the hand in writing; can it
                    be questioned that we render them an essential service by adding the actions of
                    the organs of speech; a very powerful auxiliary, since by it words become, as it
                    were, a part of ourselves, and more immediately affect us? In learning the
                    pronunciation of the letters, a very important operation is going on in the mind
                    of a deaf person; namely, the association, in the memory and understanding, of
                    the figures of written or printed characters, with certain movements or actions
                    of the organs of speech. The very habit of regarding the one as the
                    representative of the other, paves the way for considering combinations of those
                    actions or characters as the signs of things or of ideas; that is, significant
                        <hi rend="italic">words,</hi> written or articulate. We who hear consider
                    words chiefly as <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the deaf
                    who have learnt to speak consider them rather as actions proceeding from
                    themselves. And this gives language to thema sort of tangible property, which is
                    of vast importance both as respects its retention in the memory, and as it
                    respects one of its most important uses, the excitation of ideas in their own
                    minds. On this account the time, the labour, and attention, necessary to
                    articulate speech by those who are dumb, through want of hearing, would be well
                    bestowed, even if their speech were not intelligible to others. Deaf persons
                    having learnt to speak are frequently overheard speaking softly to themselves;
                    that is, rehearsing words or sentences, either for the purpose of better
                    remembering them, or of framing such expressions as they think will best convey
                    their ideas.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755787?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5787-0655"/>
                <p part="N">The act of speaking is evidently an operation purely mechanical; and the
                    instruments by which it is performed are the lungs, windpipe, and larynx, the
                    tongue, nostrils, lips, and the various parts of the mouth. The lungs supply
                    breath like the bellows to a musical organ; and the shortening or elongation of
                    the cavity of the pharynx and mouth produce the varieties of grave and sharp
                    tones in the voice, though these tones are again modulated by the movements of
                    the parts of the larynx, which are disposed so as to expand or contract the
                    aperture of the glottis. The articulation of syllables, or the formation of the
                    different letters, begins after the breath has been emitted through the larynx,
                    and is accomplished by means of the mere external organs of speech, that is, the
                    mouth, nostrils, tongue, teeth, and lips.</p>
                <p part="N">The following is the process employed by Dr Watson in teaching the
                    pronunciation of the vowels. “The first step,” he says, “is to obtain a clear
                    and distinct sound from the throat (in a voice tolerably well pitched, for this
                    is our <hi rend="italic">materia loquelae),</hi> as of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    in the word <hi rend="italic">wall,</hi> &amp;c. To effect this, and to
                    habituate the pupil to associate the sound which he is learning to form with the
                    figure of the letter which is to be its representative, this is distinctly
                    traced upon paper, or any convenient tablet, and he is made to look at it for a
                    minute or two; he then, if of acute intellect, will look up, with some anxiety
                    in his countenance, as if he would ask what he is to do with it. The sound is
                    then slowly and fully pronounced, and the learner made to observe, by his eyes,
                    the position and motion of the external organs of speech, and to feel the
                    as-triction of the muscles of the larynx, by placing his finger upon the throat,
                    carefully making him perceive the difference to be felt there between sound and
                    silence. Having made these observations for a minute or two, he will seldom
                    hesitate to attempt an imitation of what he has been observing; and that, for
                    the most part, successfully. When the contrary is the case, nothing more is
                    necessary than patient and good-natured perseverance; for if he perceive that
                    his failure has excited chagrin or disappQÍnt-ment in his teacher, he will make
                    another effort with great reluctance. The sound once acquired must be practised
                    sufficiently to avoid any danger of losing it; for the greatest care must be
                    taken, all throughout his progress, never to proceed to a new sound till the
                    preceding has become familiar, and unattended with doubt as to the manner of
                    producing it. A contrary practice would lead to endless vexation. A principal
                    requisite is to keep the learner in good humour, and to make him think that he
                    is doing well beyond expectation; nothing is more discouraging than to put him
                    back.” In the same manner he proceeds to the simple sounds of the other vowels,
                    and then to the consonants.</p>
                <p part="N">By the powers of the consonants are meant the positions and actions of
                    the several organs employed in their formation, without the addition of any
                    distinct vocal sound. For although frequent mention will be made of sound in the
                    throat, in their formation, it is to be understood as so confined by the
                    position of the organs, as not to partake of any of the sounds represented by
                    the vowels.</p>
                <p part="N">By closing the lips, sounding gently in the throat, forcing them asunder
                    by the emission of the breath, and carefully avoiding to let any of it pass
                    through the nose, we have the power of B. After the same manner is formed the
                    power of P, but without sound in the throat. M requires the lips to be closed,
                    the sound is made in the throat, and the breath suffered to escape through the
                    nose.</p>
                <p part="N">The power of C, or what is called its hard sound, that is, the sound of
                    K, is formed by raising the back part of the tongue to the roof of the mouth,
                    near the uvula, and forcing it away again rather quickly, by an emission of the
                    breath, without sound in the throat. G has the same formation, with the addition
                    of sound in the throat.</p>
                <p part="N">The power of D is produced by placing the tip of the tongue against the
                    two rows of teeth, which are to be quite, or nearly shut, sounding in the
                    throat, emitting the breath in removing the tongue from the teeth, and, at the
                    same time, opening them a little. T has the same formation, only without sound
                    in the throat.</p>
                <p part="N">By placing the upper row of teeth upon the under lip, and gently
                    emitting the breath, without sound in the throat, we have the power of F. V has
                    the same formation, with the addition of sound in the throat.</p>
                <p part="N">H is a mere emission of breath, with the mouth a little open.</p>
                <p part="N">J has the power of D and SH combined.</p>
                <p part="N">L is formed by raising the point of the tongue to the roof of the mouth,
                    near the upper teeth, sounding in the throat, and suffering the breath to escape
                    freely on each side of the tongue.</p>
                <p part="N">The power of N is formed by raising and pressing the tongue to the
                    palate, with the whole of its upper surface, so that no breath may escape except
                    through the nose; the lips being kept open, and a gentle sound being made in the
                    throat.</p>
                <p part="N">For Q, join K and∙ΛV.</p>
                <p part="N">R is variously formed; but the surest and easiest way of teaching its
                    power to a deaf person is by elevating the fore part of the tongue to the
                    palate, and, with the assistance of the breath, causing a vibratory motion of
                    it, accompanied with a gentle sound in the throat.</p>
                <p part="N">In forming S, place the tip of the tongue just below the under teeth,
                    raise the sides of it to the palate, leaving a small aperture in the middle,
                    through which the breath is to be forced, without sound in the throat, which
                    will be intercepted by the teeth being shut, and form the hissing sound
                    required. Z requires the same position of the organs, with the addition of sound
                    in the throat.</p>
                <p part="N">X is compounded of K and S.</p>
                <p part="N">CH is compounded of the powers of T and SH.</p>
                <p part="N">SH has a power nearly resembling that of S, and requires a position of
                    the organs something similar, except that the tip of the tongue must be drawn
                    back, instead of touching the gums and teeth; and the current of the breath
                    emitted must be intercepted by the under teeth only in part; the rest must be
                    suffered to escape between the rows of teeth, which must be a little opened for
                    that purpose.</p>
                <p part="N">TH requires the tongue to be a little advanced between the two rows of
                    teeth, and the breath emitted between it and the upper row, which must,
                    nevertheless, be nearly in contact with it; this will produce the sound of TH,
                    as heard in the word <hi rend="italic">think.</hi> It has another power,
                    requiring precisely the same position of the organs, but with the addition of
                    sound in the throat, heard in the word <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">NG represents a strong nasal sound; to form it the tongue is drawn back
                    and raised to the roof of the mouth, towards the uvula; a sound is made in the
                    throat, and forced through the nose.</p>
                <p part="N">It is evident that when the power of a consonant is acquired, it needs
                    only to be combined with the vowels to form syllables; as <hi rend="italic"
                        >ba,</hi><hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> &amp;c. These the pupil pronounces
                    almost at sight, as he does also <hi rend="italic">bab,</hi> and any other
                    combination of a vowel and a consonant or consonants, if well grounded in the
                    foregoing formations of them. From the easiest combinations we proceed to the
                    most complex, and by practice acquire a readiness in pronouncing the longest
                    polysyllables.</p>
                <p part="N">Whilst acquiring the faculty of speaking, the deaf and <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194755800?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5800-0656"/>dumb
                    imperceptibly learn to distinguish by the eye the words spoken by others. “It is
                    truly astonishing,” says Dr Watson, “and would hardly be credited by any onc who
                    had not seen it, how readily deaf persons, who have themselves been taught to
                    speak, catch words, and even long sentences, from the mouths of those who
                    address them. Yet, in this sort of conversation, it is indispensable that the
                    speech should be immediately directed to the <hi rend="italic">spectator</hi>
                    (we must not call him <hi rend="italic">auditor),</hi> who must have an
                    opportunity of observing every motion of the muscles (as far as these can be
                    seen externally) and countenance, in order to make out the discourse. On this
                    account it is impossible for a deaf person to understand the conversation of a
                    mixed company, a discourse from the pulpit, or an harangue to an assembly, where
                    the speaker does not immediately address him.”</p>
                <p part="N">After the sketch we have thus given of the principles on which the
                    different departments of the education of the deaf and dumb should be conducted,
                    it only remains for us to consider the best order in which we should proceed
                    with their lessons and studies, and the period within which we may reasonably
                    expect that they are to be completed. In giving directions with this view, wc
                    shall still take Dr Watson as our guide.</p>
                <p part="N">Schools for the deaf and dumb, in which a great number arc instructed at
                    the same time, afford peculiar advantages to the teacher, and are very
                    favourable to the proficiency of the scholars. By associating with others, who,
                    being equally deprived of hearing, are on a level with regard to the
                    difficulties to be surmounted, they are relieved from the continual sense of
                    inferiority which oppresses and disheartens the deaf child when placed in the
                    midst of those who have the perfect use of all their senses; and the influence
                    of example, and a spirit of emulation, will operate with due force in exciting
                    them to intellectual exertions. Dr Watson finds, by experience, that one deaf
                    person may be employed to tcaeh another with the happiest effect. So much so,
                    that when he happens to be for the moment at a loss to make one of slow
                    apprehension understand a lesson, he turns him over to one of his school-fellows
                    who has learnt it, and never without advantage to both. For it is with the deaf
                    as with every one, that we ourselves learn best by endeavouring to teach
                    others.</p>
                <p part="N">The acquisition of the pronunciation of letters, of syllables, and of
                    words, with their correct orthography, contained in the vocabulary already
                    described, together with such additional exercises as will most obviously
                    exemplify the application and meaning of the connecting parts of speech, will be
                    sufficient occupation to the pupil during the first year of his attendance upon
                    the school; and when the capacity is good, great progress is usually made in
                    these particulars during this period. He is then prepared for longer exercises,
                    and for the application of the words he has learnt, in the construction of
                    longer sentences, to which he, of course, requires to be led on by easy and
                    familiar examples. A sort of colloquy, or dialogue, must be entered into with
                    him. The questions at first must be all on the teacher’s part, and the answers
                    must be formed for the learner, in the most obvious words and phrases that will
                    convey his ideas, in strict conformity to which they must constantly be framed.
                    Due attention being paid by learner and teacher, the good effects of this method
                    will presently appear. The latter will soon be agreeably surprised by his
                    scholar changing parts with him, and becoming, in his turn, the interrogator;
                    and that, too, in a way that will show he practically understands analogy.</p>
                <p part="N">It will be useful to set aside certain stated periods, as once or twice
                    in a week, for the repetition of words already learnt; taking care to see
                    minutely that correct ideas are annexed to each. When the whole of the words in
                    the select vocabulary, substantives, verbs, and adjectives, have been gone
                    through several times, and the reader can correctly spell, speak, and point them
                    out (if the names of things engraved), or show their signification by his signs
                    (if the names of actions, or qualities, &amp;c.), then he is to enter upon a
                    work as yet altogether new to him. He is to go over his vocabulary again, and to
                    learn a short definition of each word; that is, to tell the meaning of w ords by
                    words. This employment is prescribed, not because he will better understand the
                    words in his vocabulary by being taught to define them, but because an
                    opportunity is thus afforded of enlarging it, by the introduction of synonymous
                    words, and words that are defined in some way from those we are defining; and
                    these new words enable us to explain others. So that, by this means, and by our
                    colloquial exercises, our vocabulary is daily and almost imperceptibly
                    enlarging. This is strictly analogous to the manner of acquiring a first
                    language by those who hear. The conjugation of verbs is, in the mean time, tobe
                    carefully attended to; and onc example, at least, through all the moods, tenses,
                    and persons, should now be performed every morning, till the pupil can write any
                    person of any mood or tense required.</p>
                <p part="N">By this time, probably about the third year of the learner’s progress,
                    supposing in him the requisite attention and capacity, it will be proper and
                    necessary to begin the reading of printed books, for the sake of profiting by
                    the information they contain. As far as the mere act of reading is concerned, we
                    have no new difficulty to surmount, for all our exercises and lessons have, in
                    fact, been read as well as written by the learner. The difference between
                    printed characters and those used in writing has, of course, not been
                    unobserved. What constitutes the chief impediment to making sense of what is met
                    with in books, is the promiscuous use of words, without regard to our
                    selections. What is to be done when we meet with a word which we have never seen
                    before? Precisely that which is done with all children under similar
                    circumstances; explain it by the substitution of a word of which the meaning is
                    known, if it can be done; if not, pass it over till a favourable opportunity
                    shall occur to show its meaning by an example. If no such opportunity ever
                    occur, then can the meaning of the word be of no great moment to the
                    learner.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to discover the progress he has made, and is daily making, and
                    to assist him in the composition of sentences, or the expression of his thoughts
                    in writing, he is now required, every day, to furnish, according to his
                    capacity, a certain number of lines from his own ideas. He is at liberty to
                    choose his subject; he may relate what he has seen in his walk or his
                    play-ground, or he may unfold the stores of his memory relative to more distant
                    places and periods. He may ask questions, and seek for information of any kind.
                    His rude essays at expression are often curious, and require some skill in the
                    language of pantomime to discover their meaning by his own explanations. This
                    being attained, it is put into correct but easy language; he commits it to his
                    memory thus corrected; and goes to work again, “at his leisure hour in the
                    evening,” for the next day, generally profiting considerably by the alterations
                    it was necessary to make in his preceding essay. We have now a new channel of
                    communication opened; and the knowledge of the meaning of words, and their use
                    in the construction of sentences, which we have already acquired, may be carried
                    to almost any given degree of perfection and extension. Frequent conversation
                    and intercourse, by the words of the language he has learnt, is of the very
                    utmost importance to a deaf person, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194755813?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5813-0657"/>especially
                    if he should have but little leisure or inclination for reading, as the means of
                    extending his knowledge of language, and of enlarging his conception of things,
                    and as the means of retaining what he has acquired. Every one will readily
                    perceive this, who considers how easily a foreign or dead language is lost for
                    want of reading, writing, or speaking in it.</p>
                <p part="N">The asylum for educating the deaf and dumb children of the poor,
                    established in the immediate vicinity of London, by private subscriptions, in
                    the year 1792, was originally under the very able superintendence of Dr Joseph
                    Watson, who has, since his death, been succeeded by his son Mr James Watson. No
                    child is admitted on the charitable foundation under the age of nine years. This
                    age was not fixed upon from any idea that it was the earliest at which regular
                    education could be advantageously begun; but <hi rend="italic">five</hi> years
                    being, generally speaking, deemed sufficient to accomplish that course of
                    instruction which was thought most essential to such children, destined to earn
                    their bread by the labour of their hands, <hi rend="italic">fourteen</hi> being
                    the earliest age at which they could be apprenticed, it was judged best, for the
                    economical purposes of the institution, not to receive them before the age of
                    nine years. That he may not be misapprehended, Dr Watson afterwards states
                    precisely what he understands by an education most essential to deaf children of
                    the class mentioned. “I deem it essential,” says he, “that they should have such
                    a knowledge of language as to enable them to express their ideas on common
                    occasions; to understand the commands or directions it may be necessary to give
                    them in ordinary cases, &amp;c.; to read with intelligence the precepts, the
                    examples, and the promises, which are contained in the Scriptures, particularly
                    the New Testament; that they should write a good hand, spell correctly the words
                    they use, and understand the principal rules of arithmetic. When I say that
                    these acquirements may be attained in <hi rend="italic">five years,</hi> I mean
                    to state <hi rend="italic">that</hi> as the shortest time, even where the
                    capacity of the learner is good. Where the mind is intended to be enlarged by a
                    system of general information and science, a proportionably longer time must
                    necessarily be required for its accomplishment.”</p>
                <p part="N">An institution of a similar kind was also established at Birmingham, and
                    Mr Thomas Braidwood, who had conducted a private school for the deaf and dumb at
                    Hackney, was originally appointed teacher. Mr Braidwood, however, is now dead,
                    and his successor is Mr du Puget. Though the original design did not go beyond
                    that of a day-school, for the more immediate instruction of such deaf and dumb
                    persons as might be found in Birmingham, yet since, by the zealous exertions of
                    a number of its friends, the charity attracted a more general attention, a
                    liberal subscription was raised for providing a building fitted for the
                    reception of children from distant places. This building was completed and first
                    opened in January 1815, and is sufficient to contain forty children.</p>
                <p part="N">In June 1810 a society was instituted in Edinburgh for the education of
                    deaf and dumb children. The first teacher was Mr John Braidwood, a member of the
                    family which has done so much for the instruction of this interesting class of
                    persons. On his removal, a short time afterwards, Mr Robert Kinniburgh was
                    appointed teacher of the school, and this gentleman still continues to discharge
                    the duties of his office with equal ability and success. The number of his
                    pupils at present (1833) is sixty-four. All of them are boarded in the society’s
                    house, where they are taught reading, writing, geography, and arithmetic, and
                    are carefully instructed in the principles of the Christian religion. They are
                    also, in some cases, taught to express their wants and ideas in articulate
                    speech; and all are instructed to communicate their sentiments by written
                    language, which they do with great facility. No child is admitted under nine,
                    nor above fourteen years of age. Five years are required for completing their
                    education. Besides the above-mentioned branches of education, which all the
                    pupils are taught in common, the female pupils arc taught needle-work, and those
                    of an inferior station are qualified by suitable instruction for becoming
                    domestic servants. Those of the boys who remain six years in the institution are
                    taught to be tailors or shoemakers; but those who remain only five years have
                    their attention directed solely to education. Since this institution commenced
                    its labours, 170 males and 119 females, in all 289, have left school more or
                    less instructed, and, by having their rational and moral powers awakened,
                    qualified to become useful members of society.</p>
                <p part="N">The system of tuition followed in the Edinburgh school is nearly the
                    same as that of the London institution. Mr Kinniburgh considers the British
                    system of education for the deaf and dumb as preferable to that practised in the
                    continental schools, inasmuch as it is less metaphysical, and calculated to
                    produce more speedy results.</p>
                <p part="N">The pupils occasionally undergo public examinations, and never fail to
                    gratify and astonish crowded audiences, particularly by their remarkable
                    promptitude in defining abstract terms. The following, on the word <hi
                        rend="italic">Music,</hi> may serve as a specimen: “<hi rend="italic"
                        >Music,</hi> the language of sentiment and the breath of the passions; a
                    harmonious and sweet sound, such as the sound of a piano-forte, violin, or
                    bagpipe. <hi rend="italic">Language,</hi> a medium of conversation between one
                    man and another: it is either artificial or natural. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Natural,</hi> not acquired, not taught, not learned. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Artificial,</hi> cultivated by art, not natural. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sentiment,</hi> thought, opinion, the judgment of the mind. <hi
                        rend="italic">Breath,</hi> life, moving air. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Passions,</hi> such as extreme love, anger, zeal. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Harmonious,</hi> concordant or agreeing. <hi rend="italic">Sweet,</hi>
                    delicate, luscious, pleasing to the ear or taste. <hi rend="italic">Sound,</hi>
                    a noise; I cannot hear what is called sound. <hi rend="italic">Piano-forte,</hi>
                    a large curious musical instrument used by ladies. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bagpipe,</hi> an instrument consisting of a leathern bag and pipes used by
                    Highlanders.” At these examinations, too, they exhibit their attainments in
                    geography and arithmetic, and display a minute acquaintance with the facts and
                    doctrines of the Christian religion; and the specimens of composition which are
                    produced not only manifest much good feeling and accuracy, but sufficiently
                    controvert the assertion, that none of the deaf and dumb can ever be taught to
                    write grammatically. The public are permitted to visit the school every Tuesday
                    from twelve to one o’clock, for the purpose of examining the various
                    classes.</p>
                <p part="N">The institution was established and is wholly supported by private
                    subscription, and by the aids contributed by auxiliary societies in some of the
                    other towns in Scotland. Its expense for one year, ending 26th March 1833, was
                    about L.1100, the average cost for each pupil being somewhat under twenty pounds
                    per annum; which sum includes board, education, stationery and books, servants’
                    wages, repairs, and in some cases clothing, besides various other incidental
                    expenses.</p>
                <p part="N">Although the institution has been liberally patronized by the public,
                    yet its income has always been insufficient to meet its expenditure. In
                    consequence of this the directors have been generally under the painful
                    necessity of preferring those applicants who could afford to pay a part of the
                    expense of their own maintenance during the period allotted for their education.
                    However, in not a few cases where the parents or friends have been found unable
                    to contribute any portion of this expense, it has been wholly defrayed by the
                    institution.</p>

                    Distillery Park, Henderson Row; arranged in the interior on a plan well adapted
                    for the purposes of such an establishment, and surrounded by two acres of
                    ground, affording sufficient scope for that degree of relaxation which is
                    essential to the health of young people. The building may be said to be all that
                    the Deaf and Dumb Institution of the metropolis of Scotland ought to be; and
                    although there be nothing in its appearance very imposing to the eye of a
                    passing stranger, yet such an institution cannot but be hailed by the
                    intelligent and humane observer as one of the most grateful ornaments of our
                    city; for, as has justly been remarked, it combines in itself the objects of all
                    the most celebrated institutions of the kind, whether at home or abroad.</p>
                <p part="N">Several institutions for similar objects have been formed on the
                    Continent. The asylum for the deaf and dumb at Paris, which was under the
                    management of the late Abbé Sicard, has for its object not only to enable the
                    pupils to communicate their ideas and to form their understanding, but also to
                    qualify them to earn their subsistence. On quitting the asylum, they are all
                    capable of following a trade or profession. Their apprenticeship begins on their
                    first entering the institution, and is terminated with their instruction. This
                    apprenticeship takes place under the inspection of ten masters, viz. a printer,
                    an engraver of precious stones, a copperplate engraver, a drawing-master, a
                    turner, a mosaic artist, a tailor, a shoemaker, a cabinetmaker, and a gardener.
                    All these masters reside in the asylum, and receive their board and a salary.
                    The public exercises, which were given once or twice a month, were meant to
                    excite emulation among the pupils, to make the establishment known, to collect
                    observations, to inculcate the Abbé Sicard ’ s principles of the art of
                    teaching, and to illustrate their success by exhibiting experimental proofs of
                    the intelligence and knowledge of his pupils.</p>
                <p part="N">Institutions formed more or less upon the model of that at Paris have
                    been established in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Baden, Wurtemberg,
                    Bavaria, Austria, Prussia, Saxony, Hesse-Cassel, Nassau, Hanover, Brunswick, the
                    Free Towns of Germany, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Poland, the
                    United States of America, Canada, Mexico, and Bengal, to say nothing of those in
                    Great Britain and France. But, in general, no attempt is made to teach the
                    pupils to speak. The following table shows the absolute number of the deaf and
                    dumb in each country, and that of those who receive the benefit of education,
                    compared both with the absolute number and with that of those who remain in
                    private :—</p>

                <p part="N">Diderot alludes to the possibility of a child being born at once deaf
                    and blind, a possibility which has also been anticipated by the Abbé Sicard, in
                    the preliminary discourse to his <hi rend="italic">Cours d'Instruction,</hi>
                    where he suggests different methods of instruction that might be attempted in
                    circumstances so apparently hopeless. The first instance in which this
                    deplorable combination of defects is recorded to have occurred in any
                    individual, is mentioned by Dr Watson, in a quotation from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gentleman s Magazine</hi> for November 1808. He also adds another example
                    in the person of James Mitchell, whose history has excited so much interest, and
                    has been narrated by the masterly pen of Aĩr Ĳugald Stewart, in a memoir
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of
                        Edinburgh</hi> (vol. vii. p. 70), and also in the appendix to the last

                    has also given us some valuable and interesting particulars of his case, in a
