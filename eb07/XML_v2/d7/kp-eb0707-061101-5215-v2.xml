                        History,</hi> are certain noxious exhalations issuing from some parts of the
                    earth, and which prove almost instantly fatal to those who breathe them.</p>
                <p part="N">These damps are chiefly observed in mines and coalpits, though vapours
                    of the same kind often issue from old lavas of burning mountains; and, in those
                    countries where volcanoes are common, it is said that they fill the houses, and
                    destroy people suddenly without the least warning of their approach. In mines
                    and coal-pits they are chiefly of two kinds, called by the miners and colliers
                    the <hi rend="italic">choke fire-damps</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and both go
                    under one general name of <hi rend="italic">foul air.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                        >choke-damps,</hi> known in modern chemistry by the name of fixed air, or
                    carbonic acid gas, usually infest those places which have been formerly worked,
                    but long neglected, and are called by the miners <hi rend="italic">wastes.</hi>
                    No place, however, can be reckoned safe from this kind of damps, except where
                    there is a due circulation of air; and the procuring of this is the only proper
                    means of preventing accidents from damps of all kinds. The choke-damp suffocates
                    the miners suddenly, with all the appearances found in those that are suffocated
                    by fixed air. Being heavy, it descends towards the lowest parts of the workings,
                    and thus is dangerous to the miners, who can scarcely avoid breathing it. The
                        <hi rend="italic">fire-damp,</hi> which is inflammable air, or hydrogen gas,
                    rises to the roof of the workings, as being specifically lighter than the common
                    atmosphere; and hence, though it will suffocate as well as the other, it seldom
                    proves so dangerous in this way as by its inflammable property, by which it
                    often takes fire at the candles, and explodes with extreme violence.</p>
                <p part="N">In the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> (No. 119),
                    there is an account of some explosions by damps of this kind, on which the
                    following observations have been made. First, Those who are in the place where
                    the vapour is fired suddenly find themselves surrounded with flames, but hear
                    little or no noise; though those who are in places adjacent, or above ground,
                    hear a very great one. Secondly, Those who are surrounded by the inflamed vapour
                    feel themselves scorched or burnt, but are not moved out of their places, though
                    such as. unhappily stand in the way of it are commonly killed by the violence of
                    the shock, and often thrown with great force out at the mouth of the pit; nor
                    are the heaviest machines found able to resist the impetuosity of the blast.
                    Thirdly, No smcll is perceived before the fire, but a very strong one of
                    brimstone is afterwards perceptible. Fourthly, The vapour lies towards the roof,
                    and is not perceived if the candles are held low; but when these are held
                    higher, the damp descends like a black mist, and catches hold of the flame,
                    lengthening it to two or three handfuls; and this appearance ceases when the
                    candles are held nearer the ground. Fifthly, The flame continues in the vault
                    for several minutes after the crack. Sixthly, Its colour is blue, something
                    inclining to green, and very bright. Seventhly, On the explosion of the vapour,
                    a dark smoke like that proceeding from fired gunpowder is perceived. Eighthly,
                    Damps are generally observed to come about the latter end of May, and to
                    continue during the heat of summer. They return several times during the summer
                    season, but observe no certain rule.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides these kinds of damps, which are very common, we find others
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactioĩis,</hi> concerning
                    the nature of which we can say nothing. Indeed the account seems somewhat
                    suspicious. They are given by Mr Jessop, from whom we have the foregoing
                    observations concerning the fire-damp, and who had these from the miners in
                    Derbyshire. After describing the common damp, which consists of fixed air, “They
                    call the second sort,” says he, “the <hi rend="italic">peas-bloorn damp,</hi>
                    because, as they say, it smells like peas-bloom. They tell me it always comes in
                    the summer time; and those grooves are not free which are never troubled with
                    any other sort of damps. I never heard that it was mortal, the scent, perhaps,
                    freeing them from the danger of a surprise; but by reason of it many good
                    grooves lie idle at the best and most profitable time of the year, when the
                    subterraneous waters are the lowest. They fancy it proceeds from the multitude
                    of red-trefoil flowers, by them called <hi rend="italic">honeysuckles,</hi> with
                    which the limestone meadows in the Peake do much abound. The third is the
                    strangest and most pestilential of any, if all be true w hich is said concerning
                    it. Those who pretend to have seen it, for it is visible, describe it thus: In
                    the highest part of the roof of those passages which branch out from the main
                    groove, they often see a round thing hanging, about the bigness of a foot-ball,
                    covered with a skin of the thickness and colour of a cobweb. This, they say, if
                    it is broke by any accident, as the splinter of a stone, or the like, disperseth
                    itself immediately, and suffocates all the company. Therefore, to prevent
                    casualties, as soon as they have espied it, they have a way, by the help of a
                    stick and long rope, of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755228?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0707-5228-0612"/>breaking it at a distance; which done, they
                    purify the place well with fire before they dare enter it again. I dare not
                    avouch the truth of this story in all its circumstances, because the proof of it
                    seems impossible, since they say it kills all that are likely to bear witness to
                    the particulars: neither do I deny but such a thing may have been seen hanging
                    on the roof, since I have heard many affirm it.” (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
