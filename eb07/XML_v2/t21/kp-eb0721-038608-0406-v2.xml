                <p part="N"><label type="entry">TRINIDAD</label>, the largest of the windward West
                    India Islands, is separated from the province of Venezuela by the Gulf of Paria,
                    and at one point is not more than twenty miles from the American continent. It
                    is situated between 10° and 11° north latitude, and 61° and 62° west longitude.
                    The island is nearly square, being generally about fifty miles long by thirty
                    broad; but from the furthest point (Hicacos) on the south-west to the furthest
                    point on the north-west (Point Galera), it reaches to above ninety miles, and
                    contains an area of 2020 square miles. lt was discovered by Columbus on the 31st
                    July 1498, and taken possession of by the Spaniards in 1588. Sir Walter Raleigh
                    visited it in 1595, and committed some outrages in the capital. In 1797 it was
                    captured by Sir Ralph Abercromby, and has remained a British settlement ever
                    since. The richness of its soil, the luxuriance of its vegetation, its finely
                    wooded hills, beautiful rivers, and magnificent landscapes, have distinguished
                    Trinidad as the <hi rend="italic">Indian Paradise.</hi> This island is evidently
                    a section of the opposite continent, disjoined either by a volcanic or oceanic
                    eruption. The same strata of earth, the same rocks and fossils, are common to
                    both. Besides several craters and volcanoes in the island, there are two
                    submarine volcanoes, one south of Cape de la Brea, and the other in the Bay of
                    Meyaro. But the most remarkable phenomenon in the island is the asphaltum or
                    pitch lake, situated on a small peninsula, and occupying the highest part of the
                    point of land. It is nearly circular, and more than a mile and a half in length.
                    It is remarkable for the extraordinary mutability of its surface; the small
                    islet of the evening being often found a gulf in the morning, and this again is
                    succeeded by another islet, adorned with the most luxuriant vegetation. The
                    usual appearance and consistence of the asphaltum is that of pit-coal, but of a
                    grayish colour, melting like sealing-wax, and in hot weather it is actually
                    liquid an inch deep. It is rendered ductile by a gentle heat, and when mixed
                    with grease or pitch, acquires fluidity. The highest mountain-range is on the
                    north, near the coast, some parts of which reach an elevation of nearly 3000
                    feet. There are also chains of hills, but of <pb break="no"

                    />less elevation, in the centre and on the south coast. They all run from east
                    to west. The island has the advantage of numerous streams, some of them
                    navigable by small vessels. The exports amounted in 1832 to L.235,657, of which
                    L.220,168 was for sugar and molasses. The imports for the same period amounted
                    to L.229,697. Port of Spain, the capital, contains a population of 9869, of whom
                    1489 are whites. The population of the island in 1832 consisted of, whites,
                    3683; free blacks, 16,302; slaves, 20,265; total, 46,250. In the island there
                    are eight free schools with 373 scholars, and twenty-two private schools with
                    412 scholars.</p>
