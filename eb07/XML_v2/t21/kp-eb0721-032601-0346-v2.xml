                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Tonnage</hi> has long been an official term,
                    intended originally to express the burthen that a ship would carry, in order
                    that the various dues and customs which are levied upon shipping might be levied
                    according to the size of the vessel, or rather in proportion to her capability
                    of carrying a burthen. It has hence arisen that the term: “tonnage,” as applied
                    to a ship, has become almost synonymous with that of size. It is indeed the only
                    term that is used to give an idea of the magnitude of merchant-ships, which are
                    invariably spoken of according to their tonnage, or as being ships of 50, of
                    500, or of 1000 tons. Not only are all dues and customs levied according to the
                    tonnage, but ships are also built, and bought, and sold, for a price per ton of
                    their admeasurement; and by the conditions of Lloyd’s classification-list of
                    shipping, they must be timbered and fastened, and must have their anchors,
                    cables, and boats, all in proportion to the same datum. Tonnage, therefore, in
                    so far as these considerations are involved, is virtually assumed to be a
                    correct representation of the size of a ship.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to levy the dues on shipping, it was necessary to establish
                    some one method to be in general use for calculating this tonnage; and
                    consequently there has long been a rule, enforced by law, for the measurement of
                    the tonnage of ships or vessels, and much mischief has arisen to the mercantile
                    shipping of Great Britain through the erroneous principles which have been
                    adopted at various times in forming these rules.</p>
                <p part="N">It is evident that tonnage may express several results of measurements,
                    and in each case may be a sufficiently fair criterion of the burthen of a
                    merchant-vessel, by which to levy the dues; because all that is required thus
                    far, either on the part of the government or of private interests, or on that of
                    the owner, is, that the dues should be levied in equal proportions on all
                    vessels. Thus tonnage may be the product of a scries of measurements, intended
                    to express either the exact size, or an approximation to the exact size, of the
                    ship. It may be the actual displacement or weight of the ship, either with or
                    without cargo; it may be the displacement of the cargo, or the dead-weight which
                    she will carry to a fixed draught of water; or it may be the capacity of the
                    space which she has for the stowage of cargo. Yet to each of these there are
                    most important practical objections. the first, or that by which the measured
                    bulk of the ship would be the tonnage, might be easily evaded, and would lead to
                    injurious results; because, as there must necessarily be fixed measuring places,
                    such a law would have the effect of restricting the form of vessels to that one
                    shape which would carry the largest cargo under the least possible measurements
                    at these places. If the actual displacement, either load or light, of a vessel,
                    were to be her tonnage, it would be subject to the inconvenience that it could
                    only be calculated correctly from the drawing of the ship, and therefore would
                    be inapplicable to foreign ships arriving in our ports. An exact account of the
                    draught of water, either load or light, would also be necessary; which, as being
                    a variable quantity when the load draught is involved, and one of great
                    difficulty to be determined when the light draught is required, would present
                    almost insuperable objections; and, besides, the draught of waiter is a quantity
                    easily concealed or falsified for fraudulent purposes. Above all objections,
                    however, may be reckoned this, that if either the load or the light displacement
                    were taken to represent the tonnage, it would be the interest of the ship-owner
                    to build large vessels with slight scantling and inadequate fastening, that the
                    weight of the vessel might be small in proportion to that of the cargo. If. the
                    tonnage were to express the difference between the two displacements, that is,
                    the excess of the load displacement over the light, or the dead-weight of the
                    lading, although this would be by far the most correct in principle,—in fact,
                    although it be even mathematically correct,—there is the objection against it,
                    that it involves a knowledge of both light and load draughts of water, and is
                    therefore on this account, practically at least, as objectionable as the whole
                    displacement. Lastly, if the tonnage were to be the space or capacity for the
                    stowage of cargo, numerous openings would be afforded for fraudulent evasion;
                    because the manner of measuring the ship for this space must be defined, and it
                    is easy to build space which will not come within the limits of the defined
                    measurements; or it is easy to build a vessel of such a form that the
                    measurements made at the given measuring places shall not give a correct account
                    of her capacity.</p>
                <p part="N">Until January 1836, the rule for computing the tonnage of ships was as
                    follows. the length was taken on a straight line along the rabbet of the keel of
                    the ship, from the back of the main stern-post to a perpendicular line from the
                    fore part of the main stem under the bowsprit. The breadth was taken from the
                    outside of the outside plank in the broadest part of the ship, cither above or
                    below the main wales, exclusivcly of all manner of doubling planks that might be
                    wrought upon the sides of the ship. If tl&gt;e ship to be measured was afloat, a
                    plumb-line was dropped over the stern, and the distance between such line and
                    the after part of the stern-post, at the load water-mark, was measured; then was
                    taken the length from the top of this plumb-line, in a direction parallel with
                    the water, to a perpendicular immediately over the load water-mark, at the fore
                    part of the main stem. Subtracting from this length the before-mentioned
                    distance between the plumb-line and the after part of the stern-post, the
                    remainder was reckoned to be the ship’s extreme length, from which three inches
                    were deducted for every foot of the load draught of water. With the dimensions
                    thus obtained, the rule then was: “From the length taken in cither of the ways
                    above mentioned, subtract three fifths of the breadth taken as above; the
                    remainder is esteemed the just length of the keel to find the tonnage; then
                    multiply this length by the breadth, and that product by half the breadth, and
                    dividing by 94, the quotient is deemed the true contents of the tonnage.”</p>
                <p part="N">This rule is still in force for ships that were registered previously to
                    the passing of the new act. It is evident that the tonnage as determined by it
                    was intended to express the size or bulk of the ship, the half breadth being an
                    assumed equivalent for a mean depth. The evils which arose out of this
                    assumption were very great. As the depth was not at ail involved, it might be
                    increased to any extent without increasing the tonnage; while, on the contrary,
                    as the square of the breadth was involved, an undue preponderance was given to
                    this dimension, and it became necessary, on the part of ship-owners, to restrict
                    it within the least possible limits. The effect of such a law was obvious. The
                    British merchant-ships, in order to profit by its inconsistencies, were built
                    exceedingly narrow and deep in proportion to the length, so that, according to
                    parliamentary returns, we find, on an average, the mercantile navy would carry
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> d more weight
                    than its legally registered tonnage. In fact, the ships became little more than
                    oblong boxes, most dangerous as sea-boats, and, from their want of stability,
                    not capable of carrying sufficient sail to insure their safety on lee shores.
                    Hence, after every gale of wind, the leeward coasts were covered with their
                    wrecks; and hence Lloyd's books registered annually the average loss of six
                    ships in four days.</p>

                <p part="N">Out of this uncertainty of navigation arose a most heartless system of
                    gambling in maritime-insurance, the temptations of which were as destructive to
                    the mercantile honour and the morality of the nation, as the inefficiency of the
                    ships was destructive to its seamen. Luckily, this cause of reproach has ceased
                    since the enactment for calculating the tonnage of vessels, which has been in
                    force from January 1836; and numbers of ships are now built that very forcibly
                    prove how injuriously the old law must have operated in checking maritime and
                    commercial adventure. Not that we mean to say the present law is by any means
                    perfect, or that the rule for calculating the tonnage cannot be evaded, because
                    this is not the fact; it can be and is evaded, but the evasions are not so
                    destructive to the good qualities of ships as those which were commonly
                    practised during the continuance of the old law. It is doubtful whether, in a
                    nation whose existence depends upon her maritime superiority, ships should not
                    be exempted from all dues. These pages are not the place to inquire how it might
                    be possible to accomplish so desirable an exemption; or how compensating
                    revenues could by any means be awarded to the harbours, the docks, or the
                    lights, which are now maintained by a taxation levied upon the tonnage of
                    shipping. It does not, however, appear difficult to conceive that the same
                    revenue might be drawn from the freights which the ships carry, as the merchant
                    would receive it back from the ship-owner in the shape of a diminished
                    freightage.</p>
                <p part="N">It is exceedingly difficult, probably even impossible, to frame a rule
                    for computing the tonnage which shall be at once of practical application, and
                    yet not have in some degree the effect of restricting improvement in the
                    qualities of merchant-ships. It is difficult to induce a man to forego a
                    constant and positive gain for one that is only prospective and uncertain. We
                    have seen that the obstacles which oppose themselves to correctly and
                    satisfactorily determining either the light or the load draughts of water, are
                    sufficient to prevent the difference between the light and load displacements
                    from being taken to represent the tonnage. This is, however, the only correct
                    measure of a ship’s power to carry cargo; the difference being, of course,
                    exactly equal in weight to the cargo which either has or may cause it. All other
                    quantities which can be taken as measures of that power are little more than
                    assumptions, and whether they represent the external dimensions of a ship, or
                    her internal capacity, they scarcely give an approximation even to the power
                    which she may possess of carrying burthen; while, in either of the above cases,
                    the fact that these quantities must be determined by measurements at fixed
                    measuring places, affords opportunity for evasion, and indeed invites it. For
                    if, by any arrangement of the dimensions, or by any peculiarity of the shape, a
                    ship can be enabled to carry a greater burthen than her registered tonnage, the
                    freight of that greater burthen is a premium which is offered to that one
                    proportion between her dimensions, or that one peculiar form for her body, and a
                    restriction is, to a certain extent, placed upon improvement; because the
                    ship-owner will content himself with the best ships that he can obtain,
                    possessing the advantages of those dimensions or of that form.</p>
                <p part="N">The present rule for computing the tonnage assumes it to be the space
                    for stowage, and the internal capacity of the vessel is calculated in order to
                    determine it. As there are necessarily fixed measuring places, the rule may, as
                    we have said, be evaded by a certain build. Its phraseology may also be most
                    easily evaded by building accommodations on deck, which will not come within the
                    meaning of the terms that are used in it—“poop,” “half-deck,” or “break in the
                    deck.” Under its operation vessels may also be advantageously built of very
                    small register tonnage to carry cargoes of heavy goods; for which purpose they
                    should be of the lightest materials, but with very large scantlings, that the
                    internal capacity may bear but a small proportion to the load dis placement of
                    the vessel. We have already however stated, that in its effects the present rule
                    is far less injurious to the mercantile navy of England, than that which it is
                    intended eventually wholly to supersede.</p>

                    from the upper deck of the foremost and aftermost depths, and at two fifths and

                    the final product by three thousand five hundred, which will give the number of

                    displacement of the ship up to that horizontal section. Find in this manner the
                    load displacement, and also the displacement up to every horizontal section;
                    then draw a vertical line AB, and on A B, graduated to some scale of feet, set
                    off the distance AB equal to the mean load draught of water of the ship, and on
                    the same line AB let the points C, D, E, be taken respectively at the heights of
                    the other equidistant horizontal sections; then from A, C, D, E, draw A <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cc, Dd, Ee,</hi> so that E <hi
                        rend="italic">e</hi>, D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cc,</hi>
                    and A <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, shall respectively be in the same ratio to each
                    other in length as are the solid contents, or the displacements of the parts of
                    the body below the respective horizontal sections, to each other, in cubical
                    contents. Thus, if the solid content of the whole displacement be double the
                    solid content of the displacement up to the height C, then draw A <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> double the length of C <hi rend="italic">c</hi>; or if
                    it be only one third more, then let A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be one third
                    longer than C <hi rend="italic">c</hi>; and on the same principle with the other
                    lines. Then trace a curve through all the points <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, c,
                        <hi rend="italic">d, e,</hi> which curve will be the curve of displacements.
                    Then, if A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be graduated by projecting all the points c,
                        <hi rend="italic">d, e, &amp;c.</hi> on to it, the line A <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> will become a scale of displacement, or of tonnage.</p>
                <p part="N">The use of the scale is obvious, as, when the ship from which it was
                    formed is at any draught of water within the limits of the height BA, her
                    displacement at that draught may be immediately known by squaring a line out
                    from its height, set off from B on the scale BA, to intersect the curve B <hi
                        rend="italic">edca,</hi> and then squaring up this point of intersection to
                    the scale of tonnage An, which will be intersected at the number of tons in the
                    displacement required. The effect to be produced in the draught of water by
                    lightening or loading the ship to any extent embraced within the scale may also
                    be easily ascertained; and, in the same manner, the quantity of lading which a
                    ship will require to be put into or taken out of her to bring her to any certain
                    draught of water, may be immediately known. In fact, so useful are these scales
                    of tonnage that they ought to be calculated for every merchant-ship, and a scale
                    drawn and placed in the hands of the commander. It would enable him to answer at
                    once innumerable questions which are completely beyond his knowledge without it.
                    Mr Parsons, a member of the late School of Naval Architecture, proposed to the
                    committee from which the law for tonnage that is at present in force has ema
                    nated, that, for all new vessels built or launched after a certain date, such
                    scales of tonnage should be formed, which, when properly authenticated, should
                    be attached to the register of the vessel, in order that from these scales the
                    true tonnage or actual weight of the cargo might be ascertained, and either the
                    whole or any portion of it which the committee might have determined, be taken
                    as the register tonnage. There would have been many difficulties opposed to the
                    practical application of this plan, although we can by no means consider them as
                    insurmountable. Among these difficulties would have been the question as to what
                    is or what ought to be considered as the light draught of water; and also the
                    circumstance that many vessels are built from eye alone, of which, therefore,
                    there would have been no drawings to form the scales of tonnage. Mr Parsons has
                    traced the curves of tonnage for many classes of merchant-vessels, and for the
                    several rates of men-of-war, and has published them in a work called Scales of
                    Displacement. A somewhat similar work, as respects the men-of-war, and under the
                    same title, has also been published by Mr Edye, the assistant surveyor of her
                    majesty’s navy.</p>
                <p part="N">A very useful body of information on merchant-vessels resulted from the
                    labours of the committee on tonnage, that has been already so frequently
                    mentioned in this article. It is a valuable and extensive collection of
                    particulars as to the form, proportions, dimensions, and tonnage of the
                    mercantile navy of England. The measurements were all made, and the information
                    was collected and arranged, by Mr Cradock, a member of the late School of Naval
                    Architecture, who was, by the permission of the Lords Commissioners of the
                    Admiralty, employed under the directions of the committee. In order that such a
                    body of information may be more generally useful than it can possibly be while
                    confined to the pages of a parliamentary Report, we shall enrich this article
                    with it. The following accounts of the various methods of computing the tonnage,
                    which are in use among the maritime nations of Europe, were obtained by her
                    majesty’s government officially from the several powers, and are included in the
                    report of the committee.</p>

                    that of the height between decks, and considered as the depth. The extreme

                <p part="N">To find the area at each section, the half of the sum of the upper and

                    between these and the stem and stern·post. The former may be found, without any
                    considerable error, by multiplying the area of the foremost section by half its

                <p part="N">In this article we have described the method of constructing a scale of
                    Tonnage, or of Displacements. The manner of performing the calculations to
                    ascertain the displacement of a ship has been explained in the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Ship-building</hi>; it is therefore unnecessary to
                    recapitulate it here. Many persons, merely for want of sufficient attention to
                    such explanations are unable to perform these arithmetical calculations and
                    hence the frequent great errors in the displacements of ships. The following
                    experimental method of ascertaining, very nearly, the actual tonnage of a ship,
                    may not therefore be altogether useless. In fact, we suggest it with the
                    impression that it may be advantageously followed by merchant-builders.</p>

                    foot, then each cubic inch will represent eight cubic feet A cubic inch of
                    sea-water weighs ·594 of an ounce, that is, eight cubic feet of sea-water on a
                    half inch scale weigh ·594 of an ounce. Therefore each ton, reckoning 35 cubic
                    feet of sea-water to the ton, will weigh 2·5987 ounces, or 5 tons will very
                    nearly weigh 13 ounces, and will measure in bulk 21 <hi rend="superscript">

                    example, to be 45 tons. Let the model float on the water, having previously

                    suppose, when the model swims at the draught of water wished for the vessel,
                    that the water has risen an additional <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                    which she now swims.</p>
                <p part="N">An additional advantage may be gained by observing the weights used
                    according to the scale already mentioned, that is, 13 ounces to re-</p>

                    to bring her to the exact trim forward and aft that may be wished Suppose, for
                    instance, a steam-boat to carry a 35 horse power engine; place 91 ounces at the
                    centre of weight given by the engineers in the space allotted for the
                    engine-room; then apportion the other weights, as crew and effects, ship’s
                    stores, cargo, &amp;c. over the respective spaces alloted for their reception.
                    It will be seen whether the vessel, as formed, will bear them there, and swim at
                    the trim intended; if not, either the vessel, the weights, or the trim, must be
                    altered.</p>
                <p part="N">In consequence of the minuteness of the scale, and of the difficulty of
                    observing it on account of the attraction of cohesion of the water it would be
                    better, and very easy, to have an index or rather two, one forward and the other
                    abaft, moving on a fulcrum over the ed <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> e of the
                    box, and pointing to a graduated arc, which might, by lengthening the index-arm
                    of the lever, indicate to any degree of exactness or minuteness required. Of
                    course the inner arm of the lever would rise and fall with the model.</p>
                <p part="N">The foregoing remarks will only apply to a box of the exact dimensions
                    given, that is, one of which every <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
