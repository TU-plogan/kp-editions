                            rend="italic">of the Musical Scale</hi></label>. “In the modern system,
                    called <hi rend="italic">tempered,”</hi> says a German writer on music, “all the
                    intervals are not employed in their original perfection, as the nature of the
                    harmonic scale presents them, but lose, sometimes in this interval, sometimes in
                    that other, something of their acuteness or gravity. In fact, experience shows
                    that, in tuning the major and minor thirds, the fifths, and the fourths, in
                    their original perfection, when we reach a certain term, we meet with a fault of
                    too great excess or too great deficiency; and from this faultiness arises the
                    necessity of tempering this or that sound, in order to combine reciprocally the
                    intervals of one mode with those of another, the result of which is called <hi
                        rend="italic">temperament."</hi> The nature and the principle of
                    temperament, as applied to musical instruments of fixed sounds, may be
                    understood by perusing pp. 610, 611, of vol. xv., article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Music</hi>, and p. 533 of vol. xvi., article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Organ.</hi> We shall here content ourselves with giving a very few
                    additional remarks, and with indicating some works whence further information
                    may be derived, seeing that the subject of musical temperament is not of
                    sufficient importance to occupy much room in a work like this. The various
                    systems of temperament that have been proposed for such instruments as the
                    organ, the harpsichord, the piano-forte, &amp;c. offer only a choice in the
                    distribution of the imperfections of false intonation. The unequal temperament
                    is that usually adopted; but it must be observed, that tuners in general proceed
                    more by rule of routine and an indifferent ear, than according to any scientific
                    principle of temperament. Hence the great differences found among instruments
                    tuned by different tuners. It is a common error to suppose that “a person who
                    sings in tune, tempers without lmowing it.” Even Chladni, following the lead,
                    has asserted this; while the truth is, that there is <hi rend="italic">no
                        temperament</hi> in the voice of a singer whose intonation is perfect,
                    unless his voice and ear happen to be misguided by the accompaniment of a <hi
                        rend="italic">tempered</hi> instrument, that is, an instrument <hi
                        rend="italic">out of tune.</hi> When left to itself, the voice of such a
                    singer, in executing the most intricate modulations, forms the sounds in their
                    true ratios to the different tonics or key-notes that occur, and, in the
                    wonderful subtlety of the intonations of that only perfect musical instrument,
                    the human voice, possesses all the intonations that are necessary to form these
                    sounds exactly. Nearly the same thing occurs in the case of such a violin-player
                    as a Viotti or a Paganini when he plays alone, and undisturbed by the false
                    intonations of any accompanying instrument. This was actually proved in Paris
                    about thirty years ago, by the experiments made by M. Charles and the celebrated
                    violinist Viotti. We may here remark, that it <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=192" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0192-0174"
                    />is of great detriment to the just intonation of a singer, to learn to sing by
                    the guidance of an instrument such as the piano-forte, as is the common
                    practice; for a habit of malintonation is then inevitably acquired. The same
                    remark applies to singers taught with the accompaniment of those instruments
                    with fretted finger-boards, such as the guitar, of which the intonation is also
                    imperfect. As to the imperfections of the common guitar, the reader may consult
                    the lively and ingenious work entitled Instructions to my Daughter, for playing
                    on the Enharmonic Guitar, London, 1829. The celebrated singer Madame Mara used
                    to say that every singer ought to learn to play the violin, in order to acquire
                    a knowledge of just intonation. Certainly that instrument, and others of the
                    violin kind, are the only ones we have that are capable of the nearest approach
                    to perfect intonation, making allowances for the mechanical imperfections of
                    their strings, as we have already hinted in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Music</hi>. But still the human voice is the only perfect musical
                    instrument. It has been a prevalent opinion among musicians and writers upon
                    music, that the ancient Greeks were ignorant of many of our musical intervals,
                    and possessed no instruments capable of executing our modern musical scales. But
                    it is more than probable that the knowledge of the ratios of musical intervals,
                    and of perfect intonation in a variety of scales, was much more exact among the
                    ancient Indians, Arabians, and Greeks, than is generally supposed, or than the
                    scanty, imperfect, and corrupted Greek relics of works on music, and the very
                    limited examination of Indian and Arabian manuscripts, have hitherto been able
                    to show. The reader may consult, on the subject of musical temperament, the
                    following works. Among these, one of the best is Professor Robison’s, for
                    clearness, as well as useful suggestions. Chapter 13, <hi rend="italic">et
