                    Horne</hi></label>, an ingenious grammarian, and an active politician, born in
                    Westminster, June 1736, was the son of Mr John Horne, a poulterer living in
                    Newport Market. He was the third of seven children; but his father, having
                    acquired considerable affluence, first sent him for a short time to Westminster
                    school, and then to Eton, where he remained five or six years without
                    particularly distinguishing himself, and was removed sooner than had been
                    intended, on account of the accidental loss of an eye. In 1755 he went to St
                    John’s College, Cambridge, where he took the degree of A.B. He then became an
                    usher in a school at Blackheath, kept by Mr Jennings; but he was soon after
                    induced by his father to take deacon’s orders, and obtained a curacy in Kent.
                    His own preference, however, was so much in favour of the law, that in 1756 he
                    entered as a student of the Middle Temple; but in 1760 he was persuaded to
                    return to the church, and to receive ordination as a priest; and he officiated
                    for three years in the chapelry of New Brentford, which his father had purchased
                    for him; performing his duties with decency, and taking some pains to study the
                    elements of medicine for the sake of the poorer members of his congregation. He
                    then went as tutor to France with the son of Mr Elwes, a gentleman of Berkshire,
                    well known for bis riches and his economy.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1765, he commenced his political career by writing an anonymous
                    pamphlet in defence of Wilkes and his party. He returned to the continent, and
                    made the tour of Italy in company with a Mr Taylor; and at Paris he formed an
                    intimacy with Wilkes himself, who then found it convenient to reside there. He
                    had altogether laid aside his clerical character in these excursions, but he
                    resumed it tor a short time after his return. Soon, however, he relapsed<pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0355-0335"/> into his political amusements; exerting
                    himself, with some success, in various elections, as a partisan of his friend
                    Wilkes, and taking up the cause of a Mrs Bigby, in the pursuit of an appeal of
                    blood, against the murderers of her husband, who were supposed to have obtained
                    a pardon through corrupt interest with the court; though the widow at last
                    disappointed him by accepting a pecuniary compensation for her right of appeal.
                    He was however successful, on his own behalf, in repelling a prosecution for a
                    libel on Mr Onslow; and he gained some credit with a party in the city by
                    suggesting to Beckford, then lord mayor of London, the reply which he made to
                    the king’s answer to their remonstrance, and which may still be seen engraved on
                    the pedestal of Beckford’s statue in Guildhall. He was soon after very active in
                    establishing the society for supporting the bill of rights, and in obtaining the
                    liberation of Bingley, the printer, who had been somewhat hastily committed to
                    prison by Lord Mansfield.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1770, he had reason to be dissatisfied with the conduct of
                    Wilkes, in some pecuniary transactions relating to the society for the bill of
                    rights. Both parties appeared to the public in a light somewhat ridiculous on
                    the occasion, and neither of them gained in respectability, though the society
                    did not appear to value Wilkes the less for the exposures that took place. It
                    was, however, shortly after dissolved, and most of its members, except the
                    particular friends of Wilkes, were incorporated into the constitutional society.
                    The next year, Mr Tooke completed his academical course at Cambridge, by taking
                    the degree of A. M., though not without some opposition. About this time he
                    exerted himself greatly in procuring the publication of the debates of the House
                    of Commons in the daily papers, notwithstanding the well-known standing orders
                    of the house; and so far as he was instrumental in carrying this point, he
                    appears to have rendered at least one very essential service to his country; but
                    Wilkes, and especially Almon, the bookseller, are said to have a still stronger
                    claim to the merit of this transaction, whatever may have been its character. He
                    had also a sharp contest with the anonymous Junius, against whose hasty attack
                    he defended himself with great spirit and energy, and with unexampled success.
                    In 1773 he made a formal resignation of his living, and meant at the same time
                    completely to lay aside his clerical character, though no person seems to have
                    felt himself authorized to accept this part of his resignation; and he began to
                    study the law very diligently, intending to make it the occupation of his life.
                    He adopted soon after a singular method of forcing himself upon the notice of
                    the public, and of the House of Commons in particular: an enclosure bill being
                    about to be hurried, as was reported, a little too rapidly through the house, he
                    wrote some paragraphs in a newspaper, which reflected very severely on the
                    conduct of the Speaker, on purpose that he might be summoned to appear before
                    the house; and being placed at the bar, he gave such reasons for his conduct as
                    produced some animated discussions, and in the end was supposed, though probably
                    without foundation, to have caused the bill to be modified in some oppressive
                    clauses. By these means he obtained the favour of Mr Tooke of Purley, who
                    thought himself aggrieved by the bill in its original state, and received from
                    him such assurances of testamentary favours as induced his nephew, Colonel
                    Harwood, to agree upon a partition of their joint interest in the reversion of
                    his estate; though Mr Horne never received, first and last, more than L.8000
                    from the property, notwithstanding the subsequent change of his name about the
                    year 1782, in acknowledgment of his patron’s kindness, and his long-continued
                    intimacy and frequent residence at Purley; the principal legatee, after all,
                    being a Mr Beaseley.</p>
                <p part="N">Mr Home Tooke was, of course, a strenuous opposer of the American war;
                    and in 1777, he published a very offensive advertisement, in which the sufferers
                    in the battle of Lexington were described as having been murdered by the king’s
                    troops. For this attack on the government, he was tried at Guildhall in July
                    1777. He conducted his own defence, but was found guilty of the libel, and
                    scn-tenced to one year’s imprisonment in the King’s Bench, and a fine of L.200.
                    It was on this occasion that he first appeared before the public as a
                    grammarian, in the criticisms which constitute his celebrated “Letter to Mr
                    Dunning.” The next year he suffered a still severer punishment, in the refusal
                    of the society of the Inner Temple to admit him to the bar, on account of his
                    having taken orders; so that his prospects of professional advancement were
                    utterly annihilated. This occurrence made him still more bitter against the
                    existing government, and in 1780 he printed some severe remarks upon the
                    measures of Lord North. He attempted to establish himself as a practical farmer
                    in Huntingdonshire; but he caught an ague, and soon becoming disgusted with an
                    agricultural life, he returned to London, and occupied for some years a house
                    near Soho Square. His ideas of parliamentary reform, contained in a second
                    letter addressed to Mr Dunning, were by no means extravagant, and he continued
                    to adhere, in this respect, rather to the party of Mr Pitt than to that of Mr
                    Fox.</p>
                <p part="N">The publication of his grammatical dissertations, under the title of the
                    Diversions of Purley, afforded but a slight and imperfect intermission of his
                    political pursuits, for his etymological works are as replete with the politics
                    of the day as his speeches and his pamphlets. Another of his pamphlets appeared
                    in 1788, under the title of Two Pair of Portraits, being intended to serve the
                    cause of Pitt’s party in their elections. But in 1790 be himself became a
                    candidate for the representation of Westminster, in opposition to Mr Fox and to
                    Lord Hood; and he distinguished himself sufficiently as a public orator, though
                    he was not succcessful in the contest.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1794, he was tried for high treason, together with several other
                    members of the corresponding societies, who had been active in attempting to
                    introduce some imitations of the French Revolution in the plans of reform which
                    they brought forward. He exhibited on the trial somewhat more of firmness than
                    of good taste. One of his associates had before been acquitted, and the jury
                    speedily returned a similar verdict with respect to himself. He afterwards
                    dedicated the second volume of his Diversions of Purley to his counsel, Gibbs
                    and Erskine, and to the jury who tried him.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1796 he again became a candidate for the representation of
                    Westminster, but again without success; and, notwithstanding his strong opinions
                    respecting a reform in parliament, he afterwards condescended to accept from
                    Lord Camelford, in 1801, a seat for the nominal borough of Old Sarum. It was
                    then to be determined if a clergyman could sit in the House of Commons; but the
                    ministry, instead of contesting the point with respect to his particular case,
                    brought in a bill to decide the question in the negative for the future, and he
                    remained in the house till the dissolution of the parliament in the next year,
                    but without f&gt;articularly distinguishing himself in its proceedings. His ast
                    public effort as a party man was made in espousing for a short time the cause of
                    Mr Paull, as candidate for Westminster; but he abandoned this gentleman in a
                    subsequent contest. The later years of his life were chiefly passed in the
                    society of a select circle of friends, who frequently partook of his hospitality
                    at Wimbledon. He died in March 1812, leaving his property to some natural
                    daughters; for he had never been married. He was buried in Ealing church, and
                    not in his garden, as he had directed; his executors thinking themselves the
                    less bound by these <pb break="no"

                    to the sale of the property.</p>
                <p part="N">1. His earliest publication was a pamphlet entitled The Petition of an
                    Englishman, 1765. It consisted principally of apologies for the private conduct
                    and immoral writings of Wilkes.</p>
                <p part="N">2. He also published a Sermon while he continued in the church, that is,

                    is his great and celebrated work; rich indeed in etymology and in wit, but

                <p part="N">9. Many of his Letters have been printed in Stephens’s Life of
                    Tooke.</p>
                <p part="N">It is from the last-mentioned publication that this historical sketch of
                    Mr Tooke’s life has principally been extracted. It now becomes necessary to add
                    some remarks on his literary and moral qualifications; and in both these points
                    of view the subject has been treated in so masterly a manner by the author of an
                    article in the Quarterly Review, who is supposed to be a near relation of
                    Tooke’s most intimate friend, the late Colonel Bosville, that it would be
                    presumption in any man to go over the same ground, without adopting very nearly
                    the eloquent and energetic expressions which that noble and learned person has
                    employed.</p>
                <p part="N">“Mr Tooke,” says the accomplished reviewer of the Memoirs of his Life
                    (Q. R. vol. vii. p. 325), “was possessed of considerable learning, as indeed his
                    writings sufficiently show. To other more casual acquirements, he united a very
                    extensive acquaintance with the Gothic dialects, of which he has so copiously
                    and so judiciously availed himself in his etymological researches.” But it must
                    be remarked, that a person more intimately acquainted with the “Gothic dialects”
                    as living languages, will easily discover that his knowledge of them was in
                    truth but superficial, or that he was indebted for it more to grammars and
                    dictionaries, than to any extensive study of the authors who had written in
                    those languages, or to any habit of speaking them; and such a person will easily
                    find a variety of instances, in which a very different etymon to that which he
                    has assigned, will naturally suggest itself as the true origin of the word in
                    question.</p>
                <p part="N">(P. 320.) “Though Mr Tooke’s philosophical works are the results of no
                    common talent and industry, yet they are neither written in a truly
                    philosophical spirit, nor do they display traces of a mind which, even if it had
                    been wholly dedicated to the study of metaphysics, would have much enlarged the
                    bounds of our knowledge in that nice and intricate branch of science. His object
                    seems to have been rather to retard than to advance the progress of philosophy,
                    by recalling us from those sound conclusions as to the nature and operations of
                    the human mind, which are built upon observation and experience, to vague
                    speculations, drawn from the imperfect analogy existing between the moral and
                    the physical world. There can be no doubt that the proposition which he has
                    succeeded in establishing is highly interesting and important; and that in the
                    illustration of it he has shown great learning, ingenuity, and research. But
                    tl&gt;en, on the other hand, he has so monstrously exaggerated its importance,
                    and so widely mistaken its tendency, and has attempted to raise so vast a
                    superstructure upon such a narrow, slippery, and inadequate foundation, that we
                    are quite lost in amazement when we recollect how completely the sagacity which
                    guided him so well in the investigation of his principal fact, appears to desert
                    him when he comes to apply that fact to the purposes of a theory. The distance
                    between what he has proved and what he wishes us to believe that he has proved,
                    is enormous. What he has proved is, that all words, even those that are
                    expressive of the nicest operations of our minds, were originally borrowed from
                    the objects of external perception; a circumstance highly curious in the history
                    of language, consequently in the history of the human mind itself, and the
                    complete demonstration of which, of course, reflects great credit upon its
                    author. What he thinks he has proved is, that this etymological history of words
                    is our true guide, both as to the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> import of the
                    words themselves, and as to the nature of those things which they are intended
                    to signify; a proposition so monstrous that he has nowhere ventured to enunciate
                    it in its general form, but has rather left it to be collected from the tenor of
                    his remarks upon particular instances. In truth, the inferences at which Mr
                    Tooke arrived, far from being warranted by his facts, are directly the contrary
                    of those to which he ought naturally to have been led by the result of his own
                    studies, when they were most successful. In tracing upwards, through all the
                    mazes of etymology, the origin of words, he ought to have seen more clearly, if
                    possible, than any body else, that their <hi rend="italic">real present</hi>
                    sense is not to be sought for in their primitive signification, or in the
                    elements of which they were originally composed, but that, on the contrary,
                    their <hi rend="italic">actual import,</hi> with which alone in reasoning we
                    have to do, hardly ever corresponds with their etymological meaning, although
                    the one always bears to the other a certain resemblance, more or less accurate,
                    according to the greater or less effect of time and accident. One could without
                    difficulty understand how a person, unaccustomed to such considerations, and
                    misled by a few instances partially chosen, should adopt a theory like that
                    which Mr Tooke was desirous to establish; but how a philosopher, minutely
                    acquainted with the whole subject, and proceeding upon a most copious induction
                    of particulars, should not have perceived that, in ninety-nine instances out of
                    a hundred, such a doctrine would lead to absolute absurdity, is, to us at least,
                    inconceivable.”</p>
                <p part="N">The reviewer then follows Mr Dugald Stewart in some very just
                    criticisms, which this distinguished philosopher had already made on several of
                    Mr Tooke’s examples, fully proving the complete fallacy of the system which so
                    completely confounds the definition of a term with its etymology. Mr Tooke has
                    indeed the merit of having demonstrated pretty clearly that all the parts of
                    speech, including those which grammarians had often considered as expletives and
                    unmeaning particles, may be resolved more or less completely into nouns and
                    verbs; but, on the one hand, it has been observed, that the very same doctrine
                    may be clearly traced back to the works of Aristotle; and, on the other, it may
                    be asserted with equal truth, if we wish to carry the theory to its utmost
                    extent, that language consists only of nouns and <hi rend="italic">one
                        verb;</hi> since all verbs may in fact be resolved into participles or
                    adjectives, compounded with auxiliary verbs, as well as those which exhibit this
                    complication in their exterior form.</p>
                <p part="N">“In the ordinary intercourse of life, Mr Tooke was kind, friendly, and
                    hospitable.” (P. 325.) We doubt whether <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=357" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0357-0337"
                    />his temper was naturally good; but if it was not, he had a merit the more; for
                    he had so completely subdued it by care and self-control, as never to betray,
                    under any provocation, the slightest mark of that irritability which often
                    accompanies talent, and which gains so rapidly upon those who know not how to
                    guard against its approaches. Indeed the aspect under which he appeared in
                    private was by no means such as the stern cynicism and ferocious turbulence of
                    his public conduct would have led one to expect; and those whose opinion of him
                    has been formed exclusively upon his political character and his writings, will
                    have some difficulty in believing that the curate of Brentford was one of the
                    best bred gentlemen of that age. In this respect he was a sort of phenomenon. He
                    was born in a low station; at no period did he appear to have possessed any
                    remarkable advantages for the study of good breeding; on the contrary, the
                    greater part of his life was spent in constant intercourse with coarse, vulgar,
                    and uneducated men; yet his natural taste was so good, and he had profited so
                    judiciously by whatever opportunities he enjoyed, that courts and high stations
                    have seldom produced a better example of polite and elegant behaviour, than was
                    exhibited by the associate of Messrs Hardy and Thelwall. Indeed his manner had
                    almost every excellence that manner can display; grace, vivacity, frankness,
                    dignity. Perhaps, indeed, in its outward forms, and in that which is purely
                    conventional, his courtesy wore the air of the <hi rend="italic">vieille
                        cour,</hi> and was rather more elaborate than is consistent with the
                    practice of this lounging unceremonious age; but it was never forced or
                    constrained, and it sat not ungracefully upon an old man.” It may however
                    deserve to be remarked, in contemplating this paradox, though rather as a
                    collateral coincidence than as a satisfactory explanation, that even from his
                    infancy Tooke had actually seen something of the very highest society, having
                    been admitted once or twice a week at Leicester House as a play-fellow to George
                    the Third; and though he may have learned but little from imitation of the
                    manners of the young prince, yet the early habit of self restraint imposed by
                    such a presence, may easily have imprinted some courtly traces on his character,
                    which were not easily effaced, and which an association with the heirs of the
                    first families of the kingdom, throughout his boyhood, at Westminster and at
                    Eton, must naturally have made still more distinct and permanent.</p>
                <p part="N">“He never appeared to greater advantage than in conversation. He
                    possessed an inexhaustible fund of anecdotes, which he introduced with great
                    skill, and related with neatness, grace, rapidity, and pleasantry: he had a
                    quick sense of the ridiculous, and was a great master of the whole art of
                    raillery, a dangerous talent, though the exercise of it in his hands was always
                    tempered by politeness and good humour.”</p>
                <p part="N">“In spite of labour and dissipation (p. 328), his life was protracted to
                    a period which indicated an originally sound and vigorous frame. For the last
                    twenty years, however, he was subject to several severe, distressing, and
                    incurable infirmities. These he bore with a patience and firmness which it was
                    impossible not to admire: to the very last he never suffered himself to be
                    beaten down by them, nor ever for one moment indulged in complaint, or gave way
                    to despondency. In the intervals of pain, nay, even when actually suffering
                    under it, he preserved a self-command, which enabled him to converse, not only
                    with spirit and vigour, but with all his accustomed cheerfulness and pleasantry;
                    never making any demand upon the sympathy of his friends, or mentioning his own
                    situation at all, except when occasionally, and by a very pardonable exercise of
                    his sophistry, he amused himself in exalting its comforts, and explaining away
                    its disadvantages; displaying, in this respect, a manly spirit and a practical
                    philosophy, which, if they had been brought tn bear upon his moral as well as
                    upon his physical condition, if they had been employed with as much effect in
                    reconciling him to his political exclusion as to his bodily sufferings, might
                    have produced, not the very imperfect character we have been attempting to
                    delineate, in which the unfavourable traits bear so large a proportion to those
                    of a nobler and more benign cast, but the venerable portrait of a truly wise and
                    virtuous man.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
