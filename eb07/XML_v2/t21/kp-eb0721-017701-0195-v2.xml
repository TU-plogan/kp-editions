                            >Templum</hi></label>, a public building erected in honour of some
                    deity, either true or false; and in which the people meet for the purpose of
                    religious worship. The word is formed from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                        >templum,</hi> which some derive from the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                        >τέμενος</hi>, signifying the same thing. The word <hi rend="italic"
                        >templum,</hi> in its primary sense among the old Romans, signified nothing
                    more than a place set apart and consecrated by the augurs, whether enclosed or
                    open, in the city or in the fields. Clemens Alexandrinus and Eusebius refer the
                    origin of temples to the sepulchres built for the dead. This notion has been
                    illustrated and confirmed by a variety of testimonies by Mr Farmer in his
                    Treatise on the Worship of Human Spirits, p. 373, &amp;c. Herodotus and Strabo
                    represent the Egyptians as the first who built temples to the gods. The first
                    erected in Greece is ascribed to Deucalion, by Apollonius, Argonaut, lib. iii.
                    Some ancient people performed their sacrifices in all places indifferently, from
                    a persuasion that the whole world is the temple of God, and that he required no
                    other. This was the doctrine of the magi, followed by the Persians, the
                    Scythians, the Numidians, and many other nations mentioned by Herodotus, lib.
                    i., Strabo, lib. xv,, and Cicero in his second oration against Verres. The
                    Persians, who worshipped the sun, believed it would wrong his power to enclose
                    him within the <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=196"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0196-0178"/>walls of a temple, who had the whole world for
                    his habitation; and hence, when Xerxes ravaged Greece, the magi exhorted him to
                    destroy all the temples he met with. The Sicyonians would build no temple to
                    their goddess Coronis; nor the Athenians, for the like reason, erect any statue
                    to Clemency, who, they said, was to live in the hearts of men, not within stone
                    walls. The Bithynians had no temples but the mountains; nor had the ancient
                    Germans any other but the woods. Even some philosophers have blamed the use and
                    building of temples, particularly Diogenes, Zeno, and his followers the Stoics.
                    But it may be said, that if God has no need of temples, men have need of places
                    to meet in for the public offices of religion; and accordingly temples may be
                    traced back even into the remotest antiquity. See Hospinian <hi rend="italic">De
                        Origine Templorum.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The Romans had several kinds of temples. Those built by the kings,
                    &amp;c. consecrated by the augurs, and in which the exercise of religion was
                    regularly performed, were called, by way of eminence, <hi rend="italic"
                        >templa.</hi> Those that were not consecrated were called <hi rend="italic"
                        >(aedes.</hi> The little temples that were covered or roofed they called <hi
                        rend="italic">(ediculae;</hi> those open, <hi rend="italic">sacella.</hi>
                    Some other edifices, consecrated to particular mysteries of religion, they
                    called <hi rend="italic">fana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">delubra.</hi> All these
                    kinds of temples, Vitruvius tells us, had other particular denominations,
                    according to the form and manner of their construction. The Romans indeed
                    surpassed all nations with regard to temples: they not only built temples to
                    their gods, to their virtues, to their diseases, &amp;c., but also to their
                    emperors, and that in their life-time. These particulars are sufficiently
                    ascertained from medals, inscriptions, and other monuments. Horace compliments
                    Augustus, and sets him above Hercules and all the heroes of table; because those
                    were only admitted into temples after their death, whereas Augustus had his
                    temples and altars while living. Epist ad Aug.</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">Praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores,</l>
                    <l part="N">Jurandasque tuum per nomen ponimus aras.</l>
                </lg>
                <p part="N">Suetonius gives an instance of the modesty of that emperor, who would
                    allow of no <hi rend="italic">temples</hi> being erected to him in the city; and
                    who, even in the provinces, where he knew it was usual to raise temples to the
                    very proconsuls, refused any but those erected in the name of Rome as well as
                    his own. The most celebrated temples among the Romans were the Capitol and
                    Pantheon. The temple of Saturn served for the public treasury.</p>
                <p part="N">The temple at Jerusalem was similar in its plan to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tabernacle.</hi> The first temple was begun by Solomon about the year of
                    the world 2992, and before Christ 1012 according to some chronologers, and
                    finished in eight years. Great mistakes have been committed respecting the
                    dimensions of this temple, by confounding the emblematical description of
                    Ezekiel with the plain account of it in the books of King and Chronicles. It
                    consisted of the holy of holies, the sanctuary, and a portico. The holy of
                    holies was a square room of twenty cubits; the sanctuary, or holy place, was
                    forty cubits long and twenty broad, consequently the length of both these
                    together was sixty cubits. The portico, which stood before the sanctuary, was
                    twenty cubits long and ten cubits broad. Whether the portico was separated by a
                    wall from the rest of the temple is not mentioned in Scripture. If it was, the
                    whole length of the temple, computing the cubit at twenty-two inches, did not
                    exceed 110 feet in length and thirty-six feet eight inches in breadth. In the
                    portico stood the two brazen pillars called <hi rend="italic">Jachin</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Boaz;</hi> which, upon comparing and reconciling the
                    seemingly different accounts in different places, appear to have been forty
                    cubits high, and about four cubits diameter. The court probably at first
                    extended all round the temple. We are informed that the court about the
                    tabernacle was 100 cubits long and fifty broad; and as Solomon made every part
                    of the temple about twice as large as the corresponding part in the tabernacle,
                    we have reason to conclude that the court around the temple was 200 cubits long
                    and 100 broad. According to this description, which is taken from the Scripture
                    history, the temple of Solomon was by no means so large as it is commonly
                    represented. Still, however, it was very magnificent in size and splendid in
                    ornament. It was plundered of its treasures in the reign of Rehoboam, and
                    repaired by Joash: it was again spoiled in the time of Ahaz and of Hezekiah; and
                    after being restored by Josiah, was demolished by Nebuchadnezzar in the year of
                    the world 3416, after it had stood 476 according to Josephus, and according to
                    Usher 428 years.</p>
                <p part="N">The second temple was built by the Jews, after their return from the
                    Babylonish captivity, under the direction and influence of Zerubbabel their
                    governor, and of Joshua the high priest, with the leave and encouragement of
                    Cyrus the Persian emperor, to whom Judea had now become a tributary kingdom.
                    According to the Jews, this temple was destitute of five remarkable appendages,
                    which were the chief glory of the first temple; the ark and mercy-seat, the
                    Shechinah, the holy fire on the altar, which had been first kindled from heaven,
                    the urim and thummim, and the spirit of prophecy. This temple was plundered and
                    profaned by Antiochus Epiphanes, who also caused the public worship in it to
                    cease. It was afterwards purified by Judas Maccabaeus, who restored the divine
                    worship; and after having stood 500 years, was rebuilt by Herod, with a
                    magnificence approaching to that of Solomon’s. Tacitus calls it “immensae
                    opulentiae templum and Josephus states that it was the most astonishing
                    structure he had ever seen, as well on account of its architecture as its
                    magnitude, and likewise the richness and magnificence of its various parts, and
                    the reputation of its sacred appurtenances. This temple, which Herod began to
                    build about sixteen years before the birth of Christ, and so far completed in
                    nine years and a half as to be fit for divine service, was at length destroyed
                    by the Romans on the same month and day of the month on which Solomon’s temple
                    was destroyed by the Babylonians.</p>
