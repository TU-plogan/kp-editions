                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ROMANO</label> Giulio, a famous painter of the Roman
                    school, was born at Rome in 1492. He was the favourite pupil of Raphael, who had
                    such an affection for him, that he appointed him, with John Francis Penni, his
                    heir. He first signalised himself by his Battle of Constantine, which he painted
                    from a design of Raphael’s, and which was particularly admired by Poussin.</p>
                <p part="N">When he had completed the hall of Constantine in the Vatican, from
                    Raphael’s designs, he went to Mantua, where the patronage of the Gonzaghi family
                    excited him to those great works, and those magnificent plans by which Mantua
                    and the palace Del T. have been so highly decorated. In the decorations of this
                    palace, Julio prepared the cartoons, and had the pictures executed by his
                    pupils; but he afterwards corrected and finished them. Modem pencils are said to
                    have covered the touches of Julio, especially in the Fable of Psyche, the
                    Allegories of Human Life, and the Giants Storming Heaven, where his composition
                    and design are alone seen. In the fresco paintings of the old palace or corte of
                    Mantua, which refer principally to the histories of the Trojan war, his peculiar
                    merits are better perceived.</p>
                <p part="N">Helen Asleep, Vulcan forging arms for Achilles, are considered
                    beautiful, and Minerva slaying Ajax is regarded as sublime.</p>
                <p part="N">The most remarkable of the altar pieces of our artist are the three
                    frescoes of St. Marco; and in the church of St. Christofero, the athletic figure
                    of that saint supporting the infant Jesus. His Martyrdom of St. Stephen on the
                    head altar of the church of St. Stephen at Genoa, is preferred to them all.</p>
                <p part="N">His conceptions were more extraordinary and more elevated than even
                    those of his master, but not so natural. He was wonderful in the choice of
                    attitudes; but did not perfectly understand the lights and shades, and is
                    frequently harsh and ungraceful. The folds ofhis draperies, says Du Fresnoy, are
                    neither beautiful nor great, easy nor natural, but all extravagant, like the
                    fantastical habits of comedians. He was, however, superior to most painters, by
                    his profound knowledge of antiquity; and, by conversing with the works ofthe
                    most excellent poets, particularly Homer, he made himself master of the
                    qualifications necessarily required in a great designer. Julio Romano was also
                    well skilled in architecture. He was employed by Cardinal de Medicis, who was
                    afterwards pope under the name of Clement VII.; he ultimately settled in Mantua,
                    whither he was invited by Frederick Gonzago, marquis of that city, in order to
                    avoid his being justly punished for having drawn at Rome the designs of twenty
                    obscene plates, engraved by Mark Anthony, to which Aretine added the same number
                    of sonnets. Julio Romano embellished the city of Mantua with many of his
                    performances, both in painting and architecture, and died in that city in 1546,
                    at 54 years of age.</p>
