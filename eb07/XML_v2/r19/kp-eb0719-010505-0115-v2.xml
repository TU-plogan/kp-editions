                    and in some measure the founder of a school, was the son of Lewis Reid, minister
                    of the parish of Strachan, in the county of Kincardine, Scotland. His mother,
                    the daughter of Mr Gregory of Kinnairdie, in Banffshire, was one of twenty-nine
                    children, and sister to David, James, and Charles Gregory, who were at the same
                    period professors of astronomy or mathematics in the universities of Oxford,
                    Edinburgh, and St Andrews.</p>

                    received the elementary parts of his education at the parish-school of
                    Kincardine O’Neil. The parochial schools of Scotland are said to have been much
                    superior at that period to what they are at present, and young men went from
                    them well furnished with philological learning to the different universities.
                    The early progress of young Reid must have been very extraordinary,</p>
                <p part="N">VOL. xιx.</p>
                <p part="N">since he was qualified to profit by the lectures of the professors at
                    the age of twelve. He soon gave very striking' proofs that he inherited the
                    genius of his mother’s family, and was conspicuous amongst the students of
                    mathematics, in a college where that science has always been cultivated with
                    zeal and success. He continued longer at the university than the usual term of
                    years, having been appointed to the office of librarian, a situation which was
                    every way agreeable to him, as it gave him ample opportunities of gratifying his
                    passion for study. About this time he became intimately attached to John
                    Stewart, afterwards professor of mathematics in Marischal College, a connection
                    which greatly strengthened his predilection for mathematical studies.</p>
                <p part="N">He resigned the office of librarian in the year 1736, and accompanied Mr
                    Stewart to England, when they paid a visit to London, Oxford, and Cambridge, and
                    were introduced to several persons of the first literary distinction. On account
                    of his relation to Dr David Gregory, he had ready access to the celebrated
                    Martin Folkes, whose house might be said to contain many of the most interesting
                    objects to be met with in the metropolis. He saw Dr Bentley at Cambridge, with
                    whose erudition he was much delighted, as well as amused with his vanity; and he
                    also conversed frequently with Saunderson, the blind mathematician. Dr Reid in
                    his philosophical speculations refers to this gentleman’s blindness, as a
                    singular phenomenon in the history of the human mind.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Reid maintained an uninterrupted friendship with the learned and
                    amiable Mr Stewart until the year 1766, at which time the latter was carried off
                    by a malignant fever. The circumstances attending the death of this excellent
                    man deeply wounded the sensibility of Dr Reid; for his wife and daughter were
                    carried ofl' by the same disorder, and buried with him in the same grave.</p>
                <p part="N">The King’s College of Aberdeen presented Dr Reid to the living of New
                    Machar in the year 1737; but such was the zeal of the people against the law of
                    patronage at that time, that he not only met with violent opposition, but was
                    also exposed to personal danger. But his attention to the duties of his office
                    was so exemplary, his temper so mild and forbearing, and his spirit of humanity
                    so active, that in a short time he subdued their prejudices; and when at last
                    called in the course of Providence to a different situation, the very people who
                    had been guilty of gross and indecent outrages against him followed him, on his
                    departure, with their benedictions and tears.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1740, he married Elizabeth, daughter of his uncle, Dr George
                    Reid, physician in London, after which his popularity at New Machar very much
                    increased. Her manners were so accommodating, and so numerous were her kind
                    offices to the sick and the indigent, that the departure of the family from the
                    neighbourhood was looked upon as a general misfortune. The manner in which
                    several old men were accustomed to speak upon the subject is worthy of being
                    kept in remembrance. “We fought,” said they, “against Dr Reid when he came, and
                    we would have fought for him when he went away.”</p>
                <p part="N">The greater part of his time during his residence at New Machar was
                    devoted to the most intense study, particularly directing his attention to the
                    laws of external perception, and of the other principles which constitute the
                    basis of human knowledge. He unbended his mind by the amusements of gardening
                    and botany, of which he was extremely fond, even in old age.</p>
                <p part="N">The professors of King’s College, in the year 1752, made choice of Dr
                    Reid to be professor of philosophy, originating wholly from the high opinion
                    they were led to entertain of his talents and erudition. We are not acquainted
                    with the particular plan which he adopted and pursued in the course of his
                    lectures; but his department at that period comprehended mathematics and physic,
                    logic and o <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=116"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0719-0116-0106"/>ethics; a practice then followed in the other
                    universities of Scotland, instead of appointing a professor for each distinct
                    branch.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Reid had not been long in Aberdeen, till, in conjunction with Dr John
                    Gregorj', he projected a literarj’ society, which continued for a number of
                    years, and met once a week. The writings of Reid, Gregory, Campbell, Beattie,
                    and Gerard, evince the numerous advantages which the members derived from this
                    institution, as they were in the habit of subjecting such works as they intended
                    for publication, to the test of friendly criticism.</p>
                <p part="N">It is perhaps not too much to assert, that of all the publications which
                    appeared about this time, the Inquiry into the Human Mind by Dr Reid discovered
                    by far the greatest originality and profound thinking. It appears that he had
                    conceived the plan, and deeply meditated upon it, long before its publication;
                    yet, without the applause of his literary associates, it is more than probable
                    that his native modesty would have prevented him from giving it to the
                    world.</p>
                <p part="N">The publication of Mr Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature, in 1739, lcd him
                    to question the principles commonly received with regard to the human
                    understanding. He admitted, when a youth, but without any attentive examination,
                    the opinions on which Mr Hume’s scepticism was raised; but when he carefully
                    adverted to the consequences which these principles appeared to involve, he
                    instantly began to suspect their truth. To subvert the sceptical theory of Mr
                    Hume was the grand object of Dr Reid’s Inquiry, which he submitted to the
                    examination of Mr Hume himself. That philosopher, even after he had seen some
                    parts of the work, discovers not a little of the Jewish spirit of unbelief that
                    any good thing should come out of Nazareth; and considering his antagonist as a
                    clergyman, and belonging to an order of men from whom prejudice would not allow
                    him to expect any soundness of reasoning in matters of science, he betrays more
                    than want of good humour, as Dr Reid’s biographer expresses himself, when he
                    says, in no very courteous language, in a letter to Dr Blair, “I wish that the
                    parsons would confine themselves to their old occupation of worrying one
                    another, and leave philosophers to argue with temper, moderation, and good
                    manners.” But though Mr Hume, as appears from the words just quoted, was very
                    angry that a clergyman should become a philosopher, on a second perusal of the
                    Inquiry, he seems to have held very different sentiments, when he wrote to the
                    author himself in the following terms. “By Dr Butler’s means, I have been
                    favoured with the perusal of your performance, which I have read with great
                    pleasure and attention. It is certainly very rare, that a piece so deeply
                    philosophical is wrote [written] with so much spirit, and affords so much
                    entertainment to the reader; though I must still regret the disadvantages under
                    which I read it, as I never had the whole performance at once before me, and
                    could not be able fidly to compare one part with another. To this reason,
                    chiefly, I ascribe some obscurities, which, in spite of your short analysis or
                    abstract, still seem to hang over your system. For I must do you the justice to
                    own, that when I entered into your ideas, no man appears to ex-</p>
                <p part="N">i&gt;ress himself with greater perspicuity than you do; a ta-ent which,
                    above all others, is requisite in that species of literature which you have
                    cultivated....As I was desirous to be of some use to you, I kept a watchful eye
                    all along over your style; but it is really so correct, and so good English,
                    that I found not any thing worth the remarking. There is only one passage in
                    this chapter, where you make use of the phrase <hi rend="italic">hinder to
                        do</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">hinder from doing,</hi> which is the
                    English one; but I could not find the passage when I sought for it. You may
                    judge how unexceptionable the whole appeared to me, when I could remark so small
                    a blemish.”</p>
                <p part="N">The impression made on the minds of speculative men by the publication
                    of Dr Reid’s Inquiry was as great as could reasonably be expected from the
                    nature of his undertaking. It was not level to the comprehension of the
                    multitude, nor even addressed to them; and as it examined opinions with the
                    utmost freedom which had obtained the sanction of the highest authorities, it
                    had little prospect of conciliating the favour of the learned. Some, however,
                    there were, who perceived the extent of his views, and beheld in his pages the
                    true spirit and language of inductive investigation, which made proselytes of
                    many, who, again, warmly recommended the work to the attention of others. The
                    Inquiry of Dr Reid was so much esteemed by the learned body of teachers then in
                    the University of Glasgow, that they gave him an invitation to the vacant
                    professorship of moral philosophy in the year 1763. It was no doubt with a
                    considerable degree of reluctance that he resolved to leave Aberdeen; yet so
                    numerous were the allurements which Glasgow presented to a man of his extensive
                    erudition and deep research, that he gave it the preference. That seminary of
                    learning could then boast of a Moor, a Simpson, a Black, a Leechman, the two
                    Wilsons, father and son, and the acute, discriminating Millar, with all of whom
                    he was more or less intimate, and whose fascinating conversation made him in
                    some measure forget that he had long been acquainted with men of genius in the
                    university of Aberdeen.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Reid’s merit as a public teacher arose principally from that fund of
                    original philosophy which is characteristic of his writings, and from his
                    invincible patience and perseverance in recommending such principles as he
                    conceived to be of the last importance to human happiness. His style, too, was
                    simple and perspicuous; his character was grave and possessed of authority; and
                    his students felt such an interest in the doctrines which he inculcated, that he
                    never failed to be heard with the most profound attention.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1773 his remarks on Aristotle’s logic appeared in Lord
                    Karnes’s Sketches of the History of Man. “In attempting,” says he, “to give some
                    account of the Analytics and of the Topics of Aristotle, ingenuity
                    [ingenuousness] obliges me to confess, that though I have often purposed to read
                    the whole with care, and to understand what is intelligible, yet my courage and
                    patience always failed before I had done. Why should I throw away so much time
                    and painful attention upon a thing of so little use? If I had lived in those
                    ages when the knowledge of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi> entitled a
                    man to the highest rank in philosophy', ambition might have induced me to employ
                    upon it some years of painful study; and less, I conceive, would not be
                    sufficient. Such reflections as these always got the better of my resolution
                    when the first ardour began to cool. All I can saj’ is, that I have read some
                    part of the different books with care, some slightly, and some perhaps not at
                    all. I have glanced over the whole often; and when any thing attracted my
                    attention, have dipped into it till my appetite was satisfied.”</p>
                <p part="N">But, in spite of his modest declarations, it is matter of doubt with
                    some, whether any of his publications does him more honour than his perspicuous
                    view of this complicated system. It is unquestionably superior to any other
                    analysis of these writings that we have yet seen; an opinion amply confirmed by
                    the sentiments of different literary characters who were intimately acquainted
                    with the works of the great philosopher of antiquity.</p>
                <p part="N">Dr Reid declined reading lectures in the university for some years
                    before his death; and he devoted this period to the task of preparing for the
                    press his great work, which was published in two volumes 4to, the first in 1785,
                    entitled Essays on the Intellectual Powere of Man; and the second in 1788,
                    entitled Essays on the Active Powers of <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=117"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0719-0117-0107"/>Man. His Essay on Quantity, occasioned by
                    reading a Treatise in which Simple and Compound Ratios are applied to Virtue and
                    Merit, was composed previously to the year 1748, and published in the
                    Philosophical Transactions of London for that year. This paper affords some
                    light respecting the progress of his speculations about the period in question.
                    The Inquiry into the Human Mind, of which we have already taken notice, appeared
                    in 1764; and at this time he was complimented with the degree of Doctor in
                    Divinity.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1796, the last of his life, he was prevailed upon to spend
                    with his friends at Edinburgh a few weeks during the summer. From that visit he
                    returned to Glasgow in his usual health and spirits, and for some time continued
                    to devote a portion of his time to the exercise both of body and of mind. But
                    about the end of September he was seized with a violent disorder, with which he
                    maintained a severe struggle; and this, together with repeated strokes of the
                    palsy, put a period to his long and useful life on the 7th of October, and in
                    the eighty-seventh year of his age.</p>
                <p part="N">As to his bodily constitution, few men have ever been more indebted to
                    nature than Dr Reid. In this respect he was athletic and vigorous, and his
                    muscular strength was uncommonly great; advantages which were powerfully
                    seconded by his temperance, exercise, and the unclouded serenity of his temper.
                    Deep and collected thought was very conspicuous in his countenance, and all his
                    looks were expressive of kindness and good will.</p>
                <p part="N">With respect to his character, his rectitude was inflexible and
                    intrepid; his attachment to truth was pure; and he had an entire command over
                    all his passions, which he acquired by the unwearied exertions of a long life.
                    When, therefore, he found it necessary to dispute the conclusions of others in
                    any of his writings, he nevcr employed any expressions to irritate those whom he
                    was anxious to convince; and the asperity of his opponents could not provoke him
                    to repress his spirit of liberality and good humour; for he considered the
                    intemperance with which controversy is carried on, as an enemy to the progress
                    of useful knowledge, and as having done more harm to the practice than service
                    to the theory of morality. He uniformly maintained the dignity of philosophy in
                    private life, and he united in his character the most amiable modesty and
                    gentleness with the noblest spirit of independence. He never solicited any
                    favours from the great; and all his academical or other preferments were
                    conferred upon him by those who were real judges of his merit, and thought he
                    deserved them. To a sound, cautious, and discriminating judgment, a singular
                    patience and perseverance of thought, and fixed attention to the operations of
                    his own mind, he added the curiosity of a naturalist and the eyes of an
                    observer; and of course his information was accurate and extensive. His
                    sensibility was of an active and lively nature; and wherever he could command
                    the means of relieving the distressed, he always employed them with the utmost
                    possible secrecy. The life of Dr Reid, by his disciple and friend Mr Dugald
                    Stewart, the great ornament of his master’s school, is known to all the world as
                    one of the first specimens of philosophical biography that any language can
                    furnish.</p>
