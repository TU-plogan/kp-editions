                    chosen principal and professor of divinity. He was soon famous in the university
                    on account of his lectures, and among his countrymen at large for his persuasive
                    mode of preaching. In the year 1593, Rollock and others were appointed by
                    parliament to confer with the popish lords; and in the following year he was one
                    of those made choice of by the General Assembly to present his majesty with a
                    paper entitled “The dangers which, through the impunity of excommunicated
                    papists, traffickers with the Spaniards, and other enemies of the religion and
                    state, are imminent to the true religion professed within this realm, his
                    majesty’s person, crown, and liberty of this our native country.” Their zeal
                    against popery was carried to excess, and they seem to have been of opinion,
                    that it was incumbent on the civil magistrate to punish idolatry with death. In
                    the year 1595, he was empowered, along with others, to visit the different
                    universities in Scotland, with a view to inquire into the doctrine and practice
                    of the different masters, the discipline adopted by them, and the state of their
                    rents and living, which they were ordered to report to the next General
                    Assembly.</p>
                <p part="N">He was chosen moderator of the General Assembly in the year 1597, at
                    which period he was fortunate enough to obtain the redress of several glaring
                    abuses. The greater part of his life was spent in conducting the affairs of the
                    church, yet Spotswood assures us that he would rather have' preferred retirement
                    and study. Indeed the feebleness of his constitution was not equal to the hurry
                    and bustle of public life, and it led him to prefer the retirement of study. He
                    was very much affected with the stone, the pains of which he bore with the
                    fortitude and resignation of a Christian. He died at Edinburgh on the last day
                    of February 1598, in the forty-third year of his age. Short as his life was, he
                    published many works, of which the following is a catalogue. A Commentary on the
                    first book of Beza’s Questions; on St Paul’s Epistle to the Ephesians; on the
                    prophet Daniel; a Logical Analysis of St Paul’s Epistle to the Romans; some
                    Questions and Answers concerning the Covenant of Grace and the Sacraments; a
                    Treatise of Effectual Calling; a Commentary on the Epistles of Paul to the
                    Thessalonians and Philemon; on fifteen select Psalms; on the Gospel of St John,
                    with a Harmony of the four Evangelists upon theDeath, Resurrection, and
                    Ascension of Jesus Christ; certain Sermons on several places of St Paul’s
                    Epistles; a Commentary on the Epistle to the Colossians; a Logical Analysis of
                    the Epistle to the Hebrews; of the Epistle to the Galatians; a Commentary upon t
                    he first two chapters of the first Epistle of St Peter; a Treatise of
                    Justification, and another of Excommunication. AH these, except the Sermons,
                    were written in Latin. Of the pious and learned author, a more particular
                    account may be found in a volume printed under the subsequent title: “De Vita et
                    Morte Roberti Rollok, Academiae Edinburgenae Primarii, Narrationes, auctoribus
                    Georgio Robertson et Henrico Charteris.” Edinb. 1826, 4 to. Robertson’s
                    biographical tract was originally published in 1599. That of Charteris was
                    printed from a manuscript in the public library of the university.</p>
