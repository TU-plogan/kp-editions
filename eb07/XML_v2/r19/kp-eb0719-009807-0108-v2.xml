                    Marriages, Deaths, and Burials, in England and Wales. The first known public
                    authority under which registers recording births or baptisms, marriages, deaths
                    or burials, were systematically kept in England, was an injunction issued in
                    September 1538 (30 Hen. VIII.), by Thomas Lord Cromwell, lord privy seal and
                    vicegerent to the king, which enjoined, that in every parish a register-book
                    should be kept in a coffer with two locks, by the parson, vicar, or curate, and
                    churchwardens; and that every Sunday, in the presence of one of the
                    churchwardens, the parson, &amp;c. should enter in a register-book a written
                    record of the dates and names of the weddings, christenings, and burials, of the
                    preceding week; by neglect of which duty he incurred a fine of three shillings
                    and fourpence, to be employed in the repair of the church.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1547, an injunction was issued by Edward VI. similar to that of 1538,
                    excepting only that the penalty was directed “to be employed to the poore-box”
                    of the parish.</p>
                <p part="N">Inquiry was directed, at the instance of Cardinal Pole, under Philipand
                    Mary, in the years 1555 and 1557, whether the clergy had complied with these
                    directions; and in the first year of Queen Elizabeth, 1559, a further injunction
                    was issued, which differed from that of Edward VI. in 1547 only in directing
                    that the penalty should be divided between the poor-box and the repair of the
                    church. These injunctions were not very strictly observed, as appears by the
                    preamble of a bill to “authorize every archbishop and bishop to erect one office
                    of registership of all the church-books, to be kept in every diocese,” which, in
                    March 1563, was read a first time in the House of Commons, but did not pass.</p>
                <p part="N">The great importance of registration was in 1590 represented to the
                    Lord-treasurer Burghley, who, impressed with the force of the representation,
                    communicated a plan to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Nothing, however, appears
                    to have been done in consequence until October 1597, when a constitution was
                    made by the archbishop, bishops, and clergy of the province of Canterbury, and
                    approved hy the queen; which notices the very great utility of parish-registers,
                    and gives minute directions for keeping them, and for the transmission of a
                    transcript yearly to the diocesan registrar. It appears, too, that persons were
                    appointed for the purpose of ascertaining if the several orders had been
                    complied with; and that every minister, at institution, was required to declare
                    that he would “keep the register-book according to the queen’s majesty’s
                    injunctions.”</p>

                        xml:id="kp-eb0719-0109-0099"/>injunction was issued similar to that of 1597,
                    with the important addition of a clause, appointing that the ancient registers,
                    so far as they could be procured, but especially since the beginning of the
                    reign of Elizabeth, should be copied into a parchment-book, to be provided by
                    every parish; after which, nothing more appears to have emanated, either from
                    the ecclesiastical or civil authorities, on this subject, till the time of the
                    Long Parliament, when the following entry in the Journal of the House of Commons
                    gives evidence of attention to the importance of registration.</p>
                <p part="N">“Anno 1644, Dec. 6. Ordered, that it be referred to the committee for
                    bringing in the ordinance for the establishing the directory, to bring in a
                    clause in that ordinance, for registering the time of baptizing of children, and
                    their parents’ names, and for registering of burials.” In the same year an
                    ordinance was made, directing, that in every parish or chapelry in England and
                    Wales, the minister and other church-officers should keep a register of birth
                    and baptism, of marriage, and of burial; and that all persons reasonably
                    desiring it might search therein and obtain copies.</p>
                <p part="N">In August 1653, in pursuance of the recommendations of a law-reform
                    committee appointed in the preceding year, and including many eminent persons,
                    an act was passed, which directed that in every parish a register-book shall be
                    provided for registering all marriages, births, and burials in the parish; and
                    that the custody of such book, and the duty of registration, shall be given to a
                    person, to be called the parish registrar, appointed by the parishioners
                    chargeable to the poor, and approved by a justice of the peace. It was also
                    enacted, that extra-parochial places, or small parishes, might be united, for
                    the purposes of registration, to other parishes, by the justices at their
                    sessions; and that all existing register-books should be kept by the registering
                    officers appointed under that act.</p>
                <p part="N">This act was not confirmed at the Restoration, and the business of
                    registration reverted to the clergy of the established church. During the reigns
                    of Charles II. and James II. nothing was done with respect to registers, except
                    that, by a clause in the act of 30 Car. II. c. 3, entitled “an act for burying
                    in woollen,” it was enacted that all clergymen “do, within their respective
                    parishes, precincts, and places, take an exact account, and keep a register, of
                    all and every person or persons buried in his or their respective parishes or
                    precincts, or in such common burial-places as their respective parishioners are
                    usually buried.”</p>
                <p part="N">In the reign of William III. registration was rendered a source of
                    revenue. The act of 6 and 7 William III. c. 6, granted duties on births,
                    marriages, and burials, and compelled the clergy, under a penalty of L.100, to
                    keep an exact register of all persons born, christened, married, or buried in
                    their respective parishes, to which register the collector of the tax, and all
                    persons concerned, might have free access without fee. It thus imposed on the
                    clergyman the onerous duty of acting gratuitously as a civil functionary, and
                    collecting information of all births within his parish, without distinction of
                    sect, and irrespective of baptism, a duty the difficulty of which was rendered
                    greater by the attempts of the parents to conceal the birth, in order to elude
                    the payment of the tax. With a view to obviate this objection, an act was passed
                    in the following year (7 and 8 William III. c. 35), which provided that parents
                    should, within five days after birth, give notice of the day of the birth to the
                    clergyman, under a penalty of forty shillings, and that the clergyman should,
                    under a like penalty, register such birth, for which the parents were to pay
                    sixpence; and by the 4th of Anne, c. 12, the clergy were relieved from the
                    ruinous penalties incurred under the act of 6 and 7 William III. c. 6, in all
                    cases where the duties ha&lt;¼ been really paid.</p>
                <p part="N">The 26th Geo. II. c. 33, an act “to prevent clandestine marriages,”
                    directed the church-wardens of every parish to provide books of vellum, or good
                    and durable paper, for the registration of marriages. By the 23d of Geo. III. c.
                    67, a stamp-duty of threepence was imposed upon every registered entry of
                    burial, marriage, birth, or christening, to be demanded by the clergyman from
                    the undertaker, or from the parties married, or from the parents of the child
                    whose birth or christening had been registered. By 25 Geo. III. c. 75, the
                    provisions of that act were extended to dissenting ministers. These measures
                    excited much objection, and were repealed in 1794.</p>
                <p part="N">The next legislative measure affecting registers was the 52d Geo. III.
                    c. 146, entitled “an act for the better regulating and preserving parish and
                    other registers of births, baptisms, marriages, and burials, in England.” After
                    reciting that “the amending the manner and form of keeping and of preserving
                    registers of baptisms, marriages, and burials of his majesty’s subjects in the
                    several parishes and places in England, will greatly facilitate the proof of
                    pedigrees of persons claiming to be entitled to real or personal estates, and be
                    otherwise of great public benefit and advantage,” it enacts, that, after the
                    31st of December 1812, registers of baptisms, marriages, and burials, according
                    to the rites of the established church, shall be made and kept by the
                    officiating minister of every parish and chapelry, in books to be provided by
                    the king’s printer, at the expense of the respective parishes, according to the
                    forms contained in schedules annexed to that act. These schedules contain the
                    following particulars: In case of <hi rend="italic">baptism,—</hi> when
                    baptized; child’s Christian name; parents’ Christian names and surnames; abode;
                    quality, trade, or profession; by whom the ceremony was performed. In case of
                        <hi rend="italic">marriage,—</hi> the name and parish of the man; the same
                    of the woman; when married; whether by banns or license; whether by consent of
                    parents or guardians; when; by whom; signature of officiating minister of the
                    parties married, and of two witnesses. In case of <hi rend="italic"
                        >burial,—</hi> the name; abode; when buried; age; by whom the ceremony was
                    performed.</p>
                <p part="N">The registers of baptism, marriage, and burial were to be kept in
                    separate books, and signed within seven days after each ceremony had been
                    performed. Annual copies were to be made, verified, and signed by the
                    officiating minister, and attested by the church-wardens, and transmitted by
                    them yearly to the registrar of the diocese; which registrar must report thereon
                    to his bishop; must deposit such copies in a safe receptacle, arranged for
                    reference; and cause alphabetical lists of persons and places to be made, kept,
                    and opened for search.</p>
                <p part="N">It is to be observed that this act, which referred in its title to
                    registers of births, made no provision for recording the date of birth. Neither
                    did it provide a record of the date of death. It only provided records of the
                    performance of the religious ceremonies of baptism, marriage, and burial,
                    according to the rites of the Established Church. It therefore afforded an
                    insufficient register, even for members of the Established Church, whilst for
                    those who dissented from the Established Church, and therefore did not avail
                    themselves of its ordinances for baptism or burial, it provided no register at
                    all.</p>
                <p part="N">The inadequacy of this system, even if frllly carried into effect, and
                    the insufficient manner in which it was complied with, called loudly for
                    investigation and remedy, and became the subject of inquiry before a select
                    committee of the House of Commons, appointed in March 1833, who, having, as they
                    state, received evidence on registration “from clergymen of the established
                    church, and from parish-clerks; from gentlemen of the legal profession; from
                    authors devoted to antiquarian research; from persons of different religious
                    denominations, including Catholics, Dissenters, Jews, and Quakers; from
                    gentlemen eminently scientific, and attached to statistical inquiries; from

                    accurate information on the extent and causes of mortality; from an eminent
                    foreigner, distinguished for extensive and accurate statistical intelligence;
                    and others, whose wide-spread inquiries in foreign countries, and peculiar
                    facilities of information, entitled them to respect ;” unanimously agreed to a
                    report, which expressed the following opinions as the conclusions at which they
                    had arrived.</p>
                <p part="N">“1. That the subject is urgently important.</p>
                <p part="N">“2. That it involves matters of great public and national interest, as
                    well as individual satisfaction, and rights and claims to property; and deserves
                    the attention of the humblest artisan as well as of the most philosophical and
                    states-man-like inquirer.</p>
                <p part="N">“3. That the existing law is imperfect and unjust, and requires not
                    merely partial amendment, but real fundamental reform.</p>
                <p part="N">“4. That the present plan, even if improved and perfected, as applicable
                    to the members of the established church, being founded on religious rights, is
                    exclusive and intolerant, as it would not include a very considerable portion of
                    the reflecting, intelligent, and influential population of the country, who are
                    Protestant and Catholic dissenters from that church, and 1100 congregations who
                    disapprove infant baptism, and must practically punish them (including, too, the
                    community who may purchase or derive property from them) for claiming the rights
                    of conscience, and believing what their judgments direct.</p>
                <p part="N">“5. That even to many pious and worthy clergymen of the established
                    church the system is productive of pain and regret, as it often induces a
                    compliance, from mere secular motives, with sacraments which they highly
                    estimate and devoutly revere. But,</p>
                <p part="N">“6. That even as to the members of the church it is detrimental and
                    absurd, since the registers are mere registers of baptisms and not of births, of
                    burials and not of deaths; since they supply no adequate proof of pedigrees, or
                    means of proving or tracing ancestral descent; since they are often falsified,
                    stolen, burnt, inaccurately inscribed, and carelessly preserved; since the
                    securities intended to be given by the last general register act (52 Geo. III.),
                    by directing the yearly and universal transcription of the registers, their
                    deposit with the diocesan records, and the preparation of indexes to facilitate
                    searches, have all experienced only the most limited fulfilment, as, while one
                    fourth of the parishes make no returns, the returns that have been sent are
                    never indorsed, and are subject to fire and decay, and the directions of the act
                    have not and cannot be enforced; and since the value of property is diminished
                    by the difficulties incident to its transfer, and the insecurity by which it is
                    so often held and acquired. And,</p>
                <p part="N">“7. That great trouble, vast expense, utter uncertainty, capricious
                    charges, and local and general evils exist, while no means are supplied to
                    obtain the information other countries possess, and justly value, as to the
                    state of disease, the operation of moral and physical causes on the health of
                    the people, the progress of population, and other matters on which accurate
                    Knowledge can scarcely be too highly appreciated or too intensely pursued.”</p>
                <p part="N">The committee further recommended, that, as a remedy for the defects
                    before mentioned, “a national civil registration of births, marriages, and
                    deaths, should be established,” including “all ranks of society, and
                    religionists of every class.”</p>
                <p part="N">In pursuance of these recommendations, measures for effecting a better
                    registration were laid before parliament; and in August 1836 the act for
                    registering births, deaths, and marriages in England, and the act for marriages
                    in England, became law. Their operation was suspended for a limited time by the
                    act of 7 Will. IV <hi rend="subscript">υ</hi> chap. 1, and they were amend ed by
                    the act of 1 Vict. chap. 22, and thus amended they came into operation on the
                    1st of July 1837.</p>
                <p part="N">These acts leave untouched the act of 1812 so far as it relates to the
                    registration of baptisms and burials, but repeal what relates to the
                    registration of marriages, and provide a new registration of marriages, of <hi

                <p part="N">The circumstances recorded in the register-book under the new law are,
                    in case of <hi rend="italic">birth,</hi> the time and place; the name, if any;
                    sex; name and surname of father; name and maiden surname of mother; rank or
                    profession of father; signature, description, and residence of the informant;
                    and the baptismal name, if added after registration of birth. In case of <hi
                        rend="italic">death,</hi> the time and place; name and surname; sex; age;
                    rank or profession; <hi rend="italic">cause of death;</hi> signature,
                    description, and residence of the informant. Every entry must be signed by the
                    informant and by the registrar, who discharges this duty without any immediate
                    expense to the parties requiring registration, but is remunerated by a moderate
                    fee on each entry paid quarterly out of the poor’s rates. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >informant,</hi> in a case of <hi rend="italic">birth,</hi> must be one of
                    the parents, or the occupier of the house or tenement in whlch the child was
                    born; or, if it be a foundling, the overseer of the poor. In a case of <hi
                        rend="italic">death,</hi> it must be some person present at the death, or in
                    attendance during the last illness; or, in default of such person, the occupier;
                    or, in default of the occupier, an inmate of the house in which the death
                    occurred; or, if there be an inquest, the coroner. Persons so qualified <hi
                        rend="italic">must</hi> inform under pain of indictment, and sign the
                    register on being requested so to do; and without such signature no birth or
                    death can be duly registered, and the entry cannot be given in evidence.</p>
                <p part="N">The new form for registration of marriages, applicable alike to all
                    Teligiousdenominations, records the place and time of marriage; names and
                    surnames of the parties; whether they are of full age or minors; their condition
                    (that is, whether bachelor or spinster, widower or widow); their rank or
                    profession; residence at the time of marriage; father’s name and surname; rank
                    or profession of father; by what rites and ceremonies, after what preliminary
                    forms (that is, whether license, banns, or certificate), and by whom solemnized;
                    and must also contain the signatures of the parties and of two witnesses.</p>
                <p part="N">One of the most important circumstances not previously recorded, for
                    which provision is made in the new register, is the “cause of death,” to which a
                    column is assigned in the registers of death, and where it is exhibited in
                    juxtaposition with the period, locality, sex, age. and occupation, thus
                    affording valuable data of the highest importance to medical science. In order
                    to attain the utmost accuracy in the returns of the causes of death, a printed
                    circular has been sent by the registrar-general to all medical practitioners in
                    England and Wales, wherein it is recommended, under the hand of the President of
                    the Royal College of Physicians, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons,
                    and the Master of the Society of Apothecaries, “that every practising member of
                    any branch of the medical profession who may have been present at the death, or
                    in attendance during the last illness, of any person, shall, immediately after
                    such death, place in the hands of such other persons as were in attendance, of
                    the occupier of the house in which the death occurred, and of some inmate who
                    may probably be required to give information, <hi rend="italic">written
                        statements of the cause of death,</hi> which such persons may show to the
                    registrar, and give as their information on that subject.”</p>
                <p part="N">The recent registration act is peculiarly distinguished from other
                    previous measures on that subject, by the provision of a central office in
                    London, called the General Register Office, for the deposit of certified copies
                    of all registers, and general superintendence over everything relat<pb

                    officer named the Registrar-General, appointed under the great seal, under whom
                    in the office is an assistant registrar, a chief clerk, three first clerks, and
                    forty-three others, who are appointed by the Lords of the Treasury, or by the
                    Registrar-General with their approval. Instructions emanate from this office to
                    all the local officers charged with the various duties of registration under
                    this act, namely, superintendent registrars, with their deputies; registrars of
                    births and deaths, with their deputies; and registrars of marriages; all of whom
                    act within their respective districts under the directions of the
                    Registrar-General, in whom is vested the power of dismissal.</p>
                <p part="N">• The duties of the Registrar-General are to make regulations, subject
                    to the approval of the Secretary of State, for the management of the General
                    Register Office, and for the duties of all registrars and superintendent
                    registrars; to appoint superintendent registrars for temporary districts; to
                    examine and sanction the formation of registrars’ districts, submitted by the
                    various boards of poor-law guardians for his approval; to examine and sanction,
                    if approved, the plans for local register offices, to be provided by the
                    poor-law guardians, and submitted by them for his approval; to furnish the
                    various books, forms, &amp;c. requisite for registration, to the various parties
                    requiring them; to register certified places of worship for solemnization of
                    marriage; to decide, in cases of doubt, upon all caveats referred to him by the
                    superintendent registrars, and to adjudicate on an appeal from the
                    superintendent registrar’s decision on a caveat; to hear and settle all matters
                    of doubt, dispute, and complaint, respecting the business of registration, and
                    the duties and conduct of the various officers employed therein; to annex
                    extraparochial places to registrars’ districts; to unite two or more
                    superintendent registrars’ districts, or to divide one superintendent
                    registrar’s district into two, with the approval of the Secretary of State; to
                    appoint registrars or superintendent registrars if the guardians neglect to do
                    so; and to send once in every year a report and abstract of all registered
                    births, deaths, and marriages, for the preceding year, to the Secretary of
                    State, to be laid before parliament.</p>
                <p part="N">The superintendent registrar is a local officer created by the
                    registration and marriage acts, acting solely within his ' district, which is
                    either identical with a poor-law union, or consists, as in a few instances, of
                    two or more unions formed into one district by the authority of the
                    Registrar-General, or is a temporary district consisting of several temporary
                    registrars’ districts united by the Registrar-General where there is no poor-law
                    board of guardians. In the latter case, the superintendent registrar is
                    appointed by the Registrar-General. Inthe former, he is either the clerk of the
                    guardians, who, as such, is entitled <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> to take
                    the office, or he is some person whom, the clerk not accepting, the guardians
                    may have appointed, subject in either case to such qualifications as the
                    Registrar-General may by any general rule re quire.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal duty of the superintendent registrar is to receive
                    quarterly, from the registrars of births and deaths, and registrars of
                    marriages, within his district, the certified copies of births, deaths, and
                    marriages registered by them for the preceding quarter, and, having verified
                    them by comparison with the original entries in the register-books, to certify
                    their correctness, and transmit them to the Registrar-General; to receive also
                    and transmit, but not also to verify, certified copies of marriages registered
                    by all clergymen of the Established Church within his district, or by any
                    registering officer of the Quakers, or secretary of a Jewish synagogue, if there
                    be any within or assigned to his district. He has also the care of the register
                    office of his district, where are deposited all register-books within the
                    district when filled; and he is to make indexes of these, and permit searches,
                    and give copies of entries in the register-books on payment of certain fixed
                    fees. He may appoint registrars of marriage within his district; and, previous
                    notice having been already given, he may grant certificates for marriage, and,
                    within his district, licenses for marriage, provided such license be not for
                    marriage to be solemnized according to the forms of the Established Church.</p>
                <p part="N">The registrar of births and deaths is a local officer acting within his
                    district, which has either been formed, with the∣ approval of the
                    Registrar-General, by a board of guardians <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>
                    established under the poor-law amendment act, or is a temporary district formed
                    by the Poor-law Commissioners where there is no such board established. In the
                    former case, the registrar is appointed by the board of guardians, in the latter
                    by the Poor-law Commissioners, subject, in both cases, to such qualifications as
                    the Registrar-General may by any general rule declare to be necessary.</p>
                <p part="N">His duties, which are the same in both cases, are to register, in the
                    books provided for that purpose, every birth and death occurring within his
                    district; and four times in every year to make, on forms furnished for that
                    purpose, copies of all such entries of births and of deaths for the quarter
                    immediately preceding; to certify that such copies are correct, and to deliver
                    them to the superintendent registrar of his district, who, on comparing them
                    with the register-book, which the registrar must also produce, will certify
                    their correctness, and transmit them to the Registrar-General. He also delivers
                    an account of the number of entries so copied, which the superintendent
                    registrar verifies, and sanctions if correct, and which the registrar then
                    presents, and obtains payment of the fees due thereupon from the guardians or
                    overseers of the poor.</p>
                <p part="N">The registrar of marriages is a local officer appointed by the
                    superintendent registrar, with the approval of the guardians, or, if there be no
                    board of guardians, of the Poor-law Commissioners, and acts solely within his
                    district, which is the same as that of the superintendent registrar by whom he
                    was appointed.</p>
                <p part="N">His duty is to be present at marriages not according to the forms of the
                    Church of England, solemnized either in registered places of worship within his
                    district, or in the superintendent registrar’s office; to register the same in a
                    book provided for that purpose; and to deliver quarterly to the superintendent
                    registrar certified copies of such registered entries, in like manner as is done
                    by the registrar of births and deaths.</p>
                <p part="N">Marriages according to the forms of the Established Church are
                    registered, as before, by the officiating clergyman, who delivers certified
                    copies quarterly to the superintendent registrar of his district, to be
                    transmitted to the Registrar-General. The marriages are also registered at the
                    time <hi rend="italic">in duplicate;</hi> and one of the books, when filled, is
                    to be deposited immediately in the superintendent registrar’s office.</p>
                <p part="N">Marriages according to the ceremonies of the Quakers and of the Jews are
                    registered respectively in duplicate by the registering officer of the Quakers
                    and the secretary of the synagogue, and certified copies are given quarterly to
                    the superintendent registrar for transmission.</p>
                <p part="N">The number of persons by whom the registration of births, deaths, and
                    marriages under the existing law is conducted (exclusive of the central
                    establishment of the General Register Office) is as follows :—</p>
                <p part="N">There are 618 superintendent registrars, each of whom may appoint a
                    deputy, with the approval of the Registrar-General, to act for him in case of
                    his illness or absence. Of these, 562 have accepted the office as clerks of
                    boards of guardians, or have been appointed by the guardians; and fifty-six are
                    temporary, and have been appointed by the Registrar-General.</p>
                <p part="N">There are 2193 registrars of births and deaths, each of whom may appoint
                    a deputy, with tlιe approval of the guardians or of the Poor-law Commissioners.
                    Of these, 1926 <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=112"

                    under the poor-law amendment act, and 267 are registrars of temporary '
                    districts, appointed by the Poor-law Commissioners.</p>
                <p part="N">The number of registrars of marriages who had been appointed and held
                    such office on the 3lst of December 1838 was 817, of whom 419 are also
                    registrars of births and deaths. The foregoing, being in number 3209, act under
                    the directions of the Registrar-General, and are removeable by him.</p>
                <p part="N">The number of other persons by whom registration of marriage is effected
                    is as follows:—hi, 11,694 officiating ministers of the Established Church, to
                    whom register-books have been furnished; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> ninety
                    registering officers of Quakers; 3rf, thirty-six secretaries of synagogues. All
                    these are in communication with the Registrar-General with respect to the duties
                    of registration.</p>
                <p part="N">One of the most important features of the new measures is the provision
                    that certified copies shall be deposited quarterly in the General Register
                    Office in London, there to be arranged and indexed for facility of reference; a
                    provision by means of which henceforth a copy of an entry of any registered
                    birth, death, or marriage, in any part of England or Wales, may be obtained by
                    application at a single office, at the trifling cost of 3s. 6d., which includes
                    the fee for search.</p>
                <p part="N">The certified copies thus transmitted from the clergy, registrars,
                    registering officers, and secretaries (amounting together to more than 15,000
                    persons), are all made on separate leaves of durable paper, of an uniform size
                    and peculiar texture, having a distinguishing water-mark for the prevention of
                    forgery, and furnished by the Registrar-General to every one of the foregoing
                    persons, on whom the duty of registration devolves. They are sent by the
                    superintendent registrars by the general post, each class of return (i. <hi
                        rend="italic">e.</hi> birth, death, and marriage) being sent separate, and
                    in a cover denoting by a mark the nature of the contents, and bearing the name
                    of the district to which it belongs. Thus, on their reception at the General
                    Register Office, the confusion which would Otherwuse ensue is avoided, by its
                    being rendered possible to classify the certified copies to a considerable
                    extent even before they are taken out of their covers.</p>
                <p part="N">They are then arranged and examined <hi rend="italic">seriatim,</hi> and
                    all defects are noted; and letters on the subject of such defects as are of any
                    importance are addressed to the persons from whom the defective copies come, and
                    who arc required to furnish either other copies, or such explanations as may
                    remove doubt. The copies are then paged, and inserted in books for
                    reference.</p>
                <p part="N">Means of immediate reference to any one of the entries of births,
                    deaths, and marriages deposited in the General Register Office, which will
                    amount yearly to almost 1,000,000, are provided in the alphabetical indexes
                    which are made there. This vast w <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> ork, far
                    exceeding in magnitude anything of a similar kind ever before attempted in this
                    country, is performed in the following manner. The few’ particulars requisite
                    for the index are copied from each entry <hi rend="italic">seriatim,</hi> on
                    forms prepared for that purpose, containing space for as many entries as there
                    are in one page of a certified copy. These, after having been checked, are cut
                    into separate slips, each containing the reference to one entry; and the slips
                    are then sorted and arranged alphabetically on files, from w’hence they are then
                    taken off one by one by the indexing clerks, and the contents of each copied
                    into the index. In this manner nearly a million of names will be indexed
                    alphabetically in the course of each year, the processes of transcribing,
                    sorting, and indexing being per» formed by between thirty and forty persons.
                    There is a separate index for each class of entries (births, deaths, and
                    marriages), and for each quarter, or twelve separate indexes for the year. Any
                    person, on payment of one shilling, may search these indexes, and, on finding
                    the name sought, may obtain, for two shillings and sixpence, a copy of the entry
                    of birth, death, or marriage referred to; which copy, being stamped with the
                    official seal, will be “received as evidence of the birth, death, or marriage to
                    which the same relates, without any further or other proof of such entry.” Thus
                    not only are means afforded of obtaining for legal purposes, by application at
                    one central office, certified copies of registers from every part of England and
                    Wales, but the copies so obtained have the additional advantage of being
                    sufficient evidence, without an affidavit, of their being correct, which is
                    often required for the confirmation of extracts given from church registers.</p>
                <p part="N">It is stated in the preface to the Population Abstract for 1831, as the
                    result of an inquiry respecting parochial registers in England, “that eight
                    hundred and twelve English parish registers commence in the year 1538, about
                    forty of which contain entries (copied probably from family bibles and
                    tomb-stones), anterior to the date of Cromwell’s injunction; 1822 parish
                    registers commence from a. d. 1538 to 1558, when Queen Elizabeth required a
                    protestation from the clergy; 2448 parish registers commence from a.d. 1558 to
                    1603, when the canons authorized by King James directed a copy of all extant
                    parish registers to be made and preserved; and nearly one half of them (5082)
                    have been preserved accordingly, and are now extant. Parish registers to the
                    number of 969 commence between that time to the year 1650; 2757 from a. d. 1650
                    to 1700; 1476 parish registers from a. d. 1700 to the year 1750; the rest (six
                    or seven hundred) since that time.”</p>
                <p part="N">In addition to the registers heretofore and now kept under the sanction
                    of ordinances and acts of parliament, there is a vast number of non-parochial
                    registers and records of marriages, births and baptisms, deaths, or burials,
                    which have been kept in some instances from a very remote period by various
                    dissenting congregations, and in many cases w <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> ith
                    great care and correctness, but in no form produced by authority, and under no
                    legal sanction; and which were therefore not admitted in evidence as registers
                    in courts of justice.</p>
                <p part="N">In September 1836, a commission was issued, which has been renewed in
                    the present reign, directing certain commissioners to inquire into the state,
                    custody, and authenticity of such registers or records; “and to inquire whether
                    any or what measures could be beneficially adopted for collecting and arranging
                    all or any of such registers or records, and for depositing the same, or copies
                    thereof, in the office of the registrar-general of births, deaths, and
                    marriages, or for otherwise preserving the same; and also to consider and advise
                    the proper measures to be adopted for giving full force and effect in evidence,
                    in all courts of justice, to all such registers as might be found accurate and
                    faithful, and for facilitating the production and reception of the same.” The
                    commissioners have reported the result of their labours, from which report it
                    appears, that about 7000 non-parochial registers have been transmitted to them
                    for inspection from 3630 religious congregations, namely,</p>

                <p part="N">“Each of these registers,” says the Report, “was authenticated by a
                    certificate under the signature of the minister, or of some officer of the
                    church or denomination, from whom it was received; and this certificate was
                    generally accompanied by answers to the questions which had been circulated by
                    the commissioners.” After being “classed <pb break="no"

                    England and Wales, and entered in a book, with a careful annotation of any
                    particulars applicable to their state or custody,” they were “submitted to the
                    inspection of the board, by whom the question as to their admissibility was
                    discussed and recorded; and in every instance the chairman, or the commissioner
                    representing the chairman, authenticated such inspection and examination, by
                    affixing his initials to the first and last entry in each register; or if some
                    parts of the register appeared to be copies, or not to bear marks of
                    authenticity, he affixed his initials to such parts only as were deemed original
                    or authentic.” With respect to all such registers as have thus been examined and
                    deemed authentic, wholly or in part, the commissioners recommend, “that they be
                    kept together in some secure place of deposit, under the care of the
                    Registrar-General, or of some other officer to be appointed for that purpose,
                    that, under certain conditions, they be receivable in evidence in all courts of
                    justice:” that the authorized custos of these registers shall permit searches,
                    and grant certified extracts, on payment of moderate fees; and that on payment
                    of a reasonable fee he shall produce any original register deposited with him,
                    on <hi rend="italic">Subpeena</hi> or order of a competent tribunal: “that all
                    criminal proceedings shall be by production of the original: that in all other
                    cases, copies or extracts, certified by the officer having custody of the
                    original, shall, after notice, be receivable as evidence of the birth, baptism,
                    marriage, death, or burial to which it relates, subject to the following
                    regulations: that in courts of law, or at quarter-sessions, any party intending
                    to use any certified extract from any register before mentioned, in evidence, on
                    the trial of any cause, or hearing of any appeal, shall give notice in writing
                    to the opposite party, his attorney or agent, of his intention to use such
                    certified extract as evidence at such trial or hearing, and at the same time
                    shall deliver to him a copy of the extract, and of the certificate thereof, in
                    order that there may be a full opportunity to ascertain whether the
                    authenticity, genuineness, or correctness of the entry may be liable to
                    objection; and in proof of such notice and delivery, or on admission of the
                    receipt of such notice and copy, such certified extract shall be received in
                    evidence at the trial or hearing, provided the judge or court shall be of
                    opinion that such service had been made a reasonable time before such trial:
                    that in case any party, instead of making proof by certified extract, intends to
                    produce any original register in evidence, he shall nevertheless, within a
                    reasonable time, give to the opposite party notice of his intention, together
                    with a copy of a certified extract of the entry which he intends to offer in
                    evidence.” The recommendations respecting the admission of registers, or
                    certified extracts, in courts of equity, and in ecclesiastical courts, are:
                    similar in character, containing only such variations as the different practice
                    of those courts requires.</p>

                    within his commune. Births and deaths are registered in duplicate, the former
                    upon information, in the presence of two witnesses, and are signed in duplicate
                    by the informant, the two witnesses, and the registering officer; in the case of
                    deaths, one of the witnesses may be also the informant. Marriages are registered
                    in the presence of four witnesses, and signed by the parties, the witnesses, and
                    the registering officer. The register of births records the year, day, hour, and

                    and residences of parents, witnesses, and informant; the date of registration,

                    the father, from some person present and assisting at the birth, a declaration
                    thereof, within three days afterwards, to the registering officer, to whom the
                    child must also be shown.</p>

                    the commune to which it belongs; the other is transmitted to the tribunal of the

                    thence frames an abstract for his arrondissement, a copy of which he sends to
                    the prefect; he also from the abstracts of the arrondissement makes an abstract
                    for his department; and copies of such abstracts are sent by the prefects of
                    departments to be deposited in a central office at Paris.</p>

                    Belgium, Geneva, and the Rhenish provinces of Prussia when under the dominion of
                    France, and is still retained in those countries.</p>
                <p part="N">In Austria, registers of births, deaths, and marriages are kept by each
                    minister of the church for his parish, and also by the Jewish rabbin for those
                    of their own persuasion.</p>

                    of the parents; their religion; and the names, and surnames, and condition of
                    the sponsors. In the case of illegitimate children, the name of the father
                    cannot be entered unless he acknowledges the paternity.</p>
                <p part="N">The register of deaths records the year, month, and day of death; the

                    supplied, the name of the fatal disease. For this purpose medical men are
                    required to inform the minister, in writing, of the cause of death of such
                    patients as they have attended.</p>

                    the production of the registers of births, deaths, and marriages. The provincial
                    authorities are also required to ascertain whether these registers are kept in

                    marriages, and deaths, of persons who are not of the established church, but who
                    are “simply tolerated,” on the declaration of the parties or their ministers,
                    and to include these declarations in his annual returns. Duplicates of the
                    registers are to be made, and at the end of each year deposited, when examined
                    and verified, in the local civil court, being “the tribunal of the place.”</p>
