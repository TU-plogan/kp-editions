                <p part="N"><label type="entry">RISIBLE</label> any thing capable of exciting
                    laughter. <hi rend="italic">Ludicrous</hi> is a general term, signifying, as may
                    appear from its derivation, what is playsome, sportive, or jocular. <hi
                        rend="italic">Ludi-</hi><hi rend="italic">crous</hi> therefore seems the
                    genus, of which <hi rend="italic">risible</hi> is a species, limited to what
                    makes us laugh.</p>
                <p part="N">However easy it may be, concerning any particular object, to say whether
                    it be risible or not, it seems difficult, if at all practicable, to establish
                    any general character, by which objects of that kind may be distinguished from
                    others. Nor is that a singular case; for, upon a review, we find the same
                    difficulty in most of the articles already handled. There is nothing more easy,
                    viewing a particular object, than to pronounce that it is beautiful or ugly,
                    grand or little; but were we to attempt general rules for ranging objects under
                    different classes according to these qualities, we should be much gravelled. A
                    separate cause increases the difficulty of distinguishing risible objects by a
                    general character: all men are not equally affected by risible objects, nor the
                    same man at all times; for in high spirits a thing will make him laugh aloud,
                    which will scarcely provoke a smile in a grave mood. Risible objects, however,
                    are circumscribed within certain limits. No object is risible but what appears
                    slight, little, or trivial; for we laugh at nothing that is of importance to our
                    own interest or to that of others. Real distress raises pity, and therefore
                    cannot be risible; but a slight or imaginary distress, which moves not pity, is
                    risible. The adventure of the fulling-mills in Don Quixote is extremely risible;
                    so is the scene where Sancho, in a dark night, tumbling into a pit, and
                    attaching himself to the side by hand and foot, hangs there in terrible dismay
                    till the morning, when he discovers himself to be within a foot of the bottom. A
                    nose remarkably long or short is risible; but to want it altogether, so far from
                    provoking laughter, raises horror in the spectator. With respect to works both
                    of nature and art, none of them is risible but such as are out of rule; some
                    remarkable defect or excess, a very long visage, for example, or a very short
                    one. Hence nothing just, proper, decent, beautiful, proportioned, or grand, is
                    risible.</p>
                <p part="N">Even from this slight sketch it will be readily conjectured, that the
                    emotion raised by a risible object is of a nature so singular as scarcely to
                    find place while the mind is occupied with any other passion or emotion; and the
                    conjecture is verified by experience; for we scarcely ever find that emotion
                    blended with any other. One emotion we must except; and that is, contempt raised
                    by certain improprieties: every improper act inspires us with some degree of
                    contempt for the author; and if an improper act be at the same time so risible
                    as to provoke laughter, of which blunders and absurdities are noted instances,
                    the two emotions of contempt and of laughter unite intimately in the mind, and
                    produce externally what is termed a <hi rend="italic">laugh of derision</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">of scorn.</hi> Hence objects that cause laughter may be
                    distinguished into two kinds: they are either <hi rend="italic">risible</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">ridiculous.</hi> A risible object is mirthful only; a
                    ridiculous object is both mirthful and contemptible. The first raises an emotion
                    of laughter that is altogether pleasant: the pleasant emotion of laughter raised
                    by the other is blended with the painful emotion of contempt, and the mixed
                    emotion is termed <hi rend="italic">the emotion of ridicule.</hi> The pain which
                    a ridiculous object gives me is resented and punished by a laugh of derision. A
                    risible object, on the other hand, gives me no pain; it is rendered altogether
                    pleasant by a certain titillation, which is expressed externally by mirthful
                    laughter.</p>
