                    person distinguished for his laborious researches in natural science, was born
                    at Rochelle in 1683, being descended of a family belonging to the law. After
                    having finished his early studies in the place of his birth, he began a course
                    of philosophy at Poitiers, and one of civil law at Bourges; but he soon
                    relinquished the latter to apply himself to mathematics, physics, and natural
                    history. Having come to Paris, he was received into the Academy of Sciences in
                    1708. From that hour he was wholly employed in natural history, to which his
                    inclination particularly led him; and his inquiries were not confined to any one
                    part of the subject. His memoirs, his observations, his discoveries on the
                    formation of shells, spiders, muscles, the marine flea, the berry which affords
                    the purple colour, and on the cause of the numbness of the torpedo, excited the
                    curiosity of the public, and early procured our author the character of an able,
                    curious, and entertaining naturalist. Filled with zeal for the welfare and
                    advantage of society, and for the progress and perfection of arts, he
                    endeavoured in all his researches to promote the public good. The public were
                    indebted to him for the discovery of the turquois mines in Languedoc. He also
                    foιmd out a substance, now used to give false stones a colour, which is obtained
                    from a certain fish called in the French <hi rend="italic">able</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">ablete</hi> on account of its whiteness, and which is the <hi
                        rend="italic">bleak</hi> or <hi rend="italic">blay</hi> of our writers. His
                    experiments on the art of turning iron into steel obtained him a pension of
                    twelve thousand livres; and this reward was to be continued to the Academy to
                    support the expense which might accrue in this art.</p>
                <p part="N">He continued his inquiries on the art of making tin and porcelain, and
                    endeavoured to render our thermometers more useful than those of former times.
                    He composed a curious history of rivers where gold-dust is found in France; and
                    he gave so simple and so easy a detail of the art of gathering this dust, that
                    persons have been employed for that purpose. He also made curious and important
                    observations on the nature of flints; on the banks of fossil shells, whence is
                    obtained in Touraine an excellent manure for land; and likewise on birds and
                    their preservation, on their method of building nests, on insects, and a great
                    number <hi rend="italic">of</hi> other subjects, not less curious than
                    useful.</p>
                <p part="N">He at first imagined that a certain varnish would keep eggs fresh; but
                    the waste of time and money showed him the inconvenience of such a process. He
                    afterwards adopted the method practised from time immemorial in Greece and the
                    islands of the Archipelago, which is to steep or im<pb break="no"

                    means, not being exposed to the air or to frost, they are well preserved, and
                    contract no bad taste or smell. Another experiment, still more important, made
                    by our author, was to introduce into France the art of hatching fowls and birds,
                    as practised in Egypt, without covering the eggs. Active, sedulous, and
                    attentive, he was early in his study, often at six in the morning. Exact in his
                    experiments and observations, he let no circumstance escape him. His writings
                    must be of great use to future philosophers. In society he was distinguished
                    through life for his modest and agreeable behaviour. His probity, benevolence,
                    goodness of heart, and other amiable qualities, as well natural as acquired,
                    endeared him to his countrymen. He died in the seventy-sixth year of his age, on
                    the 18th of October 1757, and left this world filled with sentiments of piety.
                    His death was the consequence of a fall, which happened at the castle of
                    Bar-nardière on the Maine, where he went to pass his vocation. He bequeathed to
                    the Academy of Sciences his manuscripts and all his natural productions. His
                    works are, 1. A very great number of memoirs, and observations on different
                    parts of natural history, printed in the collections of the Academy of Sciences;
                    and, 2. A large work printed separately in six vols. 4to, entitled a Natural
                    History of Insects. This important work contains a description of vast numbers
                    of caterpillars, moths, gall-insects, flies with two and four wings, lady-birds,
                    and those ephemeron flies which live only in that form a few hours; and, lastly,
                    of those singular and wonderful insects which are called <hi rend="italic"
                        >polypes,</hi> which being cut into several pieces, each piece lives, grows,
                    and becomes an insect, and affords to our eyes a great number of prodigies. The
                    works of M. de Reaumur are exact, curious, interesting, and exceedingly
                    ingenious. They are written with much candour, clearness, and elegance; but it
                    must be acknowledged that his manner is somewhat too diffuse. We must not
                    deceive the reader. He often raises our expectations, and does not give us all
                    the satisfaction which we promise ourselves from his writings. His method of
                    raising poultry, in particular, rather disappoints us. He spared neither care,
                    time, nor expense, to render it practicable. He flattered himself and his
                    countrymen with the greatest hopes; but, notwithstanding his assiduous industry
                    and vast charges, it proved abortive. M. PAdvocat recommended him to ob tain
                    from Egypt better information on the subject, and if possible to procure a
                    person versed in the art to instruct him in it; but his death prevented the
                    completion of the scheme. If any native of Egypt had arrived, showed M. de
                    Reaumur a better method than his own, and practised it with success, as in his
                    country, the community would have been benefited; on the other hand, he would
                    have seen, if it had tailed, that the climate of France was not proper for such
                    experiments. M. Maillet, consul at Cairo, to whom the regent had written to
                    obtain the art, offered to send over a native of Egypt, if the government would
                    pay the expense of his voyage, and allow him a pension of 1500 livres. M.
                    Mailletjudged rightly when he preferred this method of proceeding. M. de Reaumur
                    was not ignorant of the design, but he flattered himself that his efforts would
                    be successful without further aid, and thought he should acquire some honour. He
                    certainly had great talents, industry, sagacity, and every other requisite which
                    is necessary in such attempts; but it is morally impossible that a single man,
                    in a different climate, can attain such knowledge in an art as those who live in
                    a more favourable country, and have had the experience of many ages to profit
                    by. Yet, however unsuccessful M. de Reaumur may have been, posterity is indebted
                    to him for his repeated trials. He has removed some difficulties in the road,
                    and those who travel it may discover what he only saw at a distance.</p>
