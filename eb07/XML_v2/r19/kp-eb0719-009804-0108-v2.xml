                    and a great propagator of the doctrines of Descartes, was born in Agenois in the
                    year 1632. Hestudied languages and philosophy under the Jesuits at Cahors; and
                    as his views were then directed to the church, he was afterwards occupied in the
                    study of divinity at the university of that town. His progress in learning was
                    so uncommon, that at the end of four years he was offered a doctor’s degree
                    without the usual charges; but he did not think it became him to accept of it
                    till he had also studied in the Sorbonne at Paris. He went thither, but was soon
                    disgusted with theology; and as the philosophy of Descartes began at that time
                    to make a noise, in consequence of the lectures of Rohault, he conceived a taste
                    for, and gave himself up entirely to, the study of it. He frequented these
                    lectures; and becoming an adept, went to Toulouse in 1666, and read lectures
                    himself. Having fine parts, a clear and fluent manner, and a happy way of making
                    himself understood, he attracted all sorts of people; the magistrates, the
                    learned, the ecclesiastics, and the very women, who now all affected to abjure
                    the ancient philosophy. In 1680 he returned to Paris, where the concourse which
                    flocked to him was such that the sticklers for the peripatetic philosophy began
                    to be alarmed. They applied to the Archbishop of Paris, who thought it
                    expedient, in the name of the king, to put a stop to the lectures, which
                    accordingly were discontinued for several months. The whole life of Regis was
                    spent in propagating the new philosophy. In 1690 he published a formal system
                    thereof, containing logic, metaphysics, physics, and morals, in three volumes
                    4∙to, written in French. It was reprinted the year after, at Amsterdam, with the
                    addition of a discourse upon ancient and modern philosophy. He wrote afterwards
                    several pieces in defence of his system, in which he had disputes with M. Huet,
                    Duhamel, Malebranche, and others. His works, though abounding with ingenuity and
                    learning, have been disregarded, in consequence of the great discoveries and
                    advancement in philosophical knowledge which have since been made. He had been
                    chosen member of the Academy of Sciences in 1699, and he died in 1707.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides his System of Philosophy, he wrote the following works: The Use
                    of Reason and of Faith; an Answer to Huet’s Censures of the Cartesian
                    Philosophy; an Answer to DuhameVs Critical Reflections; some pieces against
                    Malebranche, to show that the apparent magnitude of an object depends solely on
                    the magnitude of its image traced upon the retina; and a small piece upon the
                    question, Whether Pleasure constitutes our present Happiness?</p>
