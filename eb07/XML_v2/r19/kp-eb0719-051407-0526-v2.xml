                    the Flemish painters, was born in the year 1577, but whether at Antwerp or
                    Cologne is uncertain. His father, who was a counsellor in the senate of Antwerp,
                    had been forced by the civil wars to seek refuge in Cologne; and during his

                    Verhaecht, a painter of architecture and of landscape. He next became the pupil
                    of Adam Van Oort; but he soon found that the abilities of this master were
                    insufficient to answer his elevated ideas. His surly temper, too, was dis<pb

                    with his own, he became the disciple of Octavio Van Veen, generally known by the
                    name of Otho Venius, a painter of singular merit, and who was not only skilled
                    in the principles of his art, but also distinguished for learning and other
                    accomplishments. Between the master and the scholar a remarkable similarity
                    appeared in temper and inclination; indeed the whole turn of their minds was the
                    same. It was this congeniality of sentiments which animated Rubens with that
                    ardent passion for the art of painting which at length determined him to pursue
                    it as a profession. From this time he gave up his whole mind to it; and so
                    successful were his exertions, that he soon equalled his master.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to arrive at that perfection which he already beheld in idea,
                    it became requisite to study the productions of the most eminent artists; and
                    for this purpose he travelled throughout Italy, visiting the most valuable
                    collections of paintings and antique statues with which that country
                    abounds.</p>
                <p part="N">Sandrat, who was intimately acquainted with Rubens, informs us that he
                    was recommended to the Duke of Mantua by the Archduke Albert, who had witnessed
                    his talents in the finishing of some fine paintings designed for his own palace.
                    At Mantua he was received by the duke with the most flattering marks of
                    distinction, and had opportunities of improving himself, which he did not
                    neglect. He there carefully studied the works of Julio Romano; and he next
                    visited Rome, where he had an opportunity of examining the productions of
                    Raffaelle. The paintings of Titian and Paul Veronese called him to Venice, where
                    he improved himself in the art of colouring.</p>
                <p part="N">He continued in Italy seven years. At length receiving intelligence that
                    his mother was taken ill, he hastened to Antwerp. But his filial affection was
                    not gratified with a sight of her. She died before his arrival. He married soon
                    afterwards; but his wife dying at the end of four years, he retired for some
                    time from Antwerp, and endeavoured to soothe his melancholy by a journey to
                    Holland. At Utrecht he visited Hurtort, whom he greatly esteemed.</p>
                <p part="N">The fame of Rubens was now spread all over Europe. He was invited by
                    Mary de’ Medici, queen of Henry IV. of France, to Paris, where he painted the
                    galleries in the palace of Luxembourg. These form a series of paintings which
                    delineate the history of Mary; and afford a convincing proof how well qualified
                    he was to excel in allegorical and emblematical compositions. Whilst at Paris he
                    became acquainted with the Duke of Buckingham, who was so taken with his great
                    talents and accomplishments, that he judged him well qualified to explain to
                    Isabella, the wife of Albert the archduke, the cause of the misunderstanding
                    which had taken place between the courts of England and Spain. In this
                    employment Rubens acquitted himself with such propriety, that Isabella appointed
                    him envoy to the king of Spain, with a commission to propose terms of peace, and
                    to bring back the instructions of that monarch. Philip was not less captivated
                    with Rubens, conferring on him the honour of knighthood, and making him
                    secretary to his privy council. Rubens returned to Brussels, and thence passed
                    over into England in 1630 with a commission from the Catholic king to negotiate
                    a peace between the two crowns. He was successful in his negotiation, and a
                    treaty was concluded. Charles I. who then filled the British throne, could not
                    receive Rubens in a public character on account of his profession; nevertheless,
                    he treated him with every mark of respect. Having engaged him to paint some of
                    the apartments of Whitehall, he not only gave him a handsome sum of money, but,
                    as an acknowledgment of his merit, created him a knight; and the Duke of
                    Buckingham, his friend and patron, purchased of him a collection of pictures,
                    statues, medals, and antiques, for the sum of ten thousand pounds.</p>
                <p part="N">He returned to Spain, where he was magnificently honoured arid rewarded
                    for his services, being created a gentleman of the king’s bed-chamber, and named
                    secretary to the council of state in the Netherlands. Rubens, however, did not
                    lay aside his profession. He returned to Antwerp, where he married a second
                    wife, called Helena Forment, who, being an eminent beauty, helped him much in
                    the figures of his women. But he died on the 30th of May 1640, in the
                    sixty-third year of his age, leaving vast riches to his children. Albert his
                    eldest son succeeded him in the office of secretary of state in Flanders.</p>
                <p part="N">As Rubens was possessed of all the ornaments and advantages that render
                    a man worthy to be esteemed or courted, he was always treated as a person of
                    consequence. His figure was noble, his manners engaging, and his conversation
                    lively. His learning was universal. Though his favourite study must have
                    occupied him much, yet he found time to read the works of the most celebrated
                    authors, especially the poets. He spoke several languages perfectly, and was an
                    able statesman, as well as an excellent painter. His house at Antwerp was
                    enriched with every thing that was rare and valuable in the arts. It contained
                    one spacious apartment, in imitation of the rotunda at Rome, adorned with a
                    choice collection of pictures which he had purchased in Italy, part of which he
                    sold to the Duke of Buckingham.</p>
                <p part="N">His genius qualified him to excel equally in every thing that can enter
                    into the composition of a picture. His invention was so fertile, that, if he had
                    occasion to paint the same subject several times, his imagination always
                    supplied him with something striking and new. The attitudes of his figures are
                    natural and varied, the carriage of the head is peculiarly graceful, and his
                    expression is noble and animated.</p>
                <p part="N">He is by all allowed to have carried the art of colouring to its highest
                    pitch. He understood so thoroughly the true principles of the chiaro-scuro, that
                    he gave to his figures the utmost harmony, and a prominence resembling real
                    life. His pencil is mellowed, his strokes are bold and easy, his carnation glows
                    with life, and his drapery is simple but grand, broad, and hung with much skill.
                    The great excellence of Rubens appears in his grand compositions. For as they
                    are to be viewed at a distance, he laid on a proper body of colours with
                    uncommon boldness, and fixed all his tints in their proper places; so that he
                    never impaired their lustre by breaking or torturing them, but touched them in
                    such a manner as to give them a lasting force, beauty, and harmony.</p>
                <p part="N">It is generally allowed that Rubens wanted correctness in drawing and
                    designing; some of his figures being heavy and too short, and the limbs in
                    certain parts not being justly sketched in the outline. Though he had spent
                    seven years in Italy in studying those antiques by which other celebrated
                    artists had modelled their taste, and though he had examined them with such
                    minute attention as not only to perceive their beauties, but to be qualified to
                    describe them in a dissertation which he wrote on that subject; yet he seems
                    never to have divested himself of that heavy style of painting which, being
                    peculiar to his native country, he had insensibly acquired. The astonishing
                    rapidity too with which he painted, made him fall into inaccuracies, from which
                    those works that he finished with care are entirely exempted. Amongst his
                    finished pieces may be mentioned the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ between the Two
                    Thieves; but of all his works the paintings in the palace of Luxembourg best
                    display his genius and his style.</p>
                <p part="N">It is the observation of Algarotti, that he was more moderate in his
                    movements than Tintoretto, and softer in his chiaro-scuro than Carravaggio; but
                    not so rich in his com <pb break="no"

                    Paul Veronese, in his carnations less true than Titian, and less delicate
                    than</p>
                <p part="N">" Vandyck. Yet he contrived to give his colours the utmost transparency
                    and harmony, notwithstanding their extraordinary deepness; and he possessed a
                    strength and grandeur of style which were entirely his own. See the article
