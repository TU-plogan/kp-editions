                    language with propriety, force, and elegance.</p>
                <p part="N">“We must not judge so unfavourably of eloquence or good reading,” says
                    Fénélon, “as to reckon it only a frivolous art, that a declaimer uses to impose
                    upon the weak imagination of the multitude, and to serve his own ends. It is a
                    very serious art, designed to instruct people; to suppress their passions and
                    reform their manners; to support the laws, direct public councils, and to make
                    men good and happy.”</p>
                <p part="N">Reason and experience equally demonstrate, that delivery in reading
                    ought to be less animated than in interested speaking. In every exercise of the
                    faculty of speech, and those expressions of countenance and gesture with which
                    it is generally attended, we may be considered as being always in one of the two
                    following situations: First, delivering our bosom sentiments on circumstances
                    which relate to ourselves or others; or, secondly, repeating something that was
                    spoken on a certain occasion for the amusement or information of an auditor.
                    Now, if we observe the deliveries natural to these two situations, we shall
                    find, that the first may be accompanied with every degree of expression which
                    can manifest itself in us, from the lowest of sympathy to the most violent and
                    energetic of the superior passions; whilst the latter, from the speaker’s chief
                    business being to repeat what he heard with accuracy, discovers only a faint
                    imitation of those signs of the emotions which we suppose agitated him from whom
                    the words were first borrowed. The use and necessity of this difference of
                    manner is evident; and if we are attentive to these natural signs of expression,
                    we shall find them conforming with the greatest nicety to the slightest and most
                    minute movements of the breast.</p>
                <p part="N">This repetition of another’s words might be supposed to pass through the
                    mouth of a second or third person; and in these cases, since they were not ear
                    and eye witnesses of him who first spoke them, their manner of delivery would
                    want the advantage necessarily arising from an immediate idea of the original
                    one; hence, for the reason stated, this would be of still less lively
                    representation than that of the first ' repeater. But as, from a daily
                    observation of every variety of speech and its associated signs of emotion,
                    mankind soon become pretty well acquainted with them, and this in different
                    degrees, according to their discernment, sensibility, &amp;c. experience shows
                    us that these latter repeaters, as we call them, might conceive and employ a
                    manner of delivery which, though less characteristic perhaps, would on the whole
                    be noways inferior to the first, as to the common natural expression proper for
                    their situation. It appears, therefore, that repeaters of every degree may be
                    esteemed upon a level as to animation, and that our twofold distinction above
                    specified contains accurately enough the whole variety of ordinary delivery. We
                    say ordinary, because there is another very peculiar kind of delivery sometimes
                    used in the person of a repeater, and of which it will in this place be
                    necessary to take some notice. What we mean here is mimicry; an accomplishment
                    which, when perfectly and properly displayed, never fails of yielding a high
                    degree of pleasure. But since this pleasure chiefly results from the principle
                    of imitation respecting manner, and not from the purport of the matter
                    communicated; and since, comparatively speaking, it is only attainable by few
                    persons, and practised only on j&gt;articular occasions; upon these accounts it
                    must be refused a place amongst the modes of useful delivery taught us by
                    nature, and must be esteemed a qualification purely anomalous.</p>
                <p part="N">These distinctions with regard to a speaker’s situation of mind being
                    premised, let us see to which of them an author and his reader may mest properly
                    be referred, and how they are circumstanced with regard to one another.</p>
                <p part="N">The matter of all books is, either what the author says in his own
                    person, or an acknowledged recital of the words of others; and hence an author
                    may be esteemed both an original speaker and a repeater, according as what he
                    writes is of the first or second kind. Now a reader must be supposed either
                    actually to personate the author, or one whose office is barely to communicate
                    what he has said to an auditor. But in the first of these suppositions he would,
                    in the delivery of what was the author’s own, evidently commence mimic; which
                    being, as above observed, a character not generally acknowledged in this
                    department, ought to be rejected as on the whole improper. The other supposition
                    therefore must be accounted right; and then, as to the whole matter of the book,
                    the reader is found to be exactly in the situation of a repeater, save that he
                    takes what he delivers from the page before him instead of his memory. It
                    follows, then, in proof of our initial proposition, that if we are directed by
                    nature and propriety, the manner of our delivery in reading ought to be inferior
                    in warmth and energy to what we should use, were the language the spontaneous
                    effusion of our own hearts in the circumstances of those out of whose mouths it
                    is supposed to proceed.</p>
                <p part="N">Evident as the purport of this reasoning is, it has not so much as been
                    glanced at by the writers on the subject we are now entered upon, or any of its
                    kindred ones; which has occasioned a manifest want of accuracy in several of
                    their rules and observations. Amongst the rest, this precept has long been
                    reverberated from author to author as a perfect standard for propriety in
                    reading: “Deliver yourselves in the same manner you would do, were the matter
                    your own original sentiments uttered directly from the heart.” As all kinds of
                    delivery must have many things in common, the rule will in many articles be
                    undoubtedly right; but, from what has been said above, it must as certainly be
                    faulty in respect to several others; as it is evident nature never confounds by
                    like signs two tilings so very different as a copy and an original, an emanation
                    darted immediately from the sun, and its weaker appearance in the lunar
                    reflection.</p>

                    where it is joined by the Kennet, in a fine situation rising gradually from the
                    river, and is one of the most cheerful and well-built towns of its size in

                    and blanketing; and some barge-building. It has a corporation, consisting of a
                    mayor, three aldermen, and seventeen councillors, and returns two members to the
                    House of Commons. There are markets on Wednesday and on Saturday, which are well
