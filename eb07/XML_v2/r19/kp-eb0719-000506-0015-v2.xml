                    poet, was born at Ferte-Milon on the 21st of December. 1630. He was the son of
                    John Racine, controller of the salt magazine of that city, and of Joan Sconin,
                    daughter of the king’s warden of thewoods and waters Of Villers-Caterets.
                    Deprived of his father and mother at the early age of three, he passed under
                    tile guardianship of his paternal grandfather, also named John Racine, who, not
                    long afterwards, bequeathed the trust to his widow. He studied first at
                    Beauvais; next at Paris, in the college of Fearcount; and lastly at
                    Port-Royal-des-Champs, whither a number of eminent persons had retired to devote
                    themselves to piety and the instruction of youth, amongst whom were the advocate
                    Lemaitre, Dr. Hamon, Nicole, Lacy, and Launcelot, authors of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Logic,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">General Grammar,</hi> and
                    other works, known under the title of <hi rend="italic">Me· thodes de
                        Port-Royal.</hi> Launcelot, in particular, undertook to teach Greek to the
                    youthful Racine. But besides the taste for sound literature and serious studies,
                    these mn-mortal solitaries inspired their pupil with those religious principles
                    which never abandoned him, and which were common to an the great writers and
                    great men of that age. The docility of Racine towards his masters equalled his
                    ardour for study. On one occasion, however, he showed himself refractory. Having
                    accidentally met with the Greek romance of <hi rend="italic">Theagenes and
                        Chariclea,</hi> he commenced the perusal of this work of fiction, when his
                    master surprising him, whilst thus engaged, took from him the book, and
                    consigned it to the flames. The youth procured another copy, and learned it by
                    heart, after which he placed it in the hands of Launcelot, saying, “You may bum
                    this also.” An act of disobedience of a kind so novel was the more readily
                    excused because it was not likely to have many imitators.</p>
                <p part="N">The first poetical essay of Racine was <hi rend="italic">La Nymphe de la
                        Seine,</hi> an ode which he composed for the marriage of Louis XIV. and
                    which having made him known to Chaplain, the temporary arbiter of literary
                    reputations and court favours, produced him a hundred louis, which Colbert sent
                    him on the part of the king; and not long afterwards, he received a pension of
                    six hundred livres. Four years later, towards the close of 1663, another ode,
                        <hi rend="italic">La Renommée aux Muses,</hi> composed on the occasion of
                    the establishment of the three Academies, procured for him a second royal
                    gratuity, the order for which was couched in terms peculiarly flattering to the
                    youthful poet. This ode, though inferior to the preceding, was nevertheless more
                    fortunate. Recompensed, like the other, by the king, it had the good fortune to
                    be criticised by Boileau. The poet took an early opportunity to thank the
                    critic, and this proved the origin of that connexion so intimate, so honourable,
                    so useful to Racine, and which was not one of the least advantages which fortune
                    gave him over Corneille. A little before this period, Racine had made the
                    acquaintance of Molière, and had communicated to him a tragedy, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Theagene et Chari-clee,</hi> taken from the romance, which had
                    afforded him such delight at Port-Royal. Molière, disapproving of this
                    production, gave him the plan of the <hi rend="italic">Thébaide, ou les Frères
                        Ennemis,</hi> a subject on which it is alleged that he had himself been
                    engaged. Racine executed the design, and the piece had some success. <hi
                        rend="italic">Alexandre,</hi> which was performed the following year, 1665,
                    met with a still more favourable reception, and showed great progress in the
                    versification of the author, who was then only twenty-five years of age. But,
                    excepting the verses, neither of these works gave any indication of what Racine
                    afterwards proved. They were but feeble imitations of Corneille, of whom, by a
                    misfortune common to all imitators, Racine had only adopted the defects; that
                    is, the cold gallantry mixed with heroism, the idle maxims, the metaphysical
                    reasonings, and the elaborate declamation. Corneille, to whom Racine read his
                        <hi rend="italic">Alexandre,</hi> counselled him, it is said, to write no
                    more tragedies. At a subsequent period the same advice was given to Voltaire by
                    Fontenelle, after the reading of <hi rend="italic">Brutus.</hi> But it is
                    fortunate for letters that such counsels are never followed. Voltaire replied to
                    Fontenelle by the production of <hi rend="italic">Zaire,</hi> and Racine
                    responded to Comeille by that of his <hi rend="italic">Andro-maque.</hi> Finding
                    himself pursuing a wrong direction, he suddenly changed his route and took a
                    different one, unknown perhaps even to Comeille himself. The latter had
                    astonished and surprised his audience; his young rival sought to move and to
                    soften them. Pity appeared to him a tragic resource more active, more extensive,
                    and of an effect more penetrating and less transitory, than admiration. He
                    studied the human heart, its passions, its weaknesses, and its most secret
                    recesses, and there he discovered a species of tragedy altogether new, of which
                    he gave the first and probably most inimitable model in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Andromaque;</hi> that one of all his tragedies which, without being the
                    most perfect, produces the greatest effect on the stage, by the vigorous and
                    just expression of the sentiments and characters, and by the alternations of
                    hope and fear, of terror and pity, with which the poet agitates the soul.</p>
                <p part="N">The representation of the <hi rend="italic">Andromaque</hi> in 1667, was
                    followed almost every year by a new masterpiece. But at first Racine surprised
                    the public by an excursion into the domain of Molière. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Plaideurs,</hi> imitated from the <hi rend="italic">Wasps</hi> of
                    Aristophanes, is a comedy the plot of which is somewhat feeble and inartificial;
                    but in nature, truth, facility, and <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=16"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0719-0016-0006"/>gaiety, it is admirable, and its verses became
                    so fixed in the general mind that they passed into proverbs. The piece was first
                    represented at Paris in 1668, when it was indifferently received; but it
                    succeeded pretty well at Versailles, and the players, elated with the success,
                    came to awaken Racine in the middle of the night, to communicate the good news.
                    The noise of vehicles at such an hour, in the Rue des Marais, convinced first
                    the neighbours, and next day all Paris, that justice had avenged itself on the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Plaideurs,</hi> by causing him to be seized and
                    sent to the Bastille. This pleasant mistake, and the knowledge which soon became
                    general, that the comedy had obtained the suffrage of the monarch, conciliated
                    the favour of the loyal Parisians; and from that time the piece has continued in
                    possession of the stage, privileged to extort a smile, perchance a laugh, even
                    from the iron visage of justice herself It is not true, as has sometimes been
                    said, that the <hi rend="italic">Plaideurs</hi> is the work of several hands.
                    Racine may have received from his friends hints or suggestions for some scenes,
                    and borrowed from certain <hi rend="italic">hommes de palais,</hi> or gentlemen
                    of the robe, some formulas and expressions foreign to his habitual studies; but
                    the unity of the style and the general coherence of the whole are too perfect to
                    be the work of any but one and the same hand.</p>
                <p part="N">The success of the <hi rend="italic">Andromaque,</hi> which was only
                    equalled by that of the <hi rend="italic">Cid,</hi> had excited envy; perhaps,
                    also, it had rendered the public fastidious. In 1669, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Britannicus</hi> was coldly received, and with difficulty reached the
                    eighth representation. At first no one felt the truth, the depth, and the force
                    displayed in the magnificent historical picture of Nero and his court. Boileau
                    alone was struck with its merit, and hurrying to embrace Racine, he exclaimed,
                    “Voila ce que vous avez fait de mieux.” This great critic was not only useful to
                    Racine in praising his performance, his severity was of full more service in
                    inducing him to suppress two scenes which deformed his work; one between Burrhus
                    and Narcissa, at the commencement of the third act; and another, in the fifth,
                    in which Junia is brought back into the presence of Nero. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Britannicus</hi> was followed by <hi rend="italic">Berenice,</hi> which, in
                    some respects, is one of the most remarkable of Racine’s works. At the
                    solicitation of the celebrated Henrietta of England, Racine and Corneille both
                    treated this subject which is so little fitted for representation, neither being
                    aware that the other was engaged upon it. Besides the pleasure of seeing two
                    illustrious rivals unconsciously contending for the palm, this princess secretly
                    promised herself another, in the treatment of the heroic separation of the two
                    august lovers; but a premature death deprived her of the pleasure she had
                    anticipated, in witnessing this singular competition. Three words of Suetonius
                    represent the subject of the piece: <hi rend="italic">Invitus invitam
                        dimisit;</hi> too slight a foundation upon which to work, and in the case of
                    Corneille, who was now old, an ungrateful task, far more dangerous to him than
                    even to Racine. The two rival plays were represented towards the close of 1670;
                    that of Corneille at the Palais-Royal, by the company of Molière, and that of
                    Racine at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. Corneille’s totally failed; that of Racine had
                    thirty consecutive representations, during which it drew tears alike from the
                    court and the city. The great Conde replied to some criticisms which were made
                    in his hearing in the following verses of the piece itself:</p>
                <p part="N">Depuis cinq ans entiers chaque jour je la vois,</p>
                <p part="N">Et crois toujours la voir pour la première fois.</p>
                <p part="N">It has been said, and even zealous admirers of Racine have confessed,
                    that <hi rend="italic">Berenice</hi> was not a veritable tragedy. But, tragedy
                    or drama, what signifies the title which maybe given to it, provided we be
                    agreed that it is a miracle of art, and that never, in any piece, were greater
                    difficulties more meritoriously overcome. The style possesses exquisite beauties
                    in detail, and an inexpressible charm pervades the diction throughout.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Bajazet</hi> appeared in 1672, and obtained immediate
                    vogue, partly, no doubt, from the novelty of the manners and costumes, but in a
                    greater degree, from admiration of the force and truth with which the poet had
                    delineated the characters of Roxana and Acomat; two real creations, which, in
                    spite of all its faults, will make <hi rend="italic">Bgjazet</hi> immortal. At
                    the same time, there is not a little truth in the remark of Corneille, that
                    though the costumes be Turkish, the characters are French. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mithridate,</hi> which was represented for the first time in January 1678,
                    is, according to Lallarpe, the work where Racine appears to have come nearest to
                    Corneille in bringing on the stage the great personages of antiquity, as they
                    are delineated in history. Few characters, indeed, have, upon the whole, been
                    more vigorously traced than that of Mithridates; and were it not that Racine,
                    sacrificing to the taste of the time, has made the hero amorous and jealous,
                    Corneille would not have enjoyed unquestioned supremacy in reviving and
                    reanimating history. Voltaire regards <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie,</hi> first
                    represented in 1674, as the masterpiece of the stage. Do we desire grandeur? We
                    find it in Achilles. Do we wish for true policy? It is exemplified in the part
                    of Ulysses; a policy founded solely on the love of the public good, and equally
                    adroit, dignified, and resolute. Clytem-nestra is the model of the lofty
                    pathetic; Iphigenia, that of noble and touching simplicity. Agamemnon is as he
                    should be; and, then as to the style, Voltaire has declared it to be the true
                    sublime. Three years elapsed between tile appearance of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Iphigénie</hi> and that of <hi rend="italic">Phèdre,</hi> which was first
                    represented in 1677. The former had been the object of sundry ill-natured and
                    depreciatory criticisms; but all these were only a feeble essay, or rather a
                    mere foretaste, of the attacks which were now directed against the latter,
                    chiefly at the instigation of the Duke de Nevers and the Duchess de Bouillon,
                    nephew and niece of Cardinal Mazarin, the declared enemies of Racine, though for
                    what reason does not appear. Every engine was put in action to ensure the
                    condemnation of Racine’s <hi rend="italic">Phèdre,</hi> and extol to the skies
                    that of Pradon, a person of no genius, and whose name is not worth remembering,
                    except that he was employed by the chiefs of his odious cabal to have a drama on
                    the same subject ready for representation against the time when Racine’s was to
                    appear. Pradon lent himself to the vengeance of these intriguers; his <hi
                        rend="italic">Phèdre</hi> was represented four days after that of Racine;
                    and, for the moment, the cabal were successful. But, in about a year, each piece
                    found its natural level, and Pradon and his <hi rend="italic">Phèdre</hi> were
                    alike forgotten or despised.</p>
                <p part="N">This tardy reparation, however, could not console Racine; and, besides,
                    it was poisoned by new indignities, which were heaped upon him by his
                    indefatigable enemies. Disgusted with the theatre, where he had met with such
                    injustice, he now determined to renounce it for ever; though not more than
                    thirty-eight years of age, and still in all the vigour and maturity of his
                    genius. Besides, in his infancy, he had imbibed a deep sense of religion, which,
                    suppressed for a while by his connexion with the theatre, now returned in full
                    force. He conceived that his past life had been full of errors, nay, even
                    tainted by vices, and, under this impression he not only resolved to write no
                    more plays, but had even thoughts of devoting himself to penitence and prayer in
                    monastic solitude. His spiritual guide, however, justly distrusting a zeal
                    springing out of wounded feelings, advised him to marry and settle in the world;
                    and this judicious advice Racine had the good sense to comply withal. In the
                    year 1677 he married the daughter of the treasurer of Amiens, a fortunate
                    choice, which greatly contributed to his future happiness. He next effected a
                    reconciliation with the solitaries of Port-Royal, whose censures of dramatic
                    composition, which had formerly offended him, he now acknow<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=17"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0719-0017-0007"/>ledged. He first made his peace with Nicole,
                    who received him with open arms; and Boileau introduced him to Ar-nauld, who
                    also embraced him tenderly, at the same time freely forgiving him all his
                    satire. About the same time Louis XIV. appointed Racine and Boileau
                    historiographers of France, upon the understanding, of course, that they were to
                    write the history of his reign; and the public expected great things from two
                    writers of such distinguished reputation. But both the king and his subjects
                    were equally disappointed. Boileau and Racine, after having for some time
                    laboured at the work, perceived that it was entirely opposite to the genius of
                    each; and they also judged, with reason, that the history of such a king could
                    not, and indeed ought not, to be written until long after his death, unless it
                    were to be made up of extracts of gazettes and such like materials.</p>
                <p part="N">During a period of twelve years, Racine had steadily adhered to his
                    resolution not to write any more poetry, especially for the stage; but the
                    entreaties of Madame de Main-tenon so far prevailed as to induce him to resume
                    his dramatic character, and in consequence he composed his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Esther,</hi> which was to be represented, not on the French stage, but in
                    the house of Saint-Cyr. On the 20th of January 1689, it was performed for the
                    first time, and had prodigious success. “It appears to me very remarkable,” says
                    Voltaire, “that this tragedy should then have had universal success, and that
                    two years afterwards <hi rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> though performed by the
                    same persons, had none. It happened quite otherwise when these pieces were acted
                    at Paris long after the death of the author, and when prejudice and partiality
                    had ceased. <hi rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> represented in 1717, was received,
                    as it deserved to be, with transport; whilst <hi rend="italic">Esther,</hi> in
                    1721, inspired nothing but coldness, and never appeared again. But at that time
                    there were no courtiers who complaisantly acknowledged Esther in Madame de
                    Maintenon, and with equal malignity saw Vashti in Madame de Montespan, Haman in
                    M. de Louvois, and above all, the persecution of the Hugonots by this minister,
                    in the proscription of the Hebrew’s.” The same writer, who had no taste for
                    scriptural subjects, thinks the story of <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi>
                    uninteresting and even improbable; “but, notwithstanding the badness of the
                    subject,” he adds, “thirty verses of <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> are of more
                    value than many tragedies which have had great success.”</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> composed, like Esther, for Saint-Cyr,
                    had, as already intimated, a very different fate. Envy masked under a false zeal
                    prevented the representation. It was only performed twice at Versailles, in a
                    chamber without scenes and costumes, by the ladies of Saint-Cyr. Racine having
                    Originally intended it for publication, now sent it to the press; but, to the
                    eternal disgrace of the age and nation, this masterpiece of sublime genius,
                    unsurpassed either in ancient or in modern times, found no readers; and, in some
                    societies of pretended wits, the perusal of it was ironically prescribed as
                    penance. It is in truth lamentable to think that Racine should have descended to
                    the grave suffering under this injustice, and with the bitter feeling of seeing
                    his age dissatisfied with his immortal work. In vain did Arnauld, from the depth
                    of his solitude, try to sustain, by his suffrage, the sinking spirits of his old
                    pupil; in vain did Boileau repeat, “C’est votre meilleur ouvrage, le public y
                    reviendra.” Racine almost believed that he had survived his genius, and the
                    authority of Boileau, so potential with posterity, was disregarded during the
                    lifetime of his friend. This second injustice of the public towards Racine
                    reopened the wound inflicted by the first, completed his disgust, and decided
                    him to abandon definitively writing for the theatre, which, in fact, his
                    religious impressions had, for some time, led him to regard as incompatible with
                    the Christian life. He accordingly withdrew' from all connection with the stage,
                    and employed the remainder of his days in the grateful and almost filial task of
                    composing a history of Port-Royal, the place of his education, which is drawn up
                    with equal taste and elegance, but was not published till 1767, when it appeared
                    in two volumes 12mo.</p>
                <p part="N">Racine, although he had conversed much with the court, had not learned
                    to disguise his sentiments, the usual, perhaps the necessary accomplishment of a
                    courtier. In 1697, during one of those interviews which Madame de Mainte-non
                    frequently granted him, the conversation having turned upon the misery of the
                    people exhausted by long wars, and the best means of affording them relief, this
                    celebrated woman entreated the poet to throw his ideas on the subject into the
                    form of a memoir, promising that the writing should not pass out of her hands.
                    Racine consented, not from the mere complaisance of a courtier, and still less
                    from any ambitious view’, which the whole tenor of his life contradicts, but
                    solely with the design of being useful. The king surprised this memoir in the
                    hands of his mistress, and the name of the author was disclosed. Perhaps the
                    lesson was a little too direct, since the monarch, who had all along favoured
                    the poet, immediately took offence. “Because he makes good verses,” said Louis,
                    “does he think he knows every thing? and because he is a great poet, does
                    hepretend to be a statesman ?” Racine was greatly hurt by this observation, not
                    from any selfish consideration, but from the idea of having unnecessarily
                    offended his royal benefactor. But to say as some have done, that it shortened
                    his days, is manifestly absurd. His constitution had for several years been
                    sinking under the wasting influence of excitement, and, in consequence, the term
                    of his earthly career was now fast approaching. During his last illness,
                    however, the king evinced the greatest interest in the expiring poet, about whom
                    he daily sent to make the most anxious inquiries; and his benefits followed him
                    even beyond the tomb. Racine died on the 22d of April, 1699, after much
                    suffering, borne with truly Christian fortitude, and was interred, according to
                    his wish, at Port-Royal, at the feet of Dr. Hamon, that he might not be
                    separated even in death, from the master whom he so loved and respected in life.
                    After the destruction of this monastery, his remains were transported to Paris,
                    and deposited in the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, where they were placed
                    beside those of Pascal.</p>
                <p part="N">Racine was naturally melancholy when alone, though gentle and pleasing
                    with others. His nature was tender and affectionate, inclined to indulge
                    sorrowful or religious emotions rather than those which spring out of mirth or
                    joy. He was generous, and knew how to preserve the means of being so by much
                    order and economy. He afforded assistance to a number of distant relations, and
                    had a regard almost filial for his nurse, whom he did not forget in his will.
                    There was no better husband, no more affectionate father. The Christian
                    education of his children formed his chief concern. He had family prayers daily,
                    at the same time reading and explaining a portion of the gospel to his wife, his
                    children, and his domestics. During the last ten years of his life, all his
                    pleasures, and all his happiness were concentred in his domestic circle. He no
                    longer went to court except when called thither by the duties of his charge, and
                    the interests of his family; and yet who else could boast of the same meansof
                    pleasing and making himself beloved; his fine and noble figure, his gracious
                    manners, all the charms of wit, all the splendour of renown, united with the
                    happy art of causing them to be forgotten? He was, indeed, what the ladies of
                    Saint-Cyr described him, a man of great genius and great simplicity; and he had,
                    in fact, enchanted the world, more by the amenity and grace of his instructions,
                    than by his talent for declamation, which, however, he possessed in the very
                    highest degree. No man of his time read and recited better than Racine. One day,
                    at Boileau’s, in his house at Anteuil, reading and translating off-hand the <hi
                        rend="italic">(Edipus</hi> of Sophocles, he drew tears from all present. He
                    also taught Baron and La Champmale a system of declamation more conformable to
                    nature and good taste, or. to express it <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=18"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0719-0018-0008"/>more correctly, he taught them to speak and
                    not to declaim.</p>
                <p part="N">Asto his works, his countrymen have reason to be proud of them. He is
                    the poet of theheart and the affections, and yields to none in the truth, the
                    beauty, and the force of his delineations. If Corneillesurpassed him in heroic
                    sentiments, and the grand character of his personages, he was inferior to Racine
                    in moving the passions, and in purity of diction. Such is the perfection of
                    Racine in this last respect, that in all his pieces, there is not perhaps, we do
                    not say a scene, but even a single verse, which could be replaced by another.
                    All is just and true; all is full of that poetry of images and sentiments, and
                    that continued elegance which, since the time of the Greeks, Virgil and Racine
                    have alone possessed. But above all, it is in <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> and
                    in <hi rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> particularly in the choruses of these two
                    tragedies, that, sustained by the most sublime models, he is himself almost
                    always sublime. It is there that Racine has all the elevation of a Hebrew
                    prophet, who had come to announce divine truths in strains almost divine. But
                    that which chiefly characterises Racine is the complete union, perhaps unique,
                    of two qualities which appear to be incompatible; of imagination the most
                    brilliant, and reason the most perfect, of sensibility the most exquisite, with
                    good sense the most invariable. Reason, in fact, as much and even more perhaps
                    than imagination, predominates in the conception of his most touching
                    productions, in the execution of his most dramatic scenes, in the choice of his
                    richest expressions, and in his boldest combinations, as well as most elliptical
                    turns. Boileau, who has been surnamed the poet of reason, is not, even in this
                    view, superior to Racine; and, besides, the quality here mentioned is the less
                    astonishing in him, because it is accompanied with an imagination much less
                    lively. Racine has often been pronounced the greatest of the French poets. He
                    should also be set down as the most rational; or rather, it is precisely because
                    he really is the most rational, that he is likewise the greatest.</p>
                <p part="N">There are some smaller pieces of Racine which hate not been mentioned in
                    the course of this article, particularly Idylle sur la Paix, 1685; Discours
                    prononcé à l’Académie Française, en 1685; Cantiques Spirituelles, 1689; and
                    Epigrammes Diverses. The most complete edition of the Works of Racine is that
                    which M. Aimé Martin published at Paris in six vols. 8vo. in 1820, reprinted by
                    Lefèvre in 1822.</p>
