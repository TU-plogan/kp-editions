                    a learned member of Lincoln’s Inn, was born in the year 1666. In conjunction
                    with Mr. Peere Williams, Mr. Melmoth was the publisher of Vernon’s Reports,
                    under an order of the court of Chancery. He had once an intention of printing
                    his own reports, and a short time before his death advertised them at the end of
                    those of his coadjutor Peere Williams, as then actually preparing for the press.
                    They have not yet, however, made their appearance. But the performance for which
                    he justly deserves to be held in perpetual remembrance is, The Great Importance
                    of a Religious Life; concerning which it may be mentioned to the credit of the
                    age, that notwithstanding many large editions had before been circulated, 42,000
                    copies of this useful treatise have been sold in the course of eighteen years.
                    It is a somewhat singular circumstance, that the real author of this most
                    admirable treatise should never before have been publicly known: it had been
                    commonly attributed to the first Earl of Egmont, particularly by Mr. Walpole in
                    his Catalogue; which is the more surprising, as the author is plainly pointed
                    out in the short character prefixed to the book itself. “It may add weight,
                    perhaps, to the reflections contained in the following pages,” we are told, “to
                    inform the reader, that the author’s life was one uniform exemplar of those
                    precepts which, with so generous a zeal, and such an elegant and affecting
                    simplicity of style, he endeavours to recommend to general practice. He left
                    others to contend for modes of faith, and inflame themselves and the world with
                    endless controversy; it was the wiser purpose of his more ennobled aim, to act
                    up to those clear rules of conduct which revelation hath graciously prescribed.
                    He possessed by temper every moral virtue; by religion every Christian grace. He
                    had a humanity that melted at every distress; a charity which not only thought
                    no evil, but suspected none. He exercised his profession with a skill and
                    integrity which nothing could equal but the disinterested motive that animated
                    his labours, or the amiable modesty which accompanied all his virtues. He
                    employed his industry, not to gratify his own desires; no man indulged himself
                    less: not to accumulate useless wealth; no man more disdained so unworthy a
                    pursuit: it was for the decent advancement of his family, for the generous
                    assistance of his friends, for the ready relief of the indigent. Flow often did
                    he exert his distinguished abilities, yet refuse the reward of them, in defence
                    of the widow, the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. In a word, few
                    have ever passed a more useful, not one a more blameless life; and his whole
                    time was employed either in doing good, or in meditating it. He died on the '
                    6th day of April 1743, and lies buried under the cloister of Lincoln’s Inn
                    chapel.”</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Melmoth, William,</hi> son of the preceding, was
                    born in 1710. Of his early history little is known, nor do we find that he
                    studied at either university, though it is probable that he received a liberal
                    education. He was bred to the law, and appointed a commissioner of banknιpts in
                    1756; but the greater part of his life was spent in retirement from public
                    business, partly at Shrewsbury, and partly at Bath, where he was not less
                    distinguished for integrity of conduct, than for polished manners and elegant
                    taste. He first appeared as a writer about the year 1742, when, under the
                    nameofFitzos-</p>
                <p part="N">borne, he published a volume of Letters, which have been much admired by
                    some for their style, though it is overlaboured and devoid of natural fluency,
                    and by others for the just and liberal remarks with which they abound, on
                    various topics, moral and literary. In 1747, he published his translation of the
                    Letters of Pliny, in two vols. 8vo, which was then and is still regarded as one
                    of the best versions of a Latin author that has appeared in our language. It is
                    remarkable alike for elegance, precision, and correctness; the translator enters
                    with rare felicity into the spirit not only of the author’s ideas, but of his
                    style, the characteristic attributes of which he has faithfully transfused; the
                    freedom, ease, and graceful familiarity of the epistolary style are happily
                    preserved; and there are few instances to be found in any language where an
                    original has suffered so little in passing through the trying alembic of
                    translation. In 1753, he published a translation of Cicero’s Letters to several
                    of his Friends, with remarks, in three volumes; and he likewise translated the
                    treatises <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Amicitia,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Senectute,</hi> which were published
                    in 1773 and 1779, and enriched with annotations, literary and philosophical,
                    which added greatly to their value. In his remarks on the treatise <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Amicitia,</hi> he combated the
                    opinion of Lord Shaftesbury, who had imputed it to Christianity as a defect,
                    that it contained no precepts in favour of friendship; and also that of Soame
                    Jenyns, who had represented this very omission as a proof of its divine origin.
                    His refutation, in both instances, rests upon solid grounds. Lord Shaftesbury’s
                    notion is founded on a total misconception of the true character and aim of the
                    Christian religion; the paradox of Soame Jenyns proceeds on an oblivion of its
                    first and greatest precept. The same just and orthodox spirit he had previously
                    evinced in his reply to Mr. Bryant, who, in his Treatise on the Truth of the
                    Christian Religion, had attacked Mr. Melmoth’s remarks on Trajan’s persecution
                    of the Christians in Bithynia, contained in a note to his translation of Pliny’s
                    Letters. The concluding work of Mr. Melmoth was a tribute of filial affection,
                    and consisted in Memoirs of his father, published in 1796. After a long life
                    passed in literary pursuits, and in the exercise of private virtue, this
                    excellent and accomplished person died at Bath on the 15th of March 1799, at the
                    age of eighty-nine. He had been twice married; first, to the daughter of Dr.
                    King, principal of St. Mary’s Hall, Oxford; and, secondly, to a widow lady,
                    named Mrs. Ogle. Mr. Melmoth was a happy example of the mild and humanizing
                    influence of learning on a cultivated mind; we mean of that learning which is
                    described by the great Roman orator as constituting “the aliment of youth, and
                    the delight and consolation of declining years.” “Who,” says the author of the
                    Pursuits of Literature, “who would not envy this fortunate old man his most
                    finished translation and comment on Tully ’ s Cato? or rather who would not
                    rejoice L∙ the refined and mellowed pleasure of so accomplished a gentleman, and
                    so liberal a scholar ?” Dr.. Warton, in a note on Pope’s works, mentions
                    Melmoth’s translation of Pliny’s Letters as “one of the few that are better than
                    the original ;” and Birch, in his Life of Tillotson, makes nearly the same
                    observation. Both have perhaps exceeded just ’ bounds in pronouncing so
                    unqualified an eulogium; but such an opinion deliberately expressed by such men,
                    affords strong presumptive evidence in support of the more limited commendation
                    which we have above ventured to bestow; and there can be no doubt whatever, that
                    Melmoth is one of the few translators who have been successful in producing an
                    “express image” of their originals. Besides the works already mentioned, Mr.
                    Melmoth composed some poetical pieces, which were inserted, one of them in
                    Dodsley’s, and three in Pearch’s poems, but none of them possesses any peculiar
                    merit, or rises above a decent mediocrity. The fame of Melmoth rests on his
                    prose alone. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
