                        >Manding</hi></label>, an elevated region in Western Africa, is situated,
                    according to Golberry, between the sources of the Gambia and the town of Kong,
                    about 700 miles eastward from the coast of Guinea. Little or nothing is known of
                    the country except from the travels of Park, who traversed it during his first
                    journey. It was at Taffara, a town situated near the mouth of the Frina, a small
                    tributary of the river Niger, that Park first noticed a change “from the
                    corrupted dialect of Bambarra to the pure Mandingo.” Pursuing his route along
                    the northwestern side of the river, he passed several large towns, which owed
                    their importance to a trade in salt. Crossing a range of hills, he reached
                    Sibidooloo, “the frontier town of the kingdom of Manding,” situated in a fertile
                    valley surrounded with rocky hills. From this place to Kamalia the country
                    appeared to be well peopled, and some parts of it were particularly beautiful
                    and well cultivated. Every town has its mansa, and the Mahommedan religion
                    generally prevails. At Kamalia the bushreens and kaffirs live in distinct towns.
                    Worumbang, two stages from Kamalia, is the frontier village of Manding towards
                    Jallonkadoo. The road then enters the woods of “the Great Jallonka wilderness
                    but, to save a day’s provisions, Park diverged from the direct route to the town
                    of Kinytakooro, situated in a large and well-cultivated plain watered by the
                    Kokoro, one of the principal head streams of the Senegal. After leaving this
                    place he travelled for five days through a country totally uninhabited; in some
                    parts wild and rocky, in others beautifully undulating, wooded, and abounding
                    with partridges, Guinea-fowl, and deer. In this part of the route, no fewer than
                    three large rivers were crossed (the Wonda, the Comeissang, and the Boki), all
                    flowing to the Senegal, besides several rivulets. It might seem, at first,
                    difficult to account for the abandoned state of these gloomy wilds. Park
                    remarks, that he found many extensive and beautiful districts entirely destitute
                    of inhabitants; and, in general, the borders of the different kingdoms were
                    either very thinly peopled, or almost entirely deserted. The ruins of two towns
                    burned by the Foolahs, which were passed soon after entering the wilderness,
                    indicated too plainly the real cause of the apparent depopulation. It is the
                    wars carried on to supply the slave-markets on the coast that have driven the
                    kaffir tribes into the mountains, and converted large portions of fertile
                    territory into a wilderness. A considerable quantity of gold-dust is found in
                    the sands of the rivers, which the women extract by an easy process of washing.
                    The whole region is watered by the Niger in its early course. Manding is divided
                    into a number of small aristocratic republics, each village, with the territory
                    around it, being nearly independent of the one adjoining.</p>
                <p part="N">The Mandingoes, whose name and original abode belongs to this region,
                    arc now by no means confined to it. They have spread themselves throughout all
                    the countries on the banks of the Niger, the Senegal, and, above all, of the
                    Gambia, and have become the most numerous of all the races of Western Africa.
                    This powerful tribe has been repeatedly mentioned in our articles on African
                    geography. They are described by Golberry as having a black complexion, with a
                    mixture of yellow, “Their features,” he adds, “are regular; their character
                    generous and open, and their manners hospitable; their women are pretty and
                    amiable; they are zealous professors of the religion of Mahommed, though they
                    retain many of the practices of Fetishism, and some superstitious customs.” The
                    picture which Park draws of them is not so flattering. “The Mandingoes,” he
                    says, “are in particular a very gentle race, cheerful in their dispositions,
                    inquisitive, credulous, simple, and fond of flattery. The men are commonly above
                    the middle size, well shaped, strong, and capable of enduring great labour; the
                    women are good natuređ, sprightly, and agreeable.” He does not describe their
                    complexion, but he always speaks of them as negroes; yet, from the
                    representation of Golberry, which assigns them a yellowish-black complexion, it
                    would appear that they are of mixed blood. Major Laing describes them as a
                    shrewd people, and superior to any who inhabit Western Africa from Morocco to
                    the southward. They are of a migratory disposition, and are to be found
                    traversing Africa, for the purposes of trade or war, from Tangiers to the
                    American settlement of Cape Mesurado. Their costume is simple and neat,
                    consisting of a cap, shirt, trousers, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194202825?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2825-0231"/>and
                    sandals. The cap is composed of red or blue cloth, has a conical shape, and is
                    neatly worked with different-coloured threads. The shirt, which hangs loosely
                    over the trousers, is formed of about a fathom or more of blue or white baft,
                    doubled, with a small hole cut in the top to admit the head. The sides are sewed
                    up only about half way, thus admitting the arms to have full play. Trousers, of
                    the same material, reach only to the knee; they are made very wide, and gathered
                    round the loins with a strong piece of tape. The width of the trousers is a
                    great mark of distinction amongst them, and the importance of an individual may
                    be determined by the quantity of baft which has been expended in making this
                    article of dress. The females wear a piece of cloth of baft, about a yard in
                    width round the waist, impending as far as the calf of the leg, and a shawl or
                    some fancy cloth suspended from the head, and covering the neck and shoulders if
                    they are not at work; this cloth is likewise employed in concealing their faces
                    when they are required to eat or to drink in the company of the other sex.</p>
                <p part="N">There are four trades or professions, to which conjointly the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">Nyimahalah</hi> is given: they rank in the
                    order in which they are enumerated, and consist of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >fino,</hi> or orator; the <hi rend="italic">jelle,</hi> or minstrel; the
                        <hi rend="italic">guarange,</hi> or shoemaker; and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >neomo,</hi> or blacksmith. All these possess great privileges, and rank
                    high in the scale of society. The two latter earn their livelihood by the
                    exercise of their trade; the <hi rend="italic">fino</hi> by his oratory and
                    subtĩlty as a lawyer; and the <hi rend="italic">jelle</hi> by singing the mighty
                    deeds and qualifications of rich men, who are represented as having no faults.
                    There are few distinctions of rank amongst the Mandingoes. The priests and
                    teachers of the Koran are held next in estimation to the king or ruler of a
                    country; next to these are the subordinate chiefs and headmen; then come the
                    Nyimahalahs, to whom succeed the dependent freemen; and lastly,slaves, who are
                    divided into domestic or those born in the country, and those taken in war or
                    enslaved on account of debt or as a punishment for crime. Filial affection is
                    strongly evinced amongst this people; and a destitute old man is unknown amongst
                    them. A Mandingo, unless he belongs to the Nyimahalah, seldom goes abroad
                    without his gun; and every man carries his knife or cutlass, which he uses for
                    various purposes. Their education in general consists in learning to read and
                    write a few passages of the Koran, and to recite a few prayers. The religion is
                    Mahommedan, but they are not very rigid in its observances. They draw many omens
                    from the phases of the moon, and a ceremony is performed when she first makes
                    her appearance. They also wear greegrees or safies (small prayers cased in
                    stained leather), as antidotes to evil; but beyond this their superstition does
                    not appear to extend.</p>
                <p part="N">Circumcision is practised amongst the Mandingoes, but it does not take
                    place till the children have reached the age of puberty. A peculiar ceremony,
                    called “the child’s head shaving,” takes place in infancy, on which occasion it
                    receives its name from the schoolmaster. Polygamy is practised, and the numerous
                    households to which it gives rise live in tolerable outward harmony, which,
                    however, requires to be secured by the extraordinary expedient called <hi
                        rend="italic">Mumbo Jumbo.</hi> This is had recourse to when scolding,
                    beating, and other kinds of chastisement, fail in producing the desired effect.
                    It consists in conveying the obstreperous fair one to the market-place, where
                        <hi rend="italic">Mumbo Jumbo,</hi> arrayed in a fantastical habit, waits in
                    readiness to chastise her with his rod of office. The Mandingoes have some
                    tastes more refined than are usual amongst Africans, particularly in poetry, the
                    extemporary composition and recitation of which constitutes one of their
                    favourite amusements. Their employments are chiefly a slight agriculture,
                    fishing with nets and baskets, and, above <hi rend="italic">all,</hi> traffic,
                    in which their enterprise exceeds that of all the other African tribes.</p>
