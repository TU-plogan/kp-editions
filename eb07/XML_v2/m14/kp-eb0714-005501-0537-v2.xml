                    illustrious family, which had occupied the highest offices in the magistracy,
                    being the grandson of the celebrated advocate-general Lamoignon (see <hi

                    1721. He was son of the chancellor of France, William de Lamoignon, who was
                    descended of an illustrious family. His early education he received at the
                    Jesuits’ College, and afterwards applied himself with great assiduity to the
                    study of the law, as well as of history and political economy. He was chosen a
                    counsellor of the parliament of Paris at the age of twenty-four, and succeeded
                    his father as president of the court of aids in the year 1750. Alongst with the
                    presidentship of the court of aids, he received the superintendence of the
                    press, and in his hands it became the means of promoting liberty to a degree
                    beyond all former example in that country. As he firmly believed that despotism
                    alone had reason to dread the liberty of the press, he was anxious to give it
                    every extension consistent with sound policy and the state of public opinion.

                    Rousseau, and many other free speculations, issued from the press, in defiance
                    of the terrific anathemas of the Sorbonne. This had no doubt its weight in
                    paving the way for the revolution, which Malesherbes did not probably foresee;
                    yet it had also the effect of freeing the minds of men from the fetters of
                    slavery and superstition, and of enlightening thèm respecting their rights and
                    duties in society. The superintendence of the press having been taken from him,
                    and conferred upon Maupeou, he was only the more intent on fulfilling the duties
                    of his presidentship, and opposing arbitrary power. When the proceedings of the
                    court of aids were to be prohibited, on account of the spirited conduct of
                    Malesherbes in the case of Monnerat, who had been unjustly treated by the
                    farmers of the revenue, he presented a remonstrance to the king, containing a
                    free protest against the enormous abuses of <hi rend="italic">lettres</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de cachet,</hi> by which every man’s liberty was rendered
                    precarious, and concluding with these memorable words: “No one is great enough
                    to be secure from the hatred of a minister, nor little enough not to merit that
                    of a clerk.” Soon after this he was banished to his country-seat by a <hi
                        rend="italic">lettre</hi><hi rend="italic">de cachet,</hi> and the Duke de
                    Richelieu, at the head of an armed force, abolished the tribunal. In this state
                    of retirement he committed to paper a number of observations on the political
                    and judicial state of France, as well as on agriculture and natural history, all
                    which perished in the wreck of the revolution. On the accession of Louis XVI. to
                    the throne in 1774, he received an order to appear at the place where the court
                    of aids had sat, and to resume the presidentship of the tribunal thus restored.
                    He laid before the new sovereign an ample detail of the calamitous state of the
                    kingdom, with a free exposure of the faults by which it had been produced. His
                    sentiments so fully accorded with those of the young king, that he was chosen
                    minister of state in the year 1775. In this elevated station he was only
                    ambitious to extend the sphere of his usefulness. His first care was to visit
                    the prisons, and to restore to liberty the innocent victims of the former reign.
                    His administration was also distinguished by the encouragement of commerce and
                    agriculture, being-supported in his laudable endeavours by the able and virtuous
                    Turgot, at that time comptroller-general of the revenue. But having failed in
                    his benevolent endeavours to ameliorate the condition of Protestants respecting
                    the solemnization of marriage and the legitimation of their children, he
                    resigned his office in the month of May 1776.</p>
                <p part="N">Being fond of travelling, and resolved to mix freely with people of
                    every description, in order to acquire an accurate knowledge of human nature, he
                    assumed the humble title of Μ. Guillaume, and commenced his journey in a simple,
                    frugal manner. He travelled through France, Switzerland, <pb break="no"

                    Holland, frequently journeying on foot, and lodging in villages, in order to
                    have a nearer insight of the state of the country. He made memoranda of whatever
                    he conceived to be worthy of observation respecting the productions of nature
                    and the operations of industry; and, after an absence of some years, he returned
                    to his favourite mansion, fraught with such a stock of valuable knowledge as his
                    age and experience qualified him to appreciate. Finding on his return that his
                    native country was far advanced in philosophical principles, he drew up two
                    elaborate memoirs addressed to the king; one of them on the condition of the
                    Protestants, and the other on civil liberty and toleration in general. The
                    difficulties with which ministers now found themselves surrounded induced the
                    king to call him to his councils, being a man who stood high in the esteem of
                    the whole nation; but he received no appointment to any particular office. In
                    the critical state in which he clearly saw that the king stood, he made an
                    effort to open his eyes, by means of two spirited and energetic memoirs, on the
                    calamities of France, and the means of repairing them; but, as the queen’s party
                    carried everything before it, he was not even permitted to read them, and was
                    also denied a private interview with the ill-fated monarch, in consequence of
                    which he took his final leave of the court.</p>
                <p part="N">When, by a decree of the National Convention, Louis was to be tried for
                    his life, Malesherbes, nobly forgetting the manner in which he had been banished
                    from his councils, generously offered to plead his cause. On the 13th of
                    December 1792, he wrote to the president of the Convention, “J’ai été appelé
                    deux fois au conseil de celui qui fut mon maître, dans le temps où cette
                    fonction était ambitionnée par tout le monde; je lui dois le même service,
                    lorsque c’est une fonction que bien des gens trouvent dangereuse.” He was the
                    person who announced to the unfortunate monarch his cruel fate, and one of the
                    last who took leave of him when taken out to suffer. After this eventful period,
                    he withdrew to his retreat with a wounded heart, and refused to hear anything
                    more of what was passing on the bloody theatre of Paris.</p>
                <p part="N">Occupied with agriculture and the duties of charity, he was vainly
                    seeking to console himself for the evils of his country, when, in the first days
                    of December 1793, three members of a revolutionary committee of Paris, followed
                    by a numerous escort, came to arrest his eldest daughter, and his son-in-law Μ.
                    de Rosambo. He remained alone with his grandchildren, and for a moment it was
                    believed that his age and his virtues would be respected; but next day new
                    emissaries appeared, and carried him off with his children, notwithstanding the
                    tears and protestations of the inhabitants of Malesherbes, who all offered to
                    guarantee his virtues and his innocence. He then requested to be sent to the
                    same prison with his family; but even this consolation was denied him, and he
                    was incarcerated in the Madelonettes with one of his grandsons, Μ. Louis de
                    Rosambo, whilst his other children remained dispersed in different prisons. When
                    brought before the revolutionary tribunal, he was asked if he had counsel; he
                    replied by a smile of contempt, and one Duchâteau was appointed <hi
                        rend="italic">ex officio</hi> his defender. This tribunal of blood would
                    scarcely deign to hear him who had been so long the oracle of justice, and by
                    whom so many victims had been saved from death. He was, indeed, convinced of the
                    uselessness of any defence; and when they handed him the act of accusation (or
                    indictment), in which he was charged with having conspired against “the unity of
                    the republic,” he rejected it with disdain, saying, “Encore si cela avait le
                    sens commun.” In the same charge were included thirty persons of all ages and
                    both sexes. Malesherbes heard his sentence without emotion, and marched to death
                    with undisturbed serenity. At this terrible moment, that mild yet lively gaiety
                    which had formed the charm of his life did not forsake him. Happening to strike
                    his foot against a stone, as he crossed the court-yard of ţhe palace, with his
                    hands tied at his back, he observed to the person next him. “Voilà qui est d’un
                    fâcheux augure; à ma place un Romain serait rentré.” Madame de Rosambo was not
                    less calm nor less resigned. When, on quitting her prison, she embraced
                    Mademoiselle de Sombreuil, who had displayed so great courage during the
                    massacres of September, “Mademoiselle,” said she, “you have had the honour to
                    save your father; I am going to have that of dying with mine.” Malesherbes had
                    the unspeakable grief of seeing immolated before him that daughter λvhom he
                    loved so tenderly, and who herself witnessed the butchery of her children before
                    she was called on to suffer. He perished the last of all, at the age of
                    seventy-two, on the 22d of April 1794.</p>
                <p part="N">Grave errors may be laid to the charge of Malesherbes, but all of these
                    had their source in that love of good which in him was as much a passion as a
                    principle; and, besides, they were not only expiated by a glorious death, but
                    confessed and bitterly deplored with that noble frankness which belonged to his
                    character. Besides the works already alluded to, Malcsherbes left a number of
                    manuscripts, which were dispersed by the vandalism of the revolution,
                    particularly, 1. Observations sur le Méléze, sur le Bois de Sainte Lucie, sur
                    les Pins, sur les Orchis; 2. Mémoire sur les moyens d’accélérer les Progrès de
