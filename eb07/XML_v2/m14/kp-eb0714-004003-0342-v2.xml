                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MAHRATTAS</label>. The Mahratta state comprehended a
                    country in Hindustan, very extensive, and of great natural strength, being
                    interspersed with mountains, defiles, and fortresses, and well adapted for
                    defensive war. It extended across the peninsula of India, and, generally
                    speaking, was in possession of the peishwa, Nagpoor Rajah, Scindia, Holkar,
                    Guicowar, and other inferior chiefs. The Mahrattas were not originally a
                    military tribe like the Rajpoots; nor do they possess the same grace and dignity
                    of person, being of a diminutive stature and badly made, and having more the
                    character of freebooters than of soldiers. Their original country is said to
                    have included Khandesh, Baglana, and part of Berar, and north-west as far as
                    Gujeratand the Nerbuddah River. Others again say that they are foreigners, who
                    came into India from the western parts of Persia about 1200 years ago. Little is
                    known of the history of the Mahratta people till about the middle of the
                    seventeenth century, when they possessed a narrow tract of country on the
                    western side of the peninsula, extending from the fifteenth to the twenty-first
                    degree of north latitude. The founder of the Mahratta state, or at least the
                    first person who raised this nation from obscurity, was Sevajee, who was born
                    about the year 1626, and died in 1680, and who claimed a descent, but upon very
                    doubtful grounds, from the ranahs of Odeypoor. The father of Sevajee, named
                    Sahoo Bhosila or Bhoonsla, was an officer in the service of the last Mahommedan
                    king of Bejapoor or Visiapoor. The Mahratta country was originally divided
                    amongst a number of principalities, ruled by independent chiefs, who were
                    combined into one under Sevajee. He was succeeded by his son Sambajee, who
                    extended his conquests, but who was finally taken prisoner by Aurungzebe in
                    1689, and put to death. Sahoo Rajah, who succeeded him, extended his conquests
                    from sea to sea, and obtained possession of fortresses commanding a territory
                    reaching from the province of Agra to Cape Comorin. This great monarch was
                    succeeded by his son Ram Rajah, whose power was usurped by the two chief
                    officers of the state, the peishwa or prime minister Bajeerow, and the
                    paymaster-general Ragojee, who divided the empire between them. The former fixed
                    his residence at Poonah; the latter founded a new kingdom at Nagpoor, in the
                    province of Gundwa<!--ignore-->neh. Bajeerow, the peishwa, died in 1759, and was
                    succeeded by his son Ballajeerow. In 1760 the Mahrattas had extended their
                    conquests as far as the city of Delhi, when a formidable rival appeared in Ahmed
                    Shah Abdalli, the sovereign of Afghanistan, to dispute with them the empire of
                    India. With the Afghans was fought, on the 7th of January 1761, the great battle
                    of Paniput, in which the Mahrattas were speedily overthrown with the loss of a
                    great number of their chiefs. From this period their power began to decline.
                    Ballajeerow died soon after the battle of Paniput, and was succeeded by his son
                    Madhoorow, who died in 1772, and was succeeded by his son Narrainrow, who was
                    murdered the following year by his uncle Ragobah, who was opposed in his designs
                    on the throne by a combination of twelve chiefs. At the head of these was
                    Balla-jee Pundit, who became dewan or prime minister to the infant prince.
                    Ragobah fled to Bombay, where he solicited and obtained, by means of an
                    advantageous treaty, the aid of the British government. But this aid was
                    ineffectual in seating the murderer upon the Mahratta throne. His crime had
                    brought upon him the general obloquy of the nation; and his appeal to foreign
                    aid united against him the whole confederate chiefs of the Mahratta empire. By
                    the interference of the Bengal government, a treaty was concluded; but in 1777
                    the Bombay government again espoused the cause of Ragobah, and a war ensued,
                    which was terminated by a disgraceful convention, and Ragobah abandoned. A
                    general war afterwards took place between the British and the Mahrattas, and was
                    terminated by a treaty in 1782, by which every conquest was restored except the
                    island of Salsette. At this period the Mahrattas commenced hostile operations
                    against all those independent states which lay between their territories and
                    those of the Company; and in the course of six or seven years they were all
                    subdued, by which the Mahratta frontier bordered with the British dominions. In
                    1785 they carried on an unsuccessful war with Tippoo, and were obliged to
                    purchase peace by the cession of several valuable provinces, all of which they
                    recovered by their alliance with the British in 1790. The posthumous and infant
                    son of Madhoorow, who succeeded to the peishwaship when hecame to maturity, died
                    in 1795, and the two sons of Ragobah contended for the office. The cause of the
                    eldest brother, named Bajeerow, was espoused by Scindia, by whose aid he was
                    fixed on the throne; but he was permitted to enjoy nothing of the sovereignty
                    but the name. In the year 1802 the united armies of the peishwa and Scindia were
                    defeated by Holkar; and the former having taken refuge in the territory ot the
                    British, was, by their aid, reinstated on the throne, agreeing in return to a
                    treaty offensive and defensive, and to receive into his pay a force of six
                    thousand infantry, with the usual proportion of artillery attached, for the
                    payment of which he assessed districts in the southern quarter of the country.
                    From this period the pcishwa, murmuring under his degradation into a state of
                    dependence, cherished schemes of hostility against the British. The first overt
                    act of hostility was the murder of the Guicowar’s ambassador, through the agency
                    of his ambassador Trimbuckjee. But his intrigues and schemes being discovered,
                    he vowed the strictest fidelity in future; and <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194200355?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0355-0041"/>in 1815 he
                    delivered up his prime minister to the British. He soon contrived, however, to
                    escape to the court of Poonah; and the peishwa, no longer dissembling, joined
                    the confederacy which had at that time been formed amongst the native princes of
                    India, namely, Scindia, Ameer Khan, Holkar, and the Berar Rajah, for the
                    destruction of the British power. But this confederacy was signally overthrown;
                    the peishwa’s armies were entirely routed; and he, reduced to the character of a
                    wandering fugitive, at last surrendered himself a prisoner to Sir John Malcolm,
                    on condition of an allowance being assigned him. It was now resolved by the
                    Anglo-Indian government to abolish the authority and the name of the peishwa,
                    which had become a rallying point for the disaffected, and to occupy the whole
                    of the Poonah dominions for the British nation, with the reservation of certain
                    territories for the Satarah family. Thus was extinguished not only the political
                    influence, but the name and authority, of the Mahratta state.</p>
