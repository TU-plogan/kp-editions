                    Leinster in Ireland, is bounded, on the north, by the counties of Cavan,
                    Monaghan, and Louth; on the cast, by the Irish sea and Dublin county; on the
                    south, by the county of Kildare; and on the west by that of Meath. Its
                    superficial contents amount to 567,127 acres, all of which arc capable of
                    cultivation, except 5600 acres of barren land, which would not repay the outlay
                    expended on its improvement.</p>
                <p part="N">In the time of Ptolemy it formed part of the territory of the Eblani,
                    whose settlement extended from the Boyne to the Liffey. According to the
                    accounts of native writers, the district known by the name of Meath was of much
                    greater extent than at present. It comprehended the modern counties of Meath,
                    Westmeath, Longford, with parts of Cavan, Kildare, and the King’s County, and
                    constituted one of the five subordinate kingdoms into which the island was
                    divided. At the time of the landing of the English it was the property of the
                    O’Melaghlin family, from whom it was wrested by Henry II., who bestowed it on
                    Hugh de Lacy, to be holden by the service of fifty knights. This nobleman
                    subdivided it into twelve parts called baronies, because the persons to whom he
                    granted those parts were afterwards created barons. In this state it continued
                    till the reign of Henry VIII., when it was divided by act of parliament into the
                    two counties of Meath and Westmeath. The modern division of the county is into
                    twelve baronies, which have been formed into two districts, for the purposes of
                    its civil jurisdiction. The Boyne constitutes the line of demarcation between
                    these divisions. That of Kells, to the north-west of the'river, comprehends the
                    baronies of Slane, Morgallion, Kells, Demifore, Lune, and Navan; that of
                    Dunshaughlin, to the south-west, contains those of Duleek, Skreen, Ratoath,
                    Dunboyne, Deece, and Moyfenrath. The baronies of Deece, Duleek, Kells,
                    Moyfenrath, Navan, and Slane, are each divided into half baronies, distinguished
                    by the terms upper and lower, so that the county may be considered as divided
                    into eighteen great divisions, for the purposes of its internal government.
                    These baronial divisions are again subdivided into 137 parishes, and six
                    portions of parishes, the remaining parts of which extend into some of the
                    adjoining counties.</p>
                <p part="N">According to the ecclesiastical division of Ireland this county
                    constitutes the greater portion of the diocese of the same name. There were
                    formerly many episcopal sees in Meath, all of which, except Kells and Duleek,
                    which, however, subsequently shared the same fate as the others, were
                    consolidated previously to the year 1152, when Cardinal Paparo settled the
                    diocesan divisions of Ireland, by authority from Pope Eugenius III. The seat of
                    the see was then fixed at Clonard. The bishopric of Clonmacnoiswas united to it
                    by act of parliament in 1568. The bishop of Meath has no cathedral church; his
                    residence has for a long period been at Ardbraccan, which in the wars of 1641
                    was a castle of considerable strength, but is now a modern mansion built with
                    much taste. The constitution of the diocese possesses many singularities. There
                    is neither dean nor chapter. The only dignitaries are the dean of Clonmacnois,
                    and the archdeacon of Meath. The want of a chapter is supplied by a synod, of
                    which every beneficed clergyman within the diocese is a member. This synod has a
                    common seal, which is lodged in the hands of members annually selected for its
                    custody. The bishopric is divided into twelve rural deaneries, and comprehends
                    224 parishes, of which, according to the ecclesiastical computation, 147 are in
                    the county of Meath; fifty-nine in Westmeath; sixteen in the King’s County; one
                    in Cavan; one in Longford; besides one part of a parish in Kildare. The bishop
                    of Meath takes precedence of all the other bishops in Ireland, and is a member
                    of the Privy Council in right of his see.</p>
                <p part="N">From the level aspect of this county, it doesnot present such a variety
                    of picturesque views as many other districts; yet it is not without its
                    characteristic beauties. The banks of the Boyne, especially, present a
                    succession of prospects in which the undulating surface is richly ornamented
                    with the natural beauties of wood and water, studded by numerous buildings, both
                    ancient and modern. Few of the elevations of the ground are of sufficient height
                    to be termed hills, and none deserve the title of mountain, except perhaps
                    Scribogue and Lloyd in Kells barony; and even those, where cultivated, are
                    productive to their summits.</p>
                <p part="N">The river Boyne enters the county at its south-western extremity, and
                    intersects it diagonally in a north-eastern direction, till it discharges itself
                    into the sea below Drogheda where it forms the boundary between the counties of
                    Meath and Louth. It receives the Blackwater at Navan. The Moynalty or Borora is
                    a branch of the Blackwater. The Nannywater discharges itself into the Irish sea.
                    The Ryewater forms part of the boundary between Dublin and <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194204320?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4320-0346"/>Meath. The
                    Boyne is navigable for barges as far as Navan, whence a canal has been carried
                    to Trim. The royal canal touches the southern border of the county between
                    Kilcock and Cion curry. A projected canal, to traverse the county from
                    south-east to north-west, has never been executed. The sea-coast is confined to
                    the short space between the mouth of the Boyne and the stream of the Delvid,
                    which is part of the boundary of Dublin county. It presents a shelving sţrand,
                    without a port of any consequence. There is no sheet of water meriting the name
                    of lake, except that of Lough Sheelin, which bounds the county on the north, and
                    the very inconsiderable Lough of Lakefield in Demifore.</p>
                <p part="N">The soil is extremely variable, being found of every quality, from a
                    deep rich loam to the lightest sandy texture; but that most generally to be met
                    with is a strong deep clay, resting on a substratum of limestone gravel. In some
                    parts, and even on the tops of the hills, as good earth has been found at the
                    depth of four feet as at the surface, so that the land in those favoured spots
                    can never be exhausted, because when the farmer begins to find his fields
                    unproductive, he has only by ploughing somewhat deeper to turn up a quantity of
                    virgin earth, whose productive qualities had hitherto lain dormant.</p>
                <p part="N">The county is wholly included within the great central plain of floetz
                    limestone, which crosses Ireland in a broad band. The mineral productions are
                    few, owing partly to the character of the soil, and partly to that of the
                    surface, which, from its general flatness, prevents the interior from being
                    explored to any depth, without being impeded by subterraneous water. A copper
                    mine was for some time worked in Skreen barony, but the latter of the causes now
                    mentioned put a stop to the operations. Limestone of large scantling, and
                    therefore well suited for building purposes, and also susceptible of a high
                    polish, is raised at Ardbraccan. The Episcopal palace is built of this stone. It
                    is white when fresh from the chisel, but assumes a greyish hue from
                    atmospherical exposure. Argillaceous clay, which has been applied to the
                    manufacture of coarse earthen-ware, is raised in some places. In Slane barony
                    coal-smut has been found in abundance, at the edges of streams, where the soil
                    has been washed away by the action of the water; but coal has not yet been
                    discovered. A chalybeate spring of some repute for the cure of diseases arising
                    from debility, has been discovered at Knock, in Morgallion barony.</p>
                <p part="N">The quantity of bog is very small; but in stating this fact, it must be
                    observed that there is a very extraordinary difference in the statements of the
                    two most accredited writers regarding its extent. Thompson, in his <hi
                        rend="italic">County Survey,</hi> published in 1802, under the auspices of
                    the Dublin Society, fixes the quantity of unreclaimed bog at 42,000 acres,
                    whereas Griffith, in his return to parliament, on the valuation of Ireland, in
                    1832, makes the whole of the barren mountain land and bog together to amount
                    only to 5600 acres.</p>
                <p part="N">The population of a district enjoying so many of the natural advantages
                    suited to the maintenance of human existence, is by no means so great as might
                    have been anticipated from this cause. The average of inhabitants, compared with
                    the superficial extent, is but as one to 3 j, whilst in the adjoining counties
                    of Louth and Armagh it is as 1 to 1⅜. The increase of population appears in the
                    following table, which presents the results of investigations at different

                    education to 7195 children, were supported wholly by the fees of the pupils. The
                    diocesan school for the sees of Meath and Ardagh was fixed by the commissioners
                    of education to be kept at Mullingar or Westmeath. That of Meath diocese had
                    been long kept in Trim. There are charter-schools at Trim and Ardbraccan. A
                    school w as endowed at Navanby abequestof Alderman Preston in 1686. A large free
                    school, on the Lancasterian system, has been established at Oldcasto, by a
                    bequest of Mr. Gibson of London.</p>
                <p part="N">The population is chiefly engaged in agriculture. The soil being
                    principally composed of a deep rich earth, the deepest ploughing is considered
                    as the best tillage; and from the great tendency to weeds, the farmer, who keeps
                    his ground in the most cleanly state, and at the same time most friable and
                    pulverized, is considered as having it in the most profitable condition. A
                    complete summer’s fallow at stated intervals is considered by the most judicious
                    farmers as absolutely necessary to keep the land thoroughly clean; every other
                    attempt to eradicate the -weeds, by means ofclover, vetches, or any other
                    umbraceous green crop having proved ineffectual. Planting potatoes, even without
                    manure, is considered as a good method of fallowing where cleansing is the only
                    object. In the neighbourhood of villages it is a common practice for farmers to
                    throw open the field which he intends to fallow to the cottagers, who furnish
                    manure and plant their potatoes on it. If the ground be in good heart he charges
                    them at the rate of somewhat more than his <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194204333?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4333-0347"/>own rent,
                    which is termed “paying the standing rent ;” but if poor, he makes no charge.
                    The most intelligent farmers break up their fallows before Christmas as lightly
                    as possible; yet, in order to reverse the surface at the close of the spring
                    work, it is cross-harrowed, the weeds are gathered and burned, and if necessary,
                    it is manured and gravelled. The next ploughing, called the “gorrowing,” is
                    performed by six horses or bullocks turning up the ground in high narrow ridges
                    across the former lines. In this state the land lies during the remainder of the
                    summer, and then receives a ploughing called “stretching,” which runs as the
                    ridges of sown corn are intended to lie. The grain is generally sown broad-cast
                    and harrowed in. With respect to the rotation of crops, or system of croping, no
                    restriction is imposed on the tenant Every one is permitted to raise that kind
                    of grain from which he expects to derive the greatest produce.</p>
                <p part="N">The crops usually cultivated, are wheat, oats, barley, bear, rye,
                    meslin, clover, flax, potatoes, cabbage, rape, turnips, and peas. The red wheat
                    is preferred by most as agreeing best with the soil, and having a thinner rind,
                    bearing the change of season better, and being less apt to lodge than the white.
                    The latter is cultivated on the lighter and more gravelly soils. It comes in
                    earlier, but is more liable to injury from the weather or mildew. Oats are
                    produced in the greatest variety and of the finest samples; they are sown in the
                    proportion of three to one as compared with other crops, and command a certain
                    sale at the grain markets. Barley is also in much repute. It is sown on the
                    richest land, and requires the nicest tillage; but there is always a brisk
                    demand for it, and it is considered as one of the most profitable crops. Bear is
                    a good deal sown, particularly after potatoes; it is also a profitable crop
                    where it succeeds, but it is uncertain. The straw makes excellent fodder for
                    young cattle. Rye, by itself or mixed with wheat, when it is called meslin, is
                    chiefly ground into whole meal for domestic consumption. Flax is mostly sown in
                    small patches for the use of the farmer’s family, and seldom offered in
                    quantities for sale; it grows strong and luxuriant, so as to be seldom fitted
                    for the finer fabrics. When a field is laid down for grass, those parts of it on
                    which flax had been grown produce the most luxuriant herbage, and shew the
                    earliest verdure in the following year; if sheep, which are of all animals the
                    greatest epicures, be let in upon it, they invariably settle on the part so laid
                    down; this appearance of luxuriance and early verdure is visible for at least
                    two years. Rape is grown with the greatest success on bog which has been
                    reclaimed by burning. Red clover is much used as a renovating crop; white clover
                    is seldom sown except on land laid down for pasture.</p>
                <p part="N">The quantity of artificial grass sown is very small, as compared with
                    the extensive tracts producing natural grasses; the depth and richness of the
                    soil throughout almost the whole of the county, and its tendency to moisture
                    without being absolutely wet, making it throw up such a coat of nourishing
                    herbage, as is scarcely to be equalled in Ireland. In other counties there are
                    districts which far exceed the richest lands here; such are the Golden Vale in
                    Tipperary, and the corcass lands in Limerick. But no other districtcan exhibit
                    560,000 acres situated together, of such excellent quality, and so appropriate
                    to every purpose of tillage and pasture as Meath. It is, generally speaking,
                    more friendly to the latter kind of agriculture, and consequently was almost
                    wholly applied to grazing, until the legislative measures adopted by the Irish
                    parliament for the encouragement of tillage, induced many to break up the large
                    tracts which for ages had continued untouched by the ploughshare. The superior
                    excellence of the beef reared here over that of any other district has made the
                    county proverbial for its feeding. All the old pastures are composed of grasses
                    of the best kinds. Graziers seldom think of procuring any particular species,
                    from an opinion that the land, after three years, will revert to its natural
                    herbage, even though grasses of other kinds had been sown upon it when laid
                    down. Dry gravelling soils throw up a rich coat of white clover, though no red
                    has been sown; and grounds of a clayey nature, when drained and manured with
                    limestone gravel, often exhibit a similar tendency. Natural meadows are to be
                    met everywhere; few farms, whatever be their size, are without a sufficiency for
                    the holder’s use. The artificial grasses chiefly cultivated are clover and
                    trefoil. Much attention is paid by the graziers to the treatment of their
                    feeding stock. The first week in May the pastures are generally opened for the
                    summer stock, which are seldom reared here, the land being deemed too valuable
                    to be given up to young cattle. Beasts of this description are brought from
                    Connaught or Munster. When they arrive they are bled and turned into the pasture
                    field where they remain till completely fattened, each field being stocked at
                    once with its full complement. They are then sold partly in the Dublin market
                    for the consumption of the metropolis or for exportation to Liverpool, and
                    partly to buyers from the northern ports, chiefly for the supply of the
                    colonies. The slaughtering season commences in September. Some graziers put a
                    few fat sheep to graze amongst the neat cattle; but the practice is generally
                    condemned, from an opinion that it injures the <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi>
                    proof” of the beasts, by which is meant the quantity of inside fat, the
                    butcher’s test of high feeding, as the sheep feed on the sweetest grass; of
                    course it ultimately hurts the grazier, as the north country butchers avoid
                    those whose beasts do not “die well,” as they express it, and are sure to give a
                    preference to those who are known to have good proof beasts. Bullocks are fed in
                    great abundance. The sheep, like the black cattle, are seldom natives; they are
                    brought in at the October fair of Ballinasloe. Lands newly laid down are
                    generally appropriated to the rearing of lambs for the Dublin market. The
                    marshes of Rossmin and Emla, on the Moynalty river feed great numbers of horses
                    during summer. These marshes admit of easy drainage, but the proprietors deem
                    them more profitable in their present state.</p>
                <p part="N">Almost every farmer, occupying from thirty to one hundred acres, keeps a
                    few cows, the produce of which both in milk and butter that remains after
                    supplying his own family, is sent to market. There are also a number of dairy
                    farms in Dunboyne and Ratoath, in which the landlord supplies the land, houses
                    and stock; the tenant furnishes labour and utensils, and pays for the mowing and
                    hay making; the cows, when they go backward in their milk, are charged by the
                    landlord at his own expense. The cream only is churned; the skimmed milk being
                    mixed with butter milk is sold to the Dublin chandlers who retail it to the
                    poor. The dairy cows are invariably housed from the first week in December till
                    May; during which time they are sent out to graze in the day time and fed at
                    night upon hay. Cheese is very seldom made and only for domestic use.</p>
                <p part="N">The quantity of natural wood throughout the county is but small, but the
                    plantations in demesnes, and about gentlemen’s seats, are numerous and thriving.
                    The trees most usually met with are ash, elm, sycamore, lime, and larch. Scotch
                    and spruce fir are less common. Gross oak is very scarce, the principal growth
                    of it being at Loughcrew, in Demifore. There are many osieries, of from two to
                    ten acres each, the produce of which is sold to the basket-makers of Dublin.</p>
                <p part="N">The manufactures are chiefly confined to the making of sacking from tow,
                    of coarse linens in the neighbourhood of Drogheda, where the cotton manufacture
                    is also carried on to some extent, and of linens of a texture somewhat finer in
                    the western baronies. Some coarse frieze is also manufactured for home
                    consumption. There are paper manufactories, distilleries, and breweries, of
                    considerable magnitude. Tanyards are to be met with in several places.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204346?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4346-0348"/>
                <p part="N">The chief outlet for the produce of the county is Drogheda. There are
                    good markets for grain and provisions at Trim and Navan, and extensive
                    flour-mills on the Boyne and Blackwater. But on the whole Meath cannot be
                    considered to be a manufacturing county.</p>
                <p part="N">There are several mansions in this county of great size and splendour,
                    surrounded by highly improved demesnes, and numerous seats of resident
                    gentlemen. The farm houses are generally of very inferior construction, formed
                    of the earth or clay taken off the surface of the spot on which the house is to
                    be built; hence the floor is commonly several inches below the level of the
                    soil, and consequently damp and unwholesome. The habitations of the labourers
                    and cotters are of a description still worse, being built of mud, and with
                    sunken floors, insomuch that it is found necessary to form a hole in the floor
                    as a receptacle for the water that comes in at the door, or oozes through the
                    foundation. This description, however, is not universally applicable. The owners
                    of some estates have provided comfortable residences for their labourers, to be
                    held by them on moderate terms. The furniture, food, and clothing, is of a
                    character similar to that of their habitations. In many parts the lower classes
                    suffer extremely from the want of fuel; bog-land being extremely scarce, and the
                    expense of carriage precluding the purchase of coal, which must be drawn from
                    Dublin or Drogheda. When coal can be had upon moderate terms, another objection
                    .to its use is the want of grates, as it will not burn on the hearth like turf;
                    although this difficulty has been overcome in some places by the ingenious
                    contrivance of placing two bricks edgeways and parallel to each other, at about
                    eight or ten inches asunder, by which means a current of air is produced
                    sufficient to support combustion. Though the English language is universally
                    spoken, the peasantry still prefer the use of Irish in their communications with
                    each other. Books of devotion in the latter language, but printed in the Roman
                    character, are much used. It is a proverbial expression here, as also in some
                    other parts of Ireland, “If you have to plead for your life, plead in Irish.” A
                    fund exists here derived from bequests of Dr. Sterne, bishop of Clogher, and Dr.
                    Chetwood, the income of which is applied to apprentice the children of
                    protestant parents to masters and mistresses of the same persuasion. Another
                    bequest of a gentleman of the name of Charleton, disposes of the interest of
                    L.900, in marriage portions of six guineas to labourers’ sons under thirty who
                    marry labourers’ daughters under forty, provided they have resided a year
                    previous to marriage in the same parish, and have had the consent of the parents
                    on both sides. Two-thirds of this singular bequest is appropriated to Meath, and
                    the remainder to Longford.</p>
                <p part="N">Amongst the most ancient remains of antiquity may be mentioned the round
                    or pillar towers at Kells and Donogh-more. The former is ninety-nine feet high,
                    and has four small apertures near the top facing the four cardinal points of the
                    compass. The latter is remarkable for having a representation of the Saviour on
                    the cross, carved on the key-stone over the entrance. At Kells and St.
                    Kiarans’are two fine stone crosses. At New Grange, near Slane, is another
                    relique equally extraordinary, consisting of an artificial cavern Or underground
                    gallery in form of a cross seventy-one feet in its greatest length, twenty feet
                    between the extremities of the arms of the cross, and eleven feet in its
                    greatest height. It is surrounded by a tumulus or hillock raised by art, which
                    is surrounded by a circle of huge unhewn stones set upright. It is supposed to
                    have been either a place of Druidical worship or a burying-place; and two
                    skeletons uncovered with earth were found in it, when first opened. The Hill of
                    Tarah is also worthy of note, as being the place where the kings of Ireland were
                    crowned, and where the states of the island held their triennial assemblies,
                    called the Fez of Tarah. The traces of some of the positions supposed to have
                    been connected with this ancient custom, are said by some antiquaries to be
                    still discoverable on it. Near it is a large rath. Other raths are to be seen at
                    Lismullen, Odder, and Ringlestoun. Columbkilľs house, a stone-roofed crypt or
                    cell at St. Kiarans, is said to be the most ancient building of that material in
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p part="N">The ruins of monastic buildings scattered throughout the country are too
                    numerous to admit even of recapitulation. Trim had seven monastic institutions;
                    Kells, Killeen, Du-lek, and Skryne, three each. Several of these buildings have
                    been converted into parish churches.</p>
                <p part="N">The ruins of ancient castles are not less numerous. Some of them have
                    been altered into modern residences. Of these Slane castle is amongst the
                    finest, both for architectural structure and grandeur of situation on a richly
                    wooded elevation overhanging the Boyne. It was the favourite residence of King
                    George IV. during his visit to Ireland in 1821. Killeen castle, in addition to
                    its claims on the score of antiquity, has been rendered splendidly memorable by
                    its present proprietor, the Earl of Fingal, a Roman Catholic nobleman, who,
                    during the disastrous period of the rebellion of 1798, threw it open as an
                    asylum for the well-affected of every description. The clergymen, both
                    Protestant and Catholic, performed divine service there, each to their
                    respective congregations, under the same roof, as long as the danger
                    existed.</p>
                <p part="N">Trim, the county town, situated on the Boyne, presents an appearance
                    very unsuitable to the metropolis of a county so wealthy and populous. But
                    though now a place of very inferior note, it was once amongst the principal of
                    the Anglo-Irish towns. In the war of 1641, it was besieged by Cromwell. The
                    ruins of its monastic establishments have been already noticed. Its present
                    public buildings are, the Protestant church, two Roman Catholic chapels, the
                    court house, the market house, the county jail, the charter school, and the
                    barracks. A Corinthian pillar was erected here in 1817, in honour of the Duke of
                    Wellington, who was born at Dan-gar castle in this county. The population of
                    Trim in 1831, amounted only to 3282 souls. The following are the names and
