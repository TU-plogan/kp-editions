                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MECHANICS</label> ’ INSTITUTIONS have for their
                    object the instruction of the working classes in those branches of science and
                    art, which are of practical application in the exercise of their several
                    occupations.</p>
                <p part="N">It has been a subject of very considerable controversy to whom the
                    honour of having originated those institutions ought to be attributed. Some have
                    contended that to Professor Anderson, the founder of the institution in Glasgow,
                    which bears his name, it is alone due; because in addition to the clauses in his
                    will, which especially provide for the formation of a class of <hi rend="italic"
                        >manufacturers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">artificers,</hi> he had for a
                    period of thirty years, whilst professor of natural philosophy in the university
                    of that city, opened a class to which manufacturers and others had access, for
                    the purpose of becoming acquainted with the fundamental principles of
                    experimental physics. Others, again, have affirmed that although Professor
                    Anderson had such an intention in view when he framed his will, it was only
                    through the exertions of Dr. Birckbeck, the second professor of the Andersonian
                    Institution, that the project was carried into complete and practical effect.
                    Without going into the merits of this question, however, it appears to us that
                    to Professor Anderson is certainly due the merit of having originated the <hi
                        rend="italic">idea</hi> of instructing that previously neglected but
                    valuable portion of the community. But whilst we give all the weight to which
                    that admission is entitled, we are of opinion that in as far as regards the
                    usefulness of the idea when carried into effect, the merit is due to Dr.
                    Birckbeck. Professor Anderson<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            the Rev. James Anderson, minister of the parish of Roseneatħ, in
                            Dumbartonshire, and was born there in 1726.</p></note> was in the
                    frequent habit of visiting and spending several hours in the workshops of the
                    mechanics of Glasgow, and freely entering into conversation with them; amongst
                    others he was often found at the workshop of our illustrious countryman James
                    Watt, then a watchmaker in Glasgow; and it was in consequence of the avidity
                    with which the workmen, availed themselves of the theoretical information which
                    on these visits he was in the constant practice of imparting, that he first
                    conceived the idea of bringing within their reach those principles of science,
                    the attainment of which had hitherto been confined to the higher and wealthier
                    classes.</p>
                <p part="N">He then commenced within the walls of the university a course of
                    lectures on natural philosophy, for the especial benefit of that class of
                    society, and divided the course into two branches; one meeting four times
                    a-week, in which the mathematical principles of the science were considered
                    apart from experimental illustration; and the other, which met twice a-week,
                    consisting entirely of those branches which admitted of such illustration, and
                    in which the principles of mathematics were less called into operation. This
                    latter class was regularly and numerously attended by a great many manufacturers
                    and others engaged in operative occupations, and was continued for several years
                    with great success; and he called it his <hi rend="italic">antitoga</hi> class,
                    in contradistinction to his regular academic attendance, which was denominated
                    the <hi rend="italic">toga</hi> class. It was in consequence of the decided
                    improvement in the arts and manufactures of Glasgow, which from that time became
                    very evident, and which Professor Anderson justly attributed to his
                    instructions, that he conceived the truly philanthropic intention of bequeathing
                    his ample fortune for “the good of mankind and the improvement of science.” In
                    the provisions of his will there was an especial reference to the formation of
                    classes upon the principle of that which he had himself so successfully taught
                    within the walls of the university.</p>
                <p part="N">Professor Anderson died on the 16th of January 1796; and at a meeting of
                    his executors, held on the 23d of March following, it was resolved to carry his
                    intentions into immediate effect. Accordingly on the 21st of September of the
                    same year, Dr. Thomas Garnett was elected first professor of natural
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p part="N">The lectures however were at first only popular. Dr. Garnett, in 1800,
                    was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy in the Royal Institution of
                    Great Britain, founded at the suggestion of Count Rumford and Sir Joseph Banks;
                    and Dr. George Birckbeck was elected in his stead. It was then, <hi
                        rend="italic">upon the suggestion of Or. Birckbeck,</hi> that the trustees
                    were enabled to give full effect to Professor Anderson’s favourite idea, as
                    expressed in his will, of affording instruction in experimental philosophy to
                    the artizans of Glasgow. Such was the origin of the first mechanics’ class,
                    which has now been taught for upwards of thirty-six years with increasing
                    success and advantage to this interesting class of students.</p>
                <p part="N">But important as was this era in the history of the class which was thus
                    instituted, it was not until upwards of twenty years afterwards that the example
                    was followed by any other city in the kingdom. At length, however, in 1821, the
                    School of Arts for the instruction of mechanics was formed in Edinburgh; and
                    within a year or two afterwards, the example was followed, and another
                    institution of the same nature was originated in Glasgow, in consequence of some
                    differences which had arisen between Dr. Ure, (Dr. Birckbeck’s successor in the
                    Andersonian Institution), and the students who attended his operative class. A
                    great many of these left the Andersonian and founded the Mechanics’ Institution,
                    of which Dr. Birckbeck, at their solicitation, consented to become the patron.
                    About the same time the London Mechanics’ Institution was instituted, and within
                    a very few years after this period there was hardly a city of any note in the
                    kingdom which had not institutions of a kindred description.</p>
                <p part="N">As might have been expected, there exists a variety of opinions both as
                    to the precise kind of instruction which these institutions ought to afford in
                    order to carry their objects into the most complete effect, and also in regard
                    to the manner in which they ought to be governed. Some conceive that the course
                    of instruction ought to be of a popular nature, admitting amongst the lectures
                    upon the graver and more abstruse sciences, prelections of a lighter and more
                    attractive kind; whilst others are of opinion that the course ought to be
                    strictly confined to those branches of physical science alone which are of
                    practical application in the arts or manufactures. The management of several,
                    indeed of the greater number, is entirely in the hands of the mechanics
                    themselves; some have an admixture of these with the upper classes of society,
                    whilst in others of a third description, the government is entirely vested in
                    the latter, or wealthier classes.</p>
                <p part="N">Favourable as we are to the universal diffusion of knowledge amongst the
                    great mass of the people, we conceive, that the paramount object which these
                    institutions have in view, namely, the advancement of the arts and manufactures,
                    will be most decidedly and advantageously promoted, by confining the attention
                    of the student to those branches of the physical sciences which bear more
                    especially on the great majority of the useful arts. We have seen and examined
                    carefully the plans of study as followed by most of the leading institutions of
                    this kind throughout the kingdom; but, whilst we generally approve of them all,
                    we shall confine ourselves to a more extended outline of the course followed by
                    the Edinburgh School of Arts, as being that which seems to us most likely to
                    promote the great objects they all have in view. It being self-evident that the
                    elements of mathematics, mechanical philosophy, and chemistry, are of the most
                    general application to the useful arts, it has been the <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194205815?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5815-0461"/>principal
                    aim of the directors of that institution to urge the necessity of acquiring a
                    knowledge of these upon the notice of the student by every possible means; and
                    especially that they should thoroughly understand the fundamental principles of
                    mathematics, both from the intimate connexion these have with all the physical
                    sciences, and as supplying a course of mental discipline, highly favourable to
                    the successful prosecution, at any after period of life, of those studies the
                    principles of which are more immediately involved in the ordinary occupations of
                    life, and by the application of (which alone any decided improvements in the
                    arts may reasonably be looked for. And in order to encourage the student to
                    adhere steadily to a certain course of study, an honorary certificate or diploma
                    was instituted, conferring on the successful candidate the privilege of availing
                    himself gratuitously, during his life, of all advantages of the institution.
                    That course of study is as follows :—</p>
                <p part="N">I. A junior class of mathematics meeting twice a-week, in which the
                    following branches are taught: Arithmetic, including vulgar and decimal
                    fractions; Algebra, as far as simple and quadratic equations; Geometry, first
                    and second books of Euclid. In this class, a portion of each hour of teaching is
                    devoted to exercises and examinations.</p>
                <p part="N">II. A senior class of mathematics meeting once a-week, in which the
                    following branches are taught: Geometry, the remaining books of Euclid;
                    Logarithms; Mensuration and Trigonometry, with their various practical
                    applications. In this class, also, a portion of each hour of teaching is devoted
                    to exercises and examinations.</p>
                <p part="N">III. A class of Natural Philosophy, illustrated by experiments, meeting
                    once a-week, in which the following branches are taught: Mechanics, including
                    statics and dynamics; Hydrostatics, Hydraulics, Pneumatics, and Optics, with
                    such additional matter as time may permit of. A part of every fourth lecture of
                    this course is devoted to examinations on the subjects treated of in the three
                    preceding lectures.</p>
                <p part="N">IV. A class of Theoretical Chemistry, in which the principles of the
                    science are taught, together with their application to the principal arts and
                    manufactures in the processes of which chemical principles are involved. This
                    class meets oncea-week; and apart of every fourth lecture of this course is
                    devoted to examinations upon the subjects of the three preceding lectures.</p>
                <p part="N">V. It is of course left optional to the students to attend as many of
                    the classes in one session as they please, and also to attend them separately in
                    whatever order they prefer. But the directors, impressed with the benefits which
                    may arise from such a course of study, earnestly recommend those who desire
                    fully to avail themselves of the benefits of the institution, to pursue their
                    studies on the following plan, viz. During the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
                    year, to attend the junior mathematical class alone; during the <hi
                        rend="italic">secorid</hi> year, to attend the senior mathematical and the
                    chemistry classes; and during the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> year, to attend
                    the natural philosophy and the chemistry classes.</p>
                <p part="N">It was therefore with the view of encouraging students to pursue this
                    regular and systematic plan of education, that the directors instituted the
                    honorary certificate above mentioned.</p>
                <p part="N">This course of study has for the last four years been most steadily
                    persevered in, and the acquirements of the students who obtained the
                    certificates after the most searching examinations, have completely satisfied
                    the directors and other competent judges who were present on these occasions,
                    that tlιe great object of the institution had, in their case at least, been
                    attained, and that the information acquired by them was sound and practical.</p>
                <p part="N">Within the last year an addition to the course of study afforded by this
                    institution has been made, and it promises to have the most beneficial effect on
                    the advancement of those branches of art, in which the principles of <hi
                        rend="italic">Design</hi> are in any way involved, viz. a class for
                    Ornamental Modelling. It is by no means intended in this class to open a nursery
                    for artists, but only to teaeh those engaged in trades where ornament is in the
                    least concerned, such as silver-chasers, jewellers, plasterers, glass-cutters,
                    brassfounders, smiths, die-sinkers, and a variety of others, to form their ideas
                    of design on the most approved models of ancient and modem excellence; to enable
                    them, instead of servilely imitating existing patterns, with a vague uncertainty
                    and want of acquaintance with the laws which regulate art, to classify their
                    labours, and, by accustoming their minds to contemplate and imitate acknowledged
                    excellence, gradually to lead the way to that <hi rend="italic">creative
                        skill</hi> in the execution of designs, which may eventually lead to the
                    commencement of a new era in such departments ofart.</p>
                <p part="N">The fee for each of the four classes above mentioned separately, the
                    junior mathematics, the senior mathematics, the natural philosophy, and the
                    chemistry, is five shillings. A ticket which gives admission to all the
                    lectures, twelve shillings. The privileges of the library is extended to all
                    students, whether attending one or more classes.</p>
                <p part="N">When these institutions were first originated, a great many excellent
                    persons were led to withhold from them their countenance and support, fearing
                    that the moral effect which they might have on the minds of the working classes
                    would be unfavourable to the reception of those great and fundamental principles
                    of religion, without which all human acquirements sink into insignificance; and
                    that they would only fit their pupils .more thoroughly for becoming the dupes
                    and tools of designing men. Our opinion, however, of their effects upon society
                    at large, is very different indeed; for by invigorating the faculties and
                    enlarging the information of the student, this training serves the double
                    purpose of enabling them to understand the evidences and truths of religion more
                    easily and more thoroughly than they could otherwise have done, and of
                    fortifying them more strongly against those sophistries by which its enemies so
                    often and so fatally perplex the ignorant and the simple. It is true that
                    knowledge is not always accompanied with such results; but its natural tendency
                    is to counteract and prevent the very evils which have been apprehended as
                    likely to result from it. Proceeding on the supposition that the young men who
                    attend these institutions have previously, under the parental roof and at the
                    schools where they obtained their elementary education, been taught the
                    principles of religion, the mental discipline which they receive therein, and
                    the course of study they are encouraged to pursue, furnish them with the means
                    of cherishing a more enlightened, vigorous, and steady attachment to those great
                    doctrines, which constitute the perfection and the glory of all science; and as
                    industry is one of the best safeguards of moral conduct, they will operate most
                    beneficially in that respect on those whose chief danger arises from the
                    temptations which beset them at their leisure hours. Being necessarily so much
                    occupied with objects of sense, and so little accustomed to purely mental
                    exercises, when they seek for enjoyment, they are apt to look for it in the
                    indulgence of mere appetite. Now these institutions are calculated to rescue
                    them from the power of such temptations, not only by filling up their spare time
                    with innocent and laudable pursuits, and providing them with occupations which
                    elevate them far above the grossness of sensuality, but by training them up to
                    habits of purity, sobriety, and correct deportment.</p>
                <p part="N">It is pleasing, therefore, to be enabled to say that the progress and
                    advancement of the arts since the commencement of these institutions, has been
                    most striking. They have attained an elevation, and partaken of a character
                    which was formerly unknown; and since that period we may date the discovery and
                    improvement of several of the most widely useful inventions, and the consequent
                    dissemination of those comforts and elegancies of life, which have had such an
                    influence on the whole social system.</p>
