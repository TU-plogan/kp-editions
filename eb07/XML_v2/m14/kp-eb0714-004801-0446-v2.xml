                    Mallorca, an island in the Mediterranean Sea, of the group anciently
                    distinguished by the name of the Baleares, on account of the great reputation of
                    the inhabitants as slingers. According to D’Anville, these islands were first
                    settled by a colony of Phoenicians, who transferred them to the Carthaginians,
                    and, after that republic had been conquered, they were subdued by the Romans,
                    under whose dominion they continued till the dissolution of that empire. When
                    the Moors overran Spain, the island came into the possession of that race under
                    one of their chiefs, who assumed the title of king; but afterwards, upon the
                    conquest of Granada by herdinand, it formed a province of the kingdom of
                    Spain.</p>
                <p part="N">Majorca, thelargest island of the group, is situated in north latitude
                    between 39° 15'and 39° 57', and in east longitude between 2° 9' and 3° 20'. It
                    is about 100 miles from the nearest coast of Spain, and 130 from Algiers on the
                    African shore. Its figure is an irregular rhomboid, and its area. according to
                    Toffino, is 1360 square miles. The island is in general lofty, with high ranges
                    of mountains covering the whole from the middle to the northern coast, and so
                    closely connected as to leave only a number of deep valleys and gullies between
                    them, bordered by precipices. Of these mountains the most westerly and most
                    remarkable is a high peak, called by the natives <hi rend="italic">Puig de
                        Galatzo,</hi> 2000 feet above the level of the sea, which stands in latitude
                    39° 36'. The highest mountains, however, are those on the northern side, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Silla de Torellas,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Puig
                        Major,</hi> or Great Peak. There are several others, but they are less
                    elevated.</p>
                <p part="N">From the middle of the island to the south coast, the surface is much
                    lower than on the north; but it presents several hills and agreeable prospects.
                    The land is finely variegated by corn fields, vineyards, olive woods, orchards,
                    and meadows. The soil on the hills and mountains is rich and fertile, in the
                    valleys moist and even marshy, and on the shore are tracts of sand and of
                    morasses. There are no very extensive woods, but sufficient, consisting chiefly
                    of dwarf trees, to supply fuel. There are no considerable rivers, but many small
                    brooks, and a great abundance of springs; so that there is no scarcity of good
                    water. A large lake, or rather a marsh, is formed by two small rivers, called
                    Al-bufera, on the north coast, near the Bay of Alcudia. It is separated from the
                    sea by a narrow tongue of land; but in summer the heat nearly exhales the water,
                    when the environs are thereby rendered very unhealthy. The climate is mild,
                    agreeable, and healthy in general. The heat of summer is rarely excessive, being
                    cooled by the sea breezes. The winter is temperate, and not excessive in its
                    variations. The thermometer of Reaumur usually stands from 10° to 14°. Snow and
                    ice are almost unknown.</p>
                <p part="N">The island has no other division than into communes or parishes; but it
                    contains one city, thirty-four towns, and twenty-six villages, besides many
                    hamlets. The inhabitants are 164,500, all rigidly adhering to the Roman Catholic
                    church, under a bishop, with a cathedral or palma, and eighty churches in
                    various parts of the island, and many monasteries and nunneries. By the accounts
                    of 1797, it appears there were no less than 1326 regular clergy, 1002 members of
                    monastic orders, and 529 females in nunneries; but they are said to have
                    diminished since that period.</p>
                <p part="N">The inhabitants resemble the Spaniards of Catalonia, both in their
                    complexion and features. In the towns the Castilian language is generally
                    spoken; but the common people use a tongue which is a medley compounded of
                    Limosin, Greek, Latin, Spanish, and Arabic.</p>
                <p part="N">The chief, indeed almost the exclusive occupation, of the inhabitants is
                    agriculture. According to the statistics of Arguiles, the condition of the
                    population is given, viz. 513 nobles, 3826 labouring proprietors, 2223 tenants
                    cultivators, 14,738 agricultural labourers, 3175 artisans and poor labourers,
                    155 merchants and traders, 413 officers of government, and 2270 domestic and
                    other servants. The value of the whole wealth of the island, by the same
                    minister, is stated to be L.l,664,636, distributed thus: Value of the land and
                    crops, L.1,375,600; of the animals, L.180,844; of the product of those
                    manufactures made of vegetable substances, L.53,884; of those made of animal
                    substances, L.20,965; of those made of mineral substances, L.28,340; and of the
                    products of the arts and of commerce, L.5000.</p>
                <p part="N">The produce of corn is barely sufficient for the food of the
                    inhabitants. The. average growth of wheat is about 100,000 quarters, of barley
                    356,000, of oats 25,000, and of pulse 21,000; but neither rye nor maize is
                    cultivated. In wet seasons, the corn harvest sometimes nearly fails, when the
                    scarcity of grain is severely felt. The produce of culinary vegetables is most
                    abundant, consisting of beans, peas, melons, pumpkins, onions, garlic, and the
                        various<pb break="no" facs="nls:194200459?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0714-0459-0049"/> kinds of capsicums and tornatos. As much of
                    hemp and flax is grown as is required for the inhabitants. Wine is one of the
                    most abundant products. Both the red and white are of excellent quality; and the
                    quantity yielded beyond the domestic demand is converted, by distillation, into
                    good brandy. The olive trees cover the sides of most of the hills. The olives
                    are smaller than those of the Continent, but they are more abundant in oil, and
                    the whole quantity annually made amounts to more than 650,000 gallons. The
                    mulberry trees feed a sufficient number of worms to yield about 40,000 pounds
                    weight of silk. The other articles obtained from the soil, and part of which are
                    exported, are oranges, lemons, citrons, almonds, dates, figs, pistachio nuts,
                    and capers.</p>
                <p part="N">The sea around the island swarms with fish, the taking of which affords
                    employment to many of the inhabitants, and tends to form some of the best
                    sailors in the Mediterranean. Bay salt is made on the south side of the island,
                    sufficient for domestic purposes, as well as for curing the fish taken on the
                    coasts. The stock of live cattle, according to Grasset St Sauveur, amounts to
                    2000 horses, 9000 asses, 6000 horned cattle, 61,500 sheep, 33,600 goats, and
                    25,000 swine. These last animals are fattened to the weight of from 450 to 500
                    pounds, and form the principal part of the animal food of the natives.</p>
                <p part="N">The seat of the government of the island is the city of Palma, situated
                    in a bay of the same name, formed by Cape Cala Figuera on the west, and by Cape
                    Blanco on the cast. The bay is capacious; and the best anchorage is near to the
                    city, in a depth of water from six to nine fathoms. The bay is protected by
                    three strong castles, and the city is surrounded by walls and ditches. It has a
                    fine cathedral and an episcopal palace, a government-house, and appropriate
                    courts of justice, with several monasteries. Besides the Bay of Palma, which is
                    on the south-west of the island, there are two others on the north-east part of
                    it, viz. Alcudia and Pollenza. In the former is good anchorage for the largest
                    ships, within the length of three or four cables from the town, and in six
                    fathoms water, with very good holding ground. It is somewhat exposed to the
                    north-east winds, which bring in a heavy sea, but it is nevertheless tolerably
                    secure. The Bay of Pollenza admits ships of war of the largest size; but if many
                    of them were to resort to it at the same time, the greater number would be
                    exposed to the wind from east-north-east, and a few only would be sheltered.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal places and their population are, Palma, 29,400; Falaniche,
                    6800; JManacor, 5963; Soller, 5600; Leuchmajor, 5400; Pollenza, 4500; and
                    Bonalbufar, 3740.</p>
