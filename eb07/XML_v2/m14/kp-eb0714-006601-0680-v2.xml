                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MALTE-BRUN, or rather</label>, as he was called in
                    his native country, Malthe-Conrad Bruun, was born at Thister, in the province of
                    Jutland, in Denmark, on the 12th of August 1775. His father, formerly a captain
                    of dragoons, was counsellor of justice and commissioner of domains.</p>
                <p part="N">The latter watched over the education of his son with great care, and
                    the excellent dispositions manifested by the young Conrad in his studies,
                    determined his father to educate him for the church. At the university of
                    Copenhagen, where he took his degrees, he followed his theological studies in
                    submission to his father’s desire; but literature was his chief delight. Endowed
                    with a great facility of learning languages, and apprehending the niceties of
                    inflexion, and the shades of delicacy by which they are distinguished, he was
                    soon enabled to write French with a facility, an elegance, and vigour, which no
                    other foreigner ever acquired, and which placed him in the first rank of French
                    authors.</p>
                <p part="N">Though timid and reserved in conversation, he was bold and passionate in
                    his writings. He proved this in the first pamphlet which he published, under the
                    title of Wakeren, or the Alarm Bell, the political sentiments of which drew down
                    a legal condemnation upon the author.</p>
                <p part="N">The reputation which he had acquired determined him to abandon the
                    ecclesiastical order for that of the bar. The study of the law developed his
                    independence of opinion and his enthusiasm for liberty. In 1795 and 1796, he
                    edited a periodical which he entitled The Aristocrat’s Catechism, in which the
                    public authorities found ground for commencing a process against him, which
                    obliged him to fly to the island of Hvn, belonging to Sweden. During his
                    retirement, he composed several poetical pieces of great merit. After a short
                    sojourn in the land of his exile, he obtained leave to return to Copenhagen. His
                    first care was to publish his poetical essays. This collection had all the
                    success which he could wish; but as he never ceased to assert his country’s
                    right to that freedom which, under the administration of Bernstorff, she seemed
                    on the point of obtaining, the party in power, interested in opposing reform,

                    and revolutionary spirit. The hostility of his enemies again menaced him in
                    1799, on the appearance of a bitter political satire entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tria</hi><hi rend="italic">juncta</hi><hi rend="italic">in uno.</hi> He
                    therefore hastily sought an asylum in Sweden, where his reputation secured him
                    protection, and his talents won him respect; and when the sentence of the Danish
                    tribunals had condemned him to exile, he resolved to adopt France as his
                    country.</p>
                <p part="N">He had been little more than three years in France when he commenced,
                    along with Mentelle, a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Géographie Mathématique,
                        Physique., et Politique,</hi> in sixteen volumes. It was the first work of
                    its class which combined force of expression and elegance of style with variety
                    of description and minuteness of detail. Before its appearance, the geographical
                    works of France were mere compilations, destitute alike of judgment and of
                    taste, uninteresting in narrative, and repulsive in detail. The public
                    understood, that although Malte-Brun contributed only a third part to the
                    compilation of the,new geography, its success was mainly to be attributed to his
                    talents; and the proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Debats,</hi>
                    from the celebrity he had acquired by this publication, earnestly solicited him
                    to become one of its editors. His contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Journal
                        des Debats,</hi> on voyages, geography, history, languages, antiquities,
                    physical science, morals, and literature, compose a miscellany at once
                    interesting and voluminous.</p>
                <p part="N">At the period when France was preparing to establish in Poland a barrier
                    to secure Western Europe against the preponderating power of Russia, Malte-Brun
                    conceived the design of bringing this country into notice; a country which had
                    twice fallen a sacrifice to iniquitous power, and which, divided between two of
                    its natural allies, no longer possessed a geographical existence. The interest
                    which the Poles excited secured a favourable reception for the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tableau</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Pologne·,</hi> a work which, although
                    it cost the learned geographer only six months’ labour, contains a rapid sketch
                    of the geography, history, manners, and resources of the ancient territory of
                    Poland.</p>
                <p part="N">It was in the course of the year 1808 that Malte-Brun executed the plan
                    which he had conceived, for contributing to diffuse a taste for geography in
                    France, by the publication of a periodical especially devoted to this important
                    branch of human knowledge. He then published, in concert with Μ. Eyries, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">des Voyages, de la</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Géographie, et</hi><hi rend="italic">de ľ</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Histoire;</hi> and the success of this attempt led to the
                    publication of other periodical works on geographical science.</p>
                <p part="N">The publication of these annals, and his co-operation in the editorship
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Debats,</hi> did not prevent Malte-Brun
                    from finding time to erect that monument to geography which he proposed to leave
                    as his most durable title to scientific and literary reputation; we allude to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Precis</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Géographie
                        Universelle.</hi> The first volume of this work appeared in 1810, and the
                    sixth in 1825. He had only prepared the first five or six leaves of the seventh
                    volume, when he ceased for ever from his labours, leaving the last two volumes,
                    containing Western Europe, to be completed by others. An English translation of
                    Malte-Brun’s Geography has been published at Edinburgh, in nine volumes 8vo.</p>
                <p part="N">Great, indeed, must have been the erudition which enabled him to compose
                    the first six volumes of this work. The plan is no doubt too vast for one man to
                    execute, without leaving some parts weak; still these are comparatively few in
                    number, and no part of what he left unfinished has been better done to this
                    day.</p>
                <p part="N">The constant and harassing fatigue attending his laborious employment at
                    length exhausted his strength. For three days he had determined on confining
                    himself to his room; but, absorbed by his passion for science, and the intensity
                    of his desire to be useful, he sketched, two hours before his death, the
                    analysis of a scientific work for the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Debats</hi>;
                    and, on the 14 th of December 1826, an attack of apoplexy suddenly carried him
                    off.</p>
