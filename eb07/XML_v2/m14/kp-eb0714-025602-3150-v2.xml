                    a people who inhabited the Libanus and the Anti-Libanus, and who, about the

                    the borders of the Orontes, before his settlement amongst the Mardaites of
                    Libanus. From the testimony of Tyrius and other unexceptionable witnesses, as
                    also from the most authentic records, it appears that the Maronites retained the
                    opinions of the Monothelites until the twelfth century, when, abandoning and
                    renouncing the doctrine of one will in Christ, they were, in the year 1182,
                    re-admitted into the communion of the Roman Catholic church. The most learned of
                    the modern Maronites have left no method unemployed to defend their church
                    against this accusation; they have laboured to prove, by a variety of
                    testimonies, that their ancestors always persevered in the Catholic faith, and
                    in their attachment to the Roman pontiff, without adopting the doctrine of the
                    Monophysites, or Monothelites. But all their efforts are insufficient to
                    establish the truth of these assertions to such as have any acquaintance with
                    the history of the church and the records of ancient times; for to all such the
                    testimonies they produce must appear absolutely fictitious and destitute of all
                    authority.</p>
                <p part="N">Faustus Nairon, a Maronite, settled at Rome, has published an apology
                    for Maro and the rest of his nation. His tenet is, that they really took their
                    name from the Maro who lived about the year 400, and of whom mention is made in
                    Chrysostom, Theodoret, and the <hi rend="italic">Menologium</hi> of the Greeks.
                    He adds, that the disciples of this Maro spread themselves throughout all Syria;
                    that they built several monasteries, and particularly one which bore the name of
                    their leader; that all the Syrians who were not tainted with heresy took refuge
                    amongst them; and that for this reason the heretics of those times called them
                    Maronites.</p>
                <p part="N">Mosheim observes, that the subjection of the Maronites to the spiritual
                    jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff was agreed to upon this express condition,
                    that neither the popes nor their emissaries should pretend to change or abolish
                    any thing which related to the ancient rites, moral precepts, oř religious
                    opinions, of this people; so that in reality there is nothing to be found
                    amongst the Maronites which savours of popery, if we except their attachment to
                    the Roman pontiff, who is obliged to pay very dearly for their friendship. For,
                    as the Maronites live in the utmost distress and poverty, under the tyrannical
                    yoke of the Mahommedans, the bishop of Rome is under the necessity of furnishing
                    them with subsidies to appease their oppressors; to procure a subsistence for
                    their bishop and clergy; to provide all things requisite for the support of
                    their churches, and the uninterrupted exercise of public worship; and in general
                    to contribute to lessen their misery.</p>
                <p part="N">The Maronites have a patriarch who resides in the monastery of Cannubin,
                    on Mount Libanus, and assumes the title of patriarch of Antioch, and the name of
                    Peter, as if he seemed desirous of being considered as the successor of that
                    apostle. He is elected by the clergy and the people, according to the ancient
                    custom; but, since their reunion with the church of Rome, he is obliged to have
                    a bull of confirmation from the pope. He observes perpetual celibacy, as well as
                    the rest of the bishops his suffragans; but as to the other ecclesiastics, they
                    are allowed to marry before ordination, though the monastic life is in great
                    esteem amongst them. Their monks are of the order of St Anthony, and live in the
                    most obscure places in the mountains, far from the commerce of the world.</p>
                <p part="N">As to their faith, they agree in the main with the rest of the eastern
                    church. Their priests do not say mass singly, but together, all standing around
                    the altar. They communicate in unleavened bread; and the laity have hitherto
                    partaken in both kinds, though the practice of communicating in one has latterly
                    been gaining ground. In Lent they eat nothing after sunrise; and their other
                    fastings are very numerous.</p>
