                    which it is separated by a narrowstrait, not more than twomiles in breadth. It
                    formsan excellent harbour, which is capacious, and yvell defended from all
                    winds, and it affords anchorage for the largest ships. The principal entrance is
                    from the north-west; but there is also a fine channel to the southward. There is
                    an inner harbour, in which ships may receive every kind of repair that can be
                    performed without going into dock. The area of the island is estimated at 160
                    square miles. It is nearly five leagues in length and seven or eight miles in
                    breadth. It is of an irregular four-sided figure, which is highest on the north
                    side and shortest on the south; and is intersected by a range of lofty hills,
                    which decrease in magnitude as they approach the south, and in which are the
                    sources of numerous streams, that supply the island with abundance of water.
                    These hills are of a moderate height. The highest, namely, the Flag-staff Füll,
                    does not rise to more than 2500 feet above the level of the sea. Here the heat
                    is comparatively moderate; the thermometer seldom rises above 74°, and often
                    falls to 66° whilst in the plains it ranges from 76° to 90°. The climate is
                    moist, and the rains are heavy. Except in the dry hot months of January and
                    February, scarcely a day passes without rain, which is heaviest in November and
                    December.</p>
                <p part="N">The island generally possesses a fertile soil, being for the most part a
                    light black mould, mixed with gravel, clay, and in many parts sandy. It is
                    chiefly formed from the decayed leaves of trees, f rom which originated a fine
                    vegetable mould, the whole island having been for ages covered with immense
                    forests. This has in some degree disappeared as the woods were cleared and the
                    surface exposed to the weather; but the soil in the interior is still adapted
                    for any sort of tropical produce. Cultivation is extended over the northern, and
                    nearly the whole of the southern and eastern sides of the island. The principal
                    productions are pepper, betel-nut, betel-leaf, cocoa-nuts, coffee, sugar,
                    parsley, ginger, yams, sweet potatoes, and a great variety of vegetables. The
                    island abounds in many species of fruits, such as the mangosteen, rambosteen,
                    pine-apples, guavas, oranges, citrons, pomegranates, and others. The island also
                    produces cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, pimento, kyapootee, cotatova, and numerous
                    other plants from the Moluccas and Eastern Isles. Pepper is one of the chief
                    articles of cultivation. This island also affords the elastic gum vine, or
                    American caoutchouc. It grows to the thickness of an arm, creeping along the
                    ground to the distance of two hundred paces, and then ascending amongst the
                    branches of high trees. The forests which are found in this island abound in
                    excellent timber for ship-building, and supply masts of any dimensions, lower
                    masts of any size having been procured here for a seventy-four gun-ship.</p>

                    to Captain Francis Light, of a country ship, who had married his daughter. It
                    was then transferred to the East India Company, and accepted; being peculiarly
                    adapted as a mercantile station for vessels arriving from all the Malay ports,
                    the Moluccas, Borneo, the Celebes, and the Philippine Islands. A small
                    detachment was accordingly sent from Calcutta, under the command of Captain
                    Light, who in 1786, took possession of the island, for the use of the East India
                    Company. But those early Settlers had great difficulty in clearing the country,
                    encumbered with an immense forest, with swamps which required to be drained, and
                    ravines which it was necessary to fill up. A town called George Town was,
                    however, marked out, and within a year sixty Chinese farhilics had settled in
                    it, besides great numbers of Malays, Buggepes, and other Eastern traders. The
                    port was made free to all nations, and in a very short time numerous adventurers
                    flocked to the settlement, commerce and population rapidly increased, and
                    cultivation was extended. In 1797 the population amounted to 6,937, exclusive of
                    Europeans and the garrison; and in 1805, it had risen to 10,310. They have since
                    been progressively increasing, and exhibit an uncommon diversity of races,
                    consisting of British, Dutch, Portuguese, Americans, Arabs, Parsees, Chinese,
                    Chulias, Malays, Buggepes, Birmans, Siamese, Javanese, &amp;c. In 1805, the
                    settlement having grown in wealth and importance, it was determined to erect it
                    into a regular government, subordinate only to the Governor-General of India.
                    But, on account of the enormous expense of this establishment, some
                    modifications were made in these arrangements in the year 1808. This island is
                    resorted to by invalids from the continent in search of health; but if we may
                    judge from the number of governors who have died here, the change is scarcely
                    for the better. Captain Light died in 1794; and he was succeeded by Mr.
                    Manningham, who died soon after in Bengal. In 1796 Majof∙ Macdonald took the
                    charge, and died at Madras in 1799· Sir George Leith, who succeeded him, lived
                    and returned to Europe; but the Hon. C. Bruce, who arrived as governor in the
                    year 1810, only Survived till next December.</p>
                <p part="N">The fort, which is called Fort Cornwallis, is incapable of defence, from
                    its size and construction. It is built upon the north-eastern point of the
                    island, and large sums have been spent without completing it. It contains
                    barracks for the military, an arsenal, a magazine, and several military
                    storehouses. Of late years the sea has made great encroachments on the northern
                    face of the fort, and along the esplanade. The town is of considerable extent,
                    and the streets, which cross each other at right angles, are spacious and airy.
                    There is a large pier for landing and shipping goods; a government house, a
                    church, a jail, and several substantial bridges have been built; whilst the
                    fortifications have been improved and strengthened, and the public roads
                    repaired and widened. The markets are well supplied with fish of various
                    descriptions and of excellent quality; with poultry of all sorts, pork, grain of
                    every description, and a profusion of vegetables and fruit. The beef and veal
                    are not of a good quality. Sheep are imported from the continent of India;
                    whilst Sumatra and the Malay peninsula furnish a supply of goats. Milk and
                    butter are dear and scarce. A great trade is carried on with Europe, India, and
                    the islands in the Eastern seas. Ships that are trading to the east, especially
                    to China, tòüch here, where they procure such refreshments or articles of trade
                    as they require. Vessels from Europe, bound for China, also touch here, and load
                    large quantities of tin, canes, rattans, sago, pepper, bötel-nut, hιchc-de-mar,
                    edible birds’ nests, &amp;c., for the China market. This small island is the
                    emporium of the whole trade of the Straits of Malacca and adjacent islands. The
                    imports from Europe, either directly or from the other presidencies, are
                    generally European manufactures in iron and steel, such as anchors, cιltlery of
                    all sorts, fire-arms, nails; also tin-ware, patent shot, sheet-lead,
                    sheet-copper, iron in bars, books, pamphlets, boots and shoes, cables, canvas,
                    cabinet ware, cloths, and Cassimeres, glass ware, hats, haberdashery, hosiery,
                    musical and mathematical instruments, oilmen’s stones, painters’ colours, plated
                    wire, watches, malt liquor, and European wines of all sorts. From Bengal, the
                    imports are opium, grain, iron, steel, marine stores, and piece goods; from the
                    Coromandel coast, salt, tobacco, cloths, evir rope and yarns, handkerchiefs,
                    chintzes, &amp;c.; from Bombay and the Malabar coast, cotton, salt, a few piece
                    goods, red wood, sandal wood, sharks’ fins, myrrh, piece goods, &amp;c.; from
                    Sumatra, pepper, benzoin, camphire, and gold dust; from Acheen and Pedeer, gold
                    dust, betel-nut, pepper, rice, and Acheen cloths. Tin is imported from the east
                    coast and from Junkceylon; also pepper, Sugar, oil, rice, tobacco, elephants’
                    teeth, edible birds’ nests, &amp;c.; spices from the Moluccas; gold dust, sago,
                    and black wood from Borneo; and from China, tea, sugar, lustrings, velvet,
                    paper, umbrellas, china-ware, quicksilver, and generally every article required
                    by the Chinese settlers, though British produce has in many cases superseded
                    that of China. Other articles from China are, raw silk, copper ware, China
                    camphor, China root alum. The exports consist of many of those articles which
                    are sent to Sumatra, Jnnkccylon, Java, Borneo, China, Bengal, Coromandel, as
                    they are required.</p>
