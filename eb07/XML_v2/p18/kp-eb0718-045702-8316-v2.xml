                    Brazil, situated to the north of Rio and Espiritu-Santo. It was formerly
                    reckoned a province of itself, but at the ncw provincial division of the country
                    in 1829, it was formed into a comarca of Bahia. Along with Espiritu-Santo, it
                    forms one continuous tract·, presenting such a sameness of natural features,
                    that they have generally been described together. It is separated from Rio de
                    Janeiro on the south, by the river Capabuan or Itabupuana. On the west it
                    borders on Minas Seraes; the river Belmonte separates it from Bahia on the
                    north, whilst its eastern limits are washed by the Atlantic ocean. It has a
                    sea-coast of four hundred miles in length; and the maritime district is the only
                    part of the country as yet peopled by Europeans, or their mixed descendants.

                    de Janeiro to the Bay of All-Saints (Bahia) about eleven degrees of latitude,
                    and which are not yet taken possession of by the Portuguese settlers; only a few
                    roads have hitherto been opened, with infinite labour, along the rivers that
                    traverse them. In these forests, where the primitive inhabitants, who are
                    pressed upon at every other point, have till now enjoyed a serene and peaceful
                    abode, we may still find those people in their original state.” In fact the
                    aborigines of Espiritu-Santo and Porto Seguro have been found more difficult to
                    civilize than any other native tribes in this quarter of the world, and the
                    country itself is still in a great measure uncultivated. The civilized people
                    are wholly confined to the coast, and even there they are not perfectly secure
                    from hostile attacks. Yet the salubrity of the climate, and the fertility of the
                    soil, have rendered this district an object of interest with government, so that
                    settlers have been induced to occupy it. The virgin forests with which it is
                    nearly covered, abound with the finest timber, including the cedar, the
                    sassafras tree, and various other resinous and aromatic species; and no province
                    possesses such an abundance of the tree which supplies the Peruvian balsam. “In
                    the provinces of Espiritu-Santo and Porto-Seguro,” says a recent traveller, “are
                    found several kinds of wood suited to cabinet-work and architecture. The
                    Ibirapitanga (Brazil wood) now so necessary in manufactures, and which is
                    beginning to fail in Pernambuco, is met with here,” and, we may add, on the
                    authority of others, in abundance.</p>
                <p part="N">Between the southern limits of the country and the Rio Doce, which
                    separates Espiritu-Santo from Porto Seguro, are situated several towns and
                    villages, and a few military posts, to secure the settlers from the inroads of
                    the savages. About twenty miles north oftheItabnpuana, on the southern bank of
                    the river Itapemirim is a village of the same name, more recently built than the
                    others, and containing some good houses. The inhabitants, who are but few in
                    number, carry on a small trade in sugar, cotton, rice, millet, and timber. The
                    Sera de Itapemirim, from which the river descends, is celebrated for the works
                    for washing gold, called Minas de Castello, five days journey up the Itapemirim.
                    From this place to the frontier of Minas Geraes, a road has been opened through
                    the dangerous wilderness of woods; but it is hazardous to travel along it on
                    account of the savage hordes of Puries and Botucudoes, by which the country is
                    infested. From the village of Itapemirim to the village of Nova de Benevente,
                    the countrypresents alternate woods and meadows, with a stream at intervals, but
                    no river of any size. Benevente stands at the foot of a hill on the northern
                    bank of the Iritiba or Reritigba, called also the Benevente. This place was
                    built by the Jesuits, who here collected a great number of Indians for the
                    purpose of civilizing them; but the hard labour exacted by the crown drove most
                    of them to other quarters. This was the largest establishment on the coast, and
                    the church and convent erected by the missionaries are still seen in the
                    neighbourhood of the town. Between Benevente and the Rio de Espiritu Santo,
                    which gives name to the province, the country is one continuous and magnificent
                    forest, abounding with multitudes of the feathered tribes. The river Espiritu
                    Santo, which is of considerable magnitude at its mouth, rises in the mountains
                    on the frontiers of Minas Geraes, and descending with many windings, through the
                    extensive ancient forests of the Ta-puyas, issues forth at the foot of one of
                    those higher chains of mountains which stretch towards the sea. According to
                    Cazel, the proper name of this river is the Santa Marta. It is stated to be
                    navigable to the first fall, about forty miles up, and the tide ascends twelve
                    miles to the Serra, a river which joins it on the left. Villa Velha, a small and
                    unimportant town, stands on the south bank of the river, not far from its mouth;
                    and about half a league from it, on the opposite side of the bay, is the present
                    capital of Espiritu-Santo, called Villa da Victoria. It is built, according to
                    Cazal, on an amphitheatrical site, on the western side of an island fifteen
                    miles in circumference. It is a pretty neat place, with considerable buildings,
                    constructed in the old Portuguese style. The population of this city is
                    estimated at 12,500.</p>
                <p part="N">From this town to the Rio Doce, the limits of Espiritu-Santo on the
                    north, there are several rivers and small towns; but generally speaking, not
                    only the interior but the seacoast is densely wooded. This province comprehends
                    three-fourths of the captaincy, which, in the year 1534, was assigned to Vasco
                    Fernando Coutinho, as a remuneration for his services in Asia. The Portuguese
                    were repeatedly driven from the colony by the natives, but ultimately they
                    obtained a decisive victory over the savages, and effected a permanent
                    settlement. The Jesuits were the first who succeeded in making peace with the
                    aborigines, and in 1551 they founded the college of Vittoria; but, as we have
                    observed, they made little progress in this quarter.</p>
                <p part="N">The adjoining comarca of Porto Seguro extends from the Rio Doce to the
                    river Belmonte. It lies between 19° 33' and 15° 25' of south latitude, which
                    gives it a length of sixty-five leagues. It was upon this part of the coast that
                    Cabral first set foot, and took possession of Brazil for the crown of Portugal.
                    Some Portuguese having settled here, they intermarried with the natives, so that
                    Pedro Campo Tourinho, its first donatory, found himself, in a few years, the
                    lord of a tolerably well-peopled colony. Santa Cruza town, built on the bay
                    where Cabral cast anchor, soon became considerable and flourished; but the
                    settlement was afterwards transferred to the banks of the Ioâo de Tyba, four
                    miles to the northward, no doubt from this site holding out greater advantages
                    of soil. Besides this place, Tourinho founded the town of St. Amaro, three miles
                    to the south of Porto Seguro, which was subsequently demolished by some of the
                    Indian tribes. After passing through various hands, this captaincy ultimately
                    reverted to the crown in 1758. It was then in a very wretched state, and
                    contained only two towns. The Jesuits, with all their zeal, were able to effect
                    but little, and at the time of their expulsion, they left only two aldeias
                    entirely Indian. As early as 1553, they founded a college in the capital, with a
                    view to prosecute their labours amongst the Indians of the province, but, as in
                    the case of Espiritu-Santo, with very little success.</p>
                <p part="N">The Rio Doce, or sweet river, the most considerable stream between Rio
                    and Bahia, has its origin in the mountains of Minas Geraes, and assumes the name
                    which it bears after the confluence of the Rio Piranga with the Ribeiro do
                    Carmo. It runs through a considerable tract of country, forming several falls in
                    its course. The banks of this river are covered with thick forests, which are
                    the haunt ot a great number of different animals. But far more formidable than
                    all those beasts of prey, and the terror of these forests, is the savage
                    Botucudo, the original inhabitant of the country. Some stations have, from time
                    to time, been formed on the beautiful banks of the Doce; but they have never
                    thriven, from being liable to attacks by the savages, so that the country is
                    still very thinly peopled, and no communication is kept up except along the
                    river. From the banks of the Rio Doce to the St. Matthaeus, a dreary uninhabited
                    wilderness extends along the coast. Indeed, for more than a hundred miles the
                    maritime district is a very flat tract of country; the dull monotony which it
                    presents being only here and there relieved by a sheet of water, or small
                    mountain elevation. The district of St. Matthaeus contains about 3000
                    inhabitants, who cultivate a great deal of mandioc, and export annually 60,000
                    alquieres of flour, and also planks from the neighbouring forests. The orange,
                    the lemon, and the water-melon, flourish here luxuriantly.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193538342?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-8342-0459"/>
                <p part="N">The rivcr St. Matthaeus, originally called the Cricare, like the other
                    large streams in this quarter, rises in the mountains of Minas Geraes, and
                    descends through ancient forests peopled by savage tribes, forming various
                    falls, and receiving several rivers in its course. Cazal mentions the large
                    stream of Cotache as joining it on the left margin. Nearly thirty miles from the
                    St. Matthaeus is the Mucuri, at the mouth of which stands the Villa de St. Joze
                    do Portalegre. This place has of late years risen into some importance, from the
                    opening of a road along the banks of the river, to Villa do Principe in Minas
                    Geraes. Almost all the fine species of wood found on the eastern coast of
                    Brazil, abound in the forests of this district. Five leagues to the north of the
                    Mucuri, is the river Peruhipe, four miles from the mouth of which is the town of
                    Villa Vicosa, consisting of about one hundred houses, with a church and camara,
                    pleasantly situated amongst groves of cocoa palms. The inhabitants carry on a
                    trade in mandioc flour, which is exported in small coasting vessels. Ten miles
                    farther north is Caravellao, situated on a river of the same name, about five or
                    six miles from the sea. The river is two miles in breadth, and proportionally
                    deep; and up to the town its banks are beautifully interspersed with
                    plantations. Caravellao is bustling and populous, and carries on a brisk trade
                    in the productions of the country, especially mandioc flour, large quantities of
                    which are annually exported. The port is much frequented by vessels from
                    Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio, and the other towns on the east coast.</p>
                <p part="N">Porto Seguro, the capital of the comarca, is situated at the mouth of
                    the river Buranhem, in lat. 16° <hi rend="italic">40'</hi> south, and long. 40°
                    12'west. The port, which has given name both to the town and the district, is
                    formed by a ledge of rocks which runs out for about a mile from an extended
                    point of the main, in a direction parallel to the land, presenting a natural
                    mole. This town is less considerable than Caravellao, but may contain a
                    population of about 3000 souls. The upper part of it lies on an elevated ridge,
                    but the major portion of the inhabitants are established on the declivity nearer
                    the river, a place more advantageous for carrying on trade. A third part of the
                    town lies close to the mouth of the rivcr. There is little agricultural industry
                    displayed in this country, the greater part of the farina consumed being brought
                    from Santa Cruz. This, with salt fish, constitutes the chief subsistence of the
                    inhabitants. About eighteen miles north of Porto Seguro, is the town of Santa
                    Cruz, already mentioned. It is smaller and less important than the capital,
                    although once in a flourishing condition. Some attention, however, is paid here
                    to agriculture; and farina is exported to various parts of the coast. The most
                    northerly town of Porto Seguro is the Villa de Belmonte, situated on the Rio
                    Grande de Belmonte, which falls into the sea in latitude 15° 40' south. This
                    town was originally an aldeia of christianised Indians, but few of them now
                    remain, and the place has sunk into decay. The whole population of Espiritu
                    Santo, has been reckoned at 74,000; that of Porto Seguro is probably not more.
                    But a great part of the country is still in complete possession of several
                    Indian tribes, amongst which the Botucudes, the remains of the once formidable
                    Aymores, are the most conspicuous.</p>
