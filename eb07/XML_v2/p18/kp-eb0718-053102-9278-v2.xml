                    LL.D.and F. R. S.,a natural phi losopher and theologian, was born upon the 24th
                    of March 1 <hi rend="underline">773,</hi> at Field-head, in the parish of
                    Bristall, in the west riding of Yorkshire. His father was a cloth-manufacturer,
                    and both his parents were respectable Calvinistic dissenters. A strong desire of
                    reading was one of the first passions which this philosopher exhibited, and

                    his destination, and, instead of bringing him up as a tradesman, to qualify him
                    for some learned profession. He acquired a knowledge of Hebrew, Greek, and
                    Latin, in the school of an eminent teacher at Bartlcy; and, at the age of
                    nineteen, he became a theological student in the academy of Da ventry. When
                    about the age of twenty-two, he was made choice of as assistant minister to the
                    Independent congregation of Needham Market, in Suffolk. Having resided at
                    Needham for about three years, he received an invitation to become pastor of a
                    small flock at Namptwitch, in Cheshire, which he accepted. Here he opened a day
                    school, in the management of which he displayed that turn for research, and that
                    spirit of improvement, which were afterwards destined to form such prominent
                    features in his character. His reputation as a man of extraordinary talents and
                    diligent inquiry, soon spread amongst his professional brethren; and when Dr.
                    Aitken was chosen to succeed the reverend Dr. Taylor as professor of divinity at
                    λVarring-ton, the vacant department of belles lettres was assigned to Mr.
                    Priestley.</p>
                <p part="N">His literary career may probably be said to have commenced at
                    Warrington; and the extent, as well as the originality of his pursuits, were
                    soon announced to the world by a variety of valuable publications. Much of his
                    attention about this period was taken up with general politics, on which he
                    delivered a number of lectures. Although it was reasonable to think that his
                    time would be sufficiently occupied by his academical and literary employments,
                    yet his unwearied activity and industry found means to accomplish the first
                    great work in philosophy which laid a foundation for his future fame,</p>
                <p part="N">Havinglongamused himselfwith an electrical machine, and felt himself
                    interested in the progress of discovery in that branch of physics, he undertook
                    a history of electricity, with an account of its present state. This work made
                    its first appearance at Warrington in the year 1767, and was so well received by
                    the learned world, that it went through a fifth edition in quarto, in the year
                    1794. It is justly deemed a valuable performance, and its original experiments
                    are allowed to be very ingenious.</p>
                <p part="N">About the year 1768, he was chosen as pastor of a large and respectable
                    congregation of Protestant dissenters at Leeds, which led him to give a very
                    large share of his attention to theological subjects. His mind is said to have
                    been from childhood strongly impressed with sentiments of piety and devotion;
                    and although he changed most of those religions sentiments in which he had been
                    instructed, for such as he regarded more rational and consistent with truth, his
                    piety and devotion never deserted him. He was at the head of the moderate
                    Unitarians, whose leading tenet is the proper humanity of Christ; confining
                    every species of religious worship and adoration to the one Supreme Being. Some,
                    we believe, have charged him with a design to subvert the Christian religion;
                    but, since zeal for Christianity, as a divine dispensation, and the most
                    valuable of all gifts bestowed upon the human race, was his ruling passion, such
                    an imputation cannot, in fairness, be admitted.</p>
                <p part="N">His <hi rend="italic">History and Present State of Discoveries relating
                        to Vision, Light, and Colours,</hi> appeared in 1772, in two volumes quarto.
                    This is allow ed to be a performance of great merit and lucid arrangement; but
                    it did not bring him such a large share of popularity as his <hi rend="italic"
                        >History of Electricity,</hi> because it is probable that he was scarcely
                    qualified to explain the more abstruse parts of the science. In the year <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193539291?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9291-0532"
                    />1770, he quitted the town of Leeds for a situation entirely different f rom
                    that which he had held there. His philosophical writings and the rccommendation
                    of Dr. Price had made him favourably known to the Earl of Shelburne, who held
                    out to him such advantageous proposals for residing with him, that a regard for
                    his family did not permit him to reject them. The domestic tuition of Lord
                    Shelburne’s sons having been previously committed to a man of merit, they
                    received no instructions from Dr. Priestley further than some courses of
                    experimental philosophy. He also attended his Lordship in a visit to Paris,
                    where he had an opportunity of seeing some of the most celebrated men of science
                    in that country, whom he astonished by asserting a firm belief in revealed
                    religion, which had been presented to their minds in such colours, that they
                    thought no man of sense could hesitate in rejecting it as an idle fable.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1775, he published his <hi rend="italic">Examination</hi> of
                    Dr. Reid on the Human Mind; Dr. Beattie on the Nature and Immutability of Truth;
                    and Dr. Oswald’s Appeal to Common Sense. The design of this volume was to refute
                    the doctrine of Common Sense, said to be employed as the test of truth by the
                    metaphysicians of Scotland. He never intentionally misrepresented cither the
                    arguments or the purposes of an opponent; but he measured the respect with which
                    he treated him by that which he conceived for him in his own mind. In the year
                    1777, he published his disquisitions relating to <hi rend="italic">Matter and
                        Spirit,</hi> in which he gave a history of the philosophical doctrine
                    respecting the soul, and openly supported the material system, which makes it
                    homogeneous with the body. This subjected him to more odium than any of his
                    other productions. As he materialized spirit so he in some measure spiritualized
                    matter, by assigning to it penetrability and several other subtle qualities.
                    About the same period he became the champion of philosophical necessity; a
                    doctrine not less obnoxious to many than the former, on account of its supposed,
                    or rather inevitable, effects on morality. So astonishing was the versatility of
                    his mind, that he at the same time carried on that course of discovery
                    concerning aeriform bodies, which has rendered his name so illustrious amongst
                    philosophical chemists. A second volume was published in 1775, and a third in
                    1777. Some of his most memorable discoveries were those of nitrous and
                    dephlogisticated or pure air; of the restoration of vitiated air by vegetation;
                    of the influence of light on vegetables; and of the effects of respiration on
                    the blood.</p>
                <p part="N">The name of Priestley was by these means spread throughout all the
                    countries of Europe, and honours were heaped upon him by scientific bodies in
                    various parts. The term of“his engagement with Lord Shelburne having expired,
                    Dr. Priestley found himself at liberty to choose a new situation, and retired
                    with a pension for life of L.150 a-year. He chose the vicinity of the populous
                    town of Birmingham, which was then the residence of several men of science, such
                    as Watt, Withering, Bolton, and Keir, whose names are well known to the public.
                    Here he was invited to become pastor of a dissenting congregation, an offer
                    which he accepted about the latter end of the year 1780. Soon after this
                    appeared his Letters to Bishop Newcome, <hi rend="italic">On the Duration of
                        Christ's Ministry,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">History of the Corruptions
                        of Christianity,</hi> works which were afterwards followed by his <hi
                        rend="italic">History of Early Opinions.</hi> He displayed his attachment to
                    freedom by his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the First Principles of
                        Government,</hi> and by an anonymous pamphlet on the <hi rend="italic">State
                        of Public Liberty</hi> in this country; and he evinced a warm interest in
                    the cause of America at the time of its unfortunate quarrel with the mother
                    country.</p>
                <p part="N">On the l4th of July, 1791, the celebration of the anniversary of the
                    destruction of the Bastille, by a publicdinner, at which Dr. Priestley was not
                    present, gave the signal for those riots which have brought lasting disgrace on
                    the town of Birmingham, and in some degree upon the national cha racter. Amidst
                    the conflagration of places of worship and of private dwellings, Dr. Priestley
                    was the great object of popular rage; his house, library, manuscripts, and
                    apparatus, were given as a prey to the flames; he was hunted like a criminal,
                    and experienced not only the furious outrages of a mob, but the most unhandsome
                    treatment from some who ought to have supported the character of gentlemen and
                    friends of good order. He now lay under a load of public odium and suspicion,
                    and, besides, he was constantly harassed by the petty malignity of bigotry. It
                    was not to be wondered at, therefore, that he looked for an asylum in a country
                    to which he had always shewn a friendly attachment, and which, he supposed, was
                    in full possession of all the blessings of civil and religious liberty. In the
                    year 1794, he took leave of his native country, and embarked for North America.
                    He took up his residence in Northumberland, a town in the interior of the state
                    of Pennsylvania, which he selected on account of the purchase of landed property
                    in its neighbourhood; otherwise its remoteness from the sea-ports, its want of
                    many of the comforts of life, and of all the helps to scientific pursuit,
                    rendered it a peculiarly undesirable abode for one of Dr. Priestley’s habits and
                    employments. The loss of his amiable wife, and of a most promising son, as well
                    as repeated attacks of disease, severely tried the fortitude and resignation of
                    this ill-fated philosopher.</p>
                <p part="N">In America he was received with general respect, and the angry contests
                    of party were not able wholly to deprive him of the esteem due to his character.
                    He was heard as a preacher by some of the most distinguished members of
                    Congress; and he was offered, but declined, the place of chemical professor of
                    Philadelphia. It became his great object to enable himself, in his retirement at
                    Northumberland, to renew that course of philosophical experiment, and especially
                    that train of theological writing, which had occupied so many of the best years
                    of his life. By numerous experiments on the constitution of airs, he became more
                    and more fixed in his belief of the phlogistic theory, andin his opposition to
                    the new French chemical system, of which he lived to be the only opponent of any
                    celebrity. By the liberal contributions of his friends in England, he was
                    enabled to commence the printing of two extensive works, upon which he was
                    zealously bent, a <hi rend="italic">Church History,</hi> and an <hi
                        rend="italic">Exposition of the Scriptures</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    during the progress of his final decline, he unremittingly urged their
                    completion.</p>
                <p part="N">Since an illness which seized him at Philadelphia, in the year 1801, he
                    never recovered his formerstate of health. His complaint was constant
                    indigestion, and a difficulty of swallowing food of any kind. But during this
                    period of general debility, he was busily employed in printing his <hi
                        rend="italic">Church History,</hi> in writing the first volume of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Notes on the Scriptures,</hi> and in making new and original
                    experiments. During this period, likewise, he composed his pamphlet <hi
                        rend="italic">oï Jesus and Socrates Compared,</hi> and reprinted his <hi
                        rend="italic">Essay on Phlogiston.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">From about the beginning of November 1803, till the middle of January
                    1804, his complaint grew more'Serious; yet, by judicious medical treatment and
                    strict atterltion to diet, he, after a time, seemed to be, if not regaining
                    strength, at least not getting worse; and his friends fondly hoped that his
                    health would continue to improve as the season advanced. He, however, considered
                    his life as very precarious. Even at this time, besides his miscellaneous
                    reading, which was at all times very extensive, he read through all the works
                    which are quoted in his <hi rend="italic">Comparison of the different Systems of
                        Grecian Philosophers with Christianity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> composed
                    that work; and transcribed the whole of it in less than three months, thus
                    leaving it ready for the press.</p>
                <p part="N">In the last fortnight of January, his fits of indigestion became more
                    alarming than ever, his legs swelled, and his weakness increased. Within two
                    days of his death he became so weak, that he could walk but a little way, and
                    that with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539304?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0718-9304-0533"/> great difficulty. He was fully sensible that
                    he had not long to live, yet he talked with cheerfulness to all who called for
                    him. He dwelt upon the peculiarly happy situation in which it had pleased the
                    Divine Being to place him in life; the great advantage he had enjoyed in the
                    acquaintance and friendship of some of the best and wisest men of the age in
                    which he lived; and the satisfaction he derived from having led an useful as
                    well as a happy life. On the 9th of February 1804, he breathed his last, so
                    easily, that those who were sitting close to him did not immediately perceive
                    his exit. He had put his hand to his face, which prevented them from observing
                    the last moment of his being.</p>
                <p part="N">In the constitution of Dr. Priestley’s mind, great ardour and vivacity
                    of intellect were united with a mild and placid temper. With a zeal for the
                    propagation of' truth which nothing could subdue, he joined a calm patience, and
                    an unruffled serenity of temper, which rendered him proof against
                    disappointments. The rights of private judgment were rendered sacred to him by
                    every principle of his understanding, and his heart would not have suffered him
                    to injure his bitterest enemy. He was naturally disposed to be cheerful, and
                    when his mind was not occupied with serious thoughts, he could unbend, with
                    playful ease and negligence, in the private circle of friends; but in large and
                    mixed companies, he commonly spoke little. In the domestic relations of life he
                    was uniformly kind and affectionate; his parental feelings were those of the
                    tenderest and best of fathers; and not even malice itself could ever fix a stain
                    upon his private conduct, or impeach his integrity.</p>
