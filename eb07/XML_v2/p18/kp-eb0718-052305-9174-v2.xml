                <p part="N"><label type="entry">PRESBYTERIANS</label>, Protestants, so called from
                    their maintaining that the government of the church appointed in the New
                    Testament was by presbyteries, that is, by associations of presbyters or elders,
                    all possessed of equal powers, without any superiority among them either in
                    office or in order.</p>
                <p part="N">The presbyterians believe, that the authority of their ministers to
                    preach the gospel, to administer the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s
                    supper, and to feed the flock of Christ, is in no respect inferior to the
                    authority possessed by the ministers of any other church. They oppose the
                    independent scheme of the common rights of Christians by the same arguments
                    which are used for that purpose by the episcopalians, (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Episcocacy).</hi> They affirm, however, that in the church, as established
                    by Christ and his apostles, there is no order superior to that of presbyters;
                    that all ministers are equal by their commission; that <hi rend="italic"
                        >presbyter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bishop,</hi> though different words,
                    are of the same import; and that prelacy or diocesan episcopacy was gradually

                        >moderator</hi> or president of the presbytery a permanent offieer.</p>
                <p part="N">These positions they maintain against the episcopalians by the following
                    scriptural arguments. They observe, that the apostles planted churches by
                    ordaining bishops and deacons in every city; that the ministers which in one
                    verse are called bishops, are in the next perhaps denominated presbyters; that
                    we nowhere read in the New Testament of bishops, presbyters, and deacons, in any
                    one church; and that therefore we are under the necessity of concluding <hi
                        rend="italic">bishop</hi> and <hi rend="italic">presbyter</hi> to be two
                    names for the same church officer. This is apparent from Peter’s exhortation to
                    the <hi rend="italic">elders</hi><hi rend="italic">ον</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >presbyters</hi> who were among the Jewish Christians. “The <hi

                            >Peter v. 1, 2, 3.</p></note> From this passage it is evident, that the
                    presbyters not only fed the flock of Christ, but also governed that flock with
                    episcopal powers; and that the apostle himself, as an officer of the church, was
                    nothing more than a presbyter or elder. The identity of the office of bishop and
                    presbyter is still more apparent from Heb. xiii. 7. 17. and 1 Thess. v. Γ2; for
                    the bishops are there represented as governing the flock, speaking to them the
                    word of God, watching for their souls, and discharging various offices, which it
                    is impossible for any man to perform to more than one congregation.</p>
                <p part="N">From the last cited text it is evident, that the bishops <hi
                        rend="italic">(προϊστάμενους)</hi> of the Thessalonian churches had the
                    pastoral care of no more souls than they could hold personal communion with in
                    God’s worship; for they were such as all the people were to <hi rend="italic"
                        >know, esteem,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">love,</hi> as those that not only
                    were <hi rend="italic">over them,</hi> but also “closely laboured among them,
                    and admonished them.” But diocesan bishops, whom ordinarily the hundredth part
                    of their flock never hear nor see, cannot be those bishops by whom that flock is
                    admonished, nor can they be, wiιat Peter requires the bishops of the Jewish
                    converts to bc, <hi rend="italic">ensamples to the flock.</hi> It is the opinion
                    of Dr. Hammond, who was a learned divine, and a zealot for episcopacy, that the
                        <hi rend="italic">elders</hi> whom the apostle Janies desires<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Chap. v.
                        14.</p></note> the sick to call for, were of the highest permanent order of
                    ecclesiastical officers; but it is self-evident that those elders cannot have
                    been diocesan bishops, otherwise the sick must have been often beyond the reach
                    of the remedy proposed to them.</p>
                <p part="N">There is no passage of Scripture on which the episcopalian is more ready
                    to rest his cause, than the alleged episcopacy of Timothy and Titus; of whom the
                    former is said to have been bishop of Ephesus, and the latter bishop of Crete;
                    yet the presbyterian thinks it as clear as the noonday sun, that the presbyters
                    of Ephesus were supreme governors under Christ of the Ephesian churches, at the
                    very time that Timothy is pretended to have been their proper diocesan.</p>
                <p part="N">In Acts XX. 17, scq. we read, that “from Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus,
                    and called the elders (presbyters) of the church. And when they were come to
                    him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after
                    what manner I have been with you, at all seasons. And now I know that ye all,
                    among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
                    Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all
                    men. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. Take
                    heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost
                    hath made you overseers, (6⅛ισκ0τroυs∙, <hi rend="italic">bishops'),</hi> to
                    feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know
                    this, that after my departure shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not
                    sparing the flock. Also of your ownselves shall men arise, speaking perverse
                    things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch, and remember, that
                    by the space of three years, I ceased not to warn every one night and day with
                    tears. And now, brethren, I recommend you to God, and to the word of his grace,”
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">From this passage, it is evident that there was in the city of Ephesus a
                    plurality of pastors of equal authority, without any superior pastor or bishop
                    over them; for the apostle directs his discourse to them all in common, and
                    gives them equal power over the whole flock. Dr. Hammond indeed imagines, that
                    the elders whom Paul called to Miletus were the <hi rend="italic">bishops of
                        Asia,</hi> and that he sent for them to Ephesus, because that city was the
                    metropolis of the province. But were this opinion well-founded, it is not
                    conceivable that the sacred writer would have called them the elders of the
                    church of <hi rend="italic">Ephesus,</hi> but the elders of the <hi
                        rend="italic">church in general,</hi> or the elders of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >churches in Asia.</hi> Besides, it is to be remembered, that the apostle
                    was in such haste to visit Jerusalem, that the sacred historian measures his
                    time by <hi rend="italic">days;</hi> whereas it must have required several
                    months to call together the bishops or elders of all the cities of Asia; and he
                    might certainly have gone to meet them at Ephesus in less time than would be
                    requisite for their meeting in that city and proceeding thence to him at
                    Miletus. They must therefore have been either the joint pastors of one
                    congregation, or the pastors of different congregations in one city; and as it
                    was thus in Ephesus, so was it in Philippi; for we find the apostle addressing
                    b.is epistle “to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the
                    bishops and deacons.” From the passage betöre us it is likewise plain, that the
                    presbyters of Ephesus had not only the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> but the whole
                        <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of bishops given to them by the Holy Ghost; for
                    they are enjoined to do the whole work of bishops, <hi rend="italic">ποιμαίνεις
                        την εκκλησίαν του</hi><hi rend="italic">Qεου,</hi> which signifies, tθ <hi
                        rend="italic">rule</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">feed</hi> the church of
                    God. Hence it is evident, that the apostle makes the power of <hi rend="italic"
                        >governing</hi> inseparable from that of <hi rend="italic">preaching</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">watching;</hi> and that according to him, all who are
                    preachers of God’s word, and watchmen of souls, are necessarily rulers or
                    governors of the church, without being accountable for their management to any
                    prelate, but only to their Lord Christ, from whom their power is derived.</p>
                <p part="N">It appears therefore that the apostle Paul left: in the church of
                    Ephesus, which he had planted, no other successors to himself than <hi
                        rend="italic">presbyter-bishops,</hi> or prcsbyterian ministers, and that he
                    did not devolve bis power upon any prelate. Timothy, whom the episcopalians
                    allege to have been the first bishop of Ephesus, was present when this
                    settlement was made;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">Acts xx. <hi rend="italic">5.</hi></p></note> and it is surely
                    not to be supposed, that, had he been their bishop, the apostle would have
                    devolved the whole episcopal power upon the presbyters before his face. If ever
                    there was a season fitter than another for pointing out the duty of this
                    supposed bishop to his diocese, and the duty of his presbyters to him, it was
                    surely when Paul was taking his final leave of them, and discoursing so
                    pathetically concerning the duty of <hi rend="italic">overseers,</hi> the coming
                    of ravenous wolves, and the consequent hazard of the flock. In this farewell
                    discourse, he tells them that “he had not shunned to declare unto them all the
                    counsel of God.” But with what truth could this have been said, if obedience to
                    a diocesan bishop had been any part of their duty either at the time of the
                    apostle’s speaking or at any future period? He foresaw that ravenous wolves
                    would enter in among them, and that even some of themselves should arise
                    speaking perverse things; and if, as the Episcopalians allege, diocesan
                    episcopacy was the remedy provided for those evils, is it not strange, passing
                    strange, that the inspired preacher did not foresee that Timothy, who was
                    standing beside him, was destined to fill that important office; or if he did
                    foresee it, that he omitted to recommend him to his future charge, and to give
                    him proper instructions for the discharge of his duty?</p>
                <p part="N">But if Timothy was not bishop of Ephesus, what, it may be asked, was his
                    office in that city? For that he resided there for some time, and was by the
                    apostle invested with authority to ordain and rebuke presbyters, are facts about
                    which all parties are agreed, and which indeed cannot be controverted by any
                    reader of Paul’s epistles. To this the presbyterian replies with confidence,
                    that the power which Timothy exercised in the church of Ephesus was that of an
                        evangelist,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >Tim. iv. 5.</p></note> and not a prelate. But, according to Eusebius,
                    the work of an evangelist was, “to lay the foundations of the faith in barbarous
                    nations, and to constitute among them <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193539200?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9200-0525"/>pastors;
                    after which he passed on to other countries.” Accordingly we find, that Timothy
                    was resident for a time at Philippi and Corinth,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Phil. ii. 19. 1 Cor. iv. 17;
                            xvi. 10, 11.</p></note> as well as at Ephesus, and that he had as much
                    authority over those churches as over that of which he is said to have been the
                    fixed bishop. “Now, if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear,
                    for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. Let no man therefore despise
                    him.” This text might lead us to suppose, that Timothy was bishop of Corinth as
                    well as of Ephesus; for it affords a more plausible ground than that on which
                    his episcopacy of the latter church is chiefly built. The apostle says, “I
                    besought thee<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >Tim. i. 3.</p></note> to abide still at Ephesus when I went into
                    Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teaeh no other doctrine.”
                    But had Timothy been the permanent bishop of that city, there would surely have
                    been no necessity for <hi rend="italic">beseeching</hi> him to abide with his
                    flock. It is likewise to be observed, that the first epistle to Timothy, which
                    alone was written to him during his residence at Ephesus, was of a date prior to
                    Paul’s meeting with the elders of that church at Miletus; for in the epistle he
                    hopes to come to him shortly, whereas he tells the elders at Miletus, that they
                    should see his face no more. This being the case, it is evident that Timothy was
                    left by the apostle at Ephesus only to supply his place during his temporary
                    absence at Macedonia, and that he could not possibly have been constituted
                    permanent bishop of that church, since the episcopal powers were afterwards
                    committed to the presbyters by the Holy Ghost in his presence.</p>
                <p part="N">The identity of the office of bishop and presbyter being thus clearly
                    established, it follows, that the presbyterate is the highest permanent office
                    in the church, and that every faithful pastor of a flock is successor to the
                    apostles in every thing in which they were to have any successors. In the
                    apostolic office there were indeed some things peculiar and extraordinary, such
                    as their immediate call by Christ, their infallibility, their being witnesses of
                    our Lord’s resurrection, and their unlimited jurisdiction over the whole world.
                    These powers and privileges could not be conveyed by imposition of hands to any
                    successors, whether called presbyters or bishops; but as rulers or
                    office-bearers in particular churches, we have the confession of “the very
                    chiefest apostles,” Peter and John, that they were nothing more than presbyters
                    or labouring pastors. This being the case, the dispute, which has been so warmly
                    agitated, concerning the validity of presbyterian ordination, may be soon
                    decided; for if the ceremony of ordination be at all essential, it is obvious
                    that such a ceremony performed by presbyters must be valid, as there is no
                    higher order of ecclesiastics in the church by w hom it can be performed.
                    Accordingly, we find, that Timothy himself, though said to be a bishop, was
                    ordained by the laying on of the hands of a presbytery. At that ordination
                    indeed St. Paul presided, but he could preside only as <hi rend="italic">primus
                        in paribus;</hi> for we have seen that, as permanent officers in the church
                    of Christ, the apostles themselves were no more than presbyters. If the
                    apostles’ hands were imposed for any other purpose, it must have been to
                    communicate those <hi rend="italic">charismata</hi> or miraculous gifts of the
                    Holy Spirit, which were then so frequent, but which no modern presbyter or
                    bishop will pretend to give, unless his understanding be clouded by the grossest
                    ignorance, or perverted by the most frantic enthusiasm.</p>
                <p part="N">But if the office of bishop and presbyter was originally the same, how,
                    it will be asked, came diocesan episcopacy to prevail so universally, as it is
                    confessed to have done, before the conversion of Constantine, and the civil
                    establishment of Christianity in the Roman empire? To give a satisfactory answer
                    to this question is certainly the most arduous task which the advocate for
                    presbytery has to perform; but the difficulties attending this task are not
                    insurmount-table.</p>
                <p part="N">From many passages in the New Testament,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Acts xi. 29; xiii, 1, 2, 3; xv.
                            Tit. i. v.</p></note> it is evident, that when the apostles planted
                    churches in different cities, they generally settled more than one pastor in the
                    same church, to feed and govern it with joint authority. The propriety of this
                    constitution is obvious. In those days, when the disciples of Christ were
                    persecuted for their religion, and often obliged to meet in the “night for fear
                    of the Jews,” they could not with any degree of prudence assemble in large
                    numbers; and therefore, had there been no more than one pastor in a city, the
                    Christian converts, though, when assembled, they might have amounted to but a
                    small congregation, could not all have enjoyed the benefit of public worship on
                    the same day; at least it is obvious that they could not possibly have assembled
                    for this purpose so often as their want of instruction, and the duty of
                    “breaking of bread and of prayer,” required them to meet. It was therefore with
                    great wisdom that the apostles ordained several presbyters in the same church;
                    but as these presbyters would have occasion to meet frequently, and to
                    deliberate on the state of the flock which it was their duty to feed, and over
                    which they had all equal authority, they would be under the necessity of
                    electing one of their own number to be president or <hi rend="italic"
                        >moderator</hi> of the presbytery, that order might be preserved, and all
                    things done with decency. At first there is reason to believe that those
                    presidents held their office no longer than while the presbyteries sat in which
                    they were elected. Among the apostles themselves there was no fixed president.
                    Peter indeed appears to have been most frequently admitted to that honour; but
                    there is one very memorable occasion on record, when James, the Lord’s brother,
                    presided in an assembly of apostles, elders, and brethren, held at Jerusalem, to
                    determine the question concerning the necessity of circumcising the Gentiles,
                    and commanding them to keep the law of Moses. <supplied cert="medium"

                <p part="N">Upon this model were the primitive presbyteries formed. They consisted
                    of several presbyters possessed of equal powers, who at their meetings appointed
                    one of their own number to discharge the office of moderator or temporary
                    president; but to this president they gave no prelatical powers or negative
                    voice over the deliberations of his brethren; for, as Jerom informs us, the
                    church was then governed <hi rend="italic">communi presbyterorum concilio,</hi>
                    “by a common council of presbyters.” It appears however that when an apostle, an
                    apostolical man, or an evangelist, fixed his residence in any city, and took
                    upon himself the pastoral care of part of the flock, his co-presbyters, from
                    respect to his singular gifts, made him their constant and fixed moderator.
                    Hence Timothy, during his abode at Ephesus, was moderator of the presbytery; and
                    hence, too, Mark the evangelist, who resided many years in Alexandria, has been
                    called the first bishop of that church, though he appears to have been nothing
                    more than permanent moderator. We advance this upon the authority of Jerom, one
                    of the most learned fathers of the Christian church, who informs us, that upon
                    the death of the evangelist, the presbyters of Alexandria, for more than two
                    hundred years, chose their bishops from their own number, and placed them in the
                    episcopal chair, without dreaming that they ought to be raised to a higher order
                    by a new consecration; “presbyteri unum ex se electum in excelsiori gradu
                    collocatum, episcopum nominabant.” As this practice of making the moderator of
                    the presbytery of Alexandria a permanent officer, was thought a good expedient
                    to guard the infant churches against schisms and divisions, those churches
                    gradually adopted it. For, as Jerom tells us, “postquam <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193539213?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9213-0526"/>unusquisque
                    eos quos baptisaverat, suos putabat esse, non Christi, in toto orbe decretum
                    est, ut unus de presbyteris electus, superponeretur caeteris, ad quem omnis
                    ecclesiae cura pertineret, et schismatum semina tollerentur.”</p>
                <p part="N">The advantages which, in displaying his talents and authority, the
                    perpetual president or speaker of any assembly has over his colleagues in
                    office, are so obvious, that when the practice of electing their moderators for
                    life became universal among the presbyteries of the primitive church, it is easy
                    to conceive how ambitious men might so magnify the difficulties and importance
                    of their station, as to introduce the custom of filling it by a new consecration
                    of the bishop elect. But when this was done, diocesan episcopacy, with all its
                    powers and prerogatives, would follow as a matter of course, until “by little
                    and little,” as Jerom expresses himself, “the whole pastoral care of the flock
                    was devolved upon one man.”</p>
                <p part="N">Our limits will not permit us to trace more minutely the rise and
                    progress of this ecclesiastical usurpation, as the Presbyterian calls it; but
                    the reader who wishes for fuller information, after studying the remains of the
                    four first centuries of the Christian church, may consult, “An Inquiry into the
                    Constitution, Discipline, and Worship, of the Primitive Church,” written by Lord
                    King, chancellor of England. As an impartial lover of truth, he will do well to
                    consult also a book entitled, “An original Draught of the Primitive Church,”
                    which was published as an answer to the Inquiry; and he may read with much
                    advantage to himself, “A Letter from a Parochial Bishop to a Prelatical
                    Gentleman,” with “An Apology for the Church of Scotland,” both written by Mr.
                    Willison of Dundee, and both evincing considerable learning, and great
                    ingenuity, • in their pious author. But during our own agc, the ρres-byterian
                    cause has been most ably maintained by Dr. ‘ Campbell, in his “Lectures on

                <p part="N">Of the churches at present formed upon this model, we believe, that
                    without incurring the imputation of national prejudice, we may safely affirm the
                    church of Scotland to be the most efficient. Her mode of worship is simple and
                    solemn; her established faith agreeable to the confessions of most of the other
                    Protestant churches; her judicatories are calculated to maintain the rights of
                    the people; and her pastors are eminently distinguishedby their fidelity and
                    zeal. In this respect, a gradual and very perceptible change has taken place in
                    the course of the passing century. We cannot more properly conclude this article
                    than with a short view of her constitution, as being that in which our
                    Presbyterian readers are undoubtedly most interested.</p>
                <p part="N">No one is ignorant, that from the first dawn of reformation among us,
                    till the era of the revolution, there was a perpetual struggle between the court
                    and the people for the establishment of an Episcopal or a Presbyterian form of
                    church government. The former model of ecclesiastical polity was patronised by
                    the house of Stewart on account of the support which it gave to the prerogatives
                    of the crown; the latter was the favourite of the majority of the people,
                    perhaps not so much on account of its superior claim to apostolical institution,
                    as because the laitv are mixed with the clergy in ecclesiastical judicatories,
                    and the two orders, which under episcopacy are kept so distinct, incorporated
                    into one body. In the Scottish church, everv regulation of public worship, every
                    act of discipline, anil every ecclesiastical censure, which in other churches
                    flows from the authority of a diocesan bishop, or from a convocation of the
                    clergy, is the joint work of a certain number of clergymen and laymen acting
                    together with equal authority, and deciding every question by a majority of
                    votes. The laymen who thus form an essential part of the ecclesiastical courts
                    of Scotland, are called <hi rend="italic">ruling elders</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> and hold the same office, as well as the same name, with those
                        brethren<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                                ><hi rend="superscript"> 2Actsxv</hi> · ’ ’ ’</p></note> who joined
                    with the apostles and elders at Jerusalem in determining the important question
                    concerning the necessity of imposing upon the Gentile converts the ritual
                    observances of the law of Moses. These lay-elders Paul enjoined Timothy<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Tim. V.
                        17.</p></note> to account worthy of double honour, if they should rule well,
                    and discharge the duties for which they were separated from the multitude of
                    their brethren. In the church of Scotland every parish has several of those
                    lay-elders, who are, or ought to be, grave and serious persons, chosen from
                    among the beads of families, of known orthodoxy, and steady adherence to the
                    worship, discipline, and government of the church. Being solemnly engaged to use
                    their utmost endeavours for the suppression of vice and the cherishing of piety
                    and virtue, and to exercise discipline faithfully and diligently, the minister,
                    in the presence of the congregation, sets them apart to their office by solemn
                    prayer; and concludes the ceremony, which is sometimes called ordination, with
                    exhorting both elders and people to their respective duties.</p>
                <p part="N">The kirk-session, which is the lowest ecclesiastical judicatory,
                    consists of the minister and those elders of the congregation. The minister is
                        <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> moderator, but has no negative voice over
                    the decision of the session; nor indeed has he a right to vote at all, unless
                    when the voices of the elders are equal and opposite. He may indeed enter his
                    protest against their sentence, if he think it improper, and appeal to the
                    decision of the presbytery; but this privilege belongs equally to every elder,
                    as well as to every person who may believe himself aggrieved by the ] roceedings
                    of the session. The deacons, whose proper office is to take care of the poor,
                    may be present in every session, and offer their counsel on all questions that
                    come before it; but except in what relates to the distribution of alms, they
                    have no decisive vote with the minister and elders.</p>
                <p part="N">The next judicatory is <hi rend="italic">the presbytery,</hi> which
                    consists of all the pastors within a certain district, and one ruling elder from
                    each parish, commissioned by his brethren to represent, in conjunction with the
                    minister, the session of that parish. The presbytery treats of such matters as
                    concern the particular churches within its limits; as the examination,
                    admission, ordination, and censuring of ministers; the licensing of
                    probationers, rebuking of gross or contumacious sinners, the directing of the
                    sentence of excommunication, the deciding upon references and appeals from
                    kirk-sessions, resolving cases of conscience, explaining difficulties in
                    doctrine or discipline; and censuring, according to the word of God, any heresy
                    or erroneous doctrine which hath either been publicly or privately maintained
                    within the limits of its jurisdiction. Partial as we may be thought to our own
                    church, we frankly acknowledge that we cannot altogether approve of that part of
                    her constitution which gives an equal vote, in questions of heresy, to a plain
                    mechanic and his educated pastor. In presbyteries, the only prerogatives which
                    the pastors have over the ruling elders, are the power of ordination, and the
                    privilege of having the moderator chosen from their body.</p>
                <p part="N">From the judgment of the presbytery, an appeal lies to the provincial
                    synod, which commonly meets twice a-year, and which exercises over the
                    presbyteries within the province a jurisdiction similar to that which is vested
                    in each presbytery over its several kirk-sessions. Of these synods <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193539226?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9226-0527"
                    />there are in the church of Scotland fifteen, which are composed of the members
                    of the several presbyteries within the respective provinces which give names to
                    the synods.</p>
                <p part="N">The highest authority in the church is the general assembly, which
                    consists of a certain number of ministers and ruling elders delegated from each
                    presbytery, and of commissioners from the universities and royal burghs. A
                    presbytery in which there are fewer than twelve parishes, sends to the general
                    assembly two ministers and one ruling elder: if it contain between twelve and
                    eighteen ministers, it sends three of these, and one ruling elder: if it
                    contains between eighteen and twenty-four ministers, it sends four ministers and
                    two ruling elders: and of twenty-four ministers, when it contains so many, it
                    sends five with two ruling elders. Every royal burgh sends one ruling cider, and
                    Edinburgh two. Their election must be attested by the kirk-sessions of the
                    respective burghs. Every university sends one commissioner from its own body.
                    The commissioners are annually chosen, six weeks before the meeting of the
                    assembly: and the ruling elders are often men of the first eminence in the
                    kingdom for rank and talents. In this assembly, which meets once a-year, the
                    king presides by his commissioner, who is always a nobleman; but he has no voice
                    in their deliberations. The order of their proceedings is regular, though
                    sometimes the number of members creates <hi rend="italic">a</hi> confusion,
                    which the moderator, who is chosen from among the ministers, to be the chairman
                    or speaker of the house, has not sufficient authority to prevent. To the general
                    assembly appeals are brought from all the other ecclesiastical courts of
                    Scotland; and in questions purely religious, no appeal lies from its
                    determinations. In the subordination of these assemblies, parochial,
                    presbyterial, provincial, and national, consists the external order, strength,
                    and stedfastness, of the church of Scotland.</p>
