                    department in the south of France, formed out of the ancient province Lower
                    Auvergne. It extends in north latitude from 45. 26. to 46.11. and in east
                    longitude from 2. 17. to 3. 54. In extent it is 3389 square miles, and is
                    divided into five arrondissements, and these into fifty cantons and 438
                    communes, containing by the last census 573,100 persons. It is bounded on the
                    north by the department of Allier, on the east by that of the Loire, on the
                    south by the Upper Loire and the Cantal, and on the west by the Corrèze and by
                    the Creuse. It is an elevated district, covered with hills and mountains, with
                    few or no plains, but some beautiful valleys, not very wide, through which the
                    streams flow. One of the most picturesque of these vales is that of Limagne,
                    which extends along both banks of the Allier, from the entrance of that river
                    into the department, to its passage out of it. It is remarkable for its
                    fertility. The roads are planted with large walnut and elm trees, the sides of
                    the hills arê covered with vines, and on the tops are ornamented with towns,
                    villages, and castles. Some of the mountains in the northern part, the highest
                    of which reach to about 4000 feet, have marks of volcanic origin, and are
                    composed of basalt or of lava. In the south the elevations are greater, and that
                    called the Mont d’Or is about 6300 feet. The chief river is the Allier, which
                    comes out of the department of the Upper Loire, is navigable in its course
                    through Puy de Dôme, and receives the waters of various streams. There are
                    several lakes in some of the districts, but none of them of any great extent.
                    The climate is raw and variable on the mountains, but in the valleys it is mild,
                    intensely hot in summer, and severely cold in winter; and occasionally most
                    violent storms, accompanied with hail, are experienced in the most fertile of
                    the valleys. The chief products, besides corn, of which there is a surplus for
                    the supply of the neighbouring departments, are hemp, flax, wax, honey, fruit,
                    especially cherries, walnuts, and wine. The last is abundant, but in general not
                    highly estimated. The best is in the valley of Limagne; but even there the
                    greater part of the produce of the vines is distilled into brandy. The nuts arc
                    so abundant that a great quantity of oil is made from them; and as fuel is
                    scarce, many of the walnut trees are made use of for that purpose. There are
                    mines both of iron and of coal, but they are not extensively worked. The
                    manufactures are linen cloths, blond lace, silk stockings, some cotton, and thin
                    woollens, ribbons, jewellery, leather, and paper. The population is so much
                    beyond the means of employment, that a great number of labourers yearly go to
                    the neighbouring department to procure work in summer, and return in winter with
                    the wages which they have earned. The department elects four deputies to the
                    legislature. It is in the diocese of Clermont, and under the judicial power of
                    the courts of law at Riom.</p>
