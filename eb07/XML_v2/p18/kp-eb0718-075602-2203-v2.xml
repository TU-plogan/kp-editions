                    most deplorable arts ever invented, that is, the art of war. The miserable
                    necessity of this art is, however, a matter of daily experience in the present
                    state of human nature ànd unsocial relations; also the unhappy and slavish
                    condition of all nations which are not able, by skill in this diabolical art, to
                    resist effectually the aggressions of their invaders.<note anchored="true"

                <p part="N">We do not mean to give an account of the various substances, mixtures,
                    and manipulations necessary in the construction of different fire-works; but,
                    for the reader’s amusement and instruction, we shall mention a few things which
                    are not generally known, and then conclude with the titles of a few works upon
                    pyroteehny.</p>
                <p part="N">The combinations of the different substances employed in the pyrotechny
                    connected with fire-works ought to be guided by a chemical knowledge of these
                    substances. The want of this knowledge causes most of our fire-workers to
                    compound ineffective mixtures, and to follow old and absurd recipes. Great skill
                    in pyrotechny, in its more general sense, was possessed by the Chinese long
                    before the art was known in Europe. The invention of gunpowder seems to be due
                    to them, and perhaps also the invention of fire-works. All those persons we ever
                    conversed with who had been in China, concurred in assuring us that the Chinese
                    fire-works are at this day quite unrivalled in variety, splendour, and beauty.
                    In the account of Lord Macartney’s Embassy to China there is an amusing passage
                    describing the contempt of the Chinese for the best English fire-works that were
                    exhibited to them, and the astonishment of the embassy on witnessing the superb
                    display of fire-works given by the Chinese in return. The most imposing
                    exhibitions of European fire-works used to be those that took place annually at
                    Rome, during certain holidays, on the ramparts of the Castle of St Angelo.</p>
                <p part="N">We shall now give a very few notices of practical pyrotech ny.</p>

                    vivid flash of lightning, by blowing them from a tube, &amp;e. through the flame
                    of a lamp, &amp;c. These seeds are also used in the composition of some
                    fire-works.</p>

                    strontia is the chief ingredient in the composition. A beautiful purplish flame
                    is produced by a composition containing chlorate of strontia. To aid in
                    reddening the flame of the former composition, a little lamp-black of the finest
                    quality is generally used; for a red jet of fire from a paper-case formed like
                    that of a serpent, or of a Roman candle, &amp;c., fifteen parts of pulverized
                    gunpowder and four parts of dry nitrate of strontia; a slow and bright-red fire,
                    forty parts of nitrate of strontia, thirteen of pulverized sulphur, five of
                    chlorate of potash, and four of sulphuret of antimony. In this last mixture, to
                    avoid the danger of premature combustion, the chlorate of potash must not be
                    ground in a mortar with the other ingredients, but ground separately, and
                    afterwards mixed with them by shaking and stirring upon a sheet of paper.</p>

                    The effect of this composition, when burned on the stage of a theatre, is to
                    give a cadaverous and unearthly aspect to the actors. It occurred to us many
                    years ago, that an extension of some of the effects of De Loutherbourg’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Fidophusikon</hi> might be easily and effectively adapted to
                    the stage. W’here the iòot-lights are, or else above the proscenium or front of
                    the stage, an apparatus might be contrived to throw variously-coloured lights
                    upon the actors and the scenery in the representation of magical incantations,
                    supernatural appearances, &amp;c. The disposition and reflection of these
                    variously-coloured lights might be diversified in such a manner as to produce
                    the most singular contrasts and unexpected effects.</p>

                    and other stars is made into a stiff paste with alcohol, and then cut into small
                    cylindrical or square pieces, which are rolled in pulverized gunpowder, and

                    the jasmine. Its excellence depends ehiefly on the use, in the composition, of
                    bright filings or raspings from the steel-springs of clocks or watches,
                    carefully deprived of all the finer dust that may be amongst them. The minute
                    shavings of steel, procured from turners in metal, may also be used.
                    Compositions for this kind of fire, six parts of steel-filings or shavings,
                    sixteen of pulverized gunpowder, one of saltpetre, one of sulphur; or five parts

                    the same manner. The sulphur, the pounded cast iron, or the steelfilings, are
                    mixed with the addition of a little pure alcohol, and then the other ingredients
                    are added. It must be observed, that the size of the particles of pounded cast
                    iron or of steel-filings should be proportioned to the size of the cases that
                    are to be filled with the composition; the smallest filings, &amp;c. being used

                    any size. They sometimes weigh upwards of 200 pounds.</p>

                <p part="N">It is necessary to warn the reader that fulminating mercury requires
                    great caution in handling it; and, as it is so apt to explode, it had better be
                    left out of the composition for these lights, or any other fire-works. Indeed
                    the pyrotechnist has need to exercise the greatest possible caution in all his
                    operations. For instance, it may, in ignorance, be imagined that no harm can
                    happen from pounding gunpowder in a mortar along with iron or steel-filings,
                    &amp;c. and yet the most serious accidents may result from manipulations of this
                    kind incautiously conducted.</p>
                <p part="N">One of the most formidable pyrotechnical inventions is the Congreve
                    rocket. We have conversed with some officers who served in the war against the
                    Burmese, and they described the effect of these rockets as appaling, not only to
                    the Burmese, but even to the stout-hearted Britons who fired them off.</p>
                <p part="N">Without entering into any very minute description of the process of
                    making such popular fire-works as the common sky-rocket, the Roman candle,
                    &amp;c. we shall content ourselves with a brief account of the general
                    construction of these two. The common sky-rocket consists of a strong paper or
                    thin pasteboard case, the lower end of which, where the cotton quick-match is
                    inserted, is drawn so close by means of a cord as to leave only a circular
                    opening of about one third of the interior diameter of the case. This is
                    technically called <hi rend="italic">choking</hi> the case. The case, when dried
                    after pasting, is placed in a hollow cylinder of wood, into which it fits. This
                    mould is furnished with a moveable bottom having a central nipple and a tapering
                    spike of iron, which last, entering the aperture at the lower end of the case,
                    rises within it nearly to the top. The space left round this spike is filled
                    gradually, and by repeated blows from a mallet upon a hollow rammer, with a
                    composition of pulverized gunpowder, saltpetre, and charcoal, or of sixteen
                    parts of saltpetre, twelve of elm charcoal, and four of purified flour of
                    sulphur. The rammer, which fits the inner diameter of the case, and to which the
                    mallet is applied, has in its centre a deep hollow adapted to the iron spike
                    before mentioned. The composition which forms the charge of the case must be put
                    in by small quantities at a time, and driven down compactly by regulated blows
                    of the mallet upon the rammer. The filling of the case in this manner requires
                    skill and experience, because if the charge is not uniformly compacted in the
                    case, the rocket will not rise evenly and regularly. When the charge has been
                    driven a little higher than the top of the spike, a round piece of doubled
                    paper* is put in; and upon •this one half of the inner paper of the remainder of
                    the case is folded down and rammed firmly, so as to close the case. This plug is
                    then pierced with a few holes, and above it are placed, along with some of the
                    composition, or with some gunpowder, the stars, sparks, &amp;c. that are
                    intended to appear when the rocket has reached its highest ascent. The top of
                    the case is then covered in, and fitted with a paper cone. In signal-rockets,
                    that are intended to end with a report without stars, &amp;c. the round piece of
                    double paper before mentioned is pierced with a hole in the centre, and a little
                    gunpowder is pressed firmly in above it, but without crushing the grains. The
                    top of the case is then choked <hi rend="italic">close,</hi> and the paper cone
                    fitted on. In some other rockets that contain what are called <hi rend="italic"
                        >decorations,</hi> that is, stars, sparks, serpents, crackers, &amp;c.,
                    these are placed with meal-powder in a wider cylindrical case, which is fitted
                    to the top of the case containing the charge. These rockets are also terminated
                    by a conical cap. We may remark, that in our common rockets the conical cap is
                    not sufficiently stiff to maintain its form invariably, and so to aid in the
                    regular ascent of the rocket. The balance-stick has next to be fastened to the
                    rocket. The length, thick-íiess, and weight of this stick, require calculation
                    to suit it to the dimensions and weight of the case. On the Continent, rockets
                    have been made to ascend without sticks by means of a triangle of pasteboard
                    passing round the case, or by means of three pasteboard wings glued to the case.
                    Each of these wings forms an isosceles triangle, in height six interior
                    diameters of the rocket-case, and a little more than two of these diameters at
                    the base. Each of these wings must be glued on quite parallel to the axis of the
                    case, otherwise the flight of the rocket will be irregular. A short stick with
                    similar wings has also been employed for rocket-cases. It is stated that all
                    these winged rockets rose beautifully, even in a violent wind and bad weather;
                    but some allowance must surely be made for the lateral action upon them of a
                    strong wind.</p>
                <p part="N">The Roman candle consists of a strong case of paper or of thin
                    pasteboard, which is completely closed at the lower end. It is generally charged
                    with the same composition as sky-rocket cases, alternating with gunpowder and
                    stars, as follows: First a small quantity of composition is placed at the bottom
                    of the case, and rammed down compactly by a rammer and mallet; next a small
                    quantity of gunpowder, and above that a star without any ramming, but a gentle
                    push to secure the contact of the star with the gunpowder; then a quantity of
                    the composition, which is rammed down as before; next a little more gunpowder
                    and a star, and then more composition rammed down; and so on till the case is
                    filled. The case is then closed by a piece of papermatch pasted round the
                    outside, and twisted to a point at the top. The charges of Roman candles might
                    be diversified by variously-coloured fires and stars, &amp;c.</p>
