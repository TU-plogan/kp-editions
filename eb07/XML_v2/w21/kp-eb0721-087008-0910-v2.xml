                    was born at Manchester on the 27th of April 1735. His father, James Whitaker,
                    does not appear to have been in affluent circumstances. At the age of ten, the
                    son was sent to the free-school, and in 1752 was removed to Oxford upon an
                    exhibition of ten pounds a year. He was entered of Brasen-nose College, but on
                    the 2d of March 1753 was elected scholar of Corpus Christi. He proceeded A.M. in
                    1759, and in the following year was ordained deacon and priest. On the 21st of
                    January 1763 he was elected fellow of his college, and on the 1st of July 1767
                    took the degree of B. D. At Oxford, we are informed, “his uncommon vigour of
                    intellect at once displayed itself among his acquaintance; but whilst his
                    animated conversation drew many around him, a few were repelled from the circle
                    by his impatience of contradiction (a <pb break="no"

                    />failing which almost ever accompanies powers like his), and by the
                    consciousness, it should seem, of their own inferiority.” That his conversation
                    must have displayed sufficient vivacity, and his temper sufficient warmth, may
                    very easily be conceived; but through these lines of panegyric, it is impossible
                    not to discern a strong ray of truth; namely, that from the earliest period of
                    his literary career, he was distinguished by a bold and dogmatical spirit, which
                    could ill endure dissent or opposition. This may indeed be considered as his
                    first and last characteristic; and although the zeal of a friend has, with some
                    degree of dexterity, endeavoured to convert it into a topic of praise, by
                    representing it as the ordinary mark of a superior mind, we are not very much
                    inclined to regard it in the same light. The doctrine seems indeed to be of a
                    somewhat dangerous tendency; to be calculated for misleading young candidates
                    for literary honours, who may thus be induced to supply, by arrogance and
                    dogmatism, what is wanting in sound learning and solid judgment. It may be
                    asserted, without much hazard of confutation, that this overweening and
                    dogmatical spirit is at least as frequently the characteristic of those who
                    possess but a very moderate stock of real merit; who have perhaps made no
                    uncommon progress in any branch of science or literature, and yet consider
                    themselves as entitled to decide all controversies, and to adjust all claims to
                    intellectual distinction.</p>
                <p part="N">For many years he served the curacy of Bray in Berkshire for Dr
                    Berkeley, a son of the famous bishop of Cloyne; and was subsequently curate of
                    Newton in Lancashire. He gave the first conspicuous proof of his abilities by
                    the publication of “The History of Manchester.” Lond. 1771, 4to. The second
                    volume followed in the year 1775; but although four books were originally
                    promised, only two are thus completed; they embrace the Roman, British, and
                    Saxon periods of the history. This work, which is perhaps the most remarkable of
                    his publications, was immediately regarded as the production of no ordinary
                    writer, but as more conspicuous for bold and ingenious speculation, than for
                    cool and judicious discussion. Like the other works of the same author, it is
                    written in a lively and rambling manner. His impatience and vivacity rendered
                    him incapable of selecting his topics, and condensing his thoughts; and by
                    adhering to his usual method of writing, a large book may be produced on almost
                    any subject. Before he had brought this work to a close, he published “The
                    genuine History of the Britons asserted.” Lond. 1772, 8vo. This volume is
                    chiefly directed against the historical work of Mr Macpherson, better known as
                    the foster-father of Ossian; and both publications have been considered by
                    competent judges as adding very little to the real stock of information.</p>
                <p part="N">In the course of the following year we find him residing in the
                    metropolis, and officiating as the morning preacher of Berkeley chapel. For this
                    appointment he was indebted to a Mr Hughes; but their connexion was of a very
                    short duration, for he was removed from his situation in less than two months.
                    He thought proper to communicate his grievances to the public, in “The State of
                    the Case between Mr Whitaker and Mr Hughes, relative to the Morning Preachership
                    of Berkeley Chapel.” Lond. 1774, 4to. His resentment was so strong, and his
                    discretion so weak, that he thus subjected himself to the vexation of a lawsuit,
                    and the Court of Kings Bench held his printed Case to be a libel.</p>
                <p part="N">On the 23d of August 1777, he succeeded to the rectory Rιιan-Lanyhorne,
                    one of the most valuable livings in the gift of his college. He now withdrew
                    into Cornwall, and took possession of his benefice; and he afterwards married
                    Jane Tregenna, a lady of an ancient Cornish family. Her great-grandfather,
                    grandfather, and father, were successively rectors of Mawgan in Pydar. For a
                    long time his retirement was not attended with peace and studious ease. His
                    restless and domineering disposition soon involved him in a long train of
                    contentions with his parishioners: he proposed a tithe-composition, which his
                    friends represent as by no means unreasonable, but of which his parishioners
                    appear to have entertained a different opinion; they refused to accede to his
                    proposal, and he demanded the tithes in kind. “Disputes,” we are informed,
                    “arose upon disputes; animosities were kindled; and litigations took place. That
                    Mr Whitaker was finally victorious, afforded pleasure to the friends of the
                    rector, <hi rend="italic">and to the friends of justice and truth;</hi> yet it
                    was long before harmony was restored to Ruan-Lanyhorne.” Let us here remark in
                    passing, that this mode of confounding the cause of religion with the cause of
                    tithes is a pretty ancient device. It is not certainly to be considered as
                    wonderful, if, after all these contentions and litigations, Mr Whitaker was
                    subjected to the mortification of observing that his parishioners manifested an
                    aversion to his preaching, an indifference to his admonitions, and a repugnance
                    to his authority. This is indeed the natural consequence of the measures to
                    which he resorted; they have an obvious tendency to excite or continue
                    animosities, and to circumscribe the utility of a clergyman, by rendering him
                    obnoxious to almost every man in his parish who has property enough to bring him
                    within the circle of such litigations. It may perhaps be regarded as extremely
                    doubtful whether any clergyman, possessing a portion of the primitive spirit of
                    Christianity, would be tempted to engage, more especially with his own flock, in
                    quarrels, disputes, and lawsuits, which there might be any decent means of
                    avoiding. We are informed, that after the lapse of a few years, Mr Whitaker had
                    the satisfaction of perceiving a visible alteration in the behaviour of his
                    principal parishioners, and that a good understanding was at length established
                    between the pastor and his flock. His manner was hearty and familiar; and
                    notwithstanding the rabid spirit that sometimes animates his writings, he was
                    possessed of many virtues, though meekness and humility were certainly not of
                    their number.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"
                            >In reference to this paragraph, the coadjutor of Mr Baines is pleased
                            to remark, that “Mr Whitaker’s memory has been unjustly assailed, and
                            bis integrity wantonly called in question, by an anonymous writer in the
                            Supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.” (History of the County
                            Palatine and Duchy of Lancaster, vol. ii. p. 386. Lond. 1836, 4 vols.
                            4to.) The most careless reader may perceive that not one word is uttered
                            against his integrity; nor has this writer undertaken to prove that it
                            afforded any indication of his piety or wisdom, to maintain against his
                            own parishioners a series of litigations for the space of twelve years.
                            “In this contest Mr Whitaker’s law expenses amounted to about a thousand
                            pounds; but, by taking the tithes in kind during the suits, be not only
                            made up this loss beyond the original produce of the tithes, but was

                            bis preaching, their indifference to his instruction, their repugnance
                            to his authority and certainly no result could be more natural. An
                            injudicious defence is sometimes more injurious than a wanton
                            attack.</p></note></p>

                    Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell.” Lond. 1783, 12mo. He afterwards engaged in
                    the famous controversy respecting the character of Queen Mary, and produced an
                    immense work under the title of “Mary Queen of Scots vindicated.” Lond. 1787, 3
                    vols. 8vo. He published an enlarged edition in the year 1790; and he seems to
                    have been not a little mortified that neither Lord Hailes nor Dr Robertson could
                    be induced to print a single page against him. This production, which is by no
                    means eminent for coolness of reasoning, or sobriety of manner, has probably
                    convinced very few competent judges of historical evidence, who have submitted

                    should be required to display that innocence? Besides, if we suppose her to be
                    innocent, we must, at the same time, suppose all the most distinguished of those
                    who opposed her after the murder of her husband, to be covered with an enormous
                    load of infamy. And we will only venture to add, that the uncontroverted history
                    of her proceedings, from a short period preceding the murder, till her indecent
                    nuptials with Bothwell, furnishes a degree of moral evidence which seems to be
                    ineffectually opposed by all the persevering sophistry of her defenders.</p>
                <p part="N">Having again recurred to his theological studies, Mr Whitaker published
                    a large volume, entitled “The Origin of Arianism disclosed.” Lond. 1791, 8vo.

                            (Coleridge’s Literary Remains, vol. iv. p. 306.)</p></note> it is clear
                    that the author himself entertained a favourable enough opinion of this
                    production; which he represents as “a train of historical argumentation, at once
                    novel in its direction, comprehensive in its scope, and decisive in its
                    efficacy.” If he could not discuss a point of history without heat and violence,
                    it is easy to conceive how he would be disposed to discuss a point of heresy. As
                    a proof of his zeal for orthodoxy, an anonymous friend presents us with the
                    following anecdote. “That the feeble Deist should have shrunk from his indignant
                    eye, may well be conceived, when we see his Christian principle and his manly
                    spirit uniting in the rejection of a living of considerable value, which was at
                    this time offered him by an Unitarian patron. He spurned at the temptation, and
                    pitied the seducer.” But in order to render this anecdote altogether
                    intelligible, some further information seems to be required. Were his principles
                    so pure and rigid that he could only accept of preferment from a patron of
                    confirmed and approved orthodoxy? Or did this nameless patron offer him the
                    living under the condition, express or implied, that he should become a convert
                    to the Unitarian creed? With respect to the first question, it is quite evident
                    that many pious divines have accepted of preferment from patrons who, to all
                    human appearance, had no religion whatsoever; and with respect to the second, it
                    is equally evident, that no patron, if he possessed common sense, could expect a
                    benched clergyman to make an open avowal of opinions which the church has
                    formally condemned as heretical.</p>
                <p part="N">Whitaker had contributed to the English Review a series of articles on
                    Gibbon’s history, which were now reprinted in a separate form, under the title
                    of “Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, in vols. iv.
                    v. and vi. quarto, reviewed.” Lond. 1791, 8vo. This work, which extends to a
                    considerable volume, is written in his usual vein, with sufficient acuteness and
                    animation, but with little suavity of manner or elegance of style. He certainly
                    detects errors and exposes inconsistencies; but it may readily be supposed that
                    a writer of his cast of mind was not very likely to form an impartial estimate
                    of Gibbon's real merits, which, after all the fair and necessary deductions are
                    made, must still be allowed to be very great. Whitaker is always an intrepid
                    writer; he is never afraid to deliver a decided opinion; and whether the subject
                    is very familiar or quite new to him, his tone of decision is commonly the same.
                    Thus, for example, in his animadversions on Gibbon’s admirable chapter relating
                    to the Roman jurisprudence, he is pleased to declare, that “nothing can subdue
                    the native barrenness of such a field as this.” His censure refers to a subject
                    of which he may be considered as in a state of almost total ignorance: he seems
                    to have been alike unacquainted with this science, and incapable of appreciating
                    the masterly manner in which it is here discussed. It may indeed be affirmed
                    that there is no portion of Gibbon’s work more remarkable than this very
                    chapter: although his early studies had not prepared him for such a task, he has
                    yet exhibited a rapid and powerful sketch of the Roman jurisprudence, to which
                    it might be difficult to find a parallel in the writings of the professed
                    civilians. And it has accordingly been stamped with the approbation of some of
                    the most distinguished civilians of the present age. It has been illustrated by
                    Hugo and Warnkönig, the former having published it in German, and the latter in
                    French.</p>
                <p part="N">After an interval of three years, Whitaker produced a copious work on a
                    subject which is certainly curious and interesting. This work he entitles, in
                    his usual form, “The Course of Hannibal over the Alps ascertained.” Lond. 1794,
                    2 vols. 8vo. Like some of his former publications, it attracted a considerable
                    degree of attention, and, like them, was found to contain many hasty and
                    erroneous opinions. On this ground he was encountered by the late Lord
                    Woodhouselee, who published, but without his name, “A Critical Examination of Mr
                    Whitaker’s Course of Hannibal over the Alps ascertained.” Lond. 1795, 8vo. In
                    the year 1795, he endeavoured to enlighten the public by an octavo tract on “The
                    real Origin of Government,” which we have never had the pleasure of seeing, but
                    which his friend, formerly quoted, describes as a very singular pamphlet. This
                    information may, without scruple, be received as authentic; for it is not
                    difficult to conjecture how the subject of civil government would be treated by
                    such a writer at such a period.</p>
                <p part="N">The last work which Whitaker lived to communicate to the public is “The
                    Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall historically surveyed.” Lond. 1804, 2 vols. 4to.
                    His vigour was still undiminished, and he had formed the plan of many other
                    works, particularly a history of Oxford, and a history of London: the former he
                    intended to comprise in an octavo volume, the latter he contemplated as “quite
                    new and original, and fit to make a quarto.” While he was prosecuting his ardent
                    researches into the antiquities of the metropolis, his friends remarked the
                    first indications of declining health. He had originally possessed a robust
                    constitution, but his mind was restless, and his temper ardent; and during his
                    last visit to London, his great exertions in procuring materials for his work,
                    and his great efforts in supporting his usual tone of conversation in the
                    literary circles, left him in a state of debility which was not at first
                    considered as alarming. It was however followed by a stroke of palsy, from which
                    his recovery was never so complete as to allow him to resume his occupations
                    with his former vigour. During the last year of his life, he lingered in a state
                    of gradual decay; and he is said to have contemplated his approaching
                    dissolution with the cheerful resignation of a Christian. On Sunday the 30th of
                    October 1808, he sank as into a quiet slumber, without any indication of
                    suffering, and with a smile on his countenance. He died at Ruan-Lanyhorne, in
                    the seventy-fourth year of his age. Of his three daughters, two survived him.
                    One of these, named Anne, was married in 1821 to Dr Taunton, a physician of
                    Truro. Whitaker’s widow, who is described as the last of her ancient family,
                    died at Truro in 1828, at the age of eighty-five.</p>
                <p part="N">He had recently sent to the press an antiquarian volume, which, after
                    his death, was published under the title of “The Life of Saint Neot, the oldest
                    of all the Brothers of King Alfred.” Lond. 1809, 8vo. He had likewise made some
                    progress in preparing a life of Queen Mary; and his materials were consigned by
                    his widow to Mr George Chalmers, who adopted them as the foundation of his own

                    works have now been enumerated, but a few* supplementary notices are still
                    necessary. He wrote an introduction to Flindell's Bible, and a supplement to
                    Pohvhele’s Antiquities of Cornwall, and was a contributor to “The Cornwall and
                    Devon Poets.” His connection with the English Review has already been mentioned;
                    but he likewise appears to have lent his aid to the British Critic and the
                    Antijacobin Review; and his eulogist informs us, in a very solemn style, that
                    “the strength of his principles is nowhere more apparent than in those articles
                    where he comes forward, armed with the panoply of truth, in defence of our civil
                    and ecclesiastical constitution. It was there he struck his adversaries with
                    consternation, and we beheld the host of Jacobins shrinking away from before his
                    face, and creeping into their caverns of darkness.” The same tasteful and
                    judicious writer avers, that at Whitaker’s lucubrations “a Gibbon trembled but
                    this panegyric is somewhat abated by another piece of information, namely, that
                    Gibbon was a “feeble Deist.” With what torrents of fiery indignation this worthy
                    divine must, in his fugitive and anonymous writings, have overwhelmed Jacobins
                    and heretics, may very easily be imagined by those who have inspected his more
                    elaborate works, bearing his name and addition, and intended for the benefit of
                    posterity. Some persons of cooler tempers, and of more Habitual candour, when
                    they are fairly enveloped in the cover of a review, may now and then be tempted
                    to speak in a very high and arrogant tone to men greatly elevated above their
                    own standard, and of subjects of which they only possess a very casual and
                    superficial knowledge.</p>
                <p part="N">This anonymous writer, whom we strongly suspect to be Mr Polwhele, has,
                    in the following passage, discussed the character of Whitaker with more sobriety
                    and discrimination. “It is true, to the same warmth of temper, together with a
                    sense of good intentions, we must attribute an irritability at times destructive
                    of social comfort, an impetuousness that brooked not opposition, and bore down
                    all before it. This precipitation was in part also to be traced to his ignorance
                    of the world; to his simplicity in believing others like himself—precisely what
                    they seemed to be; and, on the detection of his error, his anger at
                    dissimulation or hypocrisy. But his general good Humour, his hospitality, and
                    his convivial pleasantry, were surely enough to atone for those sudden bursts of
                    passion, those flashes which betrayed his ‘ human frailty,’ but still argued
                    genius. And they who knew how ‘fearfully and wonderfully he was made,’ could
                    bear from a Whitaker what they could not so well have tolerated in another. In
                    his family, Mr Whitaker was uniformly regular; nor did he suffer at any time his
                    literary cares to trench on his domestic duties. The loss of such a man must be
                    deemed, as it were, a chasm both in public and private life. But, for the
                    latter, we may truly say, that if ever wife had cause to lament the kind and
                    faithful husband, or children the affectionate parent, or servants the indulgent
                    master, the family at Ruan-Lanyhorne must feel their loss irreparable.”<note
