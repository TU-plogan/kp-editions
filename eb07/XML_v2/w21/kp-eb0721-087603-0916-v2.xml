                <p part="N"><label type="entry">WHITHORN</label>, a royal borough of Wigtonshire,
                    situated eleven miles south of Wigton, and two and a half miles west of Wigton
                    Bay. It consists chiefly of one street lying north and south, and nearly half a
                    mile in length. The houses are not inelegant, though somewhat irregularly built.
                    The only public buildings are the town-house and jail, the parish church, and
                    three dissenting chapels. The town is devoid of manufactures, but maintains two
                    branch banks. The population in 1831 amounted to 1805. The Isle of Whithorn, a
                    village containing 413 inhabitants, about three miles to the south-east, is the
                    port of the borough. The municipal government is vested in a provost, two
                    bailies, and fifteen councillors; and Whithorn unites with Stranraer, Wigton,
                    and New Galloway in sending a representative to the House of Commons. Registered
                    voters in 1840-1, 50. Municipal revenue about L.100.</p>
                <p part="N">Whithorn is celebrated for its antiquity, and is conspicuous in the
                    annals of the church. Its original name was <hi rend="italic">Candida Casa,</hi>
                    White Cottage, from the circumstance that, in the beginning of the fifth
                    century, a church was erected there, of white stone, supposed to be the first in
                    Scotland built of such solid materials. The founder of it was St Ninian, a
                    native of the place, who died and was buried there in 432. His memory was held
                    in such veneration that many places both in England and Scotland were called
                    after his name, and pilgrimages were made to his shrine for centuries previously
                    to the Reformation, when such superstitious practices were prohibited by act of
                    parliament. The kings of Scotland not only visited this spot themselves, but
                    encouraged others to do so, and granted protection to all strangers coming from
                    England, Ireland, and the Isle of Man on pilgrimage to Whithorn. James IV.
                    performed the pilgrimage several times; once <hi rend="italic">on foot,</hi> in
                    consequence of the dangerous illness of his queen on the birth of their eldest
                    son; and on her recovery, which was attributed to the miraculous influence of
                    the saint, her husband and she, in testimony of their gratitude, performed the
                    same journey in circumstances of great pomp and magnificence. James V. was the
                    last royal personage that paid a visit to St Ninian’s shrine. Candida Casa
                    continued till 1689 the seat of the bishop of Galloway, who, previously to the
                    erection of Edinburgh into a bishopric in 1633, ranked above all the other
                    Scotish bishops, and immediately after the archbishops of St Andrews and
                    Glasgow. About the middle of the twelfth century, a monastery was founded at
                    Whithorn by Fergus, Lord of Galloway, for monks of the Premonstratensian order.
                    The most eminent persons connected with this monastery were James Beaton,
                    afterwards archbishop of St Andrews and lord chancellor of Scotland, and Gavin
                    Dunbar, afterwards successively tutor to James V., archbishop of Glasgow, and
                    chancellor of the kingdom. Of the cathedral and monastic buildings scarcely any
                    remains can be traced, except a few arches, particularly a very beautiful one of
                    the Saxon order, and several vaults, (<hi rend="smallcaps">c. i</hi>.)</p>
