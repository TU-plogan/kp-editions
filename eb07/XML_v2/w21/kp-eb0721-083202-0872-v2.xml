                        Von</hi></label>, was born at Eutin, in Holstein, on the 18th<note

                            Weber’s own account, he was born on the 18th; according to another
                            account, on the 16th of December.</p></note> of December 1786. His
                    father, a lover of music and a skilful violinist, not only had him carefully
                    educated, but encouraged his musical pursuits, as well as his fondness for
                    painting, in which last art it appears that he made considerable progress. The
                    retired habits of his family threw him early upon his own resources for
                    amusement, and his passion for music speedily became predominant, and exclusive
                    of all other occupations. As his father often changed his place of residence,
                    Weber’s music-teachers were likewise often changed; and with this disadvantage,
                    that as they did not agree in their methods and opinions, what one of them had
                    taught, his successor untaught. This forced Weber to reflect, and to become his
                    own instructor. In 1796-7 he received valuable lessons in pianoforte playing
                    from Hauschkel of Hildburghausen. He was next placed under the care of Michael
                    Haydn at Salzburg for composition, but made little progress under that master,
                    who was then very old. In 1798 his first work of six <hi rend="italic"
                        >Fughetti</hi> was published at Salzburg, and was well received. Weber then
                    proceeded to Munich, where Valesi became his master in singing, and Kalcher in
                    composition. From Kalcher he acquired much knowledge of the art of
                    counter-point, which laid a solid foundation for his future studies. While under
                    Kalcher's tuition, he composed his first opera, <hi rend="italic">Die Macht der
                        Liebe und des Weins</hi> (the Power of Love and Wine); besides a mass,
                    sonatas, and variations for the pianoforte, violin trios, songs, &amp;c. all of
                    which he afterwards destroyed. His next opera, <hi rend="italic">Das
                        Waldmädchen</hi> (the Wood Girl), was performed in November 1800, and met
                    with more success at Vienna and St Petersburg than he himself was pleased with
                    afterwards, when his judgment had become more matured. In 1801 he composed at
                    Salzburg his opera, <hi rend="italic">Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn</hi>
                    (Peter Schmoll and his Neighbours), which was performed at Augsburg, but with
                    indifferent success. In 1802 he went on a musical tour with his father to
                    Leipzig, Hamburg, and Holstein, and during this time studied a number of
                    theoretical works, from which, it seems, he derived little benefit. Dissatisfied
                    with these, he endeavoured to form a system of his own, and to apply it to an
                    analysis of the works of the old composers. In this he succeeded to his own
                    satisfaction. The next important step in his career was his visit to Vienna,
                    where he became acquainted with several eminent musicians, among others Haydn
                    and Vogler, under the latter of whom he studied hard for about two years,
                    enriching his mind and developing his powers by a close examination of various
                    masterpieces of composition. Meyerbeer, Gänsbacher, and G. Weber, were at this
                    time his fellow-pupils under Vogler. During these studies he only published some
                    variations and a pianoforte arrangement of Vogler’s opera of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sαmori.</hi> Being called to Breslau as music-director, he availed himself
                    of his new position to obtain a knowledge of choral and orchestral effects. At
                    Breslau he composed the greater part of the opera of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rübezahl</hi> (Number Nip). In 1806 he was invited<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=873" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0873-0833"
                    /> by Prince Eugene of Würtemberg to his court at Carlsruhe in Silesia, and
                    there composed two symphonies, some concertos, and other pieces. War having
                    driven him from this asylum, he resolved to abandon his public career till more
                    favoured by circumstances; and he resided for some time in private tranquillity
                    in the house of Duke Louis of Würtemberg. There he composed his opera of <hi
                        rend="italic">Silvana,</hi> on the basis of his <hi rend="italic">Die
                        Waldmädchen,</hi> and also wrote a piece named <hi rend="italic">Der erste
                        Ton</hi> (the First Tone), besides some overtures, choral pieces, and
                    pianoforte works. In 1810 he again set out on a professional tour through
                    Germany, and from this time devoted himself entirely to his art. At Frankfort,
                    Munich, Berlin, Vienna, &amp;c. he and his works were most favourably received.
                    His opera of <hi rend="italic">Abu Hassan</hi> was composed at Darmstadt in the
                    same year. Between 1813 and 1816, he was opera-director at Prague; but giving up
                    that post in 1816, he ceased from his musical occupations for a time, contenting
                    himself with visiting various places, and quietly waiting till he should be
                    called to new and greater exertions. At Prague he produced his celebrated
                    cantata, <hi rend="italic">Kampf und Sieg</hi> (Battle and Victory). He declined
                    various liberal offers that were made to him, until he was induced to accept an
                    invitation to form a German opera at Dresden. There he composed his opera, <hi
                        rend="italic">Der Freyschütz,</hi> which was first performed at Berlin in
                    1822, with extraordinary applause. At Dresden he produced in 1822 a drama called
                        <hi rend="italic">Preciosa,</hi> which was most favourably received. His
                    opera of <hi rend="italic">Euryanthe</hi> was also composed at Dresden, but
                    first brought out under his direction at Vienna in 1823, where, as he himself
                    says, “it was received with indescribable enthusiasm.” At Berlin his Euryanthe
                    was rather coldly received, and was there nicknamed by some musical critics <hi
                        rend="italic">L'Ennuyante.</hi> It has been said that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Libretto</hi> of this opera was so confused and ill-constructed, as to
                    overpower the beauty of the music. A three-act comic opera, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Die drei Pinto</hi> (the Three Pintos), which Weber had begun at Dresden,
                    remained unfinished, and was bequeathed by its author to his friend Meyerbeer,
                    with a request that he would complete it. In 1822 Weber suffered from pulmonary
                    illness, and still more severely in 1825. He appears, from some expressions in
                    his letters, to have anticipated a premature death; and, unhappily, his
                    prognostics were too speedily verified. In 1824 he began his opera of <hi
                        rend="italic">Oberon</hi> for London, which he appears to have finished
                    about the end of 1825 or the beginning of 1826. At the end of February 1826 he
                    set out for London, where he made his first appearance on the 8th of March at
                    Covent Garden, as conductor of a selection from <hi rend="italic">Der Frey
                        schütz,</hi> and was received in the most enthusiastic manner. At this time
                    his countenance betrayed the deep impress of mortal disease. On the 12th of
                    April 1826 his opera of <hi rend="italic">Oberon, or the Elf-king’s Oath,</hi>
                    was performed at Covent Garden Theatre, and conducted by Weber himself, who was
                    again greeted with the strongest testimonies of public favour. We now approach
                    the melancholy close of this eminent artist’s career. On the 26th May his
                    benefit concert took place in the Argyll Rooms, but was very thinly attended. On
                    this occasion, bodily illness and mental vexation so affected him that he was
                    Barely able to go through his duties as conductor. After the performance he sunk
                    upon a sofa in an alarming state of exhaustion. Ten days afterwards, at seven
                    o’clock in the morning of the 5th of June, he was found dead in his bed at Sir
                    George Smart’s house, where he had resided from the time of his arrival in
                    London. On opening the body the same afternoon, the three physicians and the
                    surgeon in attendance found the larynx and the lungs so diseased as sufficiently
                    to indicate the cause of his death. Weber left a widow and two children.
                    Unhappily he had no relative near him to close his eyes. His remains were
                    interred in the vaults of the Catholic chapel, Moorfields.</p>
                <p part="N">While writing this article, we observe that the Oldenburg government has
                    ordered a bronze statue of Weber to be erected in Eutin; and also, that his
                    works shall be engraved on copper, and the plates preserved in the ducal
                    library. Impressions are to be sent as presents only to the different sovereigns
                    of Europe. The artists of the King’s Chapel at Dresden have, it is said, raised
                    a subscription for removing Weber’s body from London, to a tomb which they
                    propose to erect for it in the public cemetery of that city.</p>
                <p part="N">Weber was an excellent pianist, but does not seem to have pushed himself
                    forward in that capacity. He expressed himself most vehemently against all those
                    who composed music by the aid of any instrument. He is described as a man of
                    small stature, very thin, with an intelligent countenance; sensible, well
                    informed, and very unobtrusive. His temper seems to have been amiable, and we do
                    not find any traces of its being seriously ruffled, except on the occasion of
                    Castil Blaze’s piracy of the <hi rend="italic">Freyschiitz</hi> for the Odéon at
                    Paris. Then indeed he wrote two very sharp letters to Blaze, dated 15th December
                    1825, and 4th January 1826, but without obtaining answer or redress. A number of
                    interesting particulars regarding him is to be found in some his own letters and
                    other papers, published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Hinterlassene
                        Schriften von Carl Maria von Weber</hi> (Posthumous Writings of C. Μ. von
                    Weber), in 2 vols. 8vo, 1828. Among these are, his Autobiography, and “The Life
                    of a Composer.”</p>
                <p part="N">We have already mentioned his principal works, and their very favourable
                    reception. It has been said that, in his Freyschütz and other operas, he
                    borrowed largely from old popular German airs, and that he has no great claims
                    to originality. If he adopted much from others, the children of his adoption
                    were at least splendidly clothed and richly entertained. Still there is much of
                    originality and beauty in Weber’s works, though it may be granted that he more
                    frequently depends upon bold effects of harmony and modulation than upon melodic
                    invention and expression. The example of Mozart, extended by Beethoven, Rossini,
                    and Weber, led to that system of unlimited modulation which has now become more
                    familiarized to the musical public, though not yet relished except by the
                    initiated. The whole history of music shows that the public ear is only
                    gradually trained to innovations in harmony and modulation; and even at this
                    day, some of the most elaborate works of Sebastian Bach, and his son Emanuel,
                    are <hi rend="italic">caviare</hi> to the multitude, from their extreme
                    abstruseness.</p>
                <p part="N">Beethoven’s magnificent opera of Fidelio, produced in 1805, gave a new
                    impulse and direction to the German opera. The powerful influence of this great
                    work is very perceptible in the operas of Weber and other German composers
                    within the last thirty-five years. So is the influence of Beethoven’s pianoforte
                    music upon that of Weber and others. Although Weber cannot be compared with
                    Beethoven for original and powerful genius, fertility and sublimity of
                    invention, still he must be considered as a great master, possessed of much
                    dramatic talent, great knowledge of his art and of orchestral effect, and a high
                    degree of brilliancy and gracefulness in composition. His faults are, occasional
                    dry and harsh construction, want of unity in melody and of determinate rhythm,
                    and the occurrence of what are technically termed <hi rend="italic">strangled
                        modulations.</hi> Indeed, violent contrasts in harmony and modulation;
                    fragmentary snatches of melody, often hard and dry, without leading and
                    sustained subjects; the abuse of chromatic passages; vague and disjointed
                    rhythm; are the faulty characteristics of too many composers of the modem German
                    school when carrying license to extremes. This style may be called the
                    transcendental dithyrambic of music; wild, disorderly, heterogeneous,
                        anti-rhythmical<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=874" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0874-0834"
                    />. Weber however redeems his occasional faults by a profusion of beauties. His
                    printed works are numerous. Besides the operas mentioned above, they consist of
                    concertos, concertinos, pots-pourris, for the pianoforte, the clarinet, the
                    oboe, the bassoon, and the violoncello; sonatas, variations, polonaises,
                    &amp;c.; symphonies and overtures, among which last the overture <hi
                        rend="italic">Der Beherrscher der Geister</hi> (the Ruler of the Spirits) is
                    remarkably characteristic of Weber’s peculiar style. Many of his songs published
                    in collections are trifling; but his four-part songs, with pianoforte
                    accompaniment, named <hi rend="italic">Leger und Schwerdt</hi> (Lyre and Sword),
                    words by Körner, are excellent. A posthumous work of Weber’s, a Stabat Mater for
                    two soprano voices and one alto, was in 1826 intrusted by his widow to the
                    music-director Rungenhagen of Berlin for publication. In his autobiography, he
                    says that the following words may with justice be inscribed upon his tombstone:
                    “Here lies one who meant honestly, and wished to act uprightly, both towards his
                    art and towards his fellow-men.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. f. g.)</hi></p>
