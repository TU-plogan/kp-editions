                    >Gilbert</hi></label>, a commentator and critic of some celebrity, born at
                    Nottingham on the 22d of February 1756, was the son of the Rev. George
                    Wakefield, rector of the parish of St Nicolas. He was observed in his earliest
                    infancy to be of a serious turn of mind, and he made a rapid progress in the
                    first elements of literature. At the age of seven, he was sent to a free school
                    at Nottingham, and remained there two years, chiefly under the tuition of Mr
                    Beardmore, afterwards master of the Charterhouse: he was then sent to a school
                    kept by the Rev. S. Pickthall, at Wilford, an institution which seems to have
                    been only distinguished by the regular imprisonment of the boys for no less than
                    eleven hours a day. After this, when his father obtained the vicarage of
                    Kingston in Surrey, with the chapelry of Richmond, he was placed under the care
                    of his curate, who kept a school at Richmond; he was, however, removed in 1769
                    to a better conducted establishment in the same neighbourhood, kept by the Rev.
                    R. Wooddeson, of whom he speaks in his Memoirs with high approbation.</p>
                <p part="N">At sixteen he went to Jesus College, Cambridge, where his classical
                    studies still continued to be the principal object of his attention, although he
                    was so fortunate as to obtain the rank of second wrangler at the termination of
                    his academical studies in 1776. He has indeed the candour to observe, that the
                    year was below mediocrity with regard to the performances of the candidates in
                    general; and that, when he obtained the second classical medal, on the Duke of
                    Newcastle’s foundation, he had only one competitor. Still it must not be dcnied,
                    that to be both second wrangler and second medallist in any year implies no
                    ordinary portion of application, as well as some considerable talent. Mr
                    Wakefield was however distinguished, throughout his life, by a singular mixture
                    of opposite habits; and, in the midst of his studies, he confesses that “he
                    sometimes felt himself almost incapable of reading a single page for months
                    together and in summer especially, he could only wander about the fields in a
                    state of perfect inactivity. On the other hand, he says that, “for five years he
                    rose, almost without exception, by five o’clock, winter and summer, but never
                    breakfasted, drank tea, or <hi rend="italic">supt</hi> [supped],” or of course
                    dined, “alone half a dozen times during all that space, enjoying society, from
                    the first, beyond measure.”</p>
                <p part="N">He became a fellow of Jesus College in 1776, and he gained, in two
                    successive years, the second bachelor’s prizes given by the chancellor. In 1778
                    he was ordained by the bishop of Peterborough, though he did not subscribe the
                    articles without great reluctance. He obtained a curacy first at Stockport in
                    Cheshire, and then at Liverpool. The year after, he married Miss Watson, a niece
                    of the rector of Stockport, and thus vacated his fellowship. His domestic life
                    appears to have been happy and harmonious, though the only merit of his wife,
                    that he has left upon record, is the singular hereditary qualification, that her
                    great-grandfather and great-grandmother had lived together as man and wife for
                    seventy-five years. Soon after his marriage, he became classical tutor in the
                    dissenting academy at Warrington, though he did not professedly unite with any
                    specific community of dissenters as adopting all their opinions; but he soon
                    began openly to attack those of the established church, in a multitude of
                    controversial writings, and especially in the notes accompanying his new
                    translations of some parts of the Scriptures; a work for which he had diligently
                    laboured to prepare himself by the study of various dialects of the oriental
                    languages. After the dissolution of the academy of Warrington, he lived at
                    Bramcote in Nottinghamshire, at Richmond, and at Nottingham; partly occupied in
                    the instruction of a few pupils, and partly in pursuing his own studies and
                    illustrations of antiquity. In 1786, and for two or three years after, he
                    suffered greatly from an acute pain in his shoulder, which interfered materially
                    with the prosecution of his theological investigations.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1790, he accepted the classical professorship at Hackney.
                    Here his lectures and instructions were generally approved and admired, but he
                    carried his dissent from the articles of faith of any established society of
                    Christians so much farther than any of his colleagues, that he was thought too
                    independent to continue in his situation, and he consequently left the
                    institution in 1791; and for a <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=747" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0747-0707"
                    />similar reason he failed of obtaining the charge of two private pupils whom he
                    expected to have been placed with him. He continued to reside at Hackney,
                    employing himself partly as an author and editor, and partly in the education of
                    his own children. Among his original productions were several polemical and
                    political pamphlets, relating to the war with France, and to the various
                    controversies of the day. Of these the most remarkable for its consequences to
                    himself was his Reply to the Bishop of Landaff’s Address, which occasioned a
                    prosecution to be brought by the attorney-general, against his publisher first,
                    and then against himself; and he was sentenced to be confined for two years in
                    Dorchester jail; a punishment which was probably intended to be somewhat severe,
                    but which was most fortunate in its operation on his subsequent comfort, since
                    it was the cause of his obtaining, by the exertions of his friends and his
                    partisans at large, a subscription of about L.5000; a sum which not only
                    alleviated the rigour of his imprisonment, but also enabled him to leave his
                    family in a state of comparative affluence.</p>
                <p part="N">He was principally occupied during his confinement in continuing his
                    literary labours for the press, and in preparing <hi rend="italic">a</hi> series
                    of classical lectures, beginning with the illustration of the second book of
                    Virgil’s AEneid, the first course of which he delivered in London immediately
                    after his liberation in May 1801. The effect of unusual exertions of body and
                    mind, after so long a cessation of exercise, and in hot summer weather, appears
                    to have predisposed his constitution to a typhus fever, of which he died, after
                    a fortnight’s illness, on the 9th of September 1801, leaving a widow and six
                    children, four sons and two daughters. His brother, the Rev. Thomas Wakefield of
                    Richmond, also survived him, and died in 1806. The catalogue of his literary
                    offspring is so multitudinous, that it partly tells its own story by its length,
                    and admits of very few particular remarks.</p>

                    /> either in a moral or a literary point of view, than that of Gilbert
                    Wakefield; and he has accordingly been depicted, by critics and historians of
                    various sentiments, in colours the most opposite and the most discordant. “Of
                    his particular modes of thinking on religious and political subjects,” says Dr
                    Lindsay, “different men will form different opinions: concerning the integrity
                    of his heart, and the consistency of his character, there can be but one opinion
                    amongst those who enjoyed the happiness of his acquaintance.” It would indeed be
                    difficult to find a more splendid example of high honour and self-denial, and of
                    magnificent liberality, even under actual pecuniary embarrassment, than Mr
                    Wakefield displayed, at a time when he had to support himself, with a wife and
                    six or seven children, on about L.150 a year, in voluntarily paying the expenses
                    of Mr Cuthell on his prosecution for publishing the Reply to the Bishop of
                    Landaff’s Address, which exceeded the whole yearly amount of his income. “His
                    devotedness to study,” says his friend Dr Aikin, “was by no means attended with
                    a reserved or unsocial disposition; for no one could delight more in free
                    conversation, or bear his part in it with a more truly social spirit; and if, in
                    controversial and critical writings, he was apt to indulge in the contemptuous
                    and severe expressions which he found too much sanctioned by polemical use, in
                    disputation by word of mouth he was singularly calm and gentle, patient in
                    hearing, and placid in replying. To conclude the topic of [his] moral character,
                    it was marked by an openness, a simplicity, a good faith, an affectionate
                    ardour, a noble elevation of soul, which made way to the hearts of all who
                    nearly approached him, and rendered him the object of their warmest attachment.”
                    But “he wanted time or patience,” says Dr Parr very justly, “for that
                    discrimination which would have made his conjectures fewer indeed but more
                    probable, and his principles more exact: [yet] I shall ever think of him as one
                    of the best scholars produced by my own country in my own age.” The compliments
                    of Heyne, and of his pupil Jacobs, are still more elaborate; but it is well
                    known, that when Porson was one day asked for a toast, with a sentiment from
                    Shakspeare, he gave “Gilbert Wakefield, <hi rend="italic">What's Hecuba to him,
                        or he to Hecuba?"</hi> and there was quite as much of truth as there was of
                    neatness in the application. A reviewer of his Life in the British Critic, by no
                    means favourably disposed towards him, readily admits that “he was strictly and
                    enthusiastically honest, and seems to have acquired even a passion for
                    privations: these feelings, added to his pride of independent thinking, led him,
                    we doubt not,” he says, “to abstain from wine; to have relinquished in part, and
                    to be tending entirely to give up, the use of animal food, with various other
                    instances of peculiarity. Knowing his own assiduity, and giving himself ample
                    credit for sagacity, he thought that he was equal to the decision of every
                    possible question: and thus he became bigoted to almost every paradox which had
                    once possessed his very eccentric understanding. He was as violent against Greek
                    accents as he was against the Trinity, and anathematized the final N as strongly
                    as episcopacy. Whatever coincided not with his ideas of rectitude, justice,
                    elegance, or whatever else it might be, was to give way at once, and to be
                    rescinded at his pleasure, on pain of the most violent reprehension to all
                    opponents; whether it were an article of faith, a principle of policy, a
                    doctrine of morality, or a reading in an ancient author, away it must go, <hi

                    These exterminating sentences were also given with such precipitancy, as not to
                    allow even a minute for consideration. To the paper, to the press, to the
                    [public], all was given at once, frequently to the incurring of the most
                    palpable absurdity. Thus the simple elegance of <hi rend="italic">O beate
                        Sexti,</hi> in Horace, was proposed, in an edition of that author, to be
                    changed to <hi rend="italic">O beatě Sexti,</hi> though the alteration, besides
                    being most bald and tasteless, produced a blunder in quantity so gross, that no
                    boy, even in the middle part of a public school, would have been thought
                    pardonable in committing it. By faults [either] original or habitual, his
                    sincerity became offensive, his honesty haughty and uncharitable, his
                    intrepidity factious, his acuteness delusive, and his memory, assisted by much
                    diligence, a vast weapon which his judgment was totally unable to wield.”</p>
                <p part="N">It is not impossible that Mr Wakefield might have been more successful
                    in his studies, if he could have fount! sufficient motives for directing them
                    rather to scientific than to philological pursuits; for he seems to have been
                    fully impressed with the superior dignity of science to that of any department
                    of philology. “Compared with the noble theories of mathematical philosophy,” he
                    says, “our <hi rend="italic">classical</hi> lucubrations are as the glimmering
                    of a taper to the meridian splendour of an equatorial sun.” He would, however,
                    scarcely have had perseverance enough to distinguish himself in that solitary
                    labour which is required for the minute investigation of natural phenomena: and
                    it is seldom that any collateral encouragement is held out, in this country, for
                    the continued cultivation of abstract science; while the classical scholar,
                    though he is supposed to be principally occupied with nouns, and verbs, and
                    particles, is, in fact, unconsciously, and therefore most effectually, learning
                    the arts of poetry, and rhetoric, and logic, which have furnished, in all ages,
                    the spur and the reins for urging on and directing the mighty bulk of the body
                    politic, in church and in state, at the will of its leaders. The young man, on
                    the other hand, who commences the pursuit of science with ardour, obtains, if he
                    is most successful, and untormented by unnecessary scruples, a quiet fellowship,
                    a comfortable apartment, and an excellent plain dinner for the remainder of his
                    life; and if he fails of these, he may chance to be made an exciseman; or, in
                    the improved arrangements of the present auspicious days, a computer or an
                    assistant astronomer; but with respect to any influence that his pursuits might
                    be supposed to have on the elevation of his rank in life, or in the independent
                    provision for a family, he must lay no such flattering unction to his soul, but
                    must at all times place his pride and his happiness in the reflection that <hi
                        rend="italic">at mihi plaudo ipse domi,</hi> which is, in truth, the best
                    sublunary support of the wise and the good in every circumstance of human life.
