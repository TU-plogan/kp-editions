                    Wexford; the latter holding the northern parts, with part of Wicklow, the former
                    the southern and western, with a portion of Waterford. It was afterwards known
                    by the name of Laighion or South Leinster. It suffered severely by the predatory
                    incursions of the Danes, who, after ravaging the open country, and burning
                    Ferns, then the capital, made a permanent settlement, of which the town of
                    Weisford or Wexford was the principal position. They retained possession of the
                    district until the arrival of the English, who, in 1169, landed at Bagenbon,
                    near Bannow, under the command of Robert Fitzstephen, Maurice Fitzgerald, and
                    Hewey de Montmorency, and took the town of Wexford, which M'Murrough, king of
                    Leinster, to whose aid these adventurers had come into the country, granted to
                    Fitzstephen, together with the adjoining district of Forth, at the same time
                    bestowing on Montmorency the neighbouring district of Bargie. The latter grant
                    was confirmed by Henry II. on his arrival; but that conferred on Fitzstephen was
                    taken from him and made part of the palatinate of Leinster, which the same king
                    granted to Strongbow, the first undertaker of the adventure, and chief leader of
                    the forces. The district descended, through the female line, to William earl
                    Marshal, on whose demise, without male issue, it was portioned out among his
                    five daughters, the second of whom, wife of Warren de Mountchency, obtained
                    Wexford. In consequence of the frequent changes of seigniory, the district fell
                    into a state of great distraction, and was partly seized on by the Kavenaghs,
                    the descendants of M'Murrough, who assumed the title of kings of Leinster. It
                    was reduced to shire-ground by King John in 1210, and the lordship having
                    ultimately descended to the earl of Shrewsbury, the county was separated into
                    two parts, the Liberty and the Cross; the former being governed by authorities
                    appointed by the earl, the latter by officers of the crown. Each sent two
                    members to the Irish parliament, until the property of the earl became vested in
                    the crown, under the statute of absentees, passed in 1537. During the civil wars
                    of 1641, it was held for the royal party, until reduced by Cromwell, whose
                    operations were signalized by much cruelty. Since that event, the county
                    remained in a tranquil state until the year 1798, when it became the principal
                    seat of the insurrection in the southern counties; the town of Wexford forming
                    the head-quarters of the insurgents, and several severe conflicts taking place
                    at Enniscorthy, New-Ross, and other positions, with the royal forces.</p>
                <p part="N">The surface consists chiefly of a collection of very low hills, except
                    on the northern and western sides, on the former of which it rises into an
                    elevated ridge, forming the southern termination of the great Wicklow group. Its
                    loftiest points are, Slieveboy, 1384 feet high; Kilkevan, 1063; Connar Hill,
                    1491; and Croghan-Kinshela, 1985. On the latter or western side it is bounded by
                    the rugged chain of Mount Leinster, 2604 feet high, and Blackstairs, 2411,
                    ranging from north to south. The county boundary on this side is continued
                    southwards by the Barrow and the estuary of Waterford harbour. Within the county
                    are the Camerous Hills and Carrickburne, respectively 598 and 766 feet; Lackan,
                    near New-Ross, 628; Tarah Hill, a striking landmark on the eastern coast, 825;
                    and Forth Mountain, 774 feet. The south-eastern extremity, containing the
                    baronies of Forth and Bargie, forms a peninsula of low land, nearly shut out
                    from the rest of the county by the last-mentioned range of mountains and by
                    Wexford harbour. The principal river is the Slaney, which enters the county at
                    its north-western extremity, from Wicklow, and traverses it in a south-eastern
                    direction, till it falls into Wexford harbour at Carrigg, noted for the remains
                    of an ancient Norman fortress, erected by Fitzstephen immediately after his
                    landing. The whole course of this river is marked by a succession of picturesque
                    scenery; and it receives in its progress a number of tributary streams, of which
                    the Bann is the most remarkable. The Slaney is navigable for small barges to
                    Enniscorthy. The Bannow, which discharges itself into a bay of the same name,
                    claims notice solely from its historic reminiscences. The Barrow forms the
                    western boundary, from the foot of Blackstairs Mountain, to its confluence with
                    the Suir, in Waterford harbour. Lough Ta, near Carnsore Point, is the only lake
                    in the county. It is supplied by the ingress of several small streams, and
                    having no natural outlet, it increases rapidly in extent, covering the
                    surrounding low land, until, in every second or third year, its accumulated
                    waters are drawn off by an artificial cut, which discharges them into the sea.
                    The coast on the eastern side, from Arklow southwards to Wexford, is very
                    dangerous, having no place of refuge in case of foul weather, except in the
                    small artificial harbour of Courtown, fit only for small craft. The dangers of
                    navigation are increased by a succession of sand-banks from that of Arklow, <pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=906"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0906-0866"/> the south point of which is marked by a
                    floating light. These are called Kilgorman, the Rusk and Ram, and Blackwater
                    Bank. Wexford harbour forms a large and safe landlocked basin; but the entrance
                    to it is obstructed by a bar, on which at times there is not more than seven
                    feet water; and in the passage up to the quay there are several shifting banks,
                    that render the navigation hazardous even to those acquainted with it. Within
                    the harbour are the two small islands of Beg-Eri and Great Island, on each of
                    which are the remains of monastic buildings. The Tusker Rock, about five miles
                    from shore, between Greensore and Carnsore Point, has on it a revolving light,
                    with two faces bright and one deep red. Bells are also rung in foggy weather.
                    South of the coast, and west of Carnsore Point, are the two Saltee islands.
                    South of them is a floating light; and between them and the mainland is a narrow
                    ridge, called St Patrick’s Bridge, with but from seven to ten feet of water on
                    it at ebb tide. Farther west are the fishing harbours of Crosfarnogue and
                    Fethard. The latter is a creek, dry at low water. Still farther, the projecting
                    point of Hookhead, forming the eastern side of Waterford harbour, and having on
                    it a light-house 100 feet high, forms the western extremity of the coast, which
                    thence tends northwards to the mouth of the Barrow, having on it Duncannon Fort,
                    that commands the entrance to that river and to the port of Waterford.</p>
                <p part="N">The basis of nearly the whole county is a stratum of clay-slate,
                    graywacke, and graywacke-slate, interrupted by several small patches of quartz
                    rock near Gorey, one of larger size south of Wexford, and another south of
                    Enniscorthy. A small protrusion of greenstone trap, with whindykes, appears to
                    the north of Gorey. The carboniferous or mountain limestone shews itself to the
                    south of Wexford, along the shore of the harbour. It forms also the extremity of
                    Hookhead Point. Mount Leinster and Black-stairs are a continuation of the great
                    granite formation of Wicklow, constituting its southern termination, which is
                    here broken through by the valley of the Barrow or New-Ross river. On its
                    eastern verge it is bordered by clayslate, passing into greenstone-slate.
                    Granite also shews itself in two patches south of Carnsore Point. The Saltees
                    are of clay-slate, supporting beds of sandstone. Slates are raised in several
                    places. A lead-mine at Cairn, after having been worked for some time, and
                    abandoned, has been re-opened. Silver was formerly raised at Clonmines, where it
                    is said that the Danes established a mint for its coinage. Copper ore has been
                    discovered near Wexford, and remains of ancient mines are visible in several
                    places. A perfect skeleton of the great moose-deer of Ireland, found in a bog,
                    is now in a private collection in the county. The soil in the south-eastern
                    parts is a rich alluvial mould, mixed with coralline sand and limestone. The
                    peninsula of Hookhead, which rests on a limestone bed, is peculiarly fertile,
                    both throwing up a rich herbage, and yielding heavy crops of grain. The quality
                    of the soil deteriorates on proceeding westward; but the farmer finds a valuable
                    equivalent in these districts, in the large tracts of turf or peat-moss with
                    which its surface is overspread.</p>

                    deserving of credit, has been as follows:</p>

                    religious persuasion of the pupils, the numbers of each were as follows: Members
                    of the established church, 2298; Protestant dissenters, 30; Roman Catholics,
                    15,641; those whose religious persuasion could not be ascertained, 100. The

                    2278 pupils, were maintained by grants of public money; 24, with 1943 pupils, by
                    voluntary subscriptions; the remaining 322, with 14,548 pupils, wholly by the
                    fees paid for instruction. There is an endowed school at Ferns, on the
                    foundation of Erasmus Smith, in which the master receives an annual salary of
                    L.30, in addition to the pupils’ fees. At New-Ross there is a school, founded by
                    Sir John Ivory, with an additional endowment from the corporation.</p>
                <p part="N">The county is divided into the eight baronies of Bal-laghkeen, Bantry,
                    Bargie, Forth, Gorey, Scarewalsh, Shelburne, and Shelmalier. These are
                    subdivided into 143 parishes, all, except two in the diocese of Dublin, being
                    within that of Fems, which is nearly conterminous with the county. The diocese
                    was united with that of Leighlin until after the passing of the act for reducing
                    the number of sees in Ireland; under the provisions of which the united dioceses
                    were in 1835 joined to that of Ossory, and the three are now held by one bishop,
                    who is a suffragan to the archbishop of Dublin. Previously to the union, the
                    county was represented in the Irish parliament by eighteen members, two for the
                    county, and two for each of the boroughs of Bannow, Clonmines, Enniscorthy,
                    Fethard, Newborough, New-Ross, Taghmon, and Wexford. By the act of union the
                    number was reduced to four; two for the county, and one each for New-Ross and
                    Wexford, which arrangement has been continued under the reform act. The number

                    and to that of the heads of families as 1 to 8½. The county is in the Leinster
                    circuit. The assizes are held in Wexford, and general sessions of the peace at
                    the same place, and in Enniscorthy, Gorey, and New-Ross, twice in the year: in
                    each of these last-named towns there are bridewells. The local government is
                    vested in a lieutenant, sixteen deputy-lieutenants, seventy-four unsalaried
                    magistrates, and a stipendiary. Under these there is a constabulary force,
                    consisting of a county inspector, seven sub-inspectors, eight head constables,
                    and 240 constables and sub-constables. The county infirmary, house of industry,
                    and fever hospital, are in Wexford. There are also fever hospitals in seven
                    other towns, and numerous dispensaries throughout the county. Wexford,
                    Enniscorthy, Gorey, and New-Ross, have been fixed on as sites for the workhouses
                    of poor-law unions.</p>

                <p part="N">The Forth mountain divides the county into two districts, differing as
                    widely from each other in character as if they were in separate islands. The
                    country to the south of this mountain, containing the baronies of Forth and
                    Bargie, is peopled by the descendants of the English colony which was located
                    here in the time of Henry II. Their manners, customs, mode of dress, and even in
                    a great degree their language, still retain traces of the peculiarity of their
                    origin. The appearance of these baronies, when viewed by a spectator placed on
                    the summit of their boundary ridge, is not unlike the south of Devonshire. The
                    entire district is well peopled. The farm-houses, as in Devonshire, are built of
                    clay, and thatched, with neat offices, and generally a vegetable garden attached
                    to them. The unwearied and well-directed industry of the farmers insures a large
                    return from the land. The whole is under tillage, and the vicinity of the sea
                    enables the farmer to obtain a plentiful supply of sea-weed and calcareous sand
                    for manure, besides which marl is found in abundance. Fuel is scarce; but the
                    want of turf is supplied by the use of furze, which thrives here luxuriantly,
                    and with which the mounds of earth that form the general fence of the farm are
                    thickly topped; thus insuring at the same time the most perfect security against
                    trespass, shelter for the cattle in severe weather, and a supply, sufficient
                    though not profuse, of fuel from the prunings of the furze. The fences are
                    sometimes further fortified by a hedge of quicksets along the centre of the top
                    of the mound. It is said that there was a turbary along the shore, which the
                    encroachments of the sea have long ago covered with sand, and with water during
                    flood-tides. The principal crops are barley and beans: these are to be seen, in
                    the peninsula of Carne, growing luxuriantly on land so overspread with stone as
                    to induce the opinion that the ground was wholly unproductive. Poultry of every
                    kind is reared in all the farm-houses, chiefly for exportation to Dublin and
                    Liverpool. Many farmers pay much attention to the rearing of bees, and efforts
                    are frequently made to preserve the stock while taking the honey. The sandy
                    reaches near the coast form burrows for immense numbers of rabbits, the flesh of
                    which is deemed to be of a peculiarly good flavour. The shores are frequented by
                    numerous flocks of wild and sea fowl, among which the barnacle is most highly
                    prized. Round fish is taken in large quantities on the eastern extremity of
                    Nymph Bank, which is off the coast; and also at the station of the floating
                    light off the Saltees. The inshore fishing employs many hands, their open boats
                    being enabled to run for shelter during rough weather into the numerous creeks
                    and inlets which indent the coast. Shellfish is plenty. The Wexford oyster is
                    carried to Dublin, where it finds a ready market, more on account of size than
                    flavour. Wexford town is the chief market for the produce of the farms; and many
                    of the inhabitants have never travelled farther, looking on all beyond the
                    mountain as a foreign country. An elderly woman, the wife of a respectable
                    farmer, in answer to a question as to the extent of her travelling through the
                    country, replied, “that she had never been out of Forth. On one unlucky day,
                    indeed, she had been prevailed upon to go to the top of the mountain; but the
                    sight of the wide world that there opened on her overcame her: her head grew
                    giddy, her stomach sickened, and she hastened home, determined never again to
                    expose herself to such a hazard.” The dialect of the peasantry, of which some
                    vestiges are still preserved in common conversation, was Saxon-English of the
                    time of the Henries and Edwards. The rector of a parish there, when reading
                    Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales while overseeing his reapers in a field, was struck
                    with the similarity between many words in his book and the expressions he heard
                    from those around him. On reading some passages of it to them, he was peculiarly
                    struck with the surprise and pleasure expressed by them when they found
                    themselves able to understand what was written in a book. They were fully
                    competent to interpret what was read, and gave explanations of phrases and
                    passages which to him were abstruse, in a manner more satisfactory than the
                    commentators whose notes were annexed to the printed text. Their usual mode of
                    saluting each other is simple and pleasing. On meeting, one asks, “Is it long
                    since ?" meaning to inquire whether the interval of absence has appeared long.
                    The reply is couched in similar terms of artless courtesy—“Yea, joy.” The young
                    people are passionately addicted to festive amusements, such as dancing and
                    hurling. At their marriages, which in other respects are celebrated according to
                    the forms usual elsewhere, an apple is cut into small pieces and thrown among
                    the crowd, a custom derived from England, but the origin of which is unknown.
                    The dress of the peasantry until lately w∙as, for the men a jacket or short
                    coat, waistcoat, and trunk breeches, with a round narrow-brimmed hat; for the
                    women a short jacket and petticoat, bordered at bottom with several rows of
                    coloured ribbon or tape; the head-dress was a kerchief. The people live
                    comfortably, are industrious, cleanly, and well-conducted. The poorest farmer
                    eats meat twice in the week, and the table of the wealthier is covered with
                    butchermeat and fowl. The usual beverage is home-brewed ale or beer of excellent
                    flavour and colour. The women do all manner of field-work, except ploughing, and
                    receive equal wages with the men. The manners and customs of the inhabitants of
                    the other baronies resemble those of the Irish peasantry throughout the
                    surrounding counties: there is less attention to external appearance and to
                    domestic comfort and cleanliness. The soil also is poorer, and the farming less
                    precise. There is, however, no disinclination to exertion, no want of the
                    application of personal labour: the defect lies in its misdirection. In the
                    western baronies, where there is neither sea-weed, marl, nor limestone, the
                    petty farmer will take long journeys to draw home a load of lime, forty load of
                    which are required to manure an acre. Beans are everywhere a favourite, though
                    an uncertain crop. Wheat is sown in quantities sufficient to render it an
                    important article of export. In most respects the system of tillage or the
                    description of crops differs little from those of similar soils elsewhere. But
                    it is observed, that even in those districts of the northern baronies in which
                    the soil is good, abounding with marl alternating with a clayey loam, and
                    adequate, by proper management, to give an abundant return to well-directed
                    industry, little is perceptible of the activity, comfort, or happiness of the
                    southern baronies. This difference is most striking on the estates in which the
                    practice of letting lands to middle-men is most prevalent.</p>
                <p part="N">The manufactures carried on in the county are those of woollen cloth,
                    checks, and coarse linens, all for the homeconsumption of the district, and
                    wrought in the farm-houses. A cotton factory near Enniscorthy failed. Iron was
                    also manufactured in the same neighbourhood. At present the raising of grain and
                    rearing of cattle is almost exclusively the occupation of the inhabitants, and
                    the export of the agricultural produce the sole article of commerce. The
                    principal markets for grain and flour are Wexford, Enniscorthy, and New-Ross.
                    Much butter is sent to Dublin through Gorey; and much also is exported to
                    Liverpool, together with swine and poultry. The exports of the county through
                    Wexford have been estimated at 30,000 tons, value L.330,000; and the imports
                    through the same channel at 40,000 tons, value L.600,000. The communication with
                    the counties in the interior is carried on chiefly by the Barrow, which is
                    navigable for barges to Athy, where it meets the Grand Canal. A line of railroad
                    from Wexford to Carlow has been surveyed by the Commissioners of Railways, but
                    no steps have as yet been taken towards its formation. There are five banking
                    establishments; one a branch of the Bank of Ireland, one of the Provincial <pb

                    loan-societies have been formed under the loan-fund act, in all of which the
                    amount of loans in the hands of borrowers at the close of 1839 was L.6728, and
                    the number of borrowers during the year 7356.</p>
                <p part="N">Every part of the county, but more particularly the southern baronies,
                    abound with reliques of Danish, Saxon, and Norman antiquities. Raths are very
                    numerous. There are two of considerable magnitude near Dunbrody, and two others
                    near Enniscorthy and New-Ross. A heap of stones, near Wicklow Gap, at the
                    northern extremity of the county, marks the spot where the bodies of those who
                    fell in a sanguinary conflict there, between the king’s troops and the
                    insurgents in 1798, were interred together. The pile is constantly on the
                    increase, as, according to the custom of the country, every passenger, as he
                    travels onwards, adds a stone to the heap, and offers up a prayer for the repose
                    of the souls of the deceased. The abbey of Dunbrody, situate near the confluence
                    of the Suir and Barrow or Ross river, still exhibits the remains of one of the
                    finest monastic buildings in Ireland. Tintern Abbey, called also “De Voto,” was
                    built by William Marshal, near the Bannow, on the spot where he landed after a
                    storm, in performance of a vow made by him while in peril. On the head of
                    Bagenbon, at the mouth of the same river, are the vestiges of a strong earthen
                    intrenchment called Strongbow’s Camp; but it was more probably that of
                    Fitzstephen and his followers on their first landing. Ferns Castle, built by
                    Strongbow, continued to be looked upon as a place of great military importance
                    to the time of Cromwell’s campaigns, and as such was also occupied during the
                    insurrection of 1798. Enniscorthy Castle, built by Raymond le Gros at the same
                    period with the former, was also a place of strength in the time of Cromwell,
                    and in 1798 was used as a prison by the insurgents while in possession of the
                    town. Buttermilk Castle, or Cuislan-na-Blahie, consists of two small dark towers
                    at the foot of a steep hill near Dunbrody; it was used as a toll-house for the
                    adjoining pass across the river, and as a place to receive and cure the fish due
                    to the monks. Duncannon Fort was erected during the alarm of the threatenetl
                    invasion of the Spanish Armada in the reign of Elizabeth. It is still kept up as
                    a military position, having a bomb-proof magazine, and arrangements for mounting
                    forty-two guns, with suitable accommodations for a garrison.</p>
                <p part="N">Wexford, the county-town, is situate on the southern side of the mouth
                    of the Slaney, where it falls into Wexford haven. It was founded by the Danes,
                    and after having been taken by the English on their first landing in Ireland,
                    became a place of some importance. It obtained a charter in 1318, which was
                    confirmed and enlarged by James I. in 1608. A parliament was held in it by the
                    earl of Desmond in 1463. At the breaking out of the war of 1641, it took part
                    with the Irish, and continued in their possession till taken in 1649 by
                    Cromwell, either by force or treachery, when the inhabitants, like those of
                    Drogheda, were subjected to military execution. In the war of 1688 it declared
                    for King William, and in the insurrection of 1798 was seized and occupied by the
                    insurgents until their main body was utterly defeated at Vinegar Hill near
                    Enniscorthy. The town still retains many vestiges of antiquity. The streets are
                    narrow and winding. It is connected with the northern part of the county by a
                    wooden bridge, 1570 feet long, thrown across the Slaney, on which a toll is
                    payable for maintaining it, under the superintendence of a board of
                    commissioners. A broad quay proceeds from the bridge along the border of the
                    haven for upwards of half a mile, which, with the haven itself, is under the
                    management of a board called the quay commissioners. The corporate jurisdiction
                    of the town under the charter of James is vested in a mayor, burgesses, and
                    commons. The mayor holds a court of record for pleas to any amount, and there is
                    also a court of conscience for debts under 40s. The county court-house, prison,
                    house of correction, infirmary, and fever-hospital are in the town. There is
                    also a small lunatic asylum, subsidiary to the district asylum for the county,
                    which is at Carlow. The borough exercised a prescriptive right of returning two
                    members to the Irish parliament, which number was reduced to one at the union,
                    and still continues so. The number of electors in 1839 was 350. By the municipal
                    corporation act for Ireland the corporation has been dissolved, and power is
                    granted to form a new corporate body, according to conditions expressed in the
                    act, under the name of “the mayor, bailifs, free burgesses, and commonalty of
                    the town or borough of Wexford.” By the same act the corporations of Gorey and
                    New-Ross have also been dissolved, and provision made for their reconstruction,
                    as in the case of Wexford; the former to be styled “the sovereign, bailifs, and
                    free commonalty of the borough and town of Newborough the latter “the sovereign
                    and burgesses of New-Ross.” Eight fairs are held during the year. The town is
                    the principal place of export for the county. Together with the suburbs, it
                    forms an ecclesiastical union, consisting of eleven parishes, in which there are
                    two churches. There are also several Roman Catholic chapels, some of which
                    belong to monastic institutions. The population was, in 1821, 8326; in 1831,
                    10,673; and in 1834, 14,670. Of the last-named number, the members of the
                    established church were 2031, the Protestant dissenters 28, and the Roman
