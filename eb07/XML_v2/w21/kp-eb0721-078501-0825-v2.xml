                    conducting water in aqueducts or in pipes for the supply of domestic consumption

                    supplies necessary for these purposes, by means of pumps, water or fire engines.
                    It also comprehends the subsequent management of the water thus conducted,
                    whether in order to make the proper distribution of it according to the demand,
                    or to employ it for the purpose of navigation, by lockage, or other
                    contrivances. And in the prosecution of these things many subordinate problems
                    will occur, in which practice will derive great advantages from a scientific
                    acquaintance with the subject The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> class of
                    water-works is of much greater variety, comprehending almost every kind of
                    hydraulic machine; and would of itself fill volumes. Many of these have already
                    occurred in various articles of this work, particularly in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Hydrodynamics,</hi> part iii.— <hi rend="italic">On Hydraulic
                        Machinery.</hi> In describing or treating them, we have tacitly referred the
                    discussion of their general principles, in which they all resemble each other,
                    to some article where they could be taken in a connected body, susceptible of
                    general scientific discussion, independent of the circumstances which of
                    necessity introduced the particular modifications required by the uses to which
                    the structures were to be applied. That part of the present article, therefore,
                    which embraces these common principles, will chiefly relate to the theory of
                    water-mills, or rather of water-wheels; because, when the necessary motion is
                    given to the axis of the water-wheel, this may be set to the performance of any
                    task whatever.</p>

                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of the conducting of Water.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">This is undoubtedly a business of great importance, and forms a
                    principal part of the practice of the civil engineer: it is also a business so
                    imperfectly understood, that we believe that very few engineers can venture to
                    say, with tolerable precision, what will be the quantity of water which his work
                    will convey, or what plan and dimensions of conduit will convey the quantity
                    which may be proposed.</p>
                <p part="N">In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">RIver</hi> we have given a sort of
                    history of the progress of our knowledge in hydraulics, a branch of mechanical
                    philosophy which seems to have been entirely unknown to the ancients. Even
                    Archimedes, the author of almost all we know in hydrostatics, seems to have been
                    entirely ignorant of any principle by which he could determine the motion of
                    water. The mechanical science of the ancients seems to have reached no farther
                    than the doctrine of equilibrium among bodies at rest. Guglielmini first
                    ventured to consider the motion of water in open canals and in rivers. Its
                    motion in pipes had been partially considered in detached portions by others,
                    but not so as to make a body of doctrine. Sir Isaac Newton first endeavoured to
                    render hydraulics susceptible of mathematical demonstration: but his fundamental
                    proposition has not yet been freed from very serious objections; nor have the
                    attempts of his successors, such as the Bernoullis, Euler, D’Alembert, and
                    others, been much more successful: so that hydraulics may still be considered as
                    very imperfect, and the general conclusions which we are accustomed to receive
                    as fundamental propositions are not much better than matters of observation,
                    little supported by principle, and therefore requiring the most scrupulous
                    caution in the application of them to any hitherto untried case. When
                    experiments are multiplied so as to include as great a variety of cases as
                    possible, and when these are cleared of extraneous circumstances, and properly
                    arranged, we must receive the conclusions drawn from them as the general laws of
                    hydraulics. The experiments of the Abbé Bossut, narrated in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Hydrodynamique,</hi> are of the greatest value, having been
                    made in the cases of most general frequency, and with great care. The greatest
                    service, however, has been done by the Chevalier du Buat, who saw the folly of
                    attempting to deduce an accurate theory from any principles that we have as yet
                    learned, and the necessity of adhering to such a theory as could be deduced from
                    experiment alone, independent of any more general principles. Such a theory must
                    be a just one, if the experiments are really general, unaffected by the
                    particular circumstances of the case, and if the classes of experiment are
                    sufficiently comprehensive to include all the cases which occur in the most
                    important practical questions. Some principle was however necessary for
                    connecting these experiments. The sufficiency of this principle was not easily
                    ascertained. Du Buat’s way of establishing it was judicious. If the principle is
                    ill-founded, the results of its combination in cases of actual experiments must
                    be irregular; but if experiments, seemingly very unlike, and in a vast variety
                    of dissimilar cases, give a train of results which is extremely regular and
                    consistent, we may presume that the principle, which in this manner harmonizes
                    and reconciles things so unlike, is founded on the nature of things; and if this
                    principle be such as is agreeable to our clearest notions of the internal
                    mechanism of the motions of fluids, our presumption approaches to
                    conviction.</p>
                <p part="N">Proceeding in this way, the Chevalier du Buat has collected a prodigious
                    number of facts, comprehending almost every case of the motion of fluids. He
                    first classed them according to their resemblance in some one particular, and
                    observed the differences which accompanied their differences in other
                    circumstances; and by considering what could produce these differences, he
                    obtained general rules, deduced from fact, by which these differences could be
                    made to fall into a regular series. He then arranged all the experiments under
                    some other circumstances of resemblance, and pursued the same method; and by
                    following this out, he has produced a general proposition, which applies to the
                    whole of this numerous list of experiments with a precision far exceeding our
                    utmost hopes.</p>
                <p part="N">We must however observe, that of this list of experiments there is a
                    very large class which is not direct, but requires a good deal of reflection to
                    enable us to draw a confident conclusion; and this is in cases which are very
                    frequent and important, viz. where the declivity is exceedingly small, as in
                    open canals and rivers. The experiments were of the following forms. Two large
                    cisterns were <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=826"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0826-0786"/> made to communicate with each other by means
                    of a pipe. The surfaces of the water in these cisterns were made to differ only
                    by a small fraction of an inch; and it is supposed that the motion in the
                    communicating pipe will be the same as in a very long pipe, or an open canal,
                    having this very minute declivity. We have no difficulty in admitting the
                    conclusion; but we have seen it contested, and it is by no means intuitive. We
                    had entertained hopes that this important case would have been determined by
                    direct experiments, which the writer of this article was commissioned to make by
                    the Board for Encouraging Improvements and Manufactures in Scotland; but the
                    infirm state of his health was always an effectual bar to the accomplishment of
                    this desirable object. This however need not occasion any hesitation in the
                    adoption of the Chevalier du Buat’s general proposition, because the experiments
                    which we are now criticising fall in precisely with the general train of the
                    rest, and show no <hi rend="italic">general,</hi> deviation which would indicate
                    a fallacy in principle.</p>
                <p part="N">We apprehend it to be quite unnecessary to add much to what has been
                    already delivered on the motion of waters in an open canal. Their <hi

                <p part="N">This velocity is considerably smaller than what was observed by Mr Watt.
                    And indeed we observe, that in the very small declivities of rivers and canals,
                    the formula is a little different. We have made several comparisons with a
                    formula which is essentially the same with Du Buat’s, and comes nearer in these
                    cases. Instead of taking the hyperbolic logarithm of <hi rend="italic">√s</hi>
                    +16, multiply its common logarithm by 2¼, or multiply it by 9, and divide the
                    product by 4; and this process is vastly easier than taking the hyperbolic
                    logarithm.</p>
                <p part="N">We have not however presumed to calculate tables on the authority of our
                    own observations, thinking too respectfully of this gentleman’s labours and
                    observations. But this subject will ere long be fully established on a series of
                    observations on canals of various dimensions and declivities, made by several
                    eminent engineers during the execution of them. Fortunately the Chevalier du
                    Buat’s formula is chiefly founded on observations on small canals; and is
                    therefore most accurate in works where it is most necessary, viz. in
                    mill-courses, and other derivations for working machinery.</p>
                <p part="N">We now proceed to take notice of a few circumstances which deserve
                    attention, in the construction of canals, in addition to those delivered in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">River.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">When a canal or aqueduct is brought off from a basin or larger stream,
                    it ought always to be widened at the entry, if it is intended for drawing off a
                    continued stream of water; for such a canal has a slope, without which it can
                    have no current. Suppose it filled to a dead level to the farther end: take away
                    the bar, and the water immediately begins to flow off at that end; but it is
                    some time before any motion is perceived at the head of the canal, during all
                    which time the motion of the water is augmenting in every part of the canal;
                    consequently the slope is increasing in every part, this being the sole cause of
                    its stream. When the water at the entry <hi rend="italic">begins</hi> to move,
                    the slope is scarcely sensible there; but it sensibly steepens every moment with
                    the increase of velocity, which at last attains its maximum relative to the
                    slope and dimensions of the whole canal; and this regulates the depth of water
                    in every point down the stream. When all has attained a state of permanency, the
                    slope at the entry <hi rend="italic">remains</hi> much greater than in any other
                    part of the canal; for this slope must be such as will produce a velocity
                    sufficient for supplying its <hi rend="smallcaps">train.</hi> And it must be
                    remembered, that the velocity which must be produced greatly exceeds the mean
                    velocity corresponding to the train of the canal. Suppose that this is
                    twenty-five inches: there must be a velocity of thirty inches at the surface, as
                    appears by the table in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">River,</hi> p. 273.
                    This must be produced by a real fall at the entry.</p>
                <p part="N">In every other part the slope is sufficient if it merely serves to give
                    the water (already in motion) force enough for overcoming the friction and other
                    resistances. But at the entry the water is stagnant if in a basin, or it is
                    moving past laterally if the aqueduct is derived from a river; and having no
                    velocity whatever in the direction of the canal, it must derive it from its
                    slope. The water therefore which has acquired a permanent form in such an
                    aqueduct, must necessarily take that form which exactly performs the offices
                    requisite in its different portions. The surface remains horizontal in the
                    basin, as KC (fig. 1), till it comes near the entry of the canal AB, and there
                    it acquires the <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=829"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0829-0789"/>form of an undulated curve CDE, and then the
                    surface acquires an uniform slope EF, in the lower part of the canal, where the
                    water is in train. If this is a drain, the discharge is much less than might be
                    produced by the same bed if this sudden slope could be avoided. If it is to be
                    navigated, having only a very gentle slope in its whole length, this sudden
                    slope is a very great imperfection, both by diminishing the depth of water which
                    might otherwise be obtained along the canal, and by rendering the passage of
                    boats into the basin very difficult, and the coming out very hazardous.</p>
                <p part="N">All this may be avoided, and the velocity at the entry may be kept equal
                    to that which forms the train of the canal, by the simple process of enlarging
                    the entry. Suppose that the water could accelerate along the slopes of the
                    canal, as a heavy body would do on a finely polished plane. If we now make the
                    width of the entry in its different parts inversely proportional to the
                    fictitious velocities in those parts, it is plain that the slope of the surface
                    will be made parallel to that of the canal which is in train. This will require
                    a form somewhat like a bell or speaking trumpet, as may easily be shown by a
                    mathematical discussion. It would however be so much evasated at the basin as to
                    occupy much room, and it would be very expensive to make such an excavation; but
                    we may, at a very moderate expense of money and room, make the increase of
                    velocity at the entry almost insensible. This should always be done, and it is
                    not all expense; for if it be not done, the water will undermine the banks on
                    each side, because it is moving very swiftly, and will make an excavation for
                    itself, leaving all the mud in the canal below. We may observe this enlargement
                    at the entry of all natural derivations from a basin or lake. It is a very
                    instructive experiment to fill up this enlargement, continuing the parallel
                    sides of the drain quite to the side of the lake. We shall immediately observe
                    the water grow shallower in the drain, and its performance will diminish.
                    Supposing the ditch carried on with parallel sides quite to the side of the
                    basin, if we build two walls or dikes from the extremities of those sides,
                    bending outwards with a proper curvature (and this will often be less costly
                    than widening the drain), the discharge will be greatly increased. We have seen
                    instances where it was nearly doubled.</p>
                <p part="N">The enlargement at the mouths of rivers is generally owing to the same
                    cause. The tide of flood up the river produces a superficial slope opposite to
                    that of the river, and this widens the mouth. This is most remarkable when the
                    tides are high, and the river has little slope.</p>
                <p part="N">After this great fall at the entry of the canal, in which all the
                    filaments are much accelerated, and the inferior ones most of all, things take a
                    contrary turn. The water, by rubbing on the bottom and the sides, is retarded;
                    and therefore the section must, from being shallow, become a little deeper, and
                    the surface will be convex for some distance, till all comes into train. When
                    this is established, the filaments nearest the bottom and side are moving
                    slowest, and the surface, in the middle especially, retains the greatest
                    velocity, gliding over the rest. The velocity in the canal, and the depth of the
                    section, adjust themselves in such a manner that the difference between the
                    surface of the basin and the surface of the uniform section of the canal
                    corresponds exactly to the velocity. Thus, if this be observed to be two feet in
                    a second, the difference of height will be <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 16</hi> ths of an inch.</p>
                <p part="N">All the practical questions that are of considerable importance
                    respecting the motion of water in aqueducts, may be easily, though not
                    elegantly, solved by means of the tables.</p>
                <p part="N">But it is to be remembered, that these tables relate only to uniform
                    motion, that is, to water that is in train, and where the velocity suffers no
                    change by lengthening the conduit, provided the slope remain the same. It is
                    much more difficult to determine what will be the velocity, <hi rend="italic"
                        >&amp;c.</hi> in a canal of which nothing is given but the form, and slope,
                    and depth of the entry, without saying how deep the water runs in it. And it is
                    here that the common doctrines of hydraulics are most in fault, and unable to
                    teach us how deep the water will run in a canal, though the depth of the basin
                    at the entry be perfectly known. Between the part of the canal which is in train
                    and the basin, there is an interval where the water is in a state of
                    acceleration, and is afterwards retarded.</p>
                <p part="N">The determination of the motions in this interval is exceedingly
                    difficult, even in a rectangular canal. It was one great aim of Du Buat’s
                    experiments to ascertain this by measuring accurately the depth of the water.
                    But he found that when the slope was but a very few inches in the whole length
                    of his canal, it was not in train for want of greater length; and when the slope
                    was still less, the small fractions of an inch, by which he was to judge of the
                    variations of depth, could not be measured with sufficient accuracy. It would be
                    a most desirable point to determine the length of a canal, whose slope and other
                    dimensions are given, which will bring it into train; and what is the ratio
                    which will then obtain between the depth at the entry, and the depth which will
                    be maintained. Till this be done, the engineer cannot ascertain by a direct
                    process what quantity of water will be drawn off from a reservoir by a given
                    canal. But as yet this is out of our reach. Experiments however are in view
                    which will promote the investigation.</p>
                <p part="N">But this and similar questions are of such importance that we cannot be
                    said to have improved hydraulics unless we can give a tolerably precise answer.
                    This we can do by a sort of retrograde process, proceeding on the principles of
                    uniform motion established by the Chevalier du Buat. We may suppose a train
                    maintained in the canal, and then examine whether this train <hi rend="italic"
                        >can</hi> be produced by any fall that is possible at the entry. If it can,
                    we may be certain that it is so produced, and our problem is solved.</p>
                <p part="N">We shall now point out the methods of answering some chief questions of

                <p part="N">The chief difficulty is to find the depth of the stream where it is in

                    it, we may begin by taking for our depth of stream a quantity A, somewhat
                    smaller than H the height of the surface of the basin above the bottom of the
                    canal. With this depth, and the known width <hi rend="italic">w</hi> of the

                    corrected by increasing the fall producing the velocity, in the proportion of
                    the first hydraulic mean depth to the mean depth corresponding to the new
                    dimensions found for the canal. It will now become 1∙53, and V will be 32∙72,
                    and the depth will be 16∙47. The quantity discharged being divided by V, will
                    give the section = 7∙335 feet, from which, and the new depth, we obtain 5·344
                    for the width.</p>
                <p part="N">This and the foregoing are the most common questions proposed to an
                    engineer. We asserted with some confidence that few of the profession are able
                    to answer them with tolerable precision. We cannot offend the professional
                    gentlemen by this, when we inform them that the Academy of Sciences at Paris
                    were occupied during several months with an examination of a plan proposed by M.
                    de Parcieux, for bringing the waters of the Yvette into Paris, and after the
                    most mature consideration, gave in a report of the quantity of water which Μ. de
                    Parcieux’s aqueduct would yield; and that their report has been found erroneous
                    in the proportion of at least two to five; for the waters have been brought in,
                    and exceed the report in this proportion. Indeed, long after giving in the
                    report, M. Perronet, the most celebrated engineer in France, affirmed that the
                    dimensions proposed were much greater than were necessary, and said that an
                    aqueduct of five and a half feet wide and three and a half deep, with a slope of
                    fifteen inches in a thousand fathoms, would have a velocity of twelve or
                    thirteen inches per second, which would bring in all the water furnished by the
                    proposed sources. The great diminution of expense occasioned by the alteration
                    encouraged the community to undertake the work. It was accordingly begun, and a
                    part executed. The water was found to run with a velocity of near nineteen
                    inches when it was three and a half feet deep. M. Perronet founded his
                    computation on his own experience alone, acknowledging that he had no theory to
                    instruct him. The work was carried no farther, it being found that the city
                    could be supplied at a much smaller expense by steam-engines erected by Boulton
                    and Watt. But the facts which occurred in the partial execution of the aqueduct
                    are very valuable. If M. Perronet’s aqueduct be examined by our general formula,
                        <hi rend="italic">s</hi> will be found = and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> =
                    18·72, from which we deduce the velocity = 18 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> /

                    precision.</p>
                <p part="N">The experiments at Turin by Michelotti on canals were very numerous, but
                    complicated with many circumstances which would render the discussion too long
                    for this place. When cleared of these circumstances, which we have done with
                    scrupulous care, they are also abundantly conformable <pb break="no"

                    />to our theory of the uniform motion of running waters. But to return to our
                    subject.</p>
                <p part="N">Should it be required to bring off at once from the basin a mill-course
                    having a determined velocity for driving an undershot wheel, the problem becomes
                    easier, because the velocity and slope combined determine the hydraulic mean
                    depth at once; and the depth of the stream will be had by means of the height
                    which must be taken for the whole depth at the entry, in order to produce the
                    required velocity.</p>
                <p part="N">In like manner, having given the quantity to be discharged, and the
                    velocity and the depth at the entry, we can find the other dimensions of the
                    channel; and the mean depth being found, we can determine the slope.</p>
                <p part="N">When the slope of a canal is very small, so that the depth of the
                    uniform stream differs but a little from that at the entry, the quantity
                    discharged is but small. But a great velocity, requiring a great fall at the
                    entry, produces a great diminution of depth, and therefore it may not compensate
                    for this diminution, and the quantity discharged may be smaller. Improbable as
                    this may appear, it is not demonstrably false; and hence we see the propriety of
                    the following question.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Question</hi> 3. Given the depth H at the entry of a

                    these data the slope is easily had by the formula for uniform motion.</p>
                <p part="N">If the canal is of the trapezoidal form, the investigation is more
                    troublesome, and requires the resolution of a cubic equation.</p>
                <p part="N">It may appear strange that increasing the slope of a canal beyond the
                    quantity determined by this problem can diminish the quantity of water conveyed.
                    But one of these two things must happen; either the motion will not acquire
                    uniformity in such a canal for want of length, or the discharge must diminish.
                    Supposing, however, that it could augment, we can judge how far this can go. Let
                    us take the extreme case by making the canal vertical. In this case it becomes a
                    simple weir or waste-board. Now the discharge of a waste-board is ****§ √2 Gw
                    (∕i"—(A Λ)^)∙ The maximum determined by the preceding problem is to that of the
                    waste-board of the same dimensions as ***H√ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                    asH√⅜HtH√H-⅜H√⅜H = 5773: 6465, nearly = 9:10.</p>
                <p part="N">Having given the dimensions and slope of a canal, we can discover the
                    relation between its expenditure and the time: or we can tell how much it will
                    sink the surface of a pond in twenty-four hours, and the gradual progress of
                    this effect; and this might be made the subject of a particular problem, but it
                    is complicated and difficult. In cases where this is an interesting object, we
                    may solve the question with sufficient accuracy, by calculating the expenditure
                    at the beginning, supposing the basin kept full. Then, from the known area of
                    the pond, we can tell in what time this expenditure will sink an inch; do the
                    same on the supposition that the water is one third lower, and that it is two
                    thirds lower (noticing the contraction of the surface of the pond occasioned by
                    this abstraction of its waters). Thus we shall obtain three rates of diminution,
                    from which we can easily deduce the desired relation between the expenditure and
                    the time.</p>
                <p part="N">Aqueducts derived from a basin or river are commonly furnished with a
                    sluice at the entry. This changes exceedingly the state of things. The slope of
                    the canal may be precisely such as will maintain the mean velocity of the water
                    which passes under the sluice; in which case the depth of the stream is equal to
                    that of the sluice, and the velocity is produced at once by the head of water
                    above it. But if the slope is less than this, the velocity of the issuing water
                    is diminished, and the water must rise in the canal. This must check the efflux
                    at the sluice, and the water will be as it were stagnant above what comes
                    through below it It is extremely difficult to determine at what precise slope
                    the water will begin to check the efflux. The contraction at the lower edge of
                    the board hinders the water from attaining at once the whole depth which it
                    acquires afterwards, when its velocity diminishes by the obstructions. While the
                    regorging which these obstructions occasion does not reach back to the sluice,
                    the efflux is not affected by it. Even when it does reach to the sluice, there
                    will be a less depth immediately behind it than farther down the canal, where it
                    is in train; because the swift moving water which is next the bottom drags with
                    it the regorged water which lies on it: but the canal must be rapid to make this
                    difference of depth sensible. In ordinary canals, with moderate slopes and
                    velocities, the velocity at the sluice may be safely taken as if it were that
                    which corresponds to the difference of depths above and below the sluice, where
                    both were in train.</p>

                    circumstanced as it is, namely, subjected to contraction. This may be regulated
                    by a proper form given to the entry into this orifice. The contraction may be
                    almost annihilated by making the masonry of a cycloidal form on both sides, and
                    also at the lower edge of the sluice-board, so as to give the orifice a form

                <p part="N">The performance of aqueduct drains is a very important object, and
                    merits our attention in this place. While the art of managing waters, and of
                    conducting them so as to answer our demands, renders us very important service,
                    by embellishing our habitations, or promoting our commercial intercourse, the
                    art of draining creates as it were new riches, fertilizing tracts of bog or
                    marsh, which were not only useless, but hurtful by their unwholesome
                    exhalations, and converting them into rich pastures and gay meadows. A wild
                    country, occupied by marshes which are inaccessible to herds or flocks, and
                    serve only for the haunts of water-fowls, or the retreat of a few poor
                    fishermen, when • once it is freed from the waters in which it is drowned, opens
                    its lap to receive the most precious seeds, is soon clothed in the richest garb,
                    gives life and abundance to numerous herds, and never fails to become the
                    delight of the industrious cultivator who has enfranchised it, and is attached
                    to it by the labour which it cost him. In return, it procures him abundance, and
                    supplies him with the means of daily augmenting its fertility. No species of
                    agriculture exhibits such long-continued and progressive improvement. New
                    families flock to the spot, and there multiply; and there nature seems the more
                    eager to repay their labours, in proportion as she has been obliged, against her
                    will, to keep her treasures locked up for a longer time, chilled by the waters.
                    The countries newly inhabited by the human race, as is a great part of America,
                    especially to the southward, are still covered to a great extent with marshes
                    and lakes; and they would long remain in this condition, if population, daily
                    making new advances, did not increase industry, by multiplying the cultivating
                    hands, at the same time that it increases their wants. The Author of this
                    beautiful world has at the beginning formed the great masses of mountain, has
                    scooped out the dales and sloping hills, has traced out the courses, and even
                    formed the beds, of the rivers; but he has left to man the care of making his
                    place of abode, and the field which must feed him, dry and comfortable. For this
                    task is not beyond his powers, as the others are. Nay, by having this given to
                    him in charge, he is richly repaid for his labour by the very state in which he
                    finds those countries into which he penetrates for the first time. Being covered
                    with lakes and forests, the juices of the soil are kept for him as it were in
                    reserve. The air, the burning heat of the sun, and the continual washing of
                    rains, would have combined to expend and dissipate their vegetative powers, had
                    the fields been exposed in the same degree to their action as the inhabited and
                    cultivated countries, the most fertile moulds of which are long since lodged in
                    the bottom of the ocean. All this would have been completely lost through the
                    whole extent of South America, had it not been protected by the forests which
                    man must cut down, by the rank herbage which he must burn, and by the marsh and
                    bog which he must destroy by draining. Let not ungrateful man complain of this.
                    It is his duty to take on himself the task of opening up treasures, preserved on
                    purpose for him with so much judgment and care. If he has discernment and
                    sensibility, he will even thank the Author of all good, who has thus husbanded
                    them for his use. He will co-operate with his beneficent views, and will be
                    careful not to proceed by wantonly snatching at present any partial good, and by
                    picking out what is most easily procured, regardless of him who is to come
                    afterwards to uncover and extract the remaining riches of the ground. A wise
                    administration of such a country will think it their duty to leave a just share
                    of this inheritance to their descendants, who are entitled to expect it as the
                    last legatees. National plans of cultivation should be formed on this principle,
                    that the steps taken by the present cultivators for realizing part of the riches
                    of the infant country shall not obstruct the works which will afterwards be
                    necessary for obtaining the remainder. This is carefully attended to in Holland
                    and in China. No man is allowed to conduct the drains, by which he recovers a
                    piece of marsh, in such a way as to render it much more difficult for a
                    neighbour, or even for his own successor, to drain another piece, although it
                    may at present be quite inaccessible. There remain in the middle of the most
                    cultivated countries many marshes, which industry has not yet attempted to
                    drain, and where the legislature has not been at pains to prevent many little
                    abuses which have produced elevations in the beds of rivers, and rendered the
                    complete draining of some spots impossible. Administration should attend to such
                    things, because their consequences are great. The sciences and arts, by which
                    alone these difficult and costly jobs can be performed, should be protected,
                    encouraged, and cherished. It is only from science that we can obtain principles
                    to direct these arts. The problem of draining canals is one of the most
                    important, and yet has hardly ever occupied the attention of the hydraulic
                    speculatist. We apprehend that the Chevalier du Buat’s theory will throw great
                    light on it; and regret that the very limited condition of our present work will
                    hardly afford room for a slight sketch of what may be done on the subject. We
                    shall, however, attempt it by a general problem, which will involve most of the
                    chief circumstances which occur in works of that kind.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Quest.</hi> 6. Let the hollow ground A (fig. 2) be
                    inundated by rains or springs, and have no outlet but the canal AB, by which it
                    discharges its water into the neighbouring river BCDE, and let its surface be
                    nearly on a level with that of the river at B. It can only drain when the river
                    sinke in the droughts of summer; and even if it could then drain completely, the
                        <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=833"

                    neighbour. It may be proposed to drain it by one or more canals, and it is
                    required to determine their lengths and other dimensions, so as to produce the
                    best effects. It is evident that there are many circumstances to determine the
                    choice, and many conditions to be attended to.</p>
                <p part="N">If the canals AC, AD, AE, are respectively equal to the proportions BC,
                    BD, BE, of the river, and have the same slopes, they will have the same
                    discharge; but they are not for this reason equivalent. The long canal AE may
                    drain the marsh completely, while the short one AC will only do it in part;
                    because the difference of level between A and C is but inconsiderable. Also the
                    freshes of the river may totally obstruct the operation of AC, while the canal
                    AE cannot be hurt by them, E being so much lower than C. Therefore the canal
                    must be carried so far down the river, that no freshes there shall ever raise
                    the waters in the canal so high as to reduce the slope in the upper part of it
                    to such a level that the current shall not be sufficient to carry off the
                    ordinary produce of water in the marsh.</p>
                <p part="N">Still the problem is indeterminate, admitting many solutions. This
                    requisite discharge may be accomplished by a short but wide canal, or by a
                    longer and narrower. Let us first see what solution can be made, so as to
                    accomplish our purpose in the most economical manner, that is, by means of the
                    smallest equation. We shall give the solution in the form of an example.</p>
                <p part="N">Suppose that the daily produce of rains and springs raises the water 1½
                    inch on an area of a square league, which gives about 120,000 cubic fathoms of
                    water. Let the bottom of the basin be three feet below the surface of the
                    freshes in the river at B in winter. Let the slope of the river be two inches in
                    100 fathoms, or <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    1600</hi>, and the canal six feet deep.</p>
                <p part="N">The canal being supposed nearly parallel to the river, it must be at
                    least 1800 fathoms long before it can be admitted into the river, otherwise the
                    bottom of the bog will be lower than the mouth of the canal; and even then a
                    hundred or two more fathoms added to this will give it so little slope, that an
                    immense breadth will be necessary to make the discharge with so small a
                    velocity. On the other hand, if the slope of the canal be made equal to that of
                    the river, an extravagant length will be necessary before its admission into the
                    river, and many obstacles may then intervene; and even then it must have a
                    breadth of thirteen feet, as may easily be calculated by the general hydraulic
                    theorem. By receding from each of these extremes, we shall diminish the expense
                    of excavation. Therefore,</p>

                    river, opposite to the basin, D the discharge in a second, and - the slope of

                    the velocities are very nearly in the subduplicate ratio of the slopes.</p>
                <p part="N">To introduce these data into the equation, recollect that ******D <hi

                <p part="N">We have considered this important problem in its most simple state. If
                    the basin is far from the river, so that the drains are not nearly parallel to
                    it, and therefore have less slope attainable in their course, it is more
                    difficult. Perhaps the best method is to try two very extreme cases and a middle
                    one, and then a fourth, nearer to that extreme which differs least from the
                    middle one in the quantity of excavation. This will point out on which side the
                    minimum of <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=834"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0834-0794"/> excavation lies, and also the law by which it
                    diminishes and afterwards increases. Then draw a line, on which set off from one
                    end the lengths of the canals. At each length erect an ordinate representing the
                    excavation, and draw a regular curve through the extremities of the ordinates.
                    From that point of the curve which is nearest to the base line, draw another
                    ordinate to the base. This will point out the best length of the canal with
                    sufficient accuracy. The length will determine the slope, and this will give the
                    width, by means of the general theorem. These draining canals must always come
                    off from the basin with evasated entries. This will prevent the loss of much
                    fall at the entry.</p>
                <p part="N">Two canals may sometimes be necessary. In this case expense may
                    frequently be saved, by making one canal flow into the other. This however must
                    be at such a distance from the basin, that the swell produced in the other by
                    this addition may not reach back to the immediate neighbourhood of the basin,
                    otherwise it would impede the performance of both. For this purpose, recourse
                    must be had to Problem III. p. 283, of the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >River</hi>. We must here observe, that in this respect canals differ
                    exceedingly from rivers: rivers enlarge their beds, so as always to convey every
                    increase of waters; but a canal may be gorged through its whole length, and will
                    then greatly diminish its discharge. In order that the lower extremity of a
                    canal may convey the waters of an equal canal admitted into it, their junction
                    must be so far from the basin that the swell occasioned by raising its waters
                    nearly ½ more (viz. in the subduplicate ratio of I to 2) may not reach back to
                    the basin.</p>
                <p part="N">This observation points out another method of economy. Instead of one
                    wide canal, we may make a narrower one of the whole length, and another narrow
                    one reaching part of the way, and communicating with the long canal at a proper
                    distance from the basin. But the lower extremity will now be too shallow to
                    convey the waters of both, therefore raise its banks by using the earth taken
                    from its bed, which must at any rate be disposed of. Thus the waters will be
                    conveyed, and the expense, even of the lower part of the long canal, will
                    scarcely be increased.</p>
                <p part="N">These observations must suffice for an account of the management of open
                    canals; and we proceed to the consideration of the conduct of water in
                    pipes.</p>
                <p part="N">This is much more simple and regular, and the general theorem requires
                    very trifling modifications for adapting it to the cases or questions that occur

                    that two pipes having the same length and the same slope give quantities of

                <p part="N">It may be observed that the height assumed for determining the slope in
                    these two questions, will seldom differ more than an inch or two from the whole
                    height of the reservoir above the place of delivery; for in conduits of a few
                    hundred feet long, the velocity seldom exceeds four feet per second, which
                    requires only a head of three inches.</p>
                <p part="N">As no inconvenience worth minding results from making the pipes a tenth
                    of an inch or so wider than is barely sufficient, and as this generally is more
                    than the error arising from even a very erroneous assumption of <hi

                    two tenths of an inch, and then we may be confident that our conduit will draw
                    off the intended quantity of water.</p>
                <p part="N">We presume that every person who assumes the name of engineer knows how
                    to reduce the quantity of water measured in gallons, pints, or other
                    denominations, to cubic inches, and can calculate the gallons, &amp;c. furnished
                    by a pipe of known diameter, moving with a velocity that is measured in inches
                    per second. We further suppose that all care is taken in the construction of the
                    conduit, to avoid obstructions occasioned by lumps of solder hanging in the
                    inside of the pipes; and particularly that all the cocks and plugs by the way
                    have waterways equal to the section of the pipe. Undertakers are most tempted to
                    fail here, by making the cocks too small, because large cocks are very costly;
                    but the employer should be scrupulously attentive to this, because a simple
                    contraction of this kind may be the throwing away of many hundred pounds in a
                    wide pipe, which yields no more water than can pass through the small cock.</p>
                <p part="N">The chief obstructions arise from the deposition of sand or mud in the
                    lower parts of pipes, or the collection of air in the upper parts of their
                    bendings. The velocity being always very moderate, such depositions of heavy
                    matters are unavoidable. The utmost care should therefore be taken to have the
                    water freed from all such things at its entry by proper filtration; and there
                    ought to be cleansing plugs at the lower parts of the bendings, or rather a very
                    little way beyond them. When these are opened, the water issues with greater
                    velocity, and carries the depositions with it.</p>
                <p part="N">It is much more difficult to get rid of the air which chokes the pipes
                    by lodging in their upper parts. The air is sometimes taken in along with the
                    water at the reservoir, when the entry of the pipe is too near the surface. This
                    should be carefully avoided, and it costs no trouble to do so. If the entry of
                    the pipe is two feet under the surface, no air can ever get in. Floats should be
                    placed above the entries, having lids hanging from them, which will shut the
                    pipe before the water runs too low.</p>
                <p part="N">But air is also disengaged from spring-water by merely passing along the
                    pipe. When pipes are supplied by an engine, air is very often drawn in by the
                    pumps in a disengaged state. It is also disengaged from its state of chemical
                    union when the pumps have a suction-pipe of ten or twelve feet, which is very
                    common. In whatever way it is introduced, it collects in all the upper parts of
                    bendings, and chokes the passage, so that sometimes not a drop of water is
                    delivered. Our cocks should be placed there, which should be opened frequently
                    by persons who have this in charge. Desaguliers describes a contrivance to be
                    placed on all such eminences, which does this of itself. It is a pipe with a
                    cock, terminating in a small cistern. The key of the cock has a hollow ball of
                    copper at the end of a lever. When there is no air in the main pipe, water comes
                    out by this discharger, fills the cistern, raises the ball, and thus shuts the
                    cock. But when the bend of the main contains air, it rises into the cistern, and
                    occupies the upper part of it. Thus the floating ball falls down, the cock opens
                    and lets out the air, and the cistern again filling with water, the ball rises,
                    and the cock is again shut.</p>
                <p part="N">A very neat contrivance for this purpose was invented by the late
                    Professor Russell of Edinburgh. The cylindrical pipe BCDE (fig. 3), at the upper
                    end of a bending of the main, is screwed on, the upper end of which is a flat
                    plate perforated with a small hole F. This pipe contains a hollow copper
                    cylinder G, to the upper part of which is fastened a piece of soft leather H.
                    When there is air in the pipe, it comes out by the hole A, and occupies the
                    discharger, and then escapes through the hole F. The water follows, and, rising
                    in the discharger, lifts up the hollow cylinder G, causing the leather H to
                    apply itself to the plate CD, and shut the hole. Thus the air is discharged
                    without the smallest loss of water.</p>
                <p part="N">It is of the most material consequence that there be no contraction in
                    any part of a conduit. This is evident; but it is also prudent to avoid all
                    unnecessary enlargements. For when the conduit is full of water moving along it,
                    the velocity in every section is inversely proportional to the area of the
                    section: it is therefore diminished wherever the pipe is enlarged; but it must
                    again be increased where the pipe contracts. This cannot be without expending
                    force in the acceleration, which consumes part of the impelling power, whether
                    this be a head of water, or the force of an engine. See what is said on this
                    subject in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pump.</hi> Nothing is gained by any
                    enlargement; and every contraction, by requiring an augmentation of velocity,
                    employs a part of the impelling force precisely equal to the weight of a column
                    of water whose base is the contracted passage, and whose height is the fall
                    which would produce a velocity equal to this augmentation. This point seems to
                    have been quite overlooked by engineers of the first eminence, and has in many
                    instances greatly diminished the performance of their best works. It is no less
                    detrimental in open canals, because at every contraction a small fall is
                    required for restoring the velocity lost in the enlargement of the canal, by
                    which the general slope and velocity are diminished. Another point which must be
                    attended to in the conducting of water is, that the motion should not be
                    subsultory, but continuous. When the water is to be driven along a main by the
                    strokes of a reciprocating engine, it should be forced into an air-box, the
                    spring of which may preserve it in motion along the whole subsequent main. If
                    the water is brought to rest at every successive stroke of the piston, the whole
                    mass must again be put in motion through the whole length of the main. This
                    requires the same useless expenditure of power as to communicate this motion to
                    as much dead matter; and this is over and above the force which may be necessary
                    for raising the water to a certain height, which is the only circumstance that
                    enters into the calculation of the power of the pump-engine.</p>
                <p part="N">An air-box removes this imperfection, because it keeps up the motion
                    during the returning stroke of the piston. The compression of the air by the
                    active stroke of the piston must be such as to continue the impulse in
                    opposition to the contrary pressure of the water (if it is to be raised to some
                    height), and in opposition to the friction or other resistances which arise from
                    the motion that the water really acquires. Indeed a very considerable force is
                    also employed here in changing the motion of the water, which is forced out of
                    the capacious air-box into the narrow pipe; and when this change of motion is
                    not judiciously managed, the expenditure of power may be as great as if all were
                    brought to rest and again put in motion. It may even be greater, by causing the
                    water to move in the opposite direction to its former motion. Of such
                    consequence is it to have all these circumstances scientifically considered. It

                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0836-0796"/>is in such particulars, unheeded by the
                    ordinary herd of engineers or pump-makers, that the superiority of an
                    intelligent practitioner is to be seen.</p>
                <p part="N">Another material point in the conduct of water in pipes is the
                    distribution of it to the different persons who have occasion for it. This is
                    rarely done from the rising main. It is usual to send the whole into a cistern,
                    from which it is afterwards conducted to different places in separate pipes.
                    Till the discovery of the general theorem by the Chevalier du Buat, this has
                    been done with great inaccuracy. Engineers think that the different purchasers
                    from waterworks receive in proportion to their respective bargains when they
                    give them pipes whose areas are proportional to these payments; but we now see
                    that when these pipes are of any considerable length, the waters of a larger
                    pipe run with a greater velocity than those of a smaller pipe having the same
                    slope. A pipe of two inches diameter will give much more water than four pipes
                    of one inch diameter; it will give as much as five and a half such pipes or
                    more; because the squares of the discharges are very nearly as the fifth powers
                    of the diameters. This point ought therefore to be carefully considered in the
                    bargains made with the proprietors of water-works, and the payments made in this
                    proportion. Perhaps the most unexceptionable method would be to make a double
                    distribution. Let the water be first let off in its proper proportions into a
                    second series of small cisterns, and let each have a pipe which will convey the
                    whole water that is discharged into it. The first distribution may be made
                    entirely by pipes of one inch in diameter; this would leave nothing to the
                    calculation of the distributor, for every man would pay in proportion to the
                    number of such pipes which runs into his own cistern.</p>
                <p part="N">In many cases, however, water is distributed by pipes derived from a
                    main; and here another circumstance comes into action. When water is passing
                    along a pipe, its pressure on the sides of the pipe is diminished by its
                    velocity; and if a pipe is now derived from it, the quantity drawn off is also
                    diminished in the subduplicate ratio of the pressures. If the pressure is
                    reduced to one fourth, one ninth, one sixteenth, &amp;c. the discharge from the
                    lateral pipe is reduced to one half, one third, one fourth, &amp;c. It is
                    therefore of great importance to determine what this diminution of pressure is
                    which arises from the motion along the main.</p>
                <p part="N">It is plain, that if the water suffered no resistance in the main, its
                    velocity would be that with which it entered, and it would pass along without
                    exerting any pressure. If the pipe were shut at the end, the pressure on the
                    sides would be the full pressure of the head of water. If the head of water
                    remain the same, and the end of the tube be contracted, but not stopped
                    entirely, the velocity in the pipe is diminished. If we would have the velocity
                    in the pipe with this contracted mouth augmented to what it was before the
                    contraction was made, we must employ the pressure of a piston, or of a head of
                    water. This is propagated through the fluid, and thus a pressure is immediately
                    excited on the sides of the pipe. New obstructions of any kind, arising from
                    friction or any other cause, produce a diminution of velocity in the pipe: but
                    when the natural velocity is checked, the particles re-act on what obstructs
                    their motion; and this action is uniformly propagated through a perfect fluid in
                    every direction. The resistance therefore which we thus ascribe to friction,
                    produces the same lateral pressure which a contraction of the orifice, which
                    equally diminishes the velocity in the pipe, would do. Indeed this is
                    demonstrable from any distinct notions that we can form of these obstructions.
                    They proceed from the want of perfect smoothness, which obliges the particles
                    next the sides to move in undulated lines. This excites transverse forces in the
                    same manner as any constrained curvilineal motion. A particle in its undulated
                    path tends to escape from it, and acts on the lateral particles in the same
                    manner that it would do if moving singly in a capillary tube having the same
                    undulations; it would press on the concave side of every such undulation. Thus a
                    pressure is exerted among the particles, which is propagated to the sides of the
                    pipe; or the diminution of velocity may arise from a viscidity or want of
                    perfect fluidity. This obliges the particle immediately pressed to drag along
                    with it another particle which is withheld by adhesion to the sides. This
                    requires additional pressure from a piston, or an additional head of water; and
                    this pressure also is propagated to the sides of the pipe.</p>
                <p part="N">Hence it should follow, that the pressure which water in motion exerts
                    on the sides of its conduit is equal to that which is competent to the head of
                    water which impels it into the pipe, diminished by the head of water competent
                    to the actual velocity with which it moves along the pipe. Let H represent the
                    head of water which impels it into the entry of the pipe, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >h</hi> the head which would produce the actual velocity; then H — <hi
                        rend="italic">h</hi> is the column which would produce the pressure exerted
                    on its sides.</p>
                <p part="N">This is abundantly verified by very simple experiments. Let an upright
                    pipe be inserted into the side of the main pipe. When the water runs out by the
                    mouth of the main, it will rise in this branch till the weight of the column
                    balances the pressure that supports it; and if we then ascertain the velocity of
                    the issuing water by means of the quantity discharged, and compute the head or
                    height necessary for producing this velocity, and subtract this from the height
                    of water above the entry of the main, we shall find the height in the branch
                    precisely equal to their difference. Our readers may see this by examining the
                    experiments related by Gravesande, and still better by examining the experiments
                    related by Bossut, which are detailed with great minuteness. The results
                    corresponded accurately with this proposition. The experiments indeed were not
                    heights of water supported by this pressure, but water expelled by it through
                    the same orifice. Indeed the truth of the proposition appears in every way we
                    can consider the motion of water. And as it is of the first importance in the
                    practice of conducting water (for reasons which will presently appear), it
                    merits a particular attention. When an inclined tube is in train, the
                    accelerating power of the water (or its weight diminished in the proportion of
                    the length of the oblique column to its vertical height, or its weight
                    multiplied by the fraction -, which expresses the slope) is in equilibrio with
                    the obstructions; and therefore it exerts no pressure on the pipe but what
                    arises from its weight alone. Any part of it would continue to slide down the
                    inclined plane with a constant velocity, though detached from what follows it.
                    It therefore derives no pressure from the head of water which impelled it into
                    the pipe. The same must be said of a horizontal pipe infinitely smooth, or
                    opposing no resistance. The water would move in this pipe with the full velocity
                    due to the head of water which impels it into the cntry. But when the pipe
                    opposes an obstruction, the head of water is greater than that which would impel
                    it into the pipe with the velocity that it actually has in it; and this
                    additional pressure is propagated along the pipe, where it is balanced by the
                    actual resistance, and therefore excites a <hi rend="italic">guoguaversum</hi>
                    pressure on the pipe. In short, whatever part of the head of water in the
                    reservoir, or of the pressure which impels it along the tube, is not employed in
                    producing velocity, is employed in acting against some obstruction, and excites,
                    by the re-action of this obstruction, an equal pressure on the tube. The rule
                    therefore is general, but is subject to some modifications which deserve our
                    attention.</p>
                <p part="N">In the simply inclined pipe BC (fig.4), the pressure on any point S is

                    the column which would communicate the actual velocity. We have therefore <hi

                <p part="N">We must carefully distinguish this pressure on any square inch of the
                    pipe, from the obstruction or resistance which that inch actually exerts, and
                    which is part of the cause of the pressure. The pressure, by the laws of
                    hydrostatics, is the same with that exerted on the water by a square inch of the
                    piston or forcing head of water. This must balance the united obstructions of
                    the whole pipe, in as far as they are not balanced by the relative weight of the
                    water in an enclosed pipe. Whatever be the inclination of a pipe, and the
                    velocity of the water in it, there is a certain part of this resistance which
                    may not be balanced by the tendency which the water has to slide along it,
                    provided the pipe be long enough; or if the pipe is too short, the tendency down
                    the pipe may more than balance all the resistances that obtain helow. In the
                    first case, this overplus must be balanced by an additional head of water; and
                    in the latter case the pipe is not in train, and the water will accelerate.
                    There is something in the mechanism of these motions which makes a certain
                    length of pipe necessary for bringing it into train; a certain portion of the
                    surface which acts in concert in obstructing the motion. We do not completely
                    understand this circumstance, but we can form a pretty distinct notion of its
                    mode of acting. The film of water contiguous to the pipe is withheld by the
                    obstruction, but glides along; the film immediately within this is withheld by
                    the outer film, but glides through it: and thus all the concentric films glide
                    within those around them, somewhat like the sliding tubes of a spy-glass when we
                    draw it out by taking hold of the end of the innermost. Thus the second film
                    passes beyond the first and outermost, and becomes the outermost, and rubs along
                    the tube. The third does the same in its turn; and thus the central filaments
                    come at last to the outside, and all sustain their greatest possible
                    obstruction. When this is accomplished the pipe is in train. This requires a
                    certain length, which we cannot determine by theory. We see however that pipes
                    of greater diameter must require a greater length, and this in a proportion
                    which is probably that of the number of filaments, or the square of the
                    diameter. Du Buat found this supposition agree well enough with his experiments.
                    A pipe of one inch in diameter sustained no change of velocity by gradually
                    shortening it till he reduced it to six feet, and then it discharged a little
                    more water. A pipe of two inches diameter gave a sensible augmentation of
                    velocity when shortened to twenty-five feet. He therefore says that the square
                    of the diameter in inches, multiplied by seventy-two, will express, in inches,
                    the length necessary for putting any pipe in train.</p>
                <p part="N">The resistance exerted by a square inch of the pipe makes but a small
                    part of the pressure which the whole resistances occasion to be exerted there
                    before they can be overcome. The resistance may be represented by -, where <hi
                        rend="italic">d</hi> is the hydraulic depth (one fourth of the diameter),
                    and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> the length of a column whose vertical height is one
                    inch, and it is the relative weight of a column of water whose base is a square
                    inch, and height is <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> For the resistance of any length
                        <hi rend="italic">s</hi> of pipe which is in train is equal to the tendency
                    of the water to slide down (being balanced by it); that is, is equal to the
                    weight of this column multiplied by -. The magnitude of this column is had by
                    multiplying its length by its section. The section is the product of the border
                        <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> or circumference multiplied by the mean depth <hi
                        rend="italic">d,</hi> or it is <hi rend="italic">bd.</hi> This multiplied by
                    the length is <hi rend="italic">bds;</hi> and this multi plied by the slope <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript"> s</hi> is <hi

                        rend="italic">bd</hi> / <hi rend="italic">s</hi>; and this is in equilibrio
                    with the resistance of a ring of the pipe one inch broad. This, when unfolded,
                    is a parallelogram <hi rend="italic">b</hi> inches in length. One inch of this
                    therefore is the relative weight of a column of water having <hi rend="italic"
                        >d</hi> for its height and a square inch for its base. Suppose the pipe four
                    inches in diameter, and the slope = 253, the resistance is one grain, for an
                    inch of water weighs 253 grains.</p>
                <p part="N">This knowledge of the pressure of water in motion is of great
                    importance. In the management of rivers and canals it instructs us concerning
                    the damages which they produce in their beds by tearing up the soil: it informs
                    us of the strength which we must give to the banks, but it is of more
                    consequence in the management of close conduits. By this we must regulate the
                    strength of our pipes; by this also we must ascertain the quantities of water
                    which may be drawn off by lateral branches from any main conduit.</p>
                <p part="N">With respect to the first of these objects, where security is our sole
                    concern, it is proper to consider the pressure in the most unfavourable
                    circumstances, viz. when the end of the main is shut. The case is not
                    unfrequent. Nay, when the water is in motion, its velocity in a conduit seldom
                    exceeds a very few feet in a second. Eight feet per second requires only one
                    foot of water to produce it. We should therefore estimate the strain on all
                    conduits by the whole height of the reservoir.</p>
                <p part="N">In order to adjust the strength of a pipe to the strain, we may conceive
                    it as consisting of two half cylinders of insuperable strength joined along the
                    two seams, where the strength is the same with the ordinary strength of the
                    materials of which it is made. The inside pressure tends to burst the pipe by
                    tearing open these scams; and each of those two seams is equal to the weight of
                    a column of water whose height is the depth of the seam below the surface of the
                    reservoir, and whose base is an inch broad and a diameter of the pipe in length.
                    This follows from the common principles of hydrostatics.</p>
                <p part="N">Suppose the pipe to be of lead, one foot in diameter and 100 feet under
                    the surface of the reservoir. Water weighs 62½ pounds per foot. The base of our
                    column is therefore <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        12</hi> th of a foot, and the tendency to burst the pipe is 100 × 62½ × <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> = <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 6250</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> = 521 pounds
                    nearly. There fore an inch of one seam is strained by 260½ pounds. A rod of lead
                    one inch square is pulled asunder by 860 pounds (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Strength of Materials).</hi> Therefore, if the thickness of the seam is =
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 260</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 860</hi> inches, or
                    one third of an inch, it will just withstand this strain. But we must make it
                    much stronger than this, especially if the pipe leads from an engine which sends
                    the water along it by starts. Belidor and Desaguliers have given tables of the
                    thickness and weights of pipes which experience has found sufficient for <pb

                    Desaguliers says, that a leaden pipe of three fourths of an inch in thickness is
                    strong enough for a height of 140 feet and diameter of seven inches. From this
                    we may calculate all others. Belidor says, that a leaden pipe twelve inches
                    diameter and sixty feet deep should be half an inch thick. But these things will
                    be more properly computed by means of the list given in the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Strength of Matertials.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The application which we are most anxious to make of the knowledge of
                    the pressure of moving waters, is the derivation from a main conduit by lateral
                    branches. This occurs very frequently in the distribution of waters among the
                    inhabitants of towns; and it is so imperfectly understood by the greater part of
                    those who take the name of engineers, that individuals have no security that
                    they shall get even one half of the water they bargain and pay for; yet this may
                    be as accurately ascertained as any other problem in hydraulics by means of our
                    general theorem. The case therefore merits our particular attention.</p>
                <p part="N">It appears to be already determined, when we have ascertained the
                    pressures by which the water is impelled into these lateral pipes, especially
                    after we have said that the experiments of Bossut on the actual discharges from
                    a lateral pipe fully confirm the theoretical doctrine. But much remains to be
                    considered. We have seen that there is a vast difference between the discharge
                    made through a hole, or even through a short pipe, and the discharge from the
                    far end of a pipe derived from a main conduit. And even when this has been
                    ascertained by our new theory, the discharge thus modified will be found
                    considerably different from the real state of things: for when water is flowing
                    along a main with a known velocity, and therefore exerting a known pressure on
                    the circle which we propose for the entry of a branch, if we insert a branch
                    there, water will go along it; but this will generally make a considerable
                    change in the motion along the main, and therefore in the pressure which is to
                    expel the water. It also makes a considerable change in the whole quantity which
                    passes along the anterior part of the main, and a still greater change on what
                    moves along that part of it which lies beyond the branch: it therefore affects
                    the quantity necessary for the whole supply, the force that is required for
                    propelling it, and the quantity delivered by other branches. This part therefore
                    of the management of water in conduits is of considerable importance and
                    intricacy. We can propose in this place nothing more than a solution of such
                    leading questions as involve the chief circumstances, recommending to our
                    readers the perusal of original works on this subject. Μ. Bossut’s experiments
                    are fully competent to the establishment of the fundamental principle. The hole
                    through which the lateral discharges were made was but a few feet from the
                    reservoir. The pipe was successively lengthened, by which the resistances were
                    increased, and the velocity diminished: but this did not affect the lateral
                    discharges, except by affecting the pressures; and the discharges from the end
                    of the main were supposed to be the same as when the lateral pipe was not
                    inserted. Although this was not strictly true, the difference was insensible,
                    because the lateral pipe had but about the eighteenth part of the area of the
                    main.</p>
                <p part="N">Suppose that the discharge from the reservoir remains the same after the
                    derivation of this branch, then the motion of the water all the way to the
                    insertion of the branch is the same as before; but beyond this the discharge is
                    diminished by all that is discharged by the branch, with the head <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> equivalent to the pressure on the side. The discharge
                    by the lower end of the main being diminished, the velocity and resistance in it
                    are also diminished. Therefore the difference between <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    and the head employed to overcome the friction in this second case, would be a
                    needless or inefficient part of the whole load at the entry, which is
                    impossible; for every force produces an effect, or it is destroyed by some
                    re-action. The effect of the forcing head of water is to produce the greatest
                    discharge corresponding to the obstructions; and thus the discharge from the
                    reservoir, or the supply to the main, must be augmented by the insertion of the
                    branch, if the forcing head of water remains the same. A greater portion
                    therefore of the forcing head was employed in producing a greater discharge at
                    the entry of the main, and the remainder, less than <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    produced the pressure on the sides. This head was the one competent to the
                    obstructions resulting from the velocity beyond the insertion of the branch; and
                    this velocity, diminished by the discharge already made, was less than that at
                    the entry, and even than that of the main without a branch. This will appear
                    more distinctly by putting the case into the form of an equation. Therefore let
                    H — <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the height due to the velocity at the entry, of
                    which the effect obtains only horizontally. The head <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is
                    the only one which acts on the sides of the tube, tending to produce the
                    discharge by the branch, at the same time that it must overcome the obstructions
                    beyond the branch. If the orifice did not exist, and if the force producing the
                    velocity on a short tube be represented by 2 G, and the section of the main be
                    A, the supply at the entry of the main would be A√2G √H— <hi rend="italic"
                        >x</hi>; and if the orifice had no influence on the value of <hi
                        rend="italic">x,</hi> the discharge by the orifice would be ***D^/jE., D
                    being its discharge by means of the head H, when the end of the main is shut;
                    for the discharges are in the subduplicate ratio of the heads of water by which
                    they are expelled; and therefore ***√ ’ H: <hi rend="italic">y/x =</hi> D: D <hi
                        rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ^∕jL= <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> But we have seen
                    that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> must diminish; and we know that the obstructions
                    are nearly as the square roots of the velocities, when these do not differ much
                    among themselves. Therefore, calling <hi rend="italic">y</hi> the pressure or
                    head which balances the resistances of the main without a branch, while <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> is the head necessary for the main with a branch, we
                    may institute this proportion, ***y: H — <hi rend="italic">y = x:</hi> ~ ’ (~—~;
                    and this fourth term will express the head producing the velocity in the main
                    beyond the branch (as H— <hi rend="italic">y</hi> would have done in a main
                    without a branch). This velocity beyond the branch will be ***√2G ⅛∕~&gt; <hi

                <p part="N"><hi rend="underline">-</hi> ∕∙x ’ ( H ?/)</p>
                <p part="N">the discharge at the end will be A √2 G√ — ——. If to this we add the
                    discharge of the branch, the sum will be the whole discharge, and therefore the
                    whole supply. Therefore we have the following equation, ***A√2G √H — <hi

                    main is greater. By the simple theory, we mean the supposition that the lateral
                    discharges are such as would be produced by the head H— <hi rend="italic"
                        >h,</hi> where H is the height of the reservoir, and <hi rend="italic"

                <p part="N">And thus it appears that the proportion of the discharge by a lateral

                    />the pressures, but also on the size of the lateral pipe, and its distance from
                    the reservoir. When it is large, it greatly alters the train of the main, under
                    the same head, by altering the discharge at its extremity, and the velocity in
                    it beyond the branch; and if it be near the reservoir, it greatly alters the
                    train, because the diminished velocity takes place through a greater extent, and
                    there is a greater diminution of the resistances.</p>
                <p part="N">When the branch is taken off at a considerable distance from the

                    the first part of the main, and the other balances the resistances beyond the
                    lateral pipe, with a velocity diminished by the discharge from the branch. A
                    branch at the end of the main produces very little change in the train of the

                <p part="N">When the lateral discharge is great, the train may be so altered, that
                    the remaining part of the main will not run full, and then the branch will not
                    yield the same quantity. The velocity in a very long horizontal tube may be so
                    small (by a small head of water and great obstructions in a very long tube) that
                    it will just run full. An orifice made in its upper side will yield nothing, and
                    yet a small tube inserted into it will carry a column almost as high as the
                    reservoir; so that we cannot judge in all cases of the pressures by the

                <p part="N">If there be an inclined tube, having a head greater than what is
                    competent to the velocity, we may bring it into train by an opening on its upper
                    side near the reservoir. This will yield some water, and the velocity will
                    diminish in the tube till it is in train. If we should now enlarge the hole, it
                    will yield no more water than before.</p>
                <p part="N">And thus we have pointed out the chief circumstances which affect these
                    lateral discharges. The discharges are afterwards modified by the conduits in
                    which they are conveyed to their places of destination. These, for the sake of
                    economy, being generally of small dimensions, the velocity is much diminished.
                    But, at the same time, it approaches nearer to that which the same conduit would
                    bring directly from the reservoir, because its small velocity will produce a
                    less change in the train of the main conduit.</p>
                <p part="N">We should now treat of jets of water, which still make an ornament in
                    the magnificent pleasure-grounds of the wealthy. Some of these are indeed grand
                    objects, such as the two at Peterhoff in Russia, which spout about sixty feet
                    high a column of nine inches diameter, that falls again, and shakes the ground
                    with its blow. Even a spout of an inch or two inches diameter, lancing to the
                    height of 150 feet, is a gay object, and greatly enlivens a pleasure-ground,
                    especially when the changes of a gentle breeze bend the jet to one side. But we
                    have no room left for treating this subject, which is of some nicety; and must
                    conclude this article with a very short account of the management of water as an
                    active power for impelling machinery.</p>

                <p part="N">This is a very comprehensive article, including almost every possible
                    species of mill. It is no less important, and it is therefore matter of regret
                    that we cannot enter into the detail which it deserves. The mere description of
                    the immense variety of mills which are in general use would fill volumes, and a
                    scientific description of their principles and maxims of construction would
                    almost form a complete body of mechanical science. But this is far beyond the
                    limits of a work like ours. Many of these machines have been already described
                    under their proper names, or under the articles which give an account of their
                    manufactures; and for others we must refer our readers to the original works,
                    where they are described in minute detail. The great academical collection <hi
                        rend="italic">Des Arts et Metiers,</hi> published in Paris in many folio
                    volumes, contains a description of the peculiar machinery of many mills; and the
                    volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique,</hi> which
                    particularly relate to the mechanical arts, contain many more. All that we can
                    do in this place is, to consider the chief circumstances that are common to all
                    water-mills, and from which all must derive their efficacy. These circumstances
                    are to be found in the manner of employing water as an acting power, and most of
                    them are comprehended in the construction of water-wheels. When we have
                    explained the principles and the maxims of construction of a water-wheel, every
                    reader conversant in mechanics knows that the axis of this wheel may be employed
                    to transmit the force impressed on it to any species of machinery. Therefore
                    nothing subsequent to this can with propriety be considered as <hi rend="italic"
                        >water-works.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Water-wheels are of two kinds, distinguished by the manner in which
                    water is made an impelling power, viz. by its weight, or by its impulse. This
                    requires a very different form and manner of adaptation; and this forms an
                    ostensible distinction, sufficiently obvious to give a name to each class. When
                    water is made to act by its weight, it is delivered from the spout as high on
                    the wheel as possible, that it may continue long to press it down; but when it
                    is made to strike the wheel, it is delivered as low as possible, that it may
                    have previously acquired a great velocity. And thus the wheels are said to be
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">overshot</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >undershot.</hi><hi rend="italic">Of Overshot Wheels.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">This is nothing but a frame of open buckets, so disposed round the rim
                    of a wheel as to receive the water delivered from a spout; so that one side of
                    the wheel is loaded with water, while the other is empty. The consequence must
                    be, that the loaded side must descend. By this motion the water runs out of the
                    lower buckets, while the empty buckets of the rising side of the wheel come
                    under the spout in their turn, and are filled with water.</p>
                <p part="N">If it were possible to construct the buckets in such a manner as to
                    remain completely filled with water till they come to the very bottom of the
                    wheel, the pressure with which the water urges the wheel round its axis would be
                    the same as if the extremity of the horizontal radius were continually loaded
                    with a quantity of water sufficient to fill a square pipe whose section is equal
                    to that of the bucket, and whose length is the diameter of the wheel. For let
                    the buckets BD and EF, fig. 5, be compared together, the arches DB and EF are
                    equal. The mechanical energy of the water contained in the bucket BD, or the
                    pressure with which its weight urges the wheel, is the same as if all this water
                    were hung on that point T of the horizontal arm CF, where it is cut by the
                    vertical or plumb-line BT. This is plain from the most elementary principles of
                    mechanics. Therefore the effect of the bucket BD is to that of the bucket EF as
                    CT to CF or CB. Draw the horizontal lines PB <hi rend="italic">b b,</hi> QD <hi
                        rend="italic">d d.</hi> It is plain, that if BD is taken very small, so that
                    it may be considered as a straight line, BD: BO=CB: BP, and EF: <hi
                        rend="italic">bd =</hi> CF: CT, and EF×CT = <hi rend="italic">b d</hi> ×CF.
                    Therefore, if the prism of water whose vertical section is <hi rend="italic">b b
                        d d,</hi> were hung on at F, its force to urge the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=840" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0840-0800"
                    />wheel round would be the same as that of the water lying in the bucket BD. The
                    same may be said of every bucket; and the effective pressure of the whole ring
                    of water A <hi rend="italic">f</hi> HKFI, in its natural situation, is the same
                    with the pillar of water <hi rend="italic">a h ha</hi> hung on at F. And the
                    effect of any portion BF of this ring is the same with that of the corresponding
                    portion <hi rend="italic">b</hi> F <hi rend="italic">f b of</hi> the vertical
                    pillar. We do not take into account the small difference which arises from the
                    depth Bβ or F <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> because we may suppose the circle
                    described through the centres of gravity of the buckets. And in the further
                    prosecution of this subject, we shall take similar liberties, with the view of
                    simplifying the subject, and saving time to the reader.</p>
                <p part="N">But such a state of the wheel is impossible. The bucket at the very top
                    of the wheel may be completely filled with water; but when it comes into the
                    oblique position BD, a part of the water must run over the outer edge ∂, and the
                    bucket will only retain the quantity ZBD 3; and if the buckets are formed by
                    partitions directed to the axis of the wheel, the whole water must be run out by
                    the time that they descend to the level of the axis. To prevent this, many
                    contrivances have been adopted. The wheel has been surrounded with a hoop or
                    sweep, consisting of a circular board, which comes almost into contact with the
                    rim of the wheel, and terminates at H, where the water is allowed to run off.
                    But unless the work is executed with uncommon accuracy, the wheel made exactly
                    round, and the sweep exactly fitting it, a great quantity of water escapes
                    between them; and there is a very sensible obstruction to the motion of such a
                    wheel, from something like friction between the water and the sweep. Frost also
                    effectually stops the motion of such a wheel. Sweeps have therefore been
                    generally laid aside, although there are situations where they might be used
                    with good effect.</p>
                <p part="N">Mill-wrights have turned their whole attention to the giving a form to
                    the buckets which shall enable them to retain the water along a great portion of
                    the circumference of the wheel. It would be endless to describe all these
                    contrivances; and we shall therefore content ourselves with one or two of the
                    most approved. The intelligent reader will readily see that many of the
                    circumstances which concur in producing the ultimate effect (such as the
                    facility with which the water is received into the buckets, the place which it
                    is to occupy during the progress of the bucket from the top to the bottom of the
                    wheel, the readiness with which they are evacuated, or the chance that the water
                    has of being dragged beyond the bottom of the wheel by its adhesion, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.) are such as do not admit of precise calculation on reasoning about
                    their merits; and that this or that form can seldom be evidently demonstrated to
                    be the very best possible. But, at the same time, he will see the general
                    reasons of preference, and his attention will be directed to circumstances which
                    must be attended to in order to have a good bucketed wheel.</p>
                <p part="N">Fig. 6 is the outline of a wheel having forty buckets. The ring of board
                    contained between the concentric circles QDS and PAR, making the ends of the
                    buckets, is called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Shrouding,</hi> in the language of
                    the art, and QP is called the <hi rend="italic">depth of shrouding.</hi> The
                    inner circle PAR is called the <hi rend="smallcaps">sole</hi> of the wheel, and
                    usually consists of boards nailed to strong wooden rings of compass-timber of
                    considerable scantling, firmly united with the <hi rend="smallcaps">arms</hi> or
                    radii. The partitions which determine the form of the buckets consist of three
                    different planes or boards AB, BC,</p>
                <p part="N">CD, which are variously named by different artists. We have heard them
                    named the <hi rend="smallcaps">start</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">shoulder,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">arm,</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps">wrest</hi>
                    (probably for wrist, on account of a resemblance of the whole line to the human
                    arm); B is also called the <hi rend="smallcaps">elbow.</hi> Fig. 7 represents a
                    small portion of the same bucketing on a larger scale, that the proportions of
                    the parts may be more distinctly seen. AG, the sole of one bucket, is made about
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th more than
                    the depth GH of the shrouding. The start AB is ½ of AI. The plane BC is so
                    inclined to AB that it would pass through H; but it is made to terminate in C,
                    in such a manner that FC is <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 6</hi> ths of GH or AI Then CD is so placed that HD is

                    IH.</p>
                <p part="N">By this construction, it follows that the area FABC is very nearly equal
                    to DABC; so that the water which will fill the space FABC will all be contained
                    in the bucket when it shall come into such a position that AD is a horizontal
                    line; and the line AB will then make an angle of nearly 35° with the vertical,
                    or the bucket will be 35° from the perpendicular. If the bucket descend so much
                    lower that one half of the water runs out, the line AB will make an angle of
                    25°, or 24° nearly, with the vertical. Therefore the wheel, filled to the degree
                    now mentioned, will <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> to lose water at about <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> th of the diameter
                    from the bottom, and <hi rend="italic">half of the water will be discharged</hi>
                    from the lowest bucket, about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 24</hi> th of the diameter farther down. These situations
                    of the discharging bucket are marked at T and V in fig. 6. Had a greater
                    proportion of the buckets been filled with water when they were under the spout,
                    the discharge would have begun at a greater height from the bottom, and we
                    should lose a greater portion of the whole fall of water. The loss by the
                    present construction is less than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th (supposing the water to be delivered into the
                    wheel at the very top), and may be estimated at about <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> th; for the loss is the versed sine
                    of the angle which the radius of the bucket makes with the vertical. The versed
                    sine of 35° is nearly ]th of the radius (being 0∙18085), or <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of the
                    diameter. It is evident that if only ½ of this water were supplied to each
                    bucket as it passes the spout, it would have been retained for 10° more of a
                    revolution, and the loss of fall would have been only about <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 18</hi> th.</p>
                <p part="N">These observations serve to show, in general, that an advantage is
                    gained by having the buckets so capacious that the quantity of water which each
                    can receive as it passes the spout may not nearly fill it. This may be
                    accomplished by making them of a sufficient length, that is, by making the wheel
                    sufficiently broad between the two shroudings. Economy is the only objection to
                    this practice, and it is generally very ill placed. When the work to be
                    performed by the wheel is great, the addition of power gained by a greater
                    breadth will soon compensate for the additional expense.</p>
                <p part="N">The third plane CD is not very frequent, and mill-wrights generally
                    content themselves with continuing the board all the way from the elbow B to the
                    outer edge of the wheel at H; and AB is generally no more than one third of the
                    depth AI. But CD is a very evident improvement, causing the wheel to retain a
                    very sensible addition to the water. Some indeed make this addition more
                    considerable, by bringing BC more outward, so as to meet the rim of the wheel at
                    H, for instance, and making HD coincide with the rim. But this makes the entry
                    of the water somewhat more difficult during the very short time that the opening
                    of the bucket passes the spout. To facilitate this as much as possible, the
                    water should get a direction from the spout, such as will send it into the
                    buckets in the most perfect manner. This may be obtained by delivering water
                    through an aperture that is divided by thin plates of board or metal, <pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=841"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0841-0801"/> placed in the proper position, as we have
                    represented in fig. 6. The form of bucket last mentioned, having the wrest
                    concentric with the rim, is unfavourable to the ready admission of the water;
                    whereas an oblique wrest conducts the water which has missed one bucket into the
                    next below.</p>
                <p part="N">The mechanical consideration of this subject also shows us that a deep
                    shrouding, in order to make a capacious bucket, is not a good method: it does
                    not make the buckets retain their water any longer, and it diminishes the
                    effective fall of water; for the water received at the top of the wheel
                    immediately falls to the bottom of the bucket, and thus shortens the fictitious
                    pillar of water, which we showed to be the measure of the effective or useful
                    pressure on the wheel: and this concurs with our former reasons for recommending
                    as great a breadth of the wheel, and length of buckets, as economical
                    considerations will permit.</p>
                <p part="N">A bucket-wheel was some time ago executed by Mr Robert Burns, at the
                    cotton-mills of Houston, of a construction entirely new, but founded on a good
                    principle, which is susceptible of great extension. It is represented in fig. 8.
                    The bucket consists of a start AB, an arm BC, and a wrest CD, concentric with
                    the rim. But the bucket is also divided by a partition LM, concentric with the
                    sole and rim, and so placed as to make the inner and outer portions of nearly
                    equal capacity. It is evident, without any further reasoning about it, that this
                    partition will enable the bucket to retain its water much longer. When they are
                    filled one third, they retain the whole water at 18° from the bottom, and they
                    retain one half at 11°. They do not admit the water quite so freely as buckets
                    of the common construction; but by means of the contrivance mentioned a little
                    ago for the spout (also the invention of Mr Bums, and furnished with a
                    rack-work, which raised or depressed it as the supply of water varied, so as at
                    all times to employ the whole fall of the water), it is found that a slow moving
                    wheel allows one half of the water to get into the inner buckets, especially if
                    the partition do not altogether reach the radius drawn through the lip D of the
                    outer bucket.</p>
                <p part="N">This is a very great improvement of the bucket-wheel; and when the wheel
                    is made of a liberal breadth, so that the water may be very shallow in the
                    buckets, it seems to carry the performance as far as it can go. Mr Burns made
                    the first trial on a wheel of twenty-four feet diameter; and its performance is
                    manifestly superior to that of the wheel which it replaced, and which was a very
                    good one. It has also another valuable property: when the supply of water is
                    very scanty, a proper adjustment of the apparatus in the spout will direct
                    almost the whole of the water into the outer buckets, which, by placing it at a
                    greater distance from the axis, makes a very sensible addition to its mechanical
                    energy.</p>
                <p part="N">We said that this principle is susceptible of considerable extension;
                    and it is evident that two partitions will increase the effect, and that it will
                    increase with the number of partitions; so that when the practice now begun, of
                    making water-wheels of iron, shall become general, and therefore very thin
                    partitions are used, their number may be greatly increased without any
                    inconvenience, and it is obvious that this series of partitions must greatly
                    contribute to the stiffness and general firmness of the whole wheel.</p>
                <p part="N">There frequently occurs a difficulty in the making of bucket-wheels,
                    when the half-taught mill-wright attempts to retain the water a long time in the
                    buckets. The water gets into them with a difficulty which he cannot account lor,
                    and spills all about, even when the buckets are not moving away from the spout.
                    This arises from the air, which must find its way out to admit the water, but is
                    obstructed by the entering water, and occasions a great spluttering at the
                    entry. This may be entirely prevented by making the spout considerably narrower
                    than the wheel, which will leave room at the two ends of the buckets for the
                    escape of the air. This obstruction is vastly greater than one would imagine,
                    for the water drags along with it a great quantity of air, as is evident in the
                        <hi rend="italic">water-blast</hi> described by many authors.</p>
                <p part="N">There is another and very serious obstruction to the motion of an
                    overshot or bucketed wheel. When it moves in back-water, it is not only resisted
                    by the water when it moves more slowly than the wheel, which is very frequently
                    the case, but it lifts a great deal in the rising buckets. In some particular
                    states of back-water, the descending bucket fills itself completely with water,
                    and in other cases it contains a very considerable quantity, and air of common
                    density; while in some rarer cases it contains less water, with air in a
                    condensed state. In the first case the rising bucket must come up filled with
                    water,' which it cannot drop till its mouth get out of the water. In the second
                    case, part of the water goes out before this, but the air rarefies, and
                    therefore there is still some water dragged or lifted up by the wheel, by
                    suction, as it is usually called. In the last case there is no such back-load on
                    the rising side of the wheel, but (which is as detrimental to its performance)
                    the descending side is employed in condensing air; and although this air aids
                    the ascent of the rising side, it does not aid it so much as it impedes the
                    descending side, being (by the form of the bucket) nearer to the vertical line
                    drawn through the axis.</p>
                <p part="N">All this may be completely prevented by a few holes made in the start of
                    each bucket. Air being at least 800 times rarer than water, will escape through
                    a hole almost thirty times faster with the same pressure. Very moderate holes
                    will therefore suffice for this purpose; and the small quantity of water which
                    these holes discharge during the descent of the buckets, produces a loss which
                    is altogether insignificant. The water which runs out of one runs into another,
                    so that there is only the loss of one bucket. We have seen a wheel of only
                    fourteen feet diameter working in nearly three feet of back-water. It laboured
                    prodigiously, and brought up a great load of water, which fell from it in abrupt
                    dashes, rendering the motion very hobbling. When three holes of an inch diameter
                    were made in each bucket (twelve feet long), the wheel laboured no more, there
                    was no more plunging of water from its rising side, and its power on the
                    machinery was increased more than one fourth.</p>
                <p part="N">These practical observations may contain information that is new even to
                    several experienced mill-wrights. To persons less informed they cannot fail of
                    being useful. We now proceed to consider the action of water thus lying in the
                    buckets of a wheel, and to ascertain its energy as it may be modified by
                    different circumstances of fall, velocity, &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">With respect to variations in the fall, there can be little room for
                    discussion. Since the active pressure is measured by the pillar of water
                    reaching from the horizontal plane where it is delivered on the wheel, to the
                    horizontal plane where it is spilled by the wheel, it is evident that it must be
                    proportional to this pillar, and therefore we must deliver it as high and retain
                    it as long as possible.</p>
                <p part="N">This maxim obliges us, in the first place, to use a wheel whose diameter
                    is equal to the whole fall. We shall not gain any thing by employing a larger
                    wheel; for although we should gain by using only that part of the circumference
                    where the weight will act more perpendicularly to the radius, we shall lose more
                    by the necessity of discharging the water at a greater height from the bottom:
                    for we must suppose the buckets of both the wheels equally well constructed; in
                    which case, the heights above the bottom where <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=842" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0842-0802"
                    />they will discharge the water, will increase in the proportion of the diameter
                    of the wheel. Now, that we shall lose more by this than we gain by the more
                    direct application of the weight, is plain, without any further reasoning, by
                    taking the extreme case, and supposing our wheel enlarged to such a size that
                    the useless part below is equal to the whole fall. In this case the water will
                    be spilled from the buckets as soon as it is delivered into them. All
                    intermediate cases therefore partake of the imperfection of this.</p>
                <p part="N">When the fall is exceedingly great, a wheel of an equal diameter becomes
                    enormously large and expensive, and is of itself an unmanageable load. We have
                    however seen wheels of fifty-eight feet diameter, which worked extremely well;
                    but they are of very difficult construction, and extremely apt to warp and go
                    out of shape by their weight. In cases like this, where we are unwilling to lose
                    any part of the force of a small stream, the best form of a bucket-wheel is an
                    inverted chain-pump. Instead of employing a chainpump of the best construction,
                    ABCDEA (fig. 9), to raise water through the upright pipe CB, by means of a force
                    applied to the upper wheel A, let the water be delivered from a spout F, into
                    the upper part of a pipe BC, and it will press down the plugs in the lower and
                    narrower bored part of it with the full weight of the column, and escape at the
                    dead level of C. This weight will urge round the wheel A without any
                    defalcation; and this is the most powerful manner in which any fall of water
                    whatever can be applied, and it exceeds the most perfect overshot wheel. But
                    though it excels all chains of buckets in economy and in effect, it has all the
                    other imperfections of this kind of machinery. Though the chain of plugs be of
                    great strength, it has so much motion in its joints that it needs frequent
                    repairs; and when it breaks, it is generally in the neighbourhood of A, on the
                    loaded side, and all comes down with a great crash. There is also a loss of
                    power by the immersion of so many plugs and chains in the water; for there can
                    be no doubt but that if the plugs were large enough and light enough, they would
                    buoy and even draw up the plug in the narrow part at C. They must therefore
                    diminish, in all other cases, the force with which this plug is pressed
                    down.</p>
                <p part="N">The velocity of an overshot wheel is a matter of very great nicety; and
                    authors, both speculative and practical, have entertained different, nay
                    opposite, opinions on the subject. Μ. Belidor, whom the engineers of Europe have
                    long been accustomed to regard as sacred authority, maintains that there is a
                    certain velocity related to that obtainable by the whole fall, which will
                    procure to an overshot wheel the greatest performance. Desaguliers, Smeaton,
                    Lambert, De Parcieux, and others, maintain that there is no such relation, and
                    that the performance of an overshot wheel will be the greater, as it moves more
                    slowly by an increase of its load of work. Belidor maintains that the active
                    power of water lying in a bucket-wheel of any diameter is equal to that of the
                    impulse of the same water on the floats of an undershot wheel when the water
                    issues from a sluice in the bottom of the dam. The other writers whom we have
                    named assert that the energy of an undershot wheel is but one half of that of an
                    overshot, actuated by the same quantity of water falling from the same
                    height.</p>
                <p part="N">To a manufacturing country like ours, that derives astonishing
                    superiority, by which it more than compensates for the impediments of heavy
                    taxes and luxurious living, chiefly from its machinery, in which it leaves all
                    Europe far behind, the decision of this question, in such a manner as shall
                    leave no doubt or misconception in the mind even of an unlettered artist, must
                    be considered as a material service, and we think that this is easily
                    attainable.</p>
                <p part="N">When any machme moves uniformly, the accelerating force or pressure
                    actually exerted on the impelled point of the machine is in equilibrio with all
                    the resistances which are exerted at the working point, with those arising from
                    friction, and those that are excited in different parts of the machine by their
                    mutual actions. This is an incontestable truth, and though little attended to by
                    the mechanicians, is the foundation of all practical knowledge of machines.
                    Therefore, when an overshot wheel moves uniformly, with <hi rend="italic">any
                        velocity whatever,</hi> the water is acting with its whole weight, for
                    gravity would accelerate its descent, if not completely balanced by some
                    re-action; and in this balance gravity and the re-acting part of the machine
                    exert equal and opposite pressures, and thus produce the uniform motion of the
                    machine. We are thus particular on this point, because we observe mechanicians
                    of the first name employing a mode of reasoning on the question now before us
                    which is specious, and appears to prove the conclusion which they draw, but is
                    nevertheless contrary to true mechanical principles. They assert that the slower
                    a heavy body is descending (suppose in a scale suspended from an axis <hi
                        rend="italic">in peritrochea),</hi> the more does it press on the scale, and
                    the more does it urge the machine round; and therefore the slower an overshot
                    wheel turns, the greater is the force with which the water urges it round, and
                    the more work will be done. It is very true that the machine is more forcibly
                    impelled, and that more work is done; but this is not because a pound of water
                    presses more strongly, but because there is more water pressing on the wheel,
                    for the spout supplies at the same rate, and each bucket receives more water as
                    it passes by it.</p>
                <p part="N">Let us therefore examine this point by the unquestionable principles of
                    mechanics.</p>
                <p part="N">Let the overshot wheel A <hi rend="italic">f</hi> H (fig. 5) receive the
                    water from a spout at the very top of the wheel; and in order that the wheel may
                    not be retarded by dragging into motion the water simply laid into the uppermost
                    bucket at A, let it be received at B, with the velocity (directed in a tangent
                    to the wheel) acquired by the head of water AP. This velocity therefore must be
                    equal to that of the rim of the wheel. Let this be <hi rend="italic">υ,</hi> or
                    let the wheel and the water move over <hi rend="italic">v</hi> inches in a
                    second. Let the buckets be of such dimensions, that all the water which each
                    receives as it passes the spout is retained till it comes to the position R,
                    where it is discharged at once. It is plain that, in place of the separate
                    quantities of water lying in each bucket, we may substitute a continued ring of
                    water, equal to their sum, and uniformly distributed in the space BER <hi
                        rend="italic">gfβ</hi>. This constitutes a ring of uniform thickness. Let
                    the area of its cross section <hi rend="italic">β</hi> B and F <hi rend="italic"
                        >f</hi> called <hi rend="italic">a</hi>. We have already demonstrated, that
                    the mechanical energy with which this water on the circumference of the wheel
                    urges it round, is the same with what would be exerted by the pillar <hi
                        rend="italic">brrb</hi> pressing on F <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> or acting by
                    the lever CF. The weight of this pillar may be expressed by <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> × <hi rend="italic">br</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">a</hi> × PS; and
                    if we call the radius CF of the wheel R, the momentum or mechanical energy of
                    this weight will be represented by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> × PS × R.</p>
                <p part="N">Now, let us suppose that this wheel is employed to raise a weight W,
                    which is suspended by a rope wound round the axis of the wheel. Let <hi
                        rend="italic">r</hi> be the radius of this axle. Then W × <hi rend="italic"
                        >r</hi> is the momentum of the work. Let the weight rise with the velocity
                        <hi rend="italic">u</hi> when the rim of the wheel turns with the velocity
                        <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> that is, let it rise <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    inches in a second. Since a perfect equilibrium obtains between the power and
                    the work when the motion is uniform, we must have W × <hi rend="italic">r</hi> =
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> × PS X R. But it is evident that R: <hi

                    × PS.</p>
                <p part="N">Now the performance of the machine is undoubtedly measured by the weight

                    />best possible state when <hi rend="italic">a × v</hi> × PS is a maximum. But
                    it is plain that <hi rend="italic">a × υ</hi> is an invariable quantity, for it
                    is the cubic inches of water which the spout supplies in a second. If the wheel
                    moves fast, little water lies in each bucket, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    small. When <hi rend="italic">ν</hi> is small, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    great, for the opposite reason; but <hi rend="italic">a × v</hi> remains the
                    same. Therefore we must make PS a maximum, that is, we must deliver the water as
                    high up as possible. But this diminishes AP, and this diminishes the velocity of
                    the wheel; and as this has no limit, the proposition is demonstrated, and an
                    overshot wheel does the more work as it moves slowest.</p>
                <p part="N">Convincing as this discussion must be to any mechanician, we are anxious
                    to impress the same maxim on the minds of practical men, unaccustomed to
                    mathematical reasoning of any kind. We therefore beg indulgence for adding a
                    popular view of the question, which requires no such investigation.</p>
                <p part="N">We may reason in this way. Suppose a wheel having thirty buckets, and
                    that six cubic feet of water are delivered in a second on the top of a wheel,
                    and discharged without any loss by the way at a certain height from the bottom
                    of the wheel. Let this be the case whatever is the rate of the wheel’s motion,
                    the buckets being of a sufficient capacity to hold all the water which falls
                    into them. Let this wheel be employed to raise a weight of any kind, suppose
                    water in a chain of thirty buckets, to the same height and with the same
                    velocity. Suppose further, that when the load on the rising side of the machine
                    is one half of that on the wheel, the wheel makes four turns in a minute, or one
                    turn in fifteen seconds. During this time ninety cubic feet of water have flowed
                    into the thirty buckets, and each has received three cubic feet. Then each of
                    the rising buckets contains 1½ feet, and forty-five cubic feet are delivered
                    into the upper cistern during one turn of the wheel, and 180 cubic feet in one
                    minute.</p>
                <p part="N">Now, suppose the machine so loaded, by making the rising buckets more
                    capacious, that it makes only two turns in a minute, or one turn in thirty
                    seconds. Then each descending bucket must contain six cubic feet of water. If
                    each bucket of the rising side contained three cubic feet, the motion of the
                    machine would be the same as before. This is a point which no mechanician will
                    controvert. When two pounds are suspended to one end of a string which passes
                    over the pulley, and one pound to the other end, the descent of the two pounds
                    will he the same with that of a four pound weight which is employed in the same
                    manner to draw up two pounds. Our machine would therefore continue to make four
                    turns in the minute, and would deliver ninety cubic feet during each turn, and
                    360 in a minute. But, by supposition, it is making but two turns in a minute:
                    this must proceed from a greater load than three cubic feet of water in each
                    rising bucket. The machine must therefore be raising <hi rend="italic">more</hi>
                    than ninety feet of water during one turn of the wheel, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >more</hi> than 180 in the minute.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus it appears, that if the machine be turning twice as slow as before,
                    there is <hi rend="italic">more than twice the former quantity</hi> in the
                    rising buckets, and more will be raised in a minute by the same expenditure of
                    power. In like manner, if the machine go three times as slow, there must be <hi
                        rend="italic">more than three times</hi> the former quantity of water in the
                    rising buckets, and more work will be done.</p>
                <p part="N">But we may go further, and assert, that the <hi rend="italic">more</hi>
                    we retard the machine, by loading it with more work of a similar kind, the
                    greater will be its performance. This does not immediately appear from the
                    present discussion: but let us call the first quantity of water in the rising
                    bucket A; the water raised by four turns in a minute will be 4 × 30 × A = 120 A.
                    The quantity in this bucket, when the machine goes twice as slow, has been shown
                    to be greater than 2 A (call it 2 A + <hi rend="italic">x</hi>); the water
                    raised by two turns in a minute will be 2 × 30 × (2 A + <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi>) <hi rend="italic">=</hi> 120 A + 60 <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Now, let
                    the machine go four times as slow, making but one turn in a minute, the rising
                    bucket must now contain more than twice 2 A -∣- <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> or
                    more than 4 A + 2 <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> call it 4 A + 2 <hi rend="italic">x
                        + y.</hi> The work done by one turn in a minute will now be 30 × (4 <hi
                        rend="italic">A</hi> + 2 <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + <hi rend="italic">y)
                        =</hi> 120 A + 60 <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + 30 <hi rend="italic"
                    >y.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">By such an induction of the work, done with any rates of motion we
                    choose, it is evident that the performance of the machine increases with every
                    diminution of its velocity that is produced by the mere addition of a similar
                    load of work, or that it does the more work the slower it goes.</p>
                <p part="N">We have supposed the machine to be in its state of permanent uniform
                    motion. If we consider it only in the beginning of its motion, the result is
                    still more in favour of slow motion: for, at the first action of the moving
                    power, the inertia of the machine itself consumes part of it, and it acquires
                    its permanent speed by degrees, during which the resistances arising from the
                    work, friction, &amp;c. increase, till they exactly balance the pressure of the
                    water; and after this the machine accelerates no more. Now the greater the power
                    and the resistance arising from the work are in proportion to the inertia of the
                    machine, the sooner will all arrive at its state of permanent velocity.</p>
                <p part="N">There is another circumstance which impairs the performance of an
                    overshot wheel moving with a great velocity, viz. the effects of the centrifugal
                    force on the water in the buckets. Our millwrights know well enough, that too
                    great velocity will throw the water out of the buckets; but few, if any, know
                    exactly the diminution of power produced by this cause. The following very
                    simple construction will determine this. Let AOB (fig. 10) be an overshot wheel,
                    of which AB is the upright diameter, and C is the centre. Make CF the length of
                    a pendulum which will make two vibrations during one turn of the wheel. Draw FE
                    to the elbow of any of the buckets. The water in this bucket, instead of having
                    its surface horizontal, as NO, will have it in the direction <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi> O perpendicular to FE very nearly.</p>
                <p part="N">For the time of falling along half of FC is to that of two vibrations of
                    this pendulum, or to the time of a revolution of the wheel, as the radius of a
                    circle is to its circumference; and it is well known that the time of moving
                    along half of AC, by the uniform action of the centrifugal force, is to that of
                    a revolution as the radius of a circle to its circumference. Therefore the time
                    of describing one half of AC by the centrifugal force, is equal to the time of
                    describing one half of FC by gravity. These spaces, being similarly described in
                    equal times, are proportional to the accelerating forces. Therefore ½ FC: ½ AC,
                    or FC: AC = gravity: centrifugal force. Complete the parallelogram FCEK. A
                    particle at E is urged by its weight in the direction KE with a force which may
                    be expressed by FC or KE; and it is urged by the centrifugal force in the
                    direction CE, with a force = AC or CE. By their combined action it is urged in
                    the direction FE. Therefore, as the surface of standing water is always at right
                    angles to the action of gravity, that is, to the plumb-line, so the surface of
                    the water in the revolving bucket is perpendicular to the action of the combined
                    force FE.</p>
                <p part="N">Let NEO be the position of the bucket, which just holds all the water
                    which it received as it passed the spout when not affected by the centrifugal
                    force; and let NDO be its position when it. would be empty. Let the vertical
                    lines through D and E cut the circle described round C with the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=844" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0844-0804"
                    />radius CF in the points II and I. Draw HC, IC, cutting the circle AOB in L and
                    Μ. Make the arch <hi rend="italic">d'δ</hi> equal to AL, and the arch <hi
                        rend="italic">e'ε</hi> equal to AM: then C <hi rend="italic">δ</hi> and C
                        <hi rend="italic">ε</hi> will be the positions of the bucket on the
                    revolving wheel, corresponding to CD <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and CEO on the
                    wheel at rest. Water will begin to run out at ε, and it will be all gone at <hi
                        rend="italic">δ</hi>. The demonstration is evident.</p>
                <p part="N">The force which now urges the wheel is still the weight <hi
                        rend="italic">really</hi> in the buckets; for though the water be urged in
                    the direction with the force FE, one of its constituents, CE, has no tendency to
                    impel the wheel; and KE is the only impelling force.</p>
                <p part="N">It is but of late years that mills have been constructed or attended to
                    with that accuracy and scientific skill which are necessary for deducing
                    confident conclusions from any experiments that can be made with them; and it is
                    therefore no matter of wonder that the opinions of millwrights have been so
                    different on this subject. There is a natural wish to see a machine moving
                    briskly; it has the appearance of activity; but a very slow motion always looks
                    as if the machine were overloaded. For this reason mill-wrights have always
                    yielded slowly, and with some reluctance, to the repeated advices of the
                    mathematicians: but they have yielded, and we see them adopting maxims of
                    construction more agreeable to sound theory, making their wheels of great
                    breadth, and loading them with a great deal of work. Euler says that the
                    performance of the best mill cannot exceed that of the worst above one fifth;
                    but we have seen a stream of water completely expended in driving a small
                    flax-mill, which now drives a cotton-mill of 4000 spindles, with all its
                    carding, roving, and drawing machinery, besides the lathes and other engines of
                    the smith and carpenter’s workshops, exerting a force not less than ten times
                    what sufficed for the flax-mill.</p>
                <p part="N">The above discussion only demonstrates in general the advantage of slow
                    motion, but does not point out in any degree the relation between the rate of
                    motion and the work performed, nor even the principles on which it depends. Yet
                    this is a subject fit for a mathematical investigation, and we would prosecute
                    it in this place if it were necessary for the improvement of practical
                    mechanics. But we have seen that there is not, in the nature of things, a
                    maximum of performance attached to any particular rate of motion which should
                    therefore be preferred. For this reason we omit this discussion of mere
                    speculative curiosity. It is very intricate; for we must now express the
                    pressure on the wheel by a <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> pillar of water
                    incumbent on the extremity of the horizontal arm, as we did before when we
                    supposed the buckets completely filled; nor by a smaller <hi rend="italic"
                        >constant</hi> pillar, corresponding to a smaller but equal quantity lying
                    in every bucket. Each different velocity puts a different quantity of water into
                    the bucket as it passes the spout, and this occasions a difference in the place
                    where the discharge is begun and completed. This circumstance is some obstacle
                    to the advantages of very slow motions, because it brings on the discharge
                    sooner. All this may indeed be expressed by a simple equation of easy
                    management; but the whole process of the mechanical discussion is both intricate
                    and tedious, and the results are so much diversified by the forms of the
                    buckets, that they do not afford any rule of sufficient generality to reward our
                    trouble. The curious reader may see a very full investigation of this subject in
                    two dissertations by Elvius in the Swedish Transactions, and in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Hydrodynamique</hi> of Professor Kästner of Göttingen, who has
                    abridged these dissertations of Elvius, and considerably improved the whole
                    investigation, and has added some comparisons of his deductions with the actual
                    performance of some great works. These comparisons however arc not very
                    satisfactory. There is also a very valuable paper on this subject by Lambert, in
                    the Memoirs of the Academy of</p>
                <p part="N">Berlin for the year 1775. From these dissertations, and from the <hi
                        rend="italic">Hydrodynamique</hi> of the Abbé Bossut, the reader will
                    acquire all that theory can teach of the relation between the pressures of the
                    power and work on the machine, and the rates of its motion. The practical reader
                    may rest with confidence on the simple demonstration which we have given, that
                    the performance is improved by diminishing the velocity.</p>
                <p part="N">All we have to do, therefore, is to load the machine, and thus to
                    diminish its speed, unless other physical circumstances throw obstacles in the
                    way; but there are such obstacles. In all machines there are little inequalities
                    of action that are unavoidable. In the action of a wheel and pinion, though made
                    with the utmost judgment and care, there are such inequalities. These increase
                    by the changes of form occasioned by the wearing of the machine: much greater
                    irregularities arise from the subsultory motions of cranks, stampers, and other
                    parts which move unequally or reciprocally. A machine may be so loaded as just
                    to be in equilibrio with its work, in the favourable position of its parts. When
                    this changes into one less favourable, the machine may stop; if not, it at least
                    staggers, hobbles, or works unequally. The rubbing parts bear long on each
                    other, with enormous pressures, and cut deep, and increase friction. Such slow
                    motions must therefore be avoided. A little more velocity enables the machine to
                    get over those increased resistances by its inertia, or the great quantity of
                    motion inherent in it. Great machines possess this advantage in a superior
                    degree, and will therefore work steadily with a smaller velocity. These
                    circumstances are hardly susceptible of mathematical discussion, and our best
                    reliance is on well-directed experience.</p>
                <p part="N">For this purpose, the reader will do well to peruse with care the
                    excellent paper by Mr Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions for 1759. This
                    dissertation contains a numerous list of experiments, most judiciously contrived
                    by him, and executed with the accuracy and attention to the most important
                    circumstances which is to be observed in all that gentleman’s performances.</p>
                <p part="N">It is true, these experiments were made with small models; and we must
                    not, without great caution, transfer the results of such experiments to large
                    works. But we may safely transfer the laws of variation which result from a
                    variation of circumstances, although we must not adopt the absolute quantities
                    of the variations themselves. Mr Smeaton was fully aware of the limitations to
                    which conclusions drawn from experiments on models are subject, and has made the
                    applications with his usual sagacity.</p>
                <p part="N">His general inference is, that, in smaller works, the rim of the
                    overshot wheel should not have a greater velocity than three feet in a second;
                    but that larger mills may be allowed a greater velocity than this. When every
                    thing is executed in the best manner, he says that the work performed will
                    amount to fully two thirds of the power expended; that is, that three cubic feet
                    of water descending from any height will raise two to the same height.</p>
                <p part="N">It is not very easy to compare these deductions with observations on
                    large works; because there are few cases where we have good measures of the
                    resistances opposed by the work performed by the machine. Mills employed for
                    pumping water afford the best opportunities. But the inertia of their working
                    gear diminishes their useful performance very sensibly, because their great
                    beams, pump-rods, &amp;c. have a reciprocating motion, which must be destroyed
                    and produced anew in every stroke. We have examined some machines of this kind
                    which are esteemed good ones, and we find few of them whose performance exceeds
                    one half of the power expended.</p>
                <p part="N">By comparing other mills with these, we obtain the best information of
                    their resistances. The comparison with mills worked by Watt and Boulton’s
                    steam-engines, is perhaps<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=845" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0845-0805"
                    /> a better measure of the resistances opposed by different kinds of work,
                    because their power is very distinctly known. We have been informed by one of
                    the most eminent engineers, that a ton and a half of water per minute falling
                    one foot will grind and dress one bushel of wheat per hour. This is equivalent
                    to nine tons falling ten feet.</p>
                <p part="N">If an overshot wheel opposed no resistance, and only one bucket were
                    filled, the wheel would acquire the velocity due to a fall through the whole
                    height. But when it is in this state of accelerated motion, if another bucket of
                    water is delivered into it, its motion must be checked at the first, by the
                    necessity of dragging forward this water. If the buckets fill in succession as
                    they pass the spout, the velocity acquired by an unresisting wheel is but half
                    of that which one bucket would give. In all cases, therefore, the velocity is
                    diminished by the inertia of the entering water when it is simply laid into the
                    upper buckets. The performance will therefore be improved by delivering the
                    water on the wheel with that velocity with which the wheel is really moving. And
                    as we cannot give the direction of a tangent to the wheel, the velocity with
                    which it is delivered on the wheel must be so much greater than the intended
                    velocity of the rim, that it shall be precisely equal to it when it is estimated
                    in the direction of the tangent. Three or four inches of fall are sufficient for
                    this purpose; and it should never be neglected, for it has a very sensible
                    influence on the performance. But it is highly improper to give it more than
                    this, with the view of impelling the wheel by its stroke; for even although it
                    were proper to employ part of the fall in this way (which we shall presently see
                    to be very improper), we cannot procure this impulse; because the water falls
                    among other water, or it strikes the boards of the wheel with such obliquity
                    that it cannot produce any such effect.</p>
                <p part="N">It is a much debated question among mill-wrights, whether the diameter
                    of the wheel should be such that the water will be delivered at the top of the
                    wheel; or larger, so that the water is received at some distance from the top,
                    where it will act more perpendicularly to the arm. We apprehend that the
                    observations formerly made will decide in favour of the first practice. The
                    space below, where the water is discharged from the wheel, being proportional to
                    the diameter of the wheel, there is an undoubted loss of fall attending a large
                    wheel; and this is not compensated by delivering the water at a greater distance
                    from the perpendicular. We should therefore recommend the use of the whole
                    descending side, and make the diameter of the wheel no greater than the fall,
                    till it is so much reduced that the centrifugal force begins to produce a
                    sensible effect. Since the rim can hardly have a smaller velocity than three
                    feet per second, it is evident that a small wheel must revolve more rapidly.
                    This made it proper to insert the determination that we have given of the loss
                    of power produced by the centrifugal force. But even with this in view, we
                    should employ much smaller wheels than are generally done on small falls. Indeed
                    the loss of water at the bottom may be diminished, by nicely fitting the arch
                    which surrounds the wheel, so as not to allow the water to escape by the sides
                    or bottom. While this improvement remains in good order, and the wheel entire,
                    it produces a very sensible effect; but the passage widens continually by the
                    wearing of the wheel. A piece of wood or stone falling in about the wheel tears
                    off’ part of the shrouding or bucket, and frosty weather frequently binds all
                    fast. It therefore seldom answers expectations. We have nothing to add on this
                    case to what we have already extracted from Mr Smeaton’s Dissertation on the
                    subject of Breast or Half Overshot Wheels.</p>
                <p part="N">There is another form of wheel by which water is made to act on a
                    machine by its weight, which merits consideration. It is known in this country
                    by the name of <hi rend="italic">Barker's mill,</hi> and has been described by
                    Desaguliers, vol. ii. p. 460. It consists of an upright pipe or trunk AB (fig.
                    11), communicating with two horizontal branches BC, B <hi rend="italic">c</hi>,
                    which have a hole C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> near their ends, opening in
                    opposite directions, at right angles to their lengths. Suppose water to be
                    poured in at the top from the spout F, it will run out by the holes C and <hi
                        rend="italic">c</hi> with the velocity corresponding to the depth of these
                    holes under the surface. The consequence of this must be, that the arms will be
                    pressed backwards; for there is no solid surface at the hole C, on which the
                    lateral pressure of the water can be exerted, while it acts with its full force
                    on the opposite side of the arm. This unbalanced pressure is equal to the weight
                    of a column having the orifice for its base, and twice the depth under the
                    surface of the water in the trunk for its height. This measure of the height may
                    seem odd, because if the orifice were shut, the pressure on it is the weight of
                    a column reaching from the surface. But when it is open, the water issues with
                    nearly the velocity acquired by falling from the surface, and the quantity of
                    motion produced is that of a column of twice this length, moving with this
                    velocity. This is actually produced by the pressure of the fluid, and must
                    therefore be accompanied by an equal re-action.</p>
                <p part="N">Now suppose this apparatus set on the pivot E, and to have a spindle AD
                    above the trunk, furnished with a cylindrical bobbin D, having a rope wound
                    round it, and passing over a pulley G. A weight W may be suspended there, which
                    may balance this backward pressure. If the weight be too small for this purpose,
                    the retrograde motion of the arms will wind up the cord, and raise the weight;
                    and thus we obtain an acting machine, employing the pressure of the water, and
                    applicable to any purpose. A runner millstone may be put on the top of the
                    spindle; and we should then produce a flour-mill of the greatest simplicity,
                    having neither wheel nor pinion, and subject to hardly any wear. It is somewhat
                    surprising, that although this was invented at the beginning of last century,
                    and appears to have such advantage in point of simplicity, it has not come into
                    use. So little has Dr Desaguliers’s account been attended to (although it is
                    mentioned by him as an excellent machine, and as highly instructive to the
                    hydraulist), that the same invention was again brought forward by a German
                    professor (Segner) as his own, and has been honoured by a series of elaborate
                    disquisitions concerning its theory and performance by Euler and by John
                    Bernoulli. Euler’s Dissertations arc to be found in the Memoirs of the Academy
                    of Berlin, 1751, &amp;c. and in the <hi rend="italic">Nov. Comment.
                        Petropol.</hi> tom. vi. Bernoulli’s are at the end of his Hydraulics. Both
                    these authors agree in saying that this machine excels all other methods of
                    employing the force of water. Simple as it appears, its true theory, and the
                    best form of construction, are most abstruse and delicate subjects; and it is
                    not easy to give such an account of its principles as will be understood by an
                    ordinary reader.</p>
                <p part="N">We see in general that the machine must press backwards; and little
                    investigation suffices for understanding the intensity of this pressure when the
                    machine is at rest. But when it is allowed to run backwards, withdrawing itself
                    from the pressure, the intensity of it is diminished; and if no other
                    circumstances intervened, it might not be difficult to say what particular
                    pressure corresponded to any rate of motion. Accordingly, Desaguliers, presuming
                    on the simplicity of the machine, affirms the pressure to be the weight of a
                    column which would produce a velocity of efflux equal to the difference of the
                    velocity of the fluid and of the machine; and hence he deduces that its
                    performance will be the greatest possible when its retrograde velocity <pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=846"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0846-0806"/>is one third of the velocity acquired by
                    falling from the surface, in which case it will raise <hi rend="superscript">
                        8</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 27</hi> ths of the water expended to the same
                    height, which is double of the performance of a mill acted on by the impulse of
                    water.</p>
                <p part="N">But this is a very imperfect account of the operation. When the machine
                    (constructed exactly as we have described) moves round, the water which issues
                    descends in the vertical trunk, and then, moving along the horizontal arms,
                    partakes of this circular motion. This excites a centrifugal force, which is
                    exerted against the ends of the arms by the intervention of the fluid. The whole
                    fluid is subjected to this pressure (increasing for every section across the arm
                    in the proportion of its distance from the axis), and every particle is pressed
                    with the accumulated centrifugal forces of all the sections that are nearer to
                    the axis. Every section therefore sustains an actual pressure proportional to
                    the square of its distance from the axis. This increases the velocity of efflux,
                    and this increases the velocity of revolution; and this mutual co-operation
                    would seem to terminate in an infinite velocity of both motions. But, on the
                    other hand, this circular motion must be given anew to every particle of water
                    as it enters the horizontal arm. This can be done only by the motion already in
                    the arm, and at its expense. Thus there must be a velocity which cannot be
                    overpassed even by an unloaded machine. But it is also plain, that by making the
                    horizontal arm very capacious, the motion of the water from the axis to the jet
                    may be made very slow, and much of this diminution of circular motion prevented.
                    Accordingly, Euler has recommended a form by which this is done in the most
                    eminent degree. His machine consists of a hollow conoidal ring, of which fig. 12
                    is a section. The part AH <hi rend="italic">ha</hi> is a sort of funnel-basin,
                    which receives the water from the spout F, not in the direction pointing towards
                    the axis, but in the direction, and with the precise velocity, of its motion.
                    This prevents any retardation by dragging forward the water. The water then
                    passes down between the outer conoid AC <hi rend="italic">ca</hi> and the inner
                    conoid HG <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> along spiral channels formed by partitions
                    soldered to both conoids. The curves of these channels are determined by a
                    theory which aims at the annihilation of all unnecessary and improper motions of
                    the water, but which is too abstruse to find a place here. The water thus
                    conducted arrives at the bottom <hi rend="italic">CGcg.</hi> On the outer
                    circumference of this bottom is arranged a number of spouts (one for each
                    channel), which are all directed one way in tangents to the circumference.</p>
                <p part="N">Adopting the common theory of the re-action of fluids, this should be a
                    very powerful machine, and should raise <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 27</hi> ths of the water expended. But if we admit the
                    reaction to be equal to the force of the issuing fluid (and we do not see how
                    this can be refused), the machine must he nearly twice as powerful. We therefore
                    repeat our wonder that it has not been brought into use. But it appears that no
                    trial has been made even of a model; so that we have no experiments to encourage
                    an engineer to repeat the trial Even the late author Professor Segner has not
                    related any thing of this kind in his <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes
                        Hydraulicos,</hi> where he particularly describes the machine. Such
                    remissness has probably proceeded from fixing the attention on Euler’s improved
                    construction. It is plain that this must be a most cumbrous mass, even in a
                    small size requiring a prodigious vessel, and carrying an unwieldy load. If we
                    examine the theory which recommends this construction, we find that the
                    advantages, though real and sensible, bear but a small proportion to the whole
                    performance of the simple machine as invented by Dr Barker. It is therefore to
                    be regretted that engineers have not attempted to realize the first project. We
                    beg leave to recommend it, with a further argument taken from an addition made
                    to it by M. Mathon de la Cour, in Rozier’s <hi rend="italic">Journal de
                        Physique,</hi> January and August 1775. This gentleman brings down a large
                    pipe FEH (fig. 13) from a reservoir, bends it upward at H, and introduces it
                    into two horizontal arms DA, DB, which have an upright spindle DK, carrying a
                    millstone in the style of Dr Barker’s mill. The ingenious mechanician will have
                    no difficulty of contriving a method of joining these pipes, so as to permit a
                    free circular motion without losing much water. The operation of the machine in
                    this form is evident. The water, pressed by the column FG, flows out at the
                    holes A and B, and the unbalanced pressure on the opposite sides of the arms
                    forces them round. The compendiousness and other advantages of this construction
                    are more striking, allowing us to make use of the greatest fall without any
                    increase of the size of the machine. It undoubtedly enables us to employ a
                    stream of water too scanty to be employed in any other form. The author gives
                    the dimensions of an engine which he had seen at Bourg Argental. AB is 92
                    inches, and its diameter 3 inches; the diameter of each orifice is 1 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>; FG is 21 feet;
                    the pipe D was fitted into C by grinding, and the internal diameter of D is 2
                    inches.</p>
                <p part="N">When the machine was performing no work, or was unloaded, and emitted
                    water by one hole only, it made 115 turns in a minute; thus giving a velocity of
                    forty-six feet per second for the hole. This is a curious fact; for the water
                    would issue from this hole at rest with the velocity of 37 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>. This great
                    velocity (which was much less than the velocity with which the water actually
                    quitted the pipe) was undoubtedly produced by the prodigious centrifugal force,
                    which was nearly seventeen times the weight of the water in the orifice.</p>
                <p part="N">The empty machine weighed eighty pounds, and its weight was half
                    supported by the upper pressure of the water, so that the friction of the pivots
                    was much diminished. It is a pity that the author has given no account of any
                    work done by the machine. Indeed it was only working ventilators for a large
                    hall. His theory by no means embraces all its principles, nor is it well
                    founded.</p>
                <p part="N">We think that the free motion round the neck of the feeding pipe,
                    without any loss of water or any considerable friction, may be obtained in the
                    following manner. AB (fig. 14) represents a portion of the revolving horizontal
                    pipe, and CE <hi rend="italic">ec</hi> part of the feeding pipe. The neck of the
                    first is turned truly cylindrical, so as to turn easily, but without shake, in
                    the collar Ce of the feeding pipe, and each has a shoulder which may support the
                    other. That the friction of this joint may not be great, and the pipes destroy
                    each other by wearing, the horizontal pipe has an iron spindle EF, fixed exactly
                    in the axis of the joint, and resting with its pivot F in a step of hard steel,
                    fixed to the iron bar GH, which goes across the feeding pipe, and is firmly
                    supported in it. This pipe is made bell-shaped, widening below. A collar or hose
                    of thin leather is fitted to the inside of this pipe, and is represented (in
                    section) by LKM <hi rend="italic">mkl</hi>. It is kept in its place by means of

                    the pipe all around. There can be no leakage at this joint, because the water
                    will press the leather to the smooth metal pipe; nor can there be any sensible
                    friction, because the water gets at the edge of the leather, and the whole

                    not touch, so that the friction must be insensible. We imagine that this method
                    of tightening a turning joint may be used with great advantage in many
                    cases.</p>
                <p part="N">We have only further to observe on this engine, that any imperfection by
                    which the passage of the water is diminished or obstructed produces a saving of
                    water, which is in exact proportion to the diminution of effect. The only
                    inaccuracy that is not thus compensated, is when the jets are not at right
                    angles to the arms.</p>
                <p part="N">We repeat our wishes, that engineers would endeavour to bring this
                    machine into use, seeing many situations where it may be employed to great
                    advantage. Suppose, for instance, a small supply of water from a great height
                    applied in this manner to a centrifugal pump, or to a hair belt passing over a
                    pulley, and dipping in the water of a deep well. This would be a hydraulic
                    machine exceeding all others in simplicity and durability, though inferior in
                    effect to some other constructions.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Of Undershot Wheels.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">All wheels go by this name where the motion of the water is quicker than
                    that of the partitions or boards of the wheel, and it therefore impels them.
                    These are called the <hi rend="italic">float-boards,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >floats,</hi> of an undershot wheel. The water, running in a mill-row, with
                    a velocity derived from a head of water or from a declivity of channel, strikes
                    on these floats, and occasions, by its deflections sidewise and upwards, a
                    pressure on the floats sufficient for impelling the wheel.</p>
                <p part="N">There are few points of practical mechanics that have been more
                    considered than the action of water on the floats of a wheel; hardly a book of
                    mechanics being silent on the subject. But the generality of them, at least such
                    as are intelligible to persons who are not very much conversant in dynamical and
                    mathematical discussion, have hardly done any thing more than copied the
                    earliest deductions from the simple theory of the resistance of fluids. The
                    consequence has been, that our practical knowledge is very imperfect; and it is
                    chiefly from experience that we must still learn the performance of undershot
                    wheels. Unfortunately this stops their improvement; because those who have the
                    only opportunities of making the experiments are not sufficiently acquainted
                    with the principles of hydraulics, and are apt to ascribe differences in their
                    performance to trifling nostrums in their construction, or in the manner of
                    applying the impulse of the water.</p>
                <p part="N">We have said so much on the imperfection of our theories of the impulse
                    of fluids in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Resistance of</hi> F <hi

                    common explanations of the motions of undershot wheels. The part of this theory
                    of the impulse of fluids which agrees best with observation is, <hi
                        rend="italic">that the impulse is in the duplicate proportion of the

                <p part="N">This is the pressure acting on the float, and urging the wheel round its
                    axis. The wheel must yield to this motion, if the resistance of the work does
                    not exert a superior pressure on the float in the opposite direction. By
                    yielding, the float withdraws from the impulse, and this is therefore
                    diminished. The wheel accelerates, the resistances increase, and the impulses
                    diminish till they become an exact balance for the resistances. The motion now
                    remains uniform, and the momentum of impulse is equal to that of resistance. The
                    performance of the mill therefore is determined by this; and, whatever be the
                    construction of the mill, its performance is best when the momentum of impulse
                    is greatest. This is had by multiplying the pressure on the float by its
                    velocity. Therefore the momentum will be expressed by</p>

                    velocity of the stream. It only remains to say what is the absolute pressure on
                    the float thus circumstanced. Let the velocity <hi rend="italic">v</hi> be
                    supposed to arise from the pressure of a head of water <hi rend="italic">h.</hi>
                    The common theory teaches that the impulse on a given surface S at rest is equal

                        >h</hi> moving with the velocity v. Therefore the greatest performance of an
                    undershot wheel is equivalent to raising <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 27</hi> ths of the water that drives it to the same
                    height.</p>
                <p part="N">But this is too small an estimation; for the pressure exerted on a plane
                    surface, situated as the float of a mill-wheel, is considerably greater than the
                    weight of the column SA. This is nearly the pressure on a surface wholly
                    immersed in the fluid. But when a small vein strikes a larger plane, so as to be
                    deflected on all sides in a thin sheet, the impudse is almost double of this.
                    This is in some measure the case in a mill-wheel. When the stream strikes it, it
                    is heaped up along its face, and falls back again, and during this motion it is
                    acting with a hydrostatic pressure on it. When the wheel dips into an open
                    river, this accumulation is less remarkable, because much escapes laterally; but
                    in a mill-course it may be considerable.</p>
                <p part="N">We have considered only the action on one float, but several generally
                    act at once. The impulse on most of them must be oblique, and is therefore less
                    than when the same stream impinges perpendicularly; and this diminution of
                    impulse is, by the common theory, in the proportion of the sine of the
                    obliquity. For this reason it is maintained, that the impulse of the whole
                    stream on the lowest float-board, which is perpendicular to the stream, is equal
                    to the sum of the impulses made on all the floats which then dip into the water;
                    or that the impulse on any oblique float is precisely equal to the impulse which
                    that part of the stream would have made on the lowest float-board had it not
                    been interrupted. Therefore it has been recommended to make such a number of
                    float-boards, that when one of them is at the bottom of the wheel, and
                    perpendicular to the stream, the next in succession should be just entering into
                    the water. But since the impulse on a float by no means annihilates all the
                    motion of the water, and it bends round it and hits the one behind with its
                    remaining force, there must be some advantage gained by employing a greater
                    number of floats than this rule will permit. This is abundantly confirmed by the
                    experiments of Smeaton and Bossut. The latter formed three or four suppositions
                    of the number of floats, and calculated the impulse on each, according to the
                    observations made in a course of experiments by the Academy of Sciences, and
                    inserted by us in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Resistance of Fluids;</hi>
                    and when he summed them up, and compared the results with his experiments, he
                    found the agreement very satisfactory. He deduces a general rule, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=848" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0848-0808"
                    />that if the velocity of the wheel is one third of that of the stream, and if
                    seventy-two degrees of the circumference are immersed in the stream, the wheel
                    should have thirty-six floats. Each will dip one fifth of the radius. The
                    velocity being still supposed the same, there should be more or fewer floats
                    according as the arch is less or greater than seventy-two degrees.</p>
                <p part="N">Such is the theory, and such are the circumstances which it leaves
                    undetermined. The accumulation of the water on a float-board, and the force with
                    which it may still strike another, are too intricate to be assigned with any
                    tolerable precision: for such reasons we must acknowledge that the theory of
                    undershot wheels is still very imperfect, and that recourse must be had to
                    experience for their improvement. We therefore strongly recommend the perusal of
                    Mr Smeaton’s experiments on undershot wheels, contained in the same dissertation
                    with those which we have quoted on overshot wheels. We have only to observe,
                    that to an ordinary reader the experiments will appear too much in favour of
                    undershot wheels. His aim is partly to establish a theory, which will state the
                    relation between their performance and the velocity of the stream, and partly to
                    state the relation between the power expended and the work done. The velocity in
                    his experiments is always considerably below that which a body would acquire by
                    falling from the surface of the head of water; or it is the velocity acquired by
                    a shorter fall. Therefore if we estimate the power expended by the quantity of
                    water multiplied by this diminished fall, we shall make it too small, and the
                    difference in some cases is very great; yet, even with these concessions, it
                    appears that the utmost performance of an undershot wheel does not surpass the
                    raising one third of the expended water to the place from which it came. It is
                    therefore far inferior to an overshot wheel expending the same power; and Μ.
                    Belidor has led engineers into very mistaken maxims of construction, by saying
                    that overshot wheels should be given up, even in the case of great falls, and
                    that we should always bring on the water from a sluice in the very bottom of the
                    dam, and bring it to the wheel with as great a velocity as possible. Mr Smeaton
                    also says, that the maximum takes place when the velocity of the wheel is two
                    fifths of that of the stream, instead of two sixths according to the theory; and
                    this agrees with the experiments of Bossut. But he measured the velocity by
                    means of the quantity of water which ran past. This must give a velocity
                    somewhat too small, as will appear by attending to Du Buat’s observations on the
                    superficial, the mean, and the bottom velocities.</p>
                <p part="N">The rest of his observations are most judicious, and well adapted to the
                    instruction of practitioners. We have only to add to them the observations of De
                    Parcieux and Bossut, who have evinced, by very good experiments, that there is a
                    very sensible advantage gained by inclining the float-boards to the radius of
                    the wheel about twenty degrees, so that the lowest float-board shall not be
                    perpendicular, but have its point turned up the stream about twenty degrees.
                    This inclination causes the water to heap up along the float-board, and act by
                    its weight. The floats should therefore be made much broader than the vein of
                    water interrupted by them is deep.</p>
                <p part="N">Some engineers, observing the great superiority of overshot wheels above
                    undershot wheels driven by the same expense of power, have proposed to bring the
                    water home to the bottom of the wheel on an even bottom, and to make the
                    float-board no deeper than the aperture of the sluice, which would permit the
                    water to run out. The wheel is to be fitted with a close sole and sides, exactly
                    fitted to the end of this trough, so that if the wheel is at rest, the water may
                    be dammed up by the sole and float-board. It will therefore press forward the
                    float-board with the whole force of the head of water. But this cannot answer;
                    for if we suppose no float-boards, the water will flow out at the bot tom,
                    propelled in the manner those persons suppose; and it will be supplied from
                    behind, the water coming <hi rend="italic">slowly</hi> from all parts of the
                    trough to the hole below the wheel. But now add the floats, and suppose the
                    wheel in motion with the velocity that is expected. The other floats must drag
                    into motion all the water which lies between them, giving to the greatest part
                    of it a motion vastly greater than it would have taken in consequence of the
                    pressure of the water behind it; and the water out of the reach of the floats
                    will remain still, which it would not have done independently of the
                    float-boards above it, because it would have contributed to the expense of the
                    hole. The motion therefore which the wheel will acquire by this construction
                    must be so different from what is expected, that we can hardly say what it will
                    be.</p>
                <p part="N">We are therefore persuaded that the best way of delivering the water on
                    an undershot wheel in a close mill-course is, to let it slide down a very smooth
                    channel, without touching the wheel till near the bottom, where the wheel should
                    be exactly fitted to the course; or to make the floats exceedingly broader than
                    the depth of the vein of water which glides down the course, and allow it to be
                    partly intercepted by the first floats, and heap up along them, acting by its
                    weight after its impulse has been expended. If the bottom of the course be an
                    arch of a circle described with a radius much greater than that of the wheel,
                    the water which slides down will be thus gradually intercepted by the
                    floats.</p>
                <p part="N">Attempts have been made to construct water-wheels which receive the
                    impulse obliquely, like the sails of a common wind-mill. This would, in many
                    situations, be a very great acquisition. A very slow but deep river could in
                    this manner be made to drive our mills; and although much power is lost by the
                    obliquity of the impulse, the remainder may be very great. It is to be regretted
                    that these attempts have not been more zealously prosecuted; for we have no
                    doubt of their success in a very serviceable degree. Engineers have been
                    deterred, because when such wheels are plunged in an open stream, their lateral
                    motion is too much impeded by the motion of the stream. We have however seen one
                    which was very powerful. It was a long cylindrical frame, having a plate
                    standing out from it about a foot broad, and surrounding it with a very oblique
                    spiral like a cork-screw. This was plunged about one fourth of its diameter
                    (which was about twelve feet), having its axis in the direction of the stream.
                    By the work which it was performing, it seemed more powerful than a common wheel
                    which occupied the same <hi rend="italic">breadth</hi> of the river. Its length
                    was not less than twenty feet: it might have been twice as much, which would
                    have doubled its power, without occupying more of the water-way. Perhaps such a
                    spiral, continued to the very axis, and moving in a hollow canal wholly filled
                    by the stream, might be a very advantageous way of employing a deep and slow
                    stream.</p>
                <p part="N">But mills with oblique floats are most useful for employing small
                    streams, which can be delivered from a spout with a great velocity. Bossut has
                    considered these with due attention, and ascertained the best modes of
                    construction. There are two which have nearly equal performances.</p>
                <p part="N">1. The vanes being placed like those of a wind-mill, round the rim of a
                    horizontal or vertical wheel, and being made much broader than the vein of water
                    which is to strike them, let the spout be so directed that the vein may strike
                    them perpendicularly. By this measure it will be spread about on the vane in a
                    thin sheet, and exert a pressure nearly equal to twice the weight of a column
                    whose base is the orifice of the spout, and whose height is the fall producing
                    the velocity. Mills of this kin&lt;l are much in use in the south of Europe. The
                    wheel is horizontal, and the vertical axis carries the millstone; so that the
                    mill is of the utmost simplicity: and <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=849" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0849-0809"
                    />this is its chief recommendation, for its power is greatly inferior to that of
                    a wheel constructed in the usual manner.</p>
                <p part="N">2. The vanes may be arranged round the rim of the wheel, not like the
                    sails of a wind-mill, but in planes inclined to the radii, but parallel to the
                    axis, or to the planes passing through the axis. They may either stand on a
                    sole, like the oblique floats recommended by De Parcieux, as above mentioned; or
                    they may stand on the side of the rim, not pointing to the axis, but aside from
                    it. This disposition will admit the spout to be more conveniently disposed
                    either for a horizontal or a vertical wheel.</p>
                <p part="N">We shall conclude this article by describing a contrivance of Mr Burns,
                    the inventor of the double bucketed wheel, for fixing the arms of a water-wheel.
                    It is well known to mill-wrights that the method of fixing them by making them
                    to pass through the axle, weakens it exceedingly, and by lodging water in the
                    joint, soon causes it to rot and fail. They have therefore of late years put
                    cast-iron flanches on the axis, to which each arm is bolted; or the flanches are
                    so fashioned as to form boxes, serving as mortises to receive the ends of the
                    arms. These answer the purpose completely, but are very expensive; and it is
                    found that arms of fir bolted into flanches of iron are apt to work loose. Mr
                    Burns has made wooden flanches of a very curious construction, which are equally
                    firm, and cost much less than the iron ones.</p>
                <p part="N">This flanch consists of eight pieces, four of which compose the ring
                    represented in fig. 15, meeting in the joints <hi rend="italic">ab, ab, ab,
                        ab,</hi> directed to the centre O. The other four are covered by these, and
                    their joints are represented by the dotted lines <hi rend="italic">αβ, αβ, αβ,
                        αβ.</hi> These two rings break joint in such a manner that an arm MN is
                    contained between the two nearest joints <hi rend="italic">a'bf</hi> of the one,
                    and <hi rend="italic">α'β</hi> ' of the other. The tenon formed on one end of
                    the arm A, &amp;c., is of a particular shape: one side, GF, is directed to the
                    centre O; the other side, BCDE, has a small shoulder BC; then a long side CD
                    directed to the centre O; and then a third part DE parallel to GF, or rather
                    diverging a little from it, so as to make up at E the thickness of the shoulder
                    BC; that is, a line from B to E would be parallel to CD. This side of the tenon
                    fits exactly to the corresponding side of the mortise; but the mortise is wider
                    on the other side, leaving a space GFK <hi rend="italic">h</hi> a little
                    narrower at FK than at G <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> These tenons and mortises are
                    made extremely true to the square; the pieces are put round the axle, with a few
                    blocks or wedges of soft wood put between them and the axle, leaving the space
                    empty opposite to the place of each arm, and firmly bolted together by bolts
                    between the arm-mortises. The arms are then put in, and each is pressed home to
                    the side CDE, and a wedge HF of hard wood is then put into the empty part of the
                    mortise and driven home. When it comes through the flanch and touches the axle,
                    the part which has come through is cut off with a thin chisel, and the wedge is
                    driven better home. The spaces under the ends of the arms are now filled with
                    wedges, which arc driven home from opposite sides, till the circle of the arms
                    stands quite perpendicular on the axle, and all is fast. It needs no hoops to
                    keep it together, for the wedging it up round the axle makes the two half rings
                    draw close on the arms, and it cannot start at its joints till it crushes the
                    arms. Hoops however can do no harm when all is once wedged up, but it would be
                    improper to put them on before this be done.</p>
