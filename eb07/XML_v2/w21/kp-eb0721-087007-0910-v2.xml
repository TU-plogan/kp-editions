                    an English divine of a singular character, was born the 9th of December 1667, at
                    Norton, near Twycrosse, in the county of Leicester, where his father was rector.
                    He was admittcd of Clare Hall, Cambridge. In 1693 he took the degree of A.M.,
                    and became a fellow. He afterwards began to take pupils; but his ill health at
                    length forced him to decline this occupation. Having entered into orders, he
                    became chaplain to Dr More, bishop of Norwich, in 1694; and in this station he
                    published his first work, entitled “A New Theory of the Earth,” in which he
                    undertook to prove the Mosaic doctrine of the earth perfectly agreeable to
                    reason and philosophy. This work brought no small reputation to the author. In
                    the beginning of the eighteenth century he was made Sir Isaac Newton’s deputy,
                    and afterwards his successor, in the Lucasian professorship of mathematics; when
                    he resigned a living he had in Suffolk, and went to reside at Cambridge. About
                    this time he published several scientific works, explanatory of the Newtonian
                    philosophy; and he had the honour to be one of the first, if not the very first,
                    who rendered these principles popular and intelligible to the generality of
                    readers. About the year 1710, he was known to have adopted Arian principles, and
                    was forming projects to support and propagate them. He had translated into
                    English the Apostolic Constitutions, which favoured the Arian doctrine, and
                    which he asserted to be genuine. The consequence was, that in 1710 he was
                    deprived of his professorship, and expelled from the university. He nevertheless
                    pursued his scheme, by publishing the next year his Primitive Christianity
                    revived, 4 vols. 8vo, for which he incurred the censure of the convocation. On
                    his expulsion from Cambridge, Mr Whiston settled in London, where, without
                    suffering his zeal to be intimidated, he continued to write and propagate his
                    primitive Christianity, with as much ardour as if he had been in the most
                    flourishing circumstances. In 1721 a subscription was commenced for the support
                    of his family, and it amounted to L.470. Though he drew profits from reading
                    astronomical and philosophical lectures, and also from his publications, which
                    were very numerous, yet these of themselves would have been very insufficient;
                    nor, when augmented by the benevolence and charity of those who loved and
                    esteemed him for his learning, integrity, and piety, did they prevent his being
                    frequently in great distress. He long continued a member of the church of
                    England, and regularly frequented its service, though he disapproved of many
                    things in it; but at last he went over to the Baptists, and attended Dr Foster’s
                    meeting at Pinner’s Hall, Broad Street. Among other performances not specified
                    above, he wrote Memoirs of his own Life and Writings, which contain some curious
                    particulars.</p>
                <p part="N">He was remarkable for speaking the plainest truths on every occasion,
                    and to persons of every degree. During the year 1725, when Whiston, with Dr
                    Clarke, Dr Berkeley, and others, had the honour to attend Queen Caroline on a
                    certain day of every week, to discuss the progress of science, her majesty one
                    evening took occasion to pay him a just compliment on his truth and integrity,
                    requesting that he would, with his usual plainness, point out to her any fault
                    that he might have observed in her conduct. At first he begged to be excused,
                    adding, that few persons could bear to have their faults plainly told to them,
                    and least of all royal personages, who, from their elevation, are necessarily
                    surrounded by flatterers, to whose lips truth is a stranger. Her majesty
                    replied, that he was to consider her not as a queen, but as a philosopher; and
                    that philosophy is of very little use, if it cannot enable its professors to
                    bear without offence truths necessary to their own improvement. Upon this he
                    told her, that the greatest faιdt which he had observed in her conduct, was her
                    indecent behaviour in the house of God, which, he assured her, had made very
                    unfavourable impressions on the minds of many persons, who, coming to town from
                    distant parts of the country, had gone to the chapel to obtain a sight of her
                    majesty, the king, and the royal family. The queen made no reply; but in about
                    six weeks afterwards renewed her request, that Mr Whiston would point out the
                    most glaring improprieties in her conduct. To this he answered, that he had laid
                    down a maxim, from which he could not deviate, never to point out to any person
                    more than one fault at a time, and never to give a second reproof till he had
                    observed some good consequence to have arisen from the first.<note

                    died on the 22d of August 1752, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.</p>
