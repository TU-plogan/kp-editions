                    the author of the Epigoniad, was born in the parish of Dalmeny and county of
                    Linlithgow on the 5th of October 1721. His father was a small farmer, and was
                    not very fortunate in his worldly affairs. He however gave his son a liberal
                    education, the early part of which he received at Dalmeny school; and at the age
                    of thirteen he was sent to the university of Edinburgh, where he was soon
                    distinguished as a young man of genius. Among his fellow-students were Dr
                    Robertson the historian, Mr Home the poet, and some other eminent literary
                    characters. In the course of his education he also became acquainted with David
                    Hume and Adam Ferguson. Before he completed his studies at the university, his
                    father died, leaving him only the stock and unexpired lease of his farm, with
                    the care of three sisters, one of whom being afterwards married to an
                    experienced farmer, Wilkie availed himself of his practical knowledge. He formed
                    a system of farming which fully answered his own expectations, and secured to
                    him the approbation of all his neighbours. After becoming a licentiate of the
                    church of Scotland, he still continued his former mode of living, cultivating
                    his farm, reading the classics, and occasionally preaching for the ministers in
                    his neighbourhood. In 1753, he was presented to the living of Ratho by the earl
                    of Lauderdale, who was sensible of his worth, and admired his genius. The duties
                    of his new office he discharged with fidelity, and was celebrated for his
                    impressive mode of preaching, while he did not neglect the amusements of
                    husbandry, and the study of polite literature. In 1757 he published, at
                    Edinburgh, “The Epigoniad, a Poem, in nine books,” which is said to have been
                    the result of fourteen years study. Hume endeavoured to promote its success by
                    addressing a commendatory letter to the editor of the Critical Review. A second
                    edition of the poem was published at London in 1769. In 1759 Wilkie was elected
                    professor of natural philosophy in the university of St Andrews. His whole
                    fortune, when he removed to this place, did not exceed L.200, which he laid out
                    in the purchase of a few acres of land in the vicinity of the city. He lived at
                    St Andrews in the same studious and retired manner as he had done at Ratho. In
                    1766 the university conferred upon him the degree of D. D. He ended his poetical
                    career by publishing a volume of Fables. Lond. 1768, 8vo. After a lingering
                    illness, he died on the 10th of October 1772, having only completed the
                    fifty-first year of his age. The personal character of Dr Wilkie exhibited many
                    singularities; but the very distinguished individuals with whom he was
                    acquainted were all disposed to regard him as a man of talents as well as
                    learning. The subject of his Epigoniad was injudiciously chosen; nor is it
                    surprising that he did not acquire the reputation of a great epic poet.</p>
