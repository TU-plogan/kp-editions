                    the mechanical arts, is a cavity artificially cut, with a design to give its
                    form or impression to some softer matter applied therein. Moulds are implements
                    of great use in sculpture, foundery, and other arts. The workmen employed in
                    melting the mineral or metallic ore dug out of mines have their several moulds
                    to receive the melted metal as it comes out of the furnace; but these are
                    different according to the diversity of metals and works. In gold mines they
                    have moulds for ingots, in silver mines for bars, in copper and lead mines for
                    pigs or salmons, in tin mines for pigs and ingots, and in iron mines for sows,
                    chimney backs, anvils, caldrons, pots, and other large utensils and merchandises
                    of iron, which are here cast, as it were, at first hand.</p>

                    bells, guns, and other brazen works, are of wax, supported within-side by what
                    we call a core, and covered without-side with a cape or case. It is in the space
                    occupied by the wax, which is afterwards melted away to leave it free, that the
                    liquid metal runs, and the work is formed, being carried thither through a great
                    number of little canals, which cover the whole mould.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds</hi> of moneyers are frames full of sand, in

                <p part="N">A sort of concave moulds made of clay, having within them the figures
                    and inscriptions of ancient Roman coins, are found in many parts of England, and
                    supposed to have been used for casting money. Mr Baker having been favoured with
                    a sight of some of these moulds discovered in Shropshire, bearing the same types
                    and inscriptions with some of the Roman coins, gave an account of them to the
                    Royal Society. They were found in digging for sand, at a place called Ëyton in
                    Shropshire, about a mile from the great Watling-street Road. They are all of the
                    size of the Roman denarius, and of little more than the thickness of our
                    halfpenny. They are made of a smooth pot or brick clay, which seems to have been
                    first well cleansed from dirt and sand, and well beaten or kneaded, to render it
                    fit for taking a fair impression. There were a great many of them found
                    together, and some have not unfrequently been found in Yorkshire; but they do
                    not seem to have been met with in any other place, except at Lyons, where
                    several are said to have been discovered. They have been sometimes found in
                    great numbers joined together side by side, on one flat piece of clay, as if
                    intended for the casting of a great number of coins at once; and both these, and
                    all the others that have been found, seem to have been of the Emperor Severus.
                    They are sometimes found impressed on both sides, and several have the head of
                    Severus on one side and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> well-known reverse of his on
                    the other. They seem plainly to have been intended for the coinage of money,
                    though it is not easy to say in what manner they can have been employed for that
                    purpose, especially those which have impressions on both sides, unless it may be
                    supposed that they coined two pieces at the same time by <pb break="no"

                    three moulds, of which this was to be the middle one. If, by disposing these
                    into some sort of iron frame or case, as our letter-founders do the brass moulds
                    for casting their types, the melted metal could be easily poured into them, it
                    would certainly be a very easy method of coining, as such moulds require little
                    time or expense to make them, and therefore new ones might be supplied as often
                    as the old ones happened to break.</p>
                <p part="N">These moulds seem to have been burned or baked sufficiently to make them
                    hard; but not so as to render them porous like our bricks, whereby they would
                    have lost their smooth and even surface, which in these is plainly so close,
                    that whatever metal should be formed in them would have no appearance like the
                    sandholes by which counterfeit coins and metals are usually detected.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds</hi> of founders of small works are like the
                    frames of coiners. It is in these frames, which are likewise filled with sand,
                    that their several works are fashioned; and when the two frames of which the
                    mould is composed are rejoined, the melted brass is run.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds</hi> of letter-founders are partly of steel
                    and partly of wood. The wood, properly speaking, serves only to cover the real
                    mould which is within, and to prevent the workman, who holds it in his hand,
                    from being incommoded by the heat of the melted metal. Only one letter or type
                    can be formed at once in each mould.</p>

                    to be made, and has a rim or ledge of wood to which the wires are fastened.
                    These moulds are more usually called frames or forms.</p>

                    being covered with the earth, the workman has a mind to round or flatten his
                    vessel.</p>

                    a little jet or hole, through which the melted lead is conveyed.</p>

                    through the vice, and the grooves formed therein; and this they sometimes call
                    ingot-mould. In the other, they mould those little pieces of lead a line thick
                    and two lines broad, fastened to the iron bars. These may also be cast in the

                    frames, on which they make the tubes wherewith they fit their perspectives,
                    telescopes, and other optic machines. These moulds are cylinders, of a length
                    and diameter according to the use they are to be applied to, but always thicker
                    at one end than the other, to facilitate the sliding. The tubes made on these
                    moulds are of two kinds; the one simply of pasteboard and paper, and the other
                    of thin leaves of wood joined to the pasteboard. To make these tubes to draw
                    out, the last or innermost only is formed on the mould; each tube made
                    afterwards serving as a mould to that which is to, go over it, but without
                    taking out the mould from the first.</p>
