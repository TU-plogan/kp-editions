                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MOSES</label>, the son of Amram and Jochebed, was
                    born in the year 1571 before Christ. Pharaoh king of Egypt, perceiving that the
                    Hebrews had become a formidable nation, issued an edict commanding all the male
                    children to be put to death. To avoid this cruel decree, Jochebed, the mother of
                    Moses, having concealed her son for three months, at length made an ark or
                    basket of bulrushes, daubed it with pitch, laid the child in it, and exposed him
                    on the banks of the Nile. Thermuthis, the king’s daughter, who happened to be
                    walking by the river’s side, perceived the floating cradle, commanded it to be
                    brought to her, and, being struck with the beauty of the child, determined to
                    preserve his life. In three years afterwards the princess adopted him as her own
                    son, called his name Moses, and caused him to be diligently instructed in all
                    the learning of the Egyptians. But his father and mother, to whom he was
                    restored by a fortunate accident, were at still greater pains to teach him the
                    history and religion of his fathers. Many things have been related by historians
                    concerning the first period of Moses’s life, which are not to be found in the
                    Old Testament. According to Josephus and Eusebius, he made war upon the
                    Ethiopians, and completely defeated them; and they add, that the city Saba, in
                    which the enemy had been forced to take refuge, was betrayed into his hands by
                    the king’s daughter, who became deeply enamoured of him, when she beheld from
                    the top of the walls his valorous exploits at the head of the Egyptian army. But
                    as the truth of this expedition is more than doubtful, we shall confine
                    ourselves to the narrative of Sacred Writ, which commences at the fortieth year
                    of Moses’s life. He then left the court of Pharaoh, and went to visit his
                    countrymen the Hebrews, who groaned under the tyranny and oppression of their
                    unfeeling masters. Having perceived an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, he killed the
                    Egyptian, and buried him in the sand. But he was obliged, in consequence of this
                    murder, to fly into the land of Midian, where he married Zipporah, daughter of
                    the priest Jethro, by whom he had two sons, Gershom and Eliezar. Here he lived
                    forty years, during which time he employed himself in tending the flocks of his
                    father-in-law. Having one day led his flock towards Mount Horeb, God appeared to
                    him in the midst of a bush which burned with fire but was not consumed, and
                    commanded him to go and deliver his brethren from their bondage. Moses at first
                    refused to go, but was at length prevailed on by two miracles, which the
                    Almighty wrought for his conviction. Upon his return to Egypt, he, together with
                    his brother Aaron, went to the court of Pharaoh, and told him that God commanded
                    him to let the Hebrews go to offer sacrifices in the desert of Arabia. But the
                    impious monarch disregarded this command, and caused the labour of the
                    Israelites to be doubled. The messengers of the Almighty again returned to the
                    king, and wrought a miracle in his sight, that they might move his heart, and
                    induce him to let the people depart. Aaron having cast down his miraculous rod,
                    it was immediately converted into a serpent; but the same thing being performed
                    by the magicians, the king’s heart was more and more hardened, and his obstinacy
                    at last drew down the judgments of the Almighty upon his kingdom, which was
                    afflicted with ten dreadful plagues. The first was the changing of the waters of
                    the Nile and of all the rivers into blood, so that the Egyptians died of thirst.
                    In consequence of the second plague, the land was covered with innumerable
                    swarms of frogs, which entered even into Pharaoh’s palace. By the third plague
                    the dust was converted into lice, which cruelly tormented both man and beast.
                    The fourth plague consisted of a multitude of destructive flies which spread
                    throughout Egypt, and infested the whole country. The fifth was a sudden
                    pestilence, which destroyed all the cattle of the Egyptians, without injuring
                    those of the Israelites. The sixth produced numberless ulcers and fiery boils
                    both upon man and upon beast. The seventh was a dreadful storm of hail,
                    accompanied with thunder and lightning, which destroyed every thing that was in
                    the field, whether man or beast, and spared only the land of Goshen, where the
                    children of Israel dwelt. By the eighth plague swarms of locusts were brought
                    into the country, which devoured every green herb, the fruit of the trees, and
                    the produce of the harvest. By the ninth plague thick darkness covered all the
                    land of Egypt, excepting the dwellings of the children of Israel. The tenth and
                    last plague was the death of the first-born in Egypt, who were all in one night
                    cut off by the destroying angel, from the first-born of the king to the
                    first-born of the slaves and of the cattle. This dreadful calamity moved the
                    heart of the hardened Pharaoh, and he at length consented to allow the people of
                    Israel to depart from his kingdom.</p>
                <p part="N">Profane authors who have spoken of Moses appear to have been in part
                    acquainted with these mighty wonders. That he performed miracles, has been
                    allowed by many, by whom he was considered as a famous magician; and he could
                    scarcely appear in any other light to men who did not acknowledge him as the
                    messenger of the Almighty. Both Diodorus and Herodotus mention the distressed
                    state to which Egypt was reduced by these terrible calamities. The Hebrews,
                    amounting to the number of six hundred thousand men, without reckoning women and
                    children, left Egypt on the fifteenth day of the month Nisan, which, in memory
                    of this deliverance, was thenceforth reckoned the first month of their year.
                    Scarcely had they reached the shore of the Red Sea, when Pharaoh with a powerful
                    army set out in pursuit of them. On this occasion Moses stretched forth his rod
                    upon the sea; and the waters thereof being divided, remained suspended on both
                    sides till the Hebrews passed through dry footed. The Egyptians determined to
                    follow the same course; but God caused a violent wind to blow, which brought
                    back the waters to their bed, and the whole army of Pharaoh perished in the
                    waves.</p>
                <p part="N">After the miraculous passage of the Red Sea, the army proceeded towards
                    Mount Sinai, and arrived at Marah, where the waters were bitter; but Moses, by
                    casting a tree into them, rendered them fit for drinking. Their tenth encampment
                    was at Rephidim, where Moses drew water from the rock in Horeb, by smiting it
                    with his rod. Here likewise Amalek attacked Israel. Whilst Joshua fought against
                    the Amalekites, Moses stood upon the top of a hill, and lifted up his hands, in
                    consequence of which the Israelites prevailed, and cut their enemies in pieces.
                    They at length arrived at the foot of Mount Sinai on the third day of the ninth
                    month after their departure from Egypt. Moses having ascended several times into
                    the mount, received the law from the hand of God himself in the midst of
                    thunders and lightnings, and concluded the famous covenant between the Lord and
                    the children of Israel. When he descended from Sinai, he found that the people
                    had fallen into the idolatrous worship of the golden calf. The messenger of God,
                    shocked at such ingratitude, broke in <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193826632?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6632-0571"/>pieces the
                    tables of the law which he carried in his hands, and put twenty-three thousand
                    of the transgressors to the sword. He afterwards re-ascended the mountain, and
                    there obtained new tables of stone, upon which the law was inscribed. But when
                    he descended, his face shone so that the Israelites dared not to come nigh unto
                    him, and he was obliged to cover it with a veil. The Israelites were here
                    employed in constructing the tabernacle, according to a pattern shown them by
                    God. It was erected and consecrated at the foot of Mount Sinai, on the first day
                    of the first month of the second year after their departure from Egypt; and it
                    served the Israelites instead of a temple till the time of Solomon, who built a
                    house for the God of his fathers, after a model shown him by David.</p>
                <p part="N">Moses having dedicated the tabernacle, consecrated Aaron and his sons to
                    be its ministers, and appointed the Lévites to its service. He likewise gave
                    various commandments concerning the worship of God and the political government
                    of the Jews. This was a theocracy in the fullest extent of the word. God himself
                    governed them immediately by means of his servant Moses, whom he had chosen to
                    be the interpreter of his will to the people; and he required all the honours
                    belonging to their king to be paid to himself. He dwelt in his tabernacle, which
                    was situated in the middle of the camp, like a monarch in his palace; he gave
                    answers to those who consulted him, and himself denounced punishment against the
                    transgressors of his laws. This was properly the time of the theocracy, taken in
                    its full extent; for God was not only considered as the divinity who formed the
                    object of their religious worship, but as the sovereign to whom the honours of
                    supreme majesty were paid. The case was nearly the same under Joshua, who, being
                    filled with the spirit of Moses, under- . took nothing without consulting God.
                    Every measure, both of the leader and of the people, was regulated by the
                    direction of the Almighty, who rewarded their fidelity and obedience by a series
                    of miracles, victories, and successes. After Moses had regulated every thing
                    regarding the civil administration and the marching of the troops, he led the
                    Israelites to the confines of Canaan, to the foot of Mount Nebo; and here the
                    Lord commanded him to ascend into the mountain, whence he showed him the
                    promised land, into which he was not permitted to enter. He immediately
                    afterwards yielded up the ghost, without sickness or pain, in the one hundred
                    and twentieth year of his age, and 1451 years before Jesus Christ.</p>
                <p part="N">Moses is incontestably the author of the first five books of the Old
                    Testament, which go by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Pentateuch,</hi> and
                    which are acknowledged to be inspired, by the Jews, and by Christians of every
                    persuasion. Some, however, have denied that Moses was the author of these books,
                    and have founded their opinion on this, that he always speaks of himself in the
                    third person. But this manner of writing is by no means peculiar to Moses; it
                    occurs also in several ancient historians, such as Xenophon, Caesar, Josephus,
                    and others, who, possessed of more modesty or good sense than some modern
                    historians, whose egotism is altogether disgusting, have not, like them, left to
                    posterity a spectacle of ridiculous vanity and self-conceit. After all, it is
                    proper to observe, that profane authors have related many falsehoods and
                    absurdities concerning Moses, and also concerning the origin and the religion of
                    the Jews, with which they were in fact but little acquainted. Plutarch, in his
                    book concerning Isis and Osiris, says, that Judaeus and Hierosolymus were
                    brothers, and descended from Typhon; and that the former gave his name to the
                    country and its inhabitants, and the latter to the capital city. Others allege
                    that they came from Mount Ida in Phrygia. Strabo is the only author who speaks
                    anything like reason and truth concerning them; although he too says that they
                    were descended from the Egyptians, and considers Moses their legislator to have
                    been an Egyptian priest. He acknowledges, however, that they were a people
                    strictly just and sincerely religious. Other authors by whom they are mentioned
                    appear not to have had the smallest acquaintance either with their laws or with
                    their worship; and frequently confound them with the Christians, as is the case
                    with Juvenal, Tacitus, and Quintilian.</p>
