                            Chrysostom-Wolfgang-Theophilus</hi></label>, the illustrious musical
                    composer, was born at Salzburg, on the 27th of January 1756. He was the son of
                    Leopold Mozart, a musician in the employment of the Prince-archbishop of
                    Salzburg, and Anna Maria Perth Both parents were noted for their uncommon
                    beauty. Mozart was scarcely three years old when he manifested the most
                    astonishing disposition for music. With an instinctive perception of beauty, his
                    great delight was to seek for <hi rend="italic">thirds</hi> on the piano, and
                    nothing could equal his joy when he found this harmonious chord. At the age of
                    four his father taught him some minuets, and other pieces of music. Mozart would
                    learn a minuet in half an hour, and a longer piece in less than twice that time;
                    and immediately afterwards, he played them with remarkable clearness, and
                    perfectly in time. Before he was six, he had invented several small pieces
                    himself, and even attempted compositions of some extent and intricacy. The
                    vivacity of his mind led him to attach himself easily to every new object that
                    was presented to him. He pursued the usual tasks of childhood with ardour; and
                    when learning arithmetic, covered the tables, chairs, and walls with figures
                    which he had chalked upon them. Music, however, soon became his favourite study,
                    and in his juvenile efforts in composition, he showed a consistency of thought
                    and a symmetry of design which promised a maturity of the highest genius.</p>
                <p part="N">One day, his father returning from church with a friend, found his son
                    busy writing. “What are you doing there, my little fellow ?” he asked. “I am
                    composing a concerto for the harpsichord, and have almost got to the end of the
                    first part.” “Let us see this fine scrawl.” “No, I have not yet finished it.”
                    The father, however, took the paper, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193826827?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6827-0586"/>and showed
                    his friend a sheet full of notes, which could scarcely be deciphered for the
                    blots of ink. The two friends at first laughed at this heap of scribbling; but
                    after regarding it a little more seriously, the father’s eyes overflowed with
                    tears of joy and wonder. “Look, my friend,” said he, with a smile of delight,
                    “every thing is composed according to rule. It is a pity the piece cannot be
                    made any use of; but it is too difficult; nobody would be able to play it.” “It
                    is a concerto,” replied the son, “and must be studied till it can be properly
                    played. This is the style in which it ought to be executed.” He accordingly
                    began to play, but succeeded only so far as to give them an idea of what he
                    intended.</p>
                <p part="N">The extraordinary precocity of his son’s genius induced Leopold Mozart
                    to exhibit him at the different courts in Germany. As soon therefore as Wolfgang
                    had attained his sixth year, the Mozart family, consisting of the father,
                    mother, a young daughter who had made very considerable proficiency on the
                    harpsichord, and Wolfgang, took a journey to Munich. This expedition succeeded
                    in every respect. The young artists, delighted at the reception which they had
                    met with, redoubled their application, and acquired a degree of execution on the
                    piano, which no longer required the consideration of their youth to render it
                    remarkable. During the autumn of the year 1762, the whole family repaired to
                    Vienna, where the children performed before the court. Here they met with the
                    celebrated Wagenseil. When Mozart, who knew already how to esteem the
                    approbation of a great master, sat down to play before the Emperor Francis, he
                    asked his majesty, “Is not Μ. Wagenseil here? we must send for him; he
                    understands these things.” The emperor sent for Wagenseil, and gave up his place
                    to him at the side of the piano. “Sir,” said Mozart to the composer, “I am going
                    to play one of your concertos; you must turn over the leaves for me.”</p>
                <p part="N">Hitherto the young Mozart had only played upon the harpsichord. On his
                    return from Vienna to Salzburg, he brought with him a small violin, and amused
                    himself with it. Wenzl, a skilful violin player, came to consult Leopold Mozart
                    about some trios he had written. It was proposed to try the music. The father
                    played the bass, Wenzl the first violin, and Schachtncr, the archbishop’s
                    trumpeter, was to have played the second; but Wolfang insisted so much cn being
                    allowed to take this part, that his father at last consented to his playing it
                    on his little violin. It was the first time he had heard his son seriously
                    attempt this instrument, which, to the astonishment and delight of the party, he
                    played with marvellous precision.</p>
                <p part="N">Every day afforded fresh proofs of Mozart’s exquisite organization for
                    music. He could distinguish and point out the slightest differences of sound;
                    and every false or even rough note, not softened by some chord, was a torture to
                    him. It was from this cause that, during the early part of his childhood, and
                    even till he had attained his tenth year, he had an insurmountable horror for
                    the trumpet when it was not used merely as an accompaniment. The sight of this
                    instrument produced upon him much the same impression as that of a loaded pistol
                    does upon other children when pointed at them in sport. His father thought he
                    could cure him of this fear by causing the trumpet to be blown in his presence,
                    notwithstanding his son’s entreaties to be spared that torment; but at the first
                    blast the boy turned pale, fell upon the floor, and would probably have been in
                    convulsions if they had not immediately ceased.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1763, when Mozart was in his seventh year, his family set out upon
                    their first expedition beyond the boundaries of Germany; and it is from this
                    period that the celebrity of the name of Mozart in Europe is to be dated. They
                    visited Paris and many other cities on the Continent; and in the year 1764 came
                    to London, where the children played before the king. Mozart also played the
                    organ at the Chapel Royal; and with this the king was even more pleased than
                    with his performance on the harpsichord. During this visit, he composed six
                    sonatas, which he dedicated to the queen. He afterwards returned to France,
                    whence he proceeded to Holland and Switzerland; and on his arrival at his native
                    place in 1766, he composed, at the request of the Emperor Joseph, the music of
                    an opera-buffa called the <hi rend="italic">Finta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Semplice,</hi> which was approved of by Hasse and Metastasio. At the
                    dedication of the Church of the Orphans he composed tlιe music of the mass, and
                    directed this solemn service, in the presence of the imperial court, although he
                    was at that period only twelve years old.</p>
                <p part="N">In the month of December 1769, his father took him to Italy, and in
                    every city met with an enthusiastic reception. Young Mozart had not as yet
                    ventured out of the beaten track of composers; but, preserving the old forms of
                    melody and harmony, he wrote in a style which was particularly learned and
                    correct. His operas at this period were thought to have an air of stiffness,
                    from the cen-trapuntal knowledge which they exhibited. What principally
                    distinguished him from other composers, was the facility with which he scored,
                    and the extraordinary fluency of his ideas. It was probably, too, from reading
                    Metastasio at this period that Mozart’s taste in lyric poetry was formed; for in
                    maturer life he was fastidious in the choice of the words he set to music, and
                    the uninterrupted flow of melody and versification distinguished his airs from
                    those of any other composer. Another circumstance of the Italian tour, which
                    proved influential upon the after life of Mozart, was the daily hearing of the
                    highest and most pathetic style of church music, Italy having in the latter part
                    of the last century produced some of her greatest ecclesiastical works. In the
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Requiem,</hi> which was composed purely from love
                    of the <hi rend="italic">expressive</hi> in sacred music, we may discover the
                    result of the author’s young devotion to this branch of the art, the consequence
                    of listening to choral effects in the cathedrals of Italy.</p>
                <p part="N">Mozart having engaged to produce the first opera for the carnival of
                    Milan, our travellers proceeded to Bologna, where Wolfgang found an enthusiastic
                    admirer in Padre Martini, who was astonished to find a boy of fourteen years old
                    capable of giving answers instantly in the <hi rend="italic">rigore</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">modi,</hi> to any subject of fugue laid before him. In Rome
                    Mozart gave a miraculous attestation of his quickness of ear and extensive
                    memory, by bringing away from the Sistine Chapel the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Miserere</hi> of Allegri, a work full of imitation and repercussion, mostly
                    for a double choir, and continually changing in the combination and relation of
                    the parts. He drew out a sketch of this celebrated composition upon the first
                    hearing, and filled it up from recollection at home. He then repaired to the
                    second and last performance with his manuscript in his hat, and corrected it. He
                    afterwards produced his copy at a concert in Rome, and one of the singers who
                    sang at the performance of the <hi rend="italic">Miserere</hi> pronounced it
                    perfect. Mozart thus became famous in Rome, a city where it was most difficult
                    to excite attention in any thing relating to the fine arts, on account of the
                    numerous productions of art which were then every day presented, and formed
                    subjects of constant and familiar contemplation.</p>
                <p part="N">In December 1770, the first representation of his opera, <hi
                        rend="italic">Mitridαte Re di Ponto,</hi> took place at Milan. It met with
                    remarkable favour, and was performed twenty nights in succession. He afterwards
                    wrote several other operas, one of which, entitled <hi rend="italic">Lucio
                        Silla,</hi> was likewise represented twenty times. But the epoch at which
                    Mozart’s genius ripened may be dated from his twentieth year. Constant study and
                    practice had given him ease in composition, and ideas came thicker with his
                    early manhood. The fire, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826840?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0715-6840-0587"/> melodiousness, the boldness of harmony, the
                    inexhaustible invention, which characterize his works, were at this time
                    apparent. He began to think in a manner entirely independent, and to perform
                    what he had promised as a regenerator of the musical art.</p>
                <p part="N">Mozart produced his first great opera, <hi rend="italic">Idomeneo,</hi>
                    in his twenty-fifth year. He was then enamoured of Mademoiselle Constance Weber,
                    a celebrated actress, whom he afterwards married. The family of his mistress
                    having opposed the match, on account of his unsettled habits and situation, he
                    was desirous of showing them that, although he had no recognised rank in
                    society, he nevertheless possessed the means of obtaining consideration; and his
                    attachment to Constance supplied him with the subjects of the impassioned airs
                    which his work required. The love and vanity of the young composer, thus
                    stimulated to the highest pitch, enabled him to produce the opera of <hi
                        rend="italic">Idomeneo,</hi> which he always regarded as one of his best,
                    and from which he has frequently borrowed ideas for his subsequent works.</p>
                <p part="N">Mozart being now happily married and settled, gave himself up to his
                    profession. In 1787 he produced <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Nοzze
                        di Figaro,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">II Don Giovanni,</hi> and afterwards
                    his <hi rend="italic">Cosi fan</hi><hi rend="italic">Tutte,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">La Clemenza di Tito,</hi> an opera of Metastasio, which was
                    performed for the first time in 1792. He wrote only three German operas, <hi
                        rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Zauber-flöte,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Entführung aus dem Serail,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Der Schauspiel-direetor.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">His works composed for the stage consist altogether of twelve operas. He
                    left seventeen symphonies and instrumental pieces of all kinds, besides masses
                    and other church compositions. He was one of the first piano-forte performers in
                    Europe. He played with extraordinary rapidity, and the execution of his left
                    hand was especially admired. Haydn said, “I never can forget Mozart’s playing;
                    it went to the heart.”</p>
                <p part="N">Entirely absorbed in music, this great man was a child in almost every
                    other respect. His hands were so wedded to the piano, that he could use them for
                    nothing else. At table his wife carved for him; and in every thing relating to
                    money, or to the management of his domestic affairs, or even the choice and
                    arrangement of his amusements, he was entirely under her guidance. But, seated
                    at the piano-forte, he appeared a being of another order. His mind then took
                    wing, and his whole attention was directed to the development of his art. His
                    health was very delicate, and during the latter part of his too short life it
                    declined rapidly. At times he laboured under a profound melancholy, and in this
                    state he wrote <hi rend="italic">Die Zauberflote,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Clemenza di Tito,</hi> and his celebrated mass in D minor, commonly known
                    by the name of his <hi rend="italic">Requiem.</hi> The circumstances which
                    attended the composition of the last of these works are too remarkable to be
                    omitted in any notice of the life of Mozart.</p>
                <p part="N">One day, when his spirits were unusually oppressed, a stranger, of a
                    tall dignified appearance, was introduced. The manners of this stranger were
                    grave and impressive, and he told Mozart that he came from a person who did not
                    wish to be known, to request he would compose a solemn mass, as a requiem for
                    the soul of a friend whom he had recently lost, and whose memory he was desirous
                    of commemorating by this solemn service. Mozart undertook the task, and engaged
                    to have it completed in a month. The stranger begged to know what price he set
                    upon his work, and having immediately paid him a hundred ducats, took his leave.
                    The mystery of this visit seemed to have a very strong effect upon the mind of
                    the musician. He brooded over it for some time, and then suddenly calling for
                    writing materials, began to compose with extraordinary ardour. This application,
                    however, was more than his strength could support; it brought on fainting fits,
                    and his increasing ill ness obliged him to suspend his work. “I am writing this
                    Requiem for myself,” said he abruptly to his wife one day; “it will serve for my
                    own funeral service;” and this impression never afterwards left him. At the
                    expiration of the month, the mysterious stranger appeared, and demanded the
                    Requiem. “I have found it impossible,” said Mozart, “to keep my word; the work
                    has interested me more than I expected, and I have extended it beyond my first
                    design. I shall require another month to finish it.” The stranger made no
                    objection; but observing, that for this additional trouble it was but just to
                    increase the premium, laid down fifty ducats more, and promised to return at the
                    time appointed. Astonished at the whole proceedings, Mozart ordered a servant to
                    follow this singular personage, and if possible find out who he was; the man,
                    however, lost sight of him, and was obliged to return as he went. Mozart, now
                    more than ever persuaded that he was a messenger from the other world sent to
                    warm him that his end was approaching, applied with fresh zeal to the Requiem,
                    and, in spite of the exhausted state both of his mind and body, completed it
                    before the end of the month. At the appointed day the stranger returned; but
                    Mozart was no more. He died on the 5th of December 1791, before he had completed
                    his thirty-sixth year.</p>
                <p part="N">The distinguishing characteristic of the music of Mozart is its power of
                    touching the deepest feelings of the soul. He has been justly styled the
                    Raffaelle of music. He had many of the fine qualities and modest perfections of
                    the great painter, whom he also resembled in the fertility and variety of his
                    genius. Mozart embraced his art in its whole extent, and excelled in all its
                    departments. When, indeed, we bring into view all his qualifications as a
                    composer and a practical musician, the result is astonishing. The same man,
                    under the age of thirty-six, was at the head of dramatic, sinfonia, and
                    piano-forte music; he was eminent in the sacred style, and equally at his ease
                    in every variety, from the elaborate concerto to the simplest pieces of music.
                    He put forth about eight hundred compositions, including masses, motetts,
                    operas, and fragments of different kinds; at the same time supporting himself by
                    teaching and giving public performances, at which he executed concertos on the
                    piano-forte, the violin, the organ, or played extempore.</p>
                <p part="N">Of his operas, he esteemed most highly <hi rend="italic">II Don
                        Giovanni</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Idomeneo.</hi> He seldom spoke of his
                    own works; but of the <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni</hi> he one day observed,
                    “This opera was not composed for the public of Vienna; it is better suited to
                    Prague: but, to say the truth, I wrote it only for myself and my friends.” In
                    this extraordinary production, so remarkable for exquisite melodies and profound
                    harmonies, the playful, the tender, the pathetic, the mysterious, the sublime,
                    and the terrible, may be distinctly traced. The composer exhibits throughout the
                    work the most romantic imagination; and in the awful accompaniment to the reply
                    of the statue, we have a specimen of composition replete with terrific
                    expression, but at the same time perfectly free from inflation or bombast. The
                    ghost scene in the last act maybe considered as the greatest effort of dramatic
                    composition. Well has the style of Mozart been described as that of Shakspeare
                    in music. The fear of Leporello is painted with true comic spirit; a thing
                    rather unusual with Mozart. But melancholy is the prevailing passion in this
                    masterpiece; and so strong, so distinct, so real, is the imagery in which it is
                    presented to the soul, that minds possessed of the least enthusiasm are sure to
                    be moved.</p>
                <p part="N">We have already seen that the <hi rend="italic">Idomeneo</hi> was the
                    firstwork produced by Mozart that raised his name to celebrity as a dramatic
                    composer. This opera, and the <hi rend="italic">Clemenza di Tito,</hi> are, in
                    the opinion of judges, considered as the two best serious operas extant. His
                    opera of <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Nozze di Fi-</hi><pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193826853?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6853-0588"
                        /><hi rend="italic">garo</hi> is also much admired. In this piece, it must
                    be admitted that Mozart has changed the picture of Beaumarchais. The spirit of
                    the original is preserved only in the situations; all the characters are altered
                    to the tender and impassioned. But although the brilliant wit of the French
                    author has not been conveyed, yet, as a work of pure tenderness and melancholy,
                    entirely divested of any unsuitable admixture of the majestic and the tragical,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nozze di Figaro</hi> is unrivalled. It is difficult to
                    form any idea of the <hi rend="italic">Zauberflote,</hi> without having seen it.
                    The story, which is like the wandering of a delirious imagination, harmonizes
                    admirably with the genius of the musician. The subject of <hi rend="italic">Cosi
                        fan</hi><hi rend="italic">Tutte</hi> is unsuitable to Mozart, who could not
                    trifle with love. The tender parts of the characters in this opera are the
                    best.</p>
                <p part="N">The sacred compositions of Mozart are celebrated all over Europe, and
                    frequently performed in the Catholic churches. Of these works the most sublime
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Requiem</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but several of his
                    other masses and motetts are noted for their grandeur and beauty. His
                    symphonies, quartetts, and other works for the orchestra and stringed
                    instruments, rank in estimation with those of Haydn and Beethoven. His
                    piano-forte writings are also justly esteemed. Mozart’s sympathy was most
                    extensive; he participated with Sebastian Bach in the beauty of the fugue, with
                    Handel in the grandeur of church music, with Gluck in the serious opera, with
                    Haydn in instrumental music, and in the universality of his genius surpassed
                    them all.</p>
                <p part="N">In the exterior of Mozart there was nothing remarkable; he was
                    diminutive in person, and had a very agreeable countenance, which, however, did
                    not at the first glance discover the greatness of his genius. His eyes were
                    tolerably large and well shaped, more heavy than fiery in the expression; and
                    when he was thin they were rather prominent. His sight was quick and strong; but
                    he had an unsteady, abstracted look, except when seated at the piano-forte, and
                    then the whole form of his visage changed. His hands were small and beautiful,
                    and he used them so softly and naturally upon the piano-forte, that the eye was
                    no less delighted than the ear. His head was rather large in proportion to his
                    body, but his hands and feet were in perfect symmetry. The stunted growth of
                    Mozart’s body may have arisen from the efforts of his mind. He was always good
                    humoured, but very absent, and in answering questions seemed to be thinking of
                    something else. Mozart had six children, but two sons only survived him. His
                    widow married Μ. von Nissen, at Vienna, who published, in 1829, a full and
                    excellent biographical account of the composer. (z. z.)</p>
