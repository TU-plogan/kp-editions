                <p part="N"><label type="entry">MINAS GERAES</label>, an important interior province
                    of . Brazil, in South America. On the south it is separated from the provinces
                    of Rio and St Paulo by a mountain chain called the Serra Mantiqueira; on the
                    north the rivers Verde and Carynhenha divide it from Bahia and Pernambuco; on
                    the east it is bounded by part of Bahia, Porto Seguro, and Espiritu Santo; and
                    on the west by Goyaz. It is situated between the thirteenth and twenty-second
                    parallels of south latitude, and is above six hundred miles in length by about
                    three hundred and fifty in average breadth. This is the most mountainous
                    province in Brazil. Hills swell up in every direction, forming an elevated
                    table-land, and the country gradually assumes the features of a romantic alpine
                    region. The golden mountains traverse the whole extent of the province, but they
                    do not rise more than 4000 feet above the level of the sea; nor are they
                    characterised by rugged cliffs or gigantic rocky summits, such as the Alps or
                    Cordilleras exhibit. They consist of long series of detached ranges, having
                    agreeable campos on their summits, and are separated from one another by sloping
                    and pastoral, but not very deep valleys. Owing to the elevation of its
                    table-land, the climate of Minas Geraes is temperate when compared with other
                    countries under the torrid zone; and none of the provinces of Brazil abound more
                    with rivers and mountain torrents. Of these, the greater part have their origin
                    in the Serra Mantiqueira, and are received by four general channels. Two of
                    them, the Rio Doce and the Jequitinhonha, flow to the eastward, the former
                    irrigating the comarca of Villa Rica, and the latter that of Serro do Frio. The
                    St Francisco has a northerly course, and waters the comarca of Sahara; whilst
                    the Rio Grande, or Para, takes a westerly direction, after receiving the Rio das
                    Mortes, which gave its former name to the comarca of St Joao del Rey. The soil
                    in general is very fertile, yielding in abundance, and with little trouble, the
                    grains and fruits of Europe; besides the aromatic plants and other vegetable
                    productions characteristic of such regions, such as cotton, tobacco, sugar,
                    maize, mandioc, coffee, indigo, ipecacuana, columbo root, jalap, liquorice,
                    vanilla, various gums, and Jesuits’ bark. The grape yields a delicious wine, but
                    the inhabitants of the gold and diamond districts drink a humbler liquor, and
                    neglect their vineyards. The forests in this province have only been partially
                    explored, and they still constitute strongholds of the Indians. The trees of
                    which they consist are consequently little known, but many of them are well
                    adapted for dyeing and tanning. These arts, however, have hitherto made little
                    progress, as the inhabitants are averse to employments of this nature, their
                    attention being chiefly directed to the glittering but often useless treasures
                    found in the bowels of the earth. The adraganth, or dragon’s gum, in this
                    district, is of the best quality. The sugar-cane grows in a wild state; the
                    roads are covered with arcades formed by its branches, which reach in many parts
                    to the height of thirty feet. The cattle are allowed to go at large on the open
                    tracts of the country, and left to subsist on whatever they can find. In the
                    summer months, when the grass throughout the wide extent is withered and burnt,
                    they flock to the margins of brooks; but this resource soon fails them, and vast
                    numbers perish from hunger. This province is very rich in mineral productions,
                    and here the principal mines of gold and diamonds are situated. The following
                    metals and minerals are also found: Platina, silver, copper, iron, lead,
                    mercury, antimony, bismuth, fossilcoal, sulphur, emeralds, rubies, topazes,
                    chrysolites, sapphires, agates, aqua-marinas, amethysts, and almost all the
                    precious stones.</p>

                    drawing up an account of these, we have been chiefly indebted for information
                    regarding them to the works of Mr Mawe, Mr Luccock, and Drs Von Spix and
                    Martins. We shall follow the route of the first-named traveller from the
                    frontier to Villa Rica. At rather more than a league’s distance from the river
                    Paraibuna is Rosinha do Negro, a small village, situated, like others in this
                    part of the country which are connected with a large plantation, at the bottom
                    of a deep hollow, and by the side of a small stream. Two leagues farther on is
                    another register, called Mathias Barboza, formed by mud-walls, enclosing a large
                    area, with a gateway at each end, through which the public road passes. This
                    place is the great toll-house of Minas Geraes, and the duties collected,
                    amounting to L.25,000 annually, are every three months remitted to Villa Rica.
                    The road, which lies through extensive tracts of wood, continues to ascend in a
                    direction north-west by north; and there is a very sensible change in the
                    temperature. Amongst the trees are the pine and the common box-tree, the latter
                    attaining a height of more than twelve feet. As the road continues to ascend,
                    the trees get smaller, the heaths and ferns larger and more vigorous, and the
                    air becomes cool and fresh, except between the hours of two and four p. <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">μ.</hi> Several fazendas succeed one another at intervals
                    as the traveller proceeds on his journey to the capital. That called Mantequeira
                    is situated in a large plain, consisting of rich land, watered by numerous
                    streams, but overrun with weeds and brushwood. Some leagues further inland is
                    Barbazena, which consists of between three and four hundred houses, and where a
                    considerable traffic was at one time carried on with the interior in baize,
                    cotton goods, salt, and iron. Much of the trade, however, is now removed to St
                    John’s. Barbazena is pleasantly situated on the southern declivity of a
                    considerable hill, and here the two great roads from the mining country unite;
                    the one to the westward leading to St Joao del Rey, Sahara, and Cujaba; the
                    other in a northerly direction, conducting to Villa Rica, Tijuco, and Minas
                    Novas. In the vicinity of a place called Louza there is a hill covered with
                    micaceous iron ore, and the road for above half a mile is strewed with a rich
                    oxide of iron. At Alto de Virginia and S. Antonio do Ouro Branco are extensive
                    gold washings; but between these places and the capital the route lies oyer
                    bleak and sterile mountains.</p>
                <p part="N">Villa Rica, the capital of Minas Geraes, dates its title as a town no
                    further back than 1711, previously to which period it bore the name of Piro
                    Oreto (black gold), which is still retained by the mountain on the eastern
                    declivity of which it is situated. It occupies two hills, and part of the
                    circumjacent valley or hollow. The principal street runs for nearly two miles in
                    a straight line along the slope of the Morro. Several streets lead from the
                    lower part of the city to that situated on the high ground; and they are all
                    paved, and connected by four stone bridges. The houses are built of stone, two
                    stories high, covered with tiles, and in general white-washed. It is well
                    supplied with water from a number of public fountains distributed through the
                    town. Amongst the public buildings, some of which are not without a claim to
                    splendour, is the governor’s palace, which is situated on the highest projection
                    of the hill; and opposite is a group, of which the inhabitants are particularly
                    proud, formed by the town-house, the prison, and the theatre. In one of the
                    lower parts of the town stands the treasury, attached to which are the mint and
                    the custom-house. There are ten churches, several of which are richly
                    ornamented, and contain paintings and images. Villa Rica enjoys a very
                    considerable trade. Almost every week large convoys set out with the productions
                    of the country, consisting of cotton, hides, marmalade, cheese, precious stones,
                    bars of gold, and other articles. In exchange they bring back salt, wines,
                    calicoes, handkerchiefs, hams, iron-ware, and negroes to be employed in the gold
                    washings and other occupations. Almost all kinds ot trades are here carried on;
                    the principal are saddlers, tinmen, and blacksmiths. There are likewise
                    manufactories of gunpowder, hats, and pottery; and they spin and weave wool,
                    worsted, and cotton; but the trade of the goldsmith is prohibited. All the
                    manufactures are purely domestic: ,and the implements and modes of using them
                    are of the oldest and most unimproved description. The climate of this city is
                    delightful, being equal, it is said, to that of Naples. The range of the
                    thermometer in summer is from 64° to 80°; and in winter it rarely descends below
                    50° of Fahrenheit. From the great elevation of the city, however, it is subject
                    to sudden alternations of temperature during the course of a single day, and
                    thunder-storms are frequent. Both soil and climate are remarkably .favourable to
                    fruits and vegetables, and numerous orchards are situated on the side of the
                    mountain. The system of horticulture, however, is very bad; and, notwithstanding
                    the fertility of the country, the market is but ill supplied with culinary
                    articles. Of the population it is difficult to form an estimate, as the amount
                    is given by different travellers at from eight thousand to twenty thousand; and
                    Mr Luccock states that it is continually fluctuating. According to one
                    traveller, the greater part of the inhabitants consist of blacks and mulattoes;
                    another says there are more whites than blacks; and a third states that there is
                    a considerable proportion of Portuguese.</p>
                <p part="N">This is the very centre of the gold country, and a somewhat particular
                    description of this extraordinary spot is necessary. “To contemplate the gold
                    mines of Villa Rica with advantage,” says Mr Luccock, “it will be necessary to
                    recollect, that the land is composed of schist, or a sort of slaty clay, resting
                    upon a core of granite, gneiss, or sandstone, sometimes laminated, at other
                    times solid, the gold being scattered in small particles amid the su- .perjacent
                    schist and clay;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">Dr Von Spix, however, denominates the superjacent stratum an
                            ironstone floetz, consisting partly of clay coloured by oxide of iron,
                            but principally of lithomarge, generally of a reddish-brown colour. In
                            this mass there is a large quantity of compact brown ironstone: and also
                            detached nodules of quartz, mica slate, and, though rarely, fragments of
                            topazes. The gold in this formation occurs either in very small grains
                            and crystals within the layers of clay and lithomarge, or as a coating
                            on brown ironstone, or imbedded in it in folia. Below this ironstone
                            floetz is a species of mica slate, containing a large proportion of
                            iron; and through the mass there is disseminated a considerable quantity
                            of gold, particularly in the quartz veins by which it is traversed. Gold
                            in abundance is likewise found in other formations.</p></note><hi

                    several streams, whose waters have only one outlet by a narrow bason, cut by
                    their force through the surface down to the more firm component parts. Before
                    this outlet, called the Rio do Carino, became so deep as it is, a small lake
                    must have existed among the hills, through which all the waters of the upper
                    country passed, bringing with them and depositing in the bottom a variety of
                    heavy matter.” By this means the ground was raised, whilst the outlet was
                    deepened, until the water was entirely drained off; thus leaving the bottom dry,
                    in the shape of a level plain, composed of the debris of various kinds, mingled
                    with which was a considerable quantity of gold. This plain is surrounded by
                    mountains containing, it is supposed, much gold, notwithstanding what has been
                    washed down or extracted from them. A stream traverses the plain, and, when
                    flooded by rain, small trenches are formed on its banks, into which the water
                    runs, and, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820639?mode=fullsize"

                    or less gold is generally mingled with the mass; and on the occasion of a flood
                    the whole of the inhabitants turn out and pursue the search for the precious
                    metal. On the side of the hill the bottoms of the natural streams are searched,
                    and where these do not exist, excavations are formed, and the courses of streams
                    are turned and made to pass through them. So numerous are the perforations of
                    this kind, that the side of the mountain presents the appearance of a
                    honey-comb. The greatest quantity of gold has been found on the eastern
                    declivity of the Mono of Villa Rica, and here the search for it is conducted
                    more systematically. Sieves and raw ox hides are placed at certain distances in
                    trenches full of water, which is conducted from the summit; the first is
                    intended to stop the coarser sand, and the second is to catch the gold dust in
                    the hair, which stands erect; sometimes woollen cloths are used for this
                    purpose. The gold found here varies in colour according to the nature of the
                    other metals or minerals with which it is mixed. The Morro of Villa Rica extends
                    in a direction east and west along the valley of the Ribeiro do Oiro Preto or do
                    Carmo, to Passagem, a village containing about one hundred and fifty houses,
                    situated about two leagues from the capital. Gold mines or washings are likewise
                    situated in the vicinity of the episcopal city of Mariana (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Mariana),</hi> at the Presidio de St Joao Baptista, on the
                    Rio de San Joze, where it washes the base of the Altos de St Miguel, at the
                    aldeaof St Joze de Barra Louga, and at various other places throughout the
                    province. A district in which the beautiful fazenda of Capao is situated, is
                    that where the well-known Brazilian topazes are found. What is called the topaz
                    mine is only an open quarry, consisting of two breaks or slips in the mountain
                    side. These precious stones are found in three different places. The mine which
                    Dr Von Spix examined was a hill immediately behind the fazenda of Lana, which,
                    on one side, for a considerable breadth and to a height of sixty feet, had
                    become so softened by rains, and by water conducted upon it by art, that it had
                    become like a marsh. The soil is thrown up into long heaps with shovels, and
                    washed, by means of water conducted over it, into a narrow channel, with some
                    wooden lattices fixed in it, so that only the more solid parts remain behind,
                    which are then broken with hoes, and with the hands in search of topazes. The
                    quantity found here annually may amount to between fifty and sixty arrobas,, but
                    many of them are of an inferior, quality. The greater part of these topazes is
                    exported from this place to Rio de Janeiro, and a smaller portion to Bahia. The
                    euklase is also found here, and has attracted the attention of the mineiros
                    since mineralogists have inquired after it. This stone is in general scarce, and
                    is more frequently met with in the mine of Capao than in that of Lana. Five
                    leagues to the westward of Çapao is the iron foundery of De Prata, which
                    produces annually about one thousand arrobas of iron. The ore is a rich iron
                    glance, but particularly magnetic iron stone, the very thick beds of which stand
                    out near the foundery. The rock is mica slate. A league and a half to the
                    south-southeast of De Prata are the gold and lead mines of Senhor Romualdo Joze
                    Monteiro do Barros. The gold mine is a cream-coloured clay slate traversed by
                    auriferous veins of quartz, amongst which the metal is disseminated, along with
                    manganese. The mine of Cujabeira, in which the chromate of lead is found, is a
                    low hill of clay, scarcely a league distant from the fazenda. The red lead ore
                    is found in a vein of friable, grayish-white, granular quartz, amongst pretty
                    much integrated, white, scaly lithomarge. The crystals of the chromate of lead
                    are very small, and seldom show well-defined terminal planes. Not far from this
                    estate is the arraial of Matozinho, which contains about one hundred and fifty
                    houses, with several churches; and on the opposite side of the river Paraopeba
                    is situated Congon-has, containing about two hundred houses, and several
                    chapels, one of which, although small in dimensions, vies in the splendour of
                    its ornaments with any ecclesiastical edifice in the country. It has indeed been
                    designated the Loretto of Brazil. ìn external appearance it is not more than
                    respectable, but the interior decorations and emblazonry, consisting of the
                    precious stones of Brazil, are on the most splendid scale. Eight miles to the
                    north-east of Marianna is the arraial of Antonio Perreira, where gold mines are
                    situated; but we must now quit the land of gold for the land of diamonds,
                    situated in the comarca of Serro do Frio.</p>
                <p part="N">The comarca of Serro do Frio is divided from that of Villa Rica by the
                    river Doce. Villa do Principe, the capital, is situated about one hundred and
                    ten miles northnorth-east of Marianna, close upon the confines of the diamond
                    district. Like the other provincial capitals of Minas, this town has its
                    smelting-house, with the usual appointments, its ouvidor, who holds also the
                    office of mint master, and a <hi rend="italic">juiz de fora.</hi> It contains a
                    church, five chapels, and about five thousand inhabitants, a considerable
                    portion of whom are shopkeepers, the rest being artizans, farmers, and miners.
                    The country around Villa do Principe is very fine and open, being free from
                    those impenetrable forests which occur so frequently in other parts of the
                    province. The climate is mild and salubrious; the soil is productive, yielding
                    Indian corn, legumes, cotton, and sugar. A few leagues beyond this town the
                    aspect of the country changes, and the district in which Tejuco is situated is
                    sterile and unproductive. This town is irregularly built on the side of a hill,
                    and contains a church, several chapels, and a number of shops stocked with
                    English cottons, baizes, and cloths, with other kinds of manufactured goods.
                    What is termed the diamond ground extends about sixteen leagues from north to
                    south, and about eight from east to west; and several thousand negroes, who are
                    superintended by about two hundred whites, are employed in searching for the
                    precious mineral. The largest of the diamond works, called Mandango, is situated
                    on the river Jequitinhonha, which in this part is about nine feet deep, and
                    about as broad as the Thames at Windsor. .Mr Mawe has minutely described the
                    process by which the diamonds are obtained, the chief object of his visit being
                    to examine the mines. The part of the river which was then worked was a curve or
                    elbow from which the current had been diverted by means of a canal. The deeper
                    parts of the channel were laid dry by means of chain-pumps worked by a
                    waterwheel, and the <hi rend="italic">cascalho</hi> was then removed by means of
                    machinery. This stratum of debris consists of similar materials to that found in
                    the gold district. During the dry season sufficient cascalho is dug up to occupy
                    all the hands during the rainy months. This gravelly matter is washed in troughs
                    placed under sheds erected for the purpose. The negroes are formed into working
                    parties called troops, containing two hundred each, under the direction of an
                    administrator and inferior officers. Besides the precious stone, which is
                    principally sought, gold is found in the debris. Diamonds are by no means
                    peculiar to the beds of rivers or deep ravines; they have been found in cavities
                    and water-courses, even on the summits of the loftiest mountains. They of course
                    vary exceedingly in size. Some are so small that four or five are required to
                    weigh one grain, consequentlysixteenor twenty to the carat. There are seldom
                    found more than two or three diamonds of from seventeen to twenty carats in the
                    course of a year; and not once in two years is there found throughout the whole
                    washings a stone of thirty carats. There are other diamond works in this comarca
                    besides Mandango, particularly those of Monteiro, and those situated on the Rio
                    Pardo. Thirty-five leagues from Tejuco, in a north-easterly<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193820652?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0652-0111"/> direction,
                    is Tocaya, the principal place in the district of Minas Novas. The road to it
                    runs nearly parallel with the Jequitinhonha, in the numerous rivulets flowing,
                    into which river are found white and blue topazes, aqua-marinas, and the
                    chrysoberyl, a stone held in high estimation in Brazil. Twenty-five miles
                    north-north-east of Villa do Principe is the town of Fanado or Bom Succeso, in
                    the neighbourhood of which diamonds of an inferior quality are found. There are
                    several other arraials in this comarca, amongst which may be mentioned Bara do
                    Rio das Velhas, a place of considerable commerce, and, but for its insalubrity,
                    likely to become one of the largest places in the province.</p>
                <p part="N">The great river San Francisco is the boundary line between the comarca
                    of Serro do Frio and that of Paracatu. This almost Unknown district, prior to
                    1815, was included in the comarca of Sahara. A new ouvidor was then appointed
                    for the township and circuit of Paracattf, the villages of Desemboque and Araxa
                    being subsequently detached from the comarca of Villa Boa in Goyaz, and annexed
                    to the new ouvidoria. Paracatu do Principe, the only town, owes its origin to
                    its mines, first discovered in 1744. These consist of gold and lead; but
                    diamonds have also been found in some places.</p>
                <p part="N">The comarca of Sahara, which-formerly included all the western part of
                    Minas Geraes north of the comarca of Rio das Mortes, takes its name from its
                    head town, the Villa Real do Sahara. This town stands near the confluence of the
                    small river of the same name with the Das Velhas, about thirty-five miles
                    north-north-west of Marianna, and is surrounded with mountains. About twelve
                    miles from Sahara there is said to be a tepid lake, two miles in length by one
                    in breadth. It has acquired the name of the Holy Lake, from its waters having
                    been found to possess medicinal virtue in various diseases. Fifteen miles north
                    of Sahara is the flourishing parish of St Luzia, which contains a considerable
                    population, and is ornamented with five Roman Catholic temples. The only towns
                    in the comarca besides Sahara are Villa Nova da Raynha, better known by its
                    Indian name of Caethe, containing about 5000 inhabitants; it is twelve miles
                    east-south-east of Sahara, and has in its suburbs good potteries; and Pi-tangui,
                    situated on the right margin of Para, about eighty miles west-north-west of
                    Sahara. Its inhabitants, about 20,000 in number, breed horses, cattle, hogs, and
                    sheep, and cultivate cotton and the sugar-cane.</p>
                <p part="N">The comarca of St Joao del Rey or Rio das Mortes occupies the southern
                    extremity of the province adjoining those of St Paulo and Rio. It is itself
                    larger than the whole kingdom of Portugal, and the land is for the most part
                    rich and fertile in a high degree. From March to November the climate is fine
                    and dry, the nights being sometimes sharp and frosty. Ice is occasionally
                    formed, and snow falls, but they disappear before the noon-day sun. About the
                    middle of November the rainy season is ushered in by violent thunder and
                    lightning. Rain comes invariably from the south, and in continued damp weather
                    the air is unpleasantly cold. The Villa St Joao del Rey, antecedently called Rio
                    das Mortes, is a handsome little town, surrounded by a bulwark of romantic hills
                    and broken rocks, with tracts entirely sterile, and others covered with the most
                    luxuriant verdure. Its situation is so agreeable and central, that an intention
                    was once formed of making it the capital. There are in St Joao about 6000
                    inhabitants, of whom only one third are white people, the rest being negroes and
                    mulattoes. For their employment and support there are no manufactures, except a
                    small one of hats of a peculiar kind. In the adjoining country a large quantity
                    of woollen cloth is made from native produce, and serves for ordinary clothing.
                    Yet the trade of St Joao del Rey must be considerable; for Dr Von Spix informs
                    us that four constantly employed caravans, each of fifty mules, annually go
                    backwards and forwards to the capital, conveying thither bacon, cheese, some
                    cottons, woollen hats, horned cattle, mules, and gold bars; and bringing back in
                    return European goods, chiefly Portuguese and English, such as calicoes,
                    handkerchiefs, lace, iron-ware, wine, porter, and liqueurs. The gold mine, to
                    which the town owes its origin and celebrity, and whence such masses of mineral
                    wealth have been extracted, is situated within the town. It is nothing more than
                    a deep pit, and is now little resorted to. St Joao del Rey is situated eighty
                    miles south-west of Villa Rica, about the same distance south-south-west of
                    Sahara, and upwards of two hundred miles north-west of Rio. The population of
                    Minas Geraes has been computed at between six and seven hundred thousand
                    inhabitants, of whom nearly a fourth are slaves. Indians are found only upon the
                    eastern confines of the province, or in the impenetrable forests of the Serra do
                    Alar.</p>
