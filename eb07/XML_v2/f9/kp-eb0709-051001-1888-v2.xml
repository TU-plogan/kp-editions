                    LL.D., a distinguished philosopher and historian, was born at Logĩerait, in the
                    Highlands of Perthshire, on the 20th of June 1723. His father, the Reverend Adam
                    Ferguson, a native of the neighbouring parish or Moulin, had been minister of
                    Crathie and Braemar, in Aberdeenshire, from 1700 to 1714; but, on the eve of the
                    rebellion under the Earl of Mar, had been translated to Logierait, where he
                    passed the remainder of his long life, discharging the duties of his laborious
                    charge with such exemplary piety, fidelity, and firmness, that, though at the
                    period of his induction the parishioners were almost universally hostile to
                    presbyterian principles, he speedily secured the respect and admiration of all
                    ranks; and, till the close of his incumbency in 1754, retained a degree of
                    influence which proved that his knowledge of mankind was not inferior to his
                    zeal for their religious improvement. This excellent man left a numerous family,
                    of whom Adam was his youngest son, by Mary Gordon, daughter of Mr Gordon of
                    Hallhead, in Aberdeenshire.</p>
                <p part="N">It is believed that Adam received the first part of his education at the
                    village school of his native parish, under the superintendence of Mr John
                    Connacher, of whose literary attainments little can now be ascertained. Whatever
                    may have been the merits of this teacher, they do not seem to have been
                    estimated so highly as those of the schoolmasters of Dunkeld and Perth; to one
                    or other of which places it was at this time customary for the parishioners of
                    Logierait to send such of their sons as they wished to prepare for a course of
                    academical study. Two, at least, of Mr Ferguson’s younger sons attended the
                    grammar-school of Perth, between the years 1732 and 1738, whilst Mr James Martin
                    was rector, and Mr Andrew Cornfute one of the assistants. Under the tuition of
                    these able and diligent instructors, Adam is said to have made uncommon progress
                    in classical literature; and in addition to the benefit which he derived from
                    his teachers, he possessed the advantage of living under the protection of a
                    respectable citizen, Mr William Ferguson, his relative, a merchant in the town,
                    and at one time chief magistrate or provost.</p>
                <p part="N">Towards the end of autumn 1738, when he had entered into his sixteenth
                    year, he was removed from school to the University of St Andrews, where his
                    father had commenced his studies fifty years before, under a very meritorious
                    regent, Mr John Row, son of the minister of Ceres; who, being grandson of the
                    well-known David Ferguson, minister of Dunfermline, was induced, by the claims
                    of kindred as well as of duty, to pay particular attention to the improvement of
                    a youth whom he soon discovered to be highly deserving of his favour. It so
                    happened that one of the colleagues of Mr Row was still a master of St Leonard’s
                    College, and that all the other masters were of nearly the same standing with
                    the elder Mr Ferguson, who was thus confirmed in his preference of the college
                    in which he had prosecuted his own philosophical studies. At this very juncture
                    the principal of St Leonard’s College died, and the other professors, at whose
                    almost unanimous recommendation Mr Tullideph was appointed to the vacant chair,
                    anticipated the most prosperous results from his efforts to promote the good of
                    an establishment which they considered as having fallen into disrepute, in
                    consequence of the feeble and undignified administration of his
                    predecessors.</p>
                <p part="N">The Greek class in St Leonard’s College was at this time taught with
                    great reputation by Mr Francis Pringle, who had obtained his office in 1699;
                    but, though no other teacher of that language in Scotland could pretend to rival
                    him, the average number of students who were received annually under his charge,
                    from 1738 to 1747, did not exceed eleven; whilst the average of entries to the
                    corresponding class in St Salvator’s College scarcely amounted to six. Adam
                    Ferguson was enrolled in Mr Pringle’s class as a ternar, the same rank of
                    students which, in the days of Buchanan, was characterized by the term <hi
                        rend="italic">pauper</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is to say, one who
                    pays the lowest rate of fees. It has been alleged that Ferguson, after a
                    comparative trial, was admitted one of the foundation bursars, having stood
                    first in the list of successful competitors. If it were so, the victory was not
                    very splendid, as, of the twelve who entered the class along with him, not more
                    than eight (being of the denomination of ternars) could have been permitted to
                    take a share of the contest.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides Pringle, the other masters in St Leonard’s College were, John
                    Craigie, admitted professor of philosophy in 1691; Ninian Young, professor of
                    humanity, and Henry Rymer, professor of philosophy, both admitted in 1709; and
                    David Young, professor of philosophy, admitted in 1716. Before the end of the
                    session 1739, Charles Gregory, professor of mathematics, resigned in favour of
                    his son David, who, though a very ordinary man, was the most popular teacher of
                    geometry ever known in that university, which had many years before numbered
                    amongst its professors the inventor of the reflecting telescope.</p>
                <p part="N">The method of teaching in St Leonard’s College at this period did not
                    materially differ from that which had been pursued in the former century. The
                    professors in general followed the beaten track in which they had been guided by
                    their predecessors; and the tasks which they exacted from the students were
                    little more than exercises of memory. A young man of slender abilities might
                    easily distinguish himself as much as his most ingenious associates, who, on the
                    other hand, might be apt to underrate acquirements which were more accessible to
                    plodding industry than to original talents. We have good reason to believe that
                    Ferguson acquired little more at this seminary than a high admiration of the
                    Grecian and Roman literature, to the beauties of which he was more nearly
                    introduced than he had hitherto been; and that his advances in the knowledge of
                    philosophy were all made at a subsequent period. Even under the vigilant and
                    severe inspection of Principal Tullideph, the discipline of the college was by
                    no means effective; and, in Mr Pringle’s class particularly, some of the young
                    gentlemen conducted themselves so improperly as to have narrowly escaped the
                    disgrace of being refused their degrees, after they had undergone the usual
                    trials. Mr Ferguson obtained the degree of master of arts on the 4th of May
                    1742, when he had nearly completed his nineteenth year. The regent under whom he
                    finished his course of physical study was Mr David Young, who used as a text
                    book Keill’s <hi rend="italic">Introductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">veram Physicam.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The minister of Logierait had attempted to induce some of his other sons
                    to follow his own profession; but as they had all testified a disinclination to
                    this line of life, he determined to breed his youngest son to the church, and
                    accordingly he was sent to the divinity hall at St Andrews, in November 1742,
                    when the theological department o study was superintended by Principal Murison
                    and Professors Shaw and Campbell, the last of whom, a man oftalcnts an learning,
                    was well known by his writings; but, like seve of his predecessors in the same
                    chair, he scarcely ever ec tured at all. Mr Ferguson studied also a year or two
                    a Edinburgh under Professors Gowdie and Cuming; but ı» attention appears to have
                    been chiefly given to pursuι s not immediately connected with his clerical

                    the usual period, an appointment was offered to him, which he could not hold
                    without ordination. It was, in feet, represented to the General Assembly that
                    Lord John Murray, colonel of the Highland regiment (the 42d), was desirous of
                    having a chaplain of the communion of the Church of Scotland possessed of the
                    Erse language; and that Mr Adam Ferguson, though he had not studied divinity for
                    the full period of six years, was pitched upon for that office, provided the
                    Assembly would allow the presbytery of Dunkeld to take him on trials. The
                    Assembly, in respect of the young man’s capacity and good character, authorized
                    the presbytery to ordain him on passing bis first trials, and accordingly he was
                    ordained at Dunkeld, on the 2d of July 1745. A few days afterwards he joined the
                    regiment, in which he continued to serve till 1757; about die beginning of which
                    year he was elected keeper of the Advocates’ Library, on the resignation of the
                    celebrated David Hume. About a year after, Mr Ferguson was succeeded in this
                    office by Mr William Wallace, junior, advocate.</p>
                <p part="N">In the course of the year 1757, Mr Ferguson rendered himself conspicuous
                    by the interest which he took in the success of the tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Douglas,</hi> written by his friend Mr Home. He published a defence of the
                        <hi rend="italic">morality of stage plays,</hi> which, though its merit is
                    not of the highest order, was admitted by the opposite party to be “the only
                    piece on that side that was written with any tolerable degree of discretion.”
                    After Mr Home resigned his living in June 1757, Mr Ferguson and he retired to
                    country lodgings at Braid, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, where they spent
                    several months in a course of laborious study, enlivened by the intercourse of
                    friendship. As Mr Ferguson’s campaigning habits had reconciled him to a
                    migratory life, it is not easy to trace him through all his changes of
                    residence. During his father’s lifetime he had great satisfaction in making
                    occasional excursions to the Highlands, and thinking aloud in his solitary
                    walks, amidst the lakes and forests of Rannoch, or on the summit of his native
                    mountains, where one of the most magnificent prospects in nature was displayed
                    before his eyes. It was here that the lofty enthusiasm of his spirit was nursed
                    and matured; and it was not so much in the intercourse with polished society as
                    in the wilds of Athole that he acquired that dignity and ease of manner for
                    which he was distinguished above most of the literary men of his country. To use
                    his own expressive words: “If I had not been in the Highlands of Scotland, I
                    might be of their mind who think the inhabitants of Paris and Versailles the
                    only polite people in the world. It is truly wonderful to see persons of every
                    sex and age, who never travelled beyond the nearest mountain, possess themselves
                    perfectly, perform acts of kindness with an aspect of dignity, and a perfect
                    discernment of what is proper to oblige. This is seldom to be seen in our cities
                    or in our capital; but a person among the mountains, who thinks himself nobly
                    born, considers courtesy as the test of his rank. He never saw a superior, and
                    does not know what it is to be embarrassed. He has an ingenuous deference for
                    those who have seen more of the world than himself; but never saw the neglect of
                    others assumed as a mark of superiority.”</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1759 he was elected professor of natural philosophy in the
                    University of Edinburgh, in the room of Dr John Stewart. He had not made
                    physical science the principal object of his inquiries; and indeed he had not
                    studied it much more attentively than most young men do m the common routine of
                    academical instruction. But with only fo∏r months to prepare for the labours of
                    the winter, ŋ qualified himself so well as to give universal satisfaction.</p>

                    years, and by <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> apting his lectures to the
                    capacities of the young, contrived to render the study more interesting than it
                    had been commonly considered. At this time he was a member of the well-known <hi
                        rend="italic">Select Society</hi> of Edinburgh, instituted in 1754, for the
                    purpose of promoting philosophical discussion, and training the members to the
                    practice of public speaking. The ardour of this society did not begin to
                    languish till the year 1762, when another association, equally celebrated, was
                    formed by the literary circle of Edinburgh, the design of which was to rouse the
                    country to demand from the legislature the establishment of a militia in
                    Scotland. Mr Ferguson may almost be considered as the founder of this society;
                    and it was at his suggestion that it received a name (<hi rend="italic">The
                        Poker)</hi> which was sufficiently significant in the ears of the initiated,
                    but utterly unintelligible by strangers. His satirical pamphlet entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">The History of Sister Peg,</hi> was intended to forward the
                    object of this patriotic society; and it is perhaps the only production
                    connected with that cause, which, at this distance of time, is capable of
                    exciting any interest.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1763 Mr Ferguson was applied to by the Earl of Warwick, to take
                    charge of his two younger sons, the Honourable Charles and Robert Greville,
                    whose eldest brother, Lord Greville, had received part of his education under
                    the eye of Principal Robertson. These young gentlemen resided some years in his
                    house, and both they and their tutor Mr Macpherson repaid his attention to their
                    improvement by the warmest affection and gratitude. Lord Warwick, who had been
                    advised by General Clerk to place his sons under Mr Ferguson’s care, was not
                    insensible of the “great benefit they had reaped from his tuition, and
                    advantageous as well as manly and friendly conversation.” Mr, afterwards Sir
                    John, Macpherson, at the same time acknowledged, that “to him he owed all his
                    knowledge, as well as all his success in life.”</p>
                <p part="N">On the appointment of Mr Balfour to the professorship of the law of
                    nature and nations in 1764, Mr Ferguson was elected by the magistrates of
                    Edinburgh to succeed him in the chair of moral philosophy. This had long been a
                    favourite object of his ambition; and about ten years before, when the able and
                    accomplished Mr Cleghorn was on his death-bed, he urged his young friend to
                    apply for the office, which, in his apprehension, no man was more capable of
                    adorning. Mr Cleghorn, after expressing his regrct at having no such influence
                    with the patrons as to secure such an arrangement, added, as Mr Ferguson
                    sometimes related with much emotion, “I can only say of you, as Hamlet did of
                    Fortinbras, <hi rend="italic">Hehas my dying voice?</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Mr Ferguson entered on his new duties with a degree of spirit and
                    activity, from which the most splendid results were to be anticipated. In one
                    particular his mode of lecturing was singular, and not easily imitated. After
                    having delineated the general plan of his course, and committed it to writing,
                    he resolved not to write a system of lectures, but to endeavour to make himself
                    master of every part of his subject, and to trust to the moment of delivery for
                    the expression of his sentiments. This method of discoursing was in his hands
                    very happily executed; but its success depended, in a great measure, on the
                    state of his health and spirits, as well as upon the interest excited by the
                    different subjects of discussion. Perhaps no lecturer, with the exception of his
                    immediate successor, was ever more admired. His class was crowded by great
                    numbers of gentlemen of high rank and official station, as well as by younger
                    students. In the mean time, eagerly as he applied to the discharge of his
                    professional duties, his attention was extended to other branches of inquiry;
                    and within little more than a year after he commenced his labours as a lecturer
                    on morals, he sent to the press his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the History of
                        Civil Society,</hi> a work which was received with an expression of public
                    approbation which even exceeded the <pb break="no"

                    He was not able to prevail on the patrons to accept of a substitute to complete
                    the labours of that session; but after obtaining leave of absence for the next
                    session, he joined his young charge at Geneva in May 1774, and at first
                    entertained hopes that his labours might prove beneficial. The connection,
                    however, was not so agreeable as he expected, and it terminated about twelve
                    months afterwards. In the mean time, he had very nearly been deprived of his
                    office in the university. The towncouncil had, at his desire, appointed Mr John
                    Bruce, then assistant and afterwards successor to Mr Stevenson, to teach the
                    moral philosophy during the session 1774-1775 but before the conclusion of the
                    session they thought fit to rescind this act, and to declare the office vacant.
                    His friends in the university, particularly Drs Robertson, Blair, and Black,
                    were exceedingly indignant at this proceeding; more especially as Sir John
                    Pringle had been permitted to be several years absent; and at that very time the
                    professors of mathematics and of the theory of medicine had both been allowed to
                    discharge their duty by substitutes for two years without challenge or
                    complaint. As the council, however, seemed to have determined to fill up the
                    place by a new election, it became necessary for his friends to apply to the
                    Court of Session to put a stop to their proceedings. “I have been much obliged,”
                    says he, in a letter to a friend, “to the general voice that was raised in my
                    favour, as well as to the ardent zeal of particular friends. Hay Campbell
                    (afterwards Lord President) has given me proofs of friendship which I can never
                    forget. Pulteney has behaved to me in every thing as he would have done at the
                    beginning <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Poker Club. I have always been an
                    advocate for mankind, and am a more determined one than ever; the fools and
                    knaves are no more than necessary to give others something to do.”After his
                    return, he continued, as formerly, to divide his time between his literary and
                    agricultural pursuits, and engaged occasionally in the political controversies
                    which agitated the country during the progress of the American war. Besides his
                    pamphlet in answer to Dr Price’s observations on liberty, he communicated his
                    views from time to time to Sir William Pulteney, and other members of
                    parliament; and when it was resolved by government to send out commissioners to
                    quiet the disorders in the colonies, he was appointed secretary to the
                    commission. It appears from a letter of General Putnam, dated July 1778, that
                    the nomination of Dr Ferguson was very agreeable to the more intelligent part of
                    the Americans, who, not without reason, were dissatisfied to find that the
                    commissioners were fettered by restrictions, which rendered their appointment
                    nugatory. “I am very sorry,” he writes, “that the parliament of Great Britain is
                    still so blind to their own and our interest, as to send Dr Ferguson and the
                    rest of the worthy gentlemen over to America with limited power, and that to
                    last only till July 1779, and then to be revoked by them if they think fit; by
                    which means I am deprived of seeing your friend Dr Ferguson, which gives me
                    great pain, as 1 always have heard of his being a gentleman of the first
                    character for learning, good sense, and humanity.” It is well known that the
                    commissioners returned without accomplishing the object of their mission; but
                    they had an opportunity of acquiring more useful information of the state and
                    temper of the country' than government had received in al the previous course of
                    the contest. Whilst Dr Ferguson was absent duringthe session 1778-1779, hisplace
                    wassuρ-plied by Mr Dugald Stewart, who, about five years afterwards, was
                    destined to succeed him in the chair ofmora philosophy.In the year 1780 he was
                    seized with an attack of apoplexy» which, though not violent, was nevertheless
                    sufficient high expectations of his friends. “Ferguson’s book,” says Mr Hume,
                    writing to Dr Robertson from London, “goes on here with great success.” Gray the
                    poet says, <hi rend="superscript"> ζζ</hi> There are uncommon strains of
                    eloquence in it; and I was surprised to find not one single idiom of his country
                    (I think) in the whole work.” Mr Hume, in a letter to the author, (dated 10th
                    March 1767), congratulates him on the success of the book, adding that he had
                    “met with nobody that had read it who did not praise it. Lord Mansfield is very
                    loud to that purpose in his Sunday societies. I heard Lord Chesterfield and Lord
                    Lyttleton express the same sentiment; and, what is above all, Caddel, I am told,
                    is already projecting a second edition of the same quarto size.” Mr Hume then
                    informs him, that Lord Shelburne and Lord Bute were amongst his most zealous
                    partisans; the last declaring the book one of the best he had ever read. Charles
                    Townshend appears to have been of the same opinion, as he read it five
                    times.</p>
                <p part="N">General Clerk had pressed the author to dedicate his work to Lord
                    Shelburne, who had signified his intention of offering Mr Ferguson the
                    government of West Florida; upon which occasion his lordship laughed very
                    heartily, when the general expressed his conviction that Mr Ferguson was more
                    usefully employed as a teacher of science. The book, however, appeared without
                    any dedication. In the course of the following year, Lord Shelburne intimated a
                    hope of getting Mr Ferguson established with a proper appointment at Oxford; and
                    some other persons of influence meditated a design of employing him in one of
                    the departments of state. This purpose was frustrated in all probability by a
                    temper which did not permit him to accommodate himself to the views of those
                    whose maxims of conduct he did not entirely approve. Another circumstance may be
                    considered as having also operated to obstruct the fulfilment of the schemes
                    which were devised for his advancement. At this time he married Miss Burnet, a
                    young lady nearly connected with his mother’s family, and still more nearly
                    related to his intimate friend Dr Black. Soon afterwards he began to cultivate a
                    farm in the parish of Currie, and, at a considerable sacrifice of private
                    interest, gratified his taste for improvement, by transforming a barren heath
                    into a scene which became distinguished for beauty and fertility.</p>
                <p part="N">It was impossible, however, for any combination of circumstances to
                    abate his literary activity; and he not only continued to conduct the business
                    of his class with unremitted diligence, but seized every interval of leisure
                    which he could command, to collect materials for a history of the Roman
                    commonwealth. Whilst he was proceeding in his researches, he was solicited by
                    Philip, Earl of Stanhope, the editor of Dr Robert Simson’s posthumous works, and
                    the other guardians of Charles, Earl <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Chesterfield, to
                    superintend the education of that young nobleman, then in his nineteenth year.
                    The negotiation was conducted through the mediation of Dr Adam Smith, who,
                    judging the offer to be advantageous to his friend, exerted himself with great
                    earnestness to induce him to accept it. Lord Stanhope was extremely anxious to
                    obtain the able services oi Dr Ferguson without delay, as he conceived it to be
                    of the utmost consequence to his young kinsman to be placed under the care of “a
                    person so well qualified to complete the remaining part of his education, and to
                    repair the neglects, omissions, and errors, which had unfortunately been
                    committed in the former part of it.” The proposal had originally been made early
                    in the year 1773, and was renewed in December, soon after the commencement of
                    the session of the college, when Dr Ferguson was engaged not only in teaching
                    his own class, but also in lecturing on natural philosophy, the professorship of
                    which had recently become vacant by the death of his relation <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193751927?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1927-0513"/>alarm his
                    friends for his safety. This formidable affection did not in the slightest
                    degree impair the force of his understanding; and so abstemious did he
                    afterwards become, as not only to secure himself against the recurrence of the
                    disease, but to enjoy almost uninterrupted health for more than thirty years. As
                    he could not now venture to lecture as formerly without the use of written
                    notes, he therefore found it necessary to write out a course of instruction to
                    be read during the remainder of his incumbency. In his endeavours to recover the
                    substance of his lectures, he availed himself of the notes taken by intelligent
                    young men, who had studied under him different sessions, and who might thus be
                    expected to have preserved the various modes in which he had stated his
                    doctrines, and the different arguments and illustrations by which he had
                    happened to supply in one session what might have been omitted in another. But,
                    in the prospect of soon relinquishing his office, it was scarcely conceivable
                    that the compilation which he thus executed could possess all the excellencies
                    which he was capable of imparting to it; more especially as he was now busy in
                    carrying his great historical work through the press. This was the <hi
                        rend="italic">History of the Progress and Termination of the Homan
                        Republic,</hi> in three volumes quarto, published in 1783, a book which not
                    only delights by the clearness of its narrative and the boldness of its
                    descriptions, but instructs and animates by profound and masterly delineations
                    of character, as well as by the philosophical precision with which it traces the
                    connection of events. It is written in that tone of high-minded enthusiasm,
                    which, if it can only snatch from oblivion whatever is noble and generous in the
                    record of human actions, regards the graces of style as objects merely of
                    secondary account, and is chiefly studious of impressing the lessons of wisdom
                    which may be gathered from the survey of distant ages.</p>
                <p part="N">The fatigues and anxieties of public teaching now became oppressive to
                    his spirits, and not altogether favourable to his health; and he therefore
                    deemed it expedient to resign his office in 1784, when he had completed his
                    sixty-first year. Mr Dugald Stewart, then professor of mathematics, succeeded to
                    his office; and in order to entitle Dr Ferguson to retain his salary, he was
                    conjoined in the professorship of mathematics with Mr Playfair. He now proceeded
                    to revise the notes of his lectures on ethics and politics, with a view to
                    publication; and in 1792 the work appeared, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Principles of Moral and Political Science.</hi> Though composed under
                    disadvantageous circumstances, and though he has omitted many of the questions
                    which were treated in his elementary course, it contains an admirable view of
                    the systems both of ancient and modern philosophers, particularly respecting the
                    foundations of moral approbation, and the sources of private happiness and
                    public security. The authors to whose suggestions he was most indebted were
                    Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle, amongst the Greeks, Cicero and Seneca amongst
                    the Latins, Epictetus and Antoninus amongst the later scholars of the Grecian
                    school; and, amongst the moderns, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Montesquieu, and Adam
                    Smith. It has been considered as a blameable omission in this work, that too
                    slight notice is taken of the importance of religious principle; and the author,
                    ' <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. <hi rend="superscript"> act, seems</hi> 1° have
                    been aware that he had exposed himself to this objection. No man, however, was
                    ever more anxious to establish the foundations of natural theology, and to
                    strengthen the arguments for a future state; subjects on which the work abounds
                    in passages of uncommon beauty.</p>
                <p part="N">After the publication of this work, Dr Ferguson, now in <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ιs</hi> seventieth year, resolved to pay a visit to the
                    ancient Metropolis of the world. He passed a short time at some o the principal
                    cities of Europe, Berlin, Vienna, Florence, <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ple⅛,
                    and Venice, and resided part of the winter 1793 at Rome, in all of which places
                    his reception was extremely 1 flattering. He was elected a member of the Academy
                    of Berlin, as well as of other learned societies. Upon his return to Britain in
                    1794, he took up his residence at Nidpath Castle in Tweeddale, from which he
                    soon removed to Hallyards in Manor Water. In this agreeable retreat he spent the
                    next fourteen years of his life, a longer period than he had ever before resided
                    in any one place. At last, however, when his sight and his hearing had in a
                    great measure failed, he deemed it advisable to settle in a town, where he might
                    occasionally enjoy the conversation of intelligent friends; and his early
                    prepossessions induced him to settle at St Andrews. Here his strength gradually
                    declined, but the vigour of his mind continued unimpaired as long as he lived.
                    No man took a more lively interest in the great events which were then passing
                    in the world, or contemplated more anxiously the consequences of the arduous
                    struggle in which his country was engaged. He lived long enough to witness the
                    triumphant issue of the contest; and after a short illness, he died on the 22d
                    of February 1816, in the ninety-third year of his age, leaving three sons and
                    three daughters.</p>
                <p part="N">In the various situations which it was his lot to occupy, he had
                    uniformly conducted himself with a dignity and decision which bespoke the
                    elevation and force of his mind. As a military chaplain, he happily united the
                    strict decorum of the clerical character with the unembarrassed address of a man
                    of the world; so that he at the same time secured the respect of the officers
                    and the devoted attachment of the private soldiers. It was while accompanying
                    the army on different expeditions, one of the first of which was an
                    ill-conducted descent on the coast of Bretagne in 1745, that he applied his mind
                    to study the art of war; and it cannot be denied that he excels particularly in
                    the description of military evolutions. In private life his conversation was
                    easy and elegant, and, among his intimate friends, en-liveneα by a fascinating
                    gaiety and refinement of humour. He was not very patient of contradiction,
                    however, and rather apt to testify his contempt of assumed superiority.</p>

                    great mass of letters and other valuable documents had been indiscriminately

                    eminent experimental philosopher, mechanist, and astronomer, was born in
                    Banffshire, Scotland, in 1714. His parents were very poor. At an early age,
                    however, his extraordinary genius began to unfold itself. He first learned to
                    read by overhearing his father teach his elder brother; and he had made this
                    acquisition before any one suspected he had done so. He soon discovered a
                    peculiar taste for mechanics, which first indicated itself on seeing his father
                    use a lever; and having pursued this study a considerable time, even when very
                    young, he at length made a watch in wood work, from having once seen one. As he
                    had no instructor, nor any help from books, every thing he learned had all the
                    merit of an original discovery; and such in fact he very naturally believed it
                    to be. As soon as his age permitted he went out to service; but he met with
                    hardships in this humble capacity, which rendered his constitution feeble
                    through life. Whilst he was servant to a farmer, whose goodness he acknowledges
                    in the modest account of himself which he prefixed to his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mechanical Exercises,</hi> he frequently contemplated the stars; and he
                    began the study of astronomy by laying down, from his own observations alone, a
                    celestial globe. His kind master observing these marks of his ingenuity,
                    procured him the countenance and assistance of some neighbouring gentlemen, by
                    whose help and instructions he went on acquiring further knowledge, and was at
                    length sent to Edinburgh. There, having obtained some notion of drawing, he
                    began to take portraits in miniature, by which means he supported himself and
                    family for several years, both in Scotland and England, whilst engaged in
                    pursuing more serious studies. In London he first published some curious
                    astronomical tables and calculations, and afterwards gave public lectures on
                    experimental philosophy, which he repeated in most of the principal towns in
                    England with general approbation. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society
                    without paying for admission; and he had a pension of L.50 per annum given him,
                    unsolicited, by King George III. on his accession, who had heard his lectures,
                    and who frequently sent for and conversed with him on curious topics. Ηe also
                    received several presents from his majesty, and from other patrons of merit. The
                    degree of consideration which Mr Ferguson attained by the strength of his
                    natural genius alone is in fact known to every one. He was universally
                    considered as at the head of astronomy and mechanics in this nation of
                    philosophers; and he might justly be styled self-taught, or rather
                    heaven-taught; for in his whole life he had not received above half a year’s
                    instruction at school. He was a man of the clearest judgment and the most
                    unwearied application to study; benevolent, gentle, and innocent in his manners
                    as a child; humble, courteous, and communicative; and, instead of pedantry,
                    philosophy seemed to have produced in him only diffidence and urbanity. He died
                    in 1776, at the age of sixty-two.</p>

                    1805, a valuable edition of his Lectures was published at Edinburgh by Dr, now
                    Sir David, Brewster, in two volumes 8vo, with notes and an appendix, intended to
                    adapt the whole to the actual state of science.</p>

                    Scottish poet, who acquired a considerable share of celebrity at a very early
                    period of life, was born at Edinburgh on the 5th of September 1750 or 1751. His
                    father, whose name was William, paid court to the muscs as well as the son; but
                    he wisely relinquished the study of poetry for the more certain emoluments of
                    trade and commerce, and was employed in different mercantile houses both in
                    Edinburgh and in Aberdeen. He was an accountant in the Linen Hall when he died,
                    but never acquired any thing like an independent fortune.</p>
                <p part="N">The subject of this notice was of a weak and delicate constitution
                    during infancy, so much so, indeed, that small hopes were entertained of his
                    ever reaching the years ot manhood. Yet such were the care and attention of his
                    parents, that he was able to attend an English school by the time he was six
                    years of age, when his progress was considered as very extraordinary; and it
                    proved no less rapid at the High School of Edinburgh, which he attended for four
                    years, acquiring a competent knowledge of the Latin tongue with very little
                    labour or exertion. He then went to the grammar school of Dundee, and in two
                    years afterwards to the university of St Andrews, which his father preferre to
                    Edinburgh, because a gentleman of the name of Ferguson had left two bursaries
                    for the education of as many boys of the same name. <hi rend="subscript">

                <p part="N">Ferguson’s health was never at anytime impaired y severe study; yet he
                    kept alive at the university the opinion which had been entertained of him
                    whilst at schoo, an he was decidedly the first mathematician of his own stant
                    ing. He was patronized by Dr Wilkie, professor of ∏a u^ ral philosophy, but
                    better known as the author of the <hi rend="italic">Ρ goniad,</hi> who conceived
                    an attachment for him, as ∏&gt; perhaps for his poetical as his mathematical
                    talents, kindness was repaid by Ferguson, on the death o Wilkie, by a beautiful
                    eclogue to his memory; writ n <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751953?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0709-1953-0515"/>the Scottish dialect. A little before he left
                    the university, ' Ferguson had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the
                    death of Sir William Wallace, for which he had collected materials; but as he
                    subsequently met with a work on the same subject, he abandoned the design, after
                    he had completed two acts. His own reason for so doing is thus expressed:
                    “Whatever I publish shall be original, and this tragedy might be considered as a
                    copy.”</p>
                <p part="N">He returned to Edinburgh when he had finished his studies, without
                    having fixed on any particular employment; for although he was destined for the
                    church by his father, on the death of the latter he paid but little attention to
                    the expostulations of his mother. Hc also declined to enter on the study of
                    physic, assigning as a reason, that when he read the description of diseases, he
                    believed that he felt the symptoms of them all in himself. He was, however,
                    induced to attempt the study of the law, in which, as might have been expected,
                    he made no proficiency. He secms, however, to have turned a wishful eye to some
                    sinecure place, in order to obtain which he paid a visit to an uncle who resided
                    at Aberdeen, a man of literature and opulence, hoping that, through his
                    influence, he might be settled in a manner suited to his merit. But in this
                    expectation he was completely disappointed; for although his uncle at first
                    showed him every mark of attachment, his fondness decreased by degrees, and in
                    six months he desired his nephew in an abrupt manner to leave his house, without
                    attempting to procure for him any kind of living.</p>
                <p part="N">His necessities at this period were so great that he copied papers in
                    the commissary clerk’s office for so much per sheet, an employment which he soon
                    left in disgust. His exuberant wit, equalled only by his good nature,
                    thoughtlessness, and social propensities, made all who knew him receive him with
                    affection; but his powers of song and talents for mimicry often led him into the
                    company of the dissipated, whose example could not fail to do him essential
                    injury, and who had neither the power nor the inclination to provide for him
                    through life. The irregularities in which he was thus led to indulge often
                    awakened in him the reproaches of conscience; and the conversation of a
                    minister, who understood his manner of life, appears to have made a deep
                    impression on his mind. His remorse indeed soon afterwards assumed the
                    appearance of absolute despair. His sprightliness entirely forsook him; but he
                    gradually recovered from this despondency, and his health was at length fully
                    restored. Soon afterwards he cut his head so severely in consequence of a fall,
                    that he became delirious from the loss of blood; and in this condition he
                    remained for some months, till the want of sleep and perpetual talking put a
                    period to his existence on the 16th of October 1774. He was buried in the
                    Canongate churchyard. Over his grave a monument was erected by Robert Burns, who
                    loved his genius, and naturally sympathized with failings akin to his own. Had
                    Ferguson united prudence with his abilities, he would have no doubt risen to
                    distinguished eminence in the literary world. His poems in the Scottish dialect
                    have been universally admired by his countrymen; and when we reflect that they
                    were composed in the intervals of dissipation, they must be considered as
                    unequivocal evidences of his genius.</p>
