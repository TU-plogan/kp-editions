                <p part="N"><label type="entry">FINISTERRE</label>, a maritime department of France.
                    It is bounded by the sea on three sides, and on the east by the departments of
                    the Côte du Nord and of Morbihan. It is in the shape of a triangle, and extends
                    over 2890 square miles, or, according to the Almanac-Royal, 693,384 hectares, of
                    which 252,704 are under the plough, 106,281 are in fallow, 23,389 are pasturel
                    and, 148,364 are woods, 35,868 are waste, 56,414 are covered with lakes and
                    estuaries, 22,267 are the beds of rivers and harbours, and the remainder roads,
                    and the sites of cities, towns, and villages. The surface is very unequal,
                    consisting of chains of hills running through the peninsula, some reaching the
                    height of 1000 feet, with valleys between them of various extent.</p>
                <p part="N">The civil divisions are into five arrondissements, forty-three cantons,
                    and 287 communes, inhabited by 452,450 persons. The inhabitants are a distinct
                    race from the French, and mostly speak the old language of the Brey-zarđs, the
                    name by which they are distinguished. They are obstinate in their adherence to
                    old and antipathy to new customs. Their clothing is little altered in the last
                    thousand years, which in form and colour varies in each place, thus showing the
                    dwelling of each person. There are whole communes in which no individuals are to
                    be found who can read or write. They live either in scattered houses or small
                    hamlets, and more than 25,000 houses are so wretched in appearance when seen,
                    that they resemble the huts of savages. They are mostly hidden behind hedges and
                    banks, and only visible by the smoke which issues from the doors, for they have
                    neither chimneys nor windows. The cattle and the families live together in a
                    state of disgusting filth. The females, who are commonly very ugly, are
                    oppressed by their labour, and so contemptuously treated that they are not even
                    suffered to eat with the men.</p>
                <p part="N">With all this they are said to be hospitable, upright, brave, and
                    patriotic, and content with their barley bread, milk, and (but of late years)
                    potatoes. The agriculture is in a backward state, and produces less corn than is
                    required for the consumption; and since the population has increased, severe
                    scarcity would be annually felt but for the introduction of potatoes, which are
                    now extensively cultivated. The sheep, cows, and especially the horses, are
                    diminutive; but the swine are fine and numerous.</p>
                <p part="N">The inhabitants of the towns in general are more like the other parts of
                    the French nation. Those on the coast pursue the fisheries with success,
                    especially that for sardinias. The only mines are those of lead, in which silver
                    is found mixed with that metal. In two mines, at Poul-lalouen and Huelgoet, 900
                    workmen are employed, who raise yearly 600 tons of lead, and from it extract
                    26,000 ounces of silver.</p>
                <p part="N">In some parts, especially at Morlaix, there are some manufactories of
                    linen, sail-cloth, twine, cordage, and paper. At that port also the surplus
                    productions of the soil are exported to other portions of the kingdom, as well
                    as to foreign parts.</p>
