                    Baron Cuvier has remarked, is the result of observation; it is a product of
                    analysis, or what is termed in physics an empyrical formula; but its accuracy is
                    demonstrable by the inverse method, for, when once duly perceived, we may in a
                    great measure deduce from it a knowledge of the entire nature of the beings to
                    which it is applied. Being vertebrated, they must be possessed of an internal
                    skeleton; of a brain and spinal marrow, enclosed in a vertebral column; of
                    muscles exterior to the bones; of four extremities only; and of the organs of
                    the first four senses, situate in the cavities of the head; with other relations
                    not necessary to be here named.</p>
                <p part="N">The greater portion of the surface of the earth is covered by the waters
                    of the translucent sea; and wherever continents and the larger islands protrude
                    their rocky bulk, we find them coursed by flowing rivers, or intersected by
                    lakes and marshes. These present in their aggregate an enormous mass of waters,,
                    and afford protection and nourishment to myriads of living creatures, probably
                    superior in number, and in no way inferior in beauty, to those which inhabit the
                    earth. On land, the matter susceptible of life is mainly employed in the
                    construction and continuance of vegetable species; from these herbivorous
                    animals draw their nourishment; and this being animalized by assimilation,
                    becomes an appropriate food for the carnivorous kinds, which scarcely amount to
                    more than one half of the terrestrial creatures of all classes. But in the
                    liquid element, and more especially among the saline waters of the ocean, where
                    the vegetable kingdom is so much more restricted, almost all organized
                    substances are pervaded by animal life, and each lives at the expense of some
                    smaller or feebler foe. There we meet not only with the greatest and most
                    wonderful variety of forms, but also with the extremes in respect to size,—from
                    the myriads of microscopic monads, which, but for artificial means, must have
                    remained for ever invisible and unknown, to the ponderous whale, which surpasses
                    by twenty times the bulk of the largest elephant. There, too, we may discover
                    the majority of those magnificent combinations of organic structure, on the
                    relations of which naturalists have established the distinction of classes, or
                    great primary groups,—in other words, the sea may be said to contain
                    representatives of each; for, even among birds, those aerial creatures which
                    usually inhabit so light an element, we find species so constructed as to dwell
                    almost for ever on its waves. The mammiſerous class is still more fully
                    represented in the numerous tribes of seals, morses, manaties, and whales, all
                    of which require a moist abode, and some of which immediately perish when
                    deprived of it. Most reptiles are aquatic, many insects are so, more
                    particularly in their larva state; and almost all the Mollusca, the Annelides,
                    the Crustacea, and Zoophytes,—four great classes, which on terra firma are few
                    and far between,—exist in countless numbers in the waters of the ocean. Hence
                    that ancient dictum recorded by Pliny, “Quicquid nascatur in parte naturae ulla,
                    et in mari esse; praeterque multa quae nusquam alibi.”</p>
                <p part="N">But amongst all the teeming wonders which vivify the vast expanse and
                    liquid depth of waters, none so predominate, or are so truly characteristic, as
                    the subjects of our present treatise; nor are any more worthy of our devoted
                    consideration, whether we regard the beauty or eccentricity of their forms, the
                    metallic splendour of their colours, or the innumerable benefits which, through
                    the foresight of Providence, they confer upon the human race. We therefore deem
                    it incumbent upon us to exhibit an ample view of the present condition of
                    Systematic Ichthyology; but before doing so, we shall endeavour to add to the
                    interest of the subject by a few general observations.</p>
                <p part="N">We may state, in the first place, that we here intentionally refrain
                    from any bibliographical inquiry, or historical exposition of the progress of
                    Ichthyology. If such were complete, or even ample, it would occupy too much of
                    that space which we deem more usefully devoted to the actual condition of our
                    subject-matter. We more willingly set that department aside, when we consider
                    how perfectly it has been presented by Baron Cuvier.<note anchored="true"

                            our predecessors in ency-clopaedic labour, in having as a guide in so
                            difficult a subject as that on which the reader is about to enter, the
                            first nine volumes of Baron Cuvier’s signal publication. We should act
                            unwisely were we to present a crude compendium of the works of foreign
                            and British writers, such as has hitherto sufficed for publications
                            similar to that in which we are now engaged. We prefer adhering
                            throughout to Cuvier’s system of arrangement, as one which, without
                            doubt, is entitled to supersede all others hitherto proposed. We shall
                            also avail ourselves, wherever our doing so seems likely to instruct the
                            reader, of whatever general or miscellaneous information is scattered
                            through his work, presenting it in a form and sequence the most
                            advantageous to those unacquainted with the voluminous original; and
                            adding, especially in relation to our native species, whatever we find
                            of interest in recent authors, among whom, as elucidators of “British
                            Fishes,” Messrs Couch and Yarrell stand pre-eminent. We beg to make this
                            general acknowledgment of the infinite advantage we have derived from
                            Baron Cuvier’s labours, in the formation of the present treatise, in
                            reference both to our introductory and systematic portions.</p></note>
                    We shall, however, briefly allude to what may be regarded as the principal
                    epocha in the progress of Ichthyological Science. During many remote ages it
                    consisted, in common with all the kindred branches of human knowledge, of
                    nothing more than a few partial and disjointed observations. Aristotle, about
                    350 years before the Christian era, made some progress towards connecting these
                    together as a body of doctrine; but still it was a feeble body, reposing upon
                    truths (perceived indeed with surprising skill when we consider the scanty data)
                    as yet obscurely known and vaguely expressed, owing to the entire absence of all
                    proper standards for the distinction of species. For more than eighteen hundred
                    years ensuing, those who wrote on natural history can scarcely be regarded in
                    any other light than as either copiers or commentators of Aristotle; but about
                    the middle of the sixteenth century, Belon, Rondelet, and Salviani, the true
                    founders of modern Ichthyology, made their appearance (we mean as authors), by a
                    singular coincidence, almost precisely at the same time,—the first in 1553, the
                    second from 1554 to 1555, and the third from 1554 to 1558. Differing from their
                    compiling predecessors, they <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939778?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-9778-0152"/>saw and examined for themselves, and made
                    drawings from nature, if not with the elegant accuracy of modern days, at least
                    with a recognisable exactness. Yet, true to the genius of their time, they
                    continued to attach much more importance to the ascertainment of the names which
                    the species bore in the classical pages of antiquity, than to the composition of
                    their history, as it were afresh, by the light of nature and their own
                    knowledge. Nevertheless they rectified as well as extended the observations of
                    Aristotle, and laid a positive base or new foundation of the subject, by figures
                    and descriptions of a certain number of well-determined species. About the close
                    of the seventeenth century, Willughby, and his illustrious friend John Ray, gave
                    for die first time a history of fishes, in which the species were not only
                    clearly described from nature, but distributed in accordance with characters
                    drawn solely from their structure, and in which we are no longer unnecessarily
                    burdened with inapplicable passages from either Greek or Roman writers. Finally,
                    about the middle of the eighteenth century, Artedi and Linnaeus completed what
                    the others had commenced, by establishing well-defined generic groups,
                    consisting of ascertained species precisely characterised. From that period it
                    may be said that no radical defect existed, nor any obstacle in the way of a
                    gradual perfecting of the system, which could not be overcome by zeal, accuracy,
                    and perseverance. Nevertheless it is to the genius of Baron Cuvier that we owe
                    the gigantic stride which has been made in our own more immediate days. Prior to
                    1815, the methods of almost all the modern systematic writers were little else
                    than modifications, variously disguised, of the Linnaean system,—that is, with
                    alterations, generally for the worse, of the nomenclature of the illustrious
                    Swede. They darkened knowledge by a multiplicity of vain words ;—and when any
                    principle of classification was brought forward,—if new, then it was untrue to
                    nature,—if true to that beautiful abstraction, then it was already familiar as
                    household words. But forty years assiduously devoted to Ichthyology,—that is, to
                    a deep study of all preceding authors, to a constant ascertainment of whatever
                    could be gathered of the habits of fishes, and to the formation of an unrivalled
                    museum of comparative anatomy, where both their outward and internal forms were
                    perfectly displayed,—convinced the great French naturalist that many
                    heterogeneous groups still formed portions of our ichthyological system, and
                    that a salutary reformation might consequently be effected in numerous minor
                    details.</p>
                <p part="N">It was obvious, from an attentive consideration of the subject, that the
                    differences of both external and interior organs, by which fishes might be
                    distinctly characterised, were not less numerous than decided; and⅛ that in
                    truth there were few classes of created beings among which it was more easy to
                    recognise the existence of natural groups. But with a view to dispose of the
                    genera and families in a becoming order, it was necessary to seize upon a small
                    number of important characters, from which might result certain great divisions,
                    not likely to break up natural relations, and yet sufficiently precise and
                    perceptible to leave no doubt as to the place of each species. This was a
                    principal desideratum, and one which the industry and perseverance, not less
                    than the genius and high attainments, of Cuvier, have gone so far to
                    satisfy.</p>
                <p part="N">The numerous characters held in common by the chondropterygian or
                    cartilaginous fishes were too remarkable to have escaped detection by those who
                    loved and sought for the light of system. Thus all Ichthyologists have agreed in
                    the formation for these fishes of a separate order; but the Baron has observed,
                    that almost all have likewise injured the justness of their ordinal division, by
                    a combination of certain species which resembled the true cartilaginous kinds
                    merely in the softness of their skeleton. Thus the genera <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lophius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cyclopterus,</hi> except in that
                    softness, do not differ in any respect from the ordinary osseous fishes, and
                    therefore ought not to be withdrawn from them. But there are others which, in
                    addition to the softness of their bones, present peculiar characters in their
                    tegumentary system, in their teeth, and especially in the disposition of the
                    skeleton of the head, which render their immediate union with either of the
                    great groups of osseous or cartilaginous fishes a matter of greater doubt and
                    difficulty. Such, for example, are the genera <hi rend="italic">Tetrodon,
                        Diodon, Ostracion,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Balistes.</hi> The <hi
                        rend="italic">Syngnathi,</hi> or pipe-fish, likewise present, in their
                    peculiar branchiae, distinctive characters of great importance. The remarkable
                    external aspect of these different genera had long induced the majority of
                    naturalists to separate them from the others; but it so' happened also that the
                    same majority were by no means fortunate in discovering the true characters of
                    separation. Thus Artedi not only re-united them to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Eophii</hi> and lump-fish, in the order of branchiostegous fishes, but he
                    established that entire order on a false supposition—to wit, that they possessed

                    incompleteness of their branchiae,—a vague expression, and indeed contestable in
                    almost all the genera. Pennant combined them with the Chondropterygii, under the

                <p part="N">Baron Cuvier’s great object thus became, to disentangle, as it were,
                    those anomalous groups, or at least to separate all such as seemed to differ
                    sufficiently from the type of ordinary fishes to authorize such separation. His
                    next object was the discovery of precise characters, capable of being clearly
                    expressed in words. This examination soon convinced him that such genera as <hi
                        rend="italic">Lophius, Cyclopterus, Centriscus, Mormyrus,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Macrorhynchus,</hi> had been erroneously withdrawn from the
                    great group of ordinary <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939791?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-9791-0153"/>fishes, from which in fact they essentially
                    differed in nothing. But he satisfied himself that the singular genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Syngnathus,</hi> of which the form and economy are so
                    remarkable, were distinctively characterised by their branchiae, in the form of
                    tufts (hence the title of <hi rend="italic">lophobranchial</hi> fishes),
                    concealed beneath an opercle which permits the water to escape only by a small
                    opening towards the nape of the neck; and that the genera <hi rend="italic"
                        >Diodoη, Tetrodon, Ostracion,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Balistes,</hi>
                    independently of the singularity of their general form, and the incompleteness
                    of their skeleton, have the jaws, and in general all the bones of the head,
                    somewhat differently arranged from the corresponding parts in the generality of
                    fishes, the upper jaw and the palatine bones being articulated with each other,
                    and with the vomer, by immoveable sutures—a structure which leaves them much
                    less freedom in the opening of their mouths, and is also the cause (in
                    connection with the tightness of the tegumentary envelope which lastens down the
                    branchial apparatus) of so many naturalists having failed to perceive that the
                    genera in question were furnished with rays and opercula like other species.</p>
                <p part="N">But these groups once separated, there remained nine tenths of the whole
                    class of fishes, among which the first great distinctive division which presents
                    itself is, into such as have soft fins, or of which the rays are branched and
                    articulated, and into such as have spiny fins, of which a portion of the rays
                    consist of pointed bones without branches or articulation,—two primary
                    divisions, corresponding to the great groups named respectively <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Malacopterygπ</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Acanthopterygii</hi> by Artedi. Even this principle of classification is
                    not universally prevalent; for, in its practical application, we are obliged to
                    keep out of view the first rays of the dorsal and pectoral fins in certain
                    species of the genera <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Silurus,</hi> in which these rays exhibit strong and solid spines, although
                    we still class them with the Malacopterygii, or soft-finned division.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">These spines,
                            however, as Cuvier remarks, are formed, in the two genera above named,
                            by the agglutination of a multitude of smaller parts, of which the
                            articulations, though not obvious, are perceptible.</p></note> In like
                    manner, there are, among the other great division, corresponding exceptions to
                    the acanthopterygian character, as in the blennies and certain Labridae, of
                    which the spines are so small, so feeble, or so few in number, as almost to
                    escape detection. However, if the principle referred to is not quite precise in
                    relation to these slight anomalies, it is on the whole well founded, and
                    certainly does not force us to separate numerous species which nature has
                    approximated.</p>
                <p part="N">The same cannot be asserted of those distinctions which naturalists have
                    sought to establish on other principles, nor of those on which so many of the
                    secondary divisions have been founded. Thus the general form of the body, and
                    the absence of the ventral fins, the characters assumed by Ray, anterior to
                    those deduced from the spines, force a heterogeneous grouping of the eels, the
                    gobies, the Syngnathi, the Xiphias, and the moon-fish. Linnaeus was the first
                    (in the tenth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic"

                            very slightly, or even not at all, touched upon, in consequence of their
                            having been already detailed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Comparative Anatomv</hi> of this work. (See vol. iii. p. 1,
                            &amp;e.) We deemed it more advisable that the reader should be made to
                            incur the slight inconvenience of referring occasionally to a separate
                            treatise, than that the present publication should be burdened by a
                            repetition of the same subject.</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">The form and structure of fishes are as admirably adapted for rapid
                    movement through the water, as are those of birds for that aerial motion called
                    flight. Suspended in a liquid element of almost equal specific gravity with
                    themselves. external organs resembling those of birds in size would have been
                    disproportioned and unnecessary; but the air-bladder (the functions of which, by
                    no means entirely understood, have never been satisfactorily explained in all
                    their bearings) is known to possess the power of contraction and dilatation, the
                    exercise of which is followed by a corresponding descent or ascent of the
                    animal’s body. Thus a small, central, and inconspicuous organ effects, in the
                    easiest and most simple manner, the same object which even the soaring eagle or
                    giant condor can only attain by great exertion of the wings, and after laborious
                    and frequently repeated gyrations. We shall ere long, however, have occasion to
                    observe, that the air-bladder, although essential to the economy of such species
                    as possess it, is by no means indispensable to the class of fishes, as in many
                    tribes it is entirely wanting.</p>
                <p part="N">Fishes being without a neck, and the part called the tail for the most
                    part equalling at its origin the portion of the trunk from which it springs, the
                    prevailing shape is somewhat uniform, diminishing gradually towards either end.
                    Doubtless, however, a vast variety of form is exhibited in a class which is now
                    calculated to contain from six to eight thousand collected species. Of these
                    forms a sufficiently accurate idea may be acquired by inspecting the numerous
                    plates which accompany the present treatise, and we shall therefore not attempt
                    any further verbal illustration of the subject, although we shall add a few
                    notices regarding the general aspect and character of the principal external
                    parts.</p>
                <p part="N">The mouth of fishes either opens from beneath, as in the rays, or at the
                    extremity of the muzzle, as in the majority of the class, or from the upper
                    surface, as in <hi rend="italic">Uranoscopus.</hi> It also varies greatly in its
                    relative dimensions, from the minute perforation of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Centriscus,</hi> to the vast expansion of the angler fish.</p>
                <p part="N">Exteriorly only two of the organs of the senses are visible, the
                    orifices of the nostrils and the eyes. The former may be simple, as in the rays
                    and sharks, or double, as in the generality of osseous fishes; and they differ
                    in their position in relation to the jaws, the eyes, or the extremity of the
                    muzzle. The eyes vary extremely in respect to size in the different species, and
                    even sometimes disappear entirely beneath the skin; and they also differ greatly
                    in their position, being usually placed laterally, one on each side of the head,
                    although in <hi rend="italic">Uranoscopus</hi> (as the name implies) they look
                    upwards, and in most of the flat fishes they both occupy the same side.</p>
                <p part="N">In regard to those important organs, the branchiae or gills, a single
                    family alone, the chondropterygian fishes, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192939804?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9804-0154"/>are
                    characterised by having their exterior margin fixed to the skin, with as many
                    openings for the issue of the water as there are intervals between the branchiae
                    themselves; but all other fishes have the external margin of the branchiae free,
                    and the water which enters the mouth escapes by the opening of the
                    gill-covers.</p>
                <p part="N">A certain number of the fins are vertical, and serve the fish somewhat
                    in the same way as a vessel is served by her helm and keel. Of these, some,
                    called <hi rend="italic">dorsal,</hi> arc attached to the back, others, beneath
                    the tail, are named <hi rend="italic">anal,</hi> while a fine expansion, which
                    usually terminates the body, is known as the <hi rend="italic">caudal</hi> fin.
                    All these are <hi rend="italic">vertical</hi> fins, and vary in different
                    tribes, either in number, or dimensions, or the nature of the rays by which they
                    are supported, and which are sometimes spiny, sometimes branched and composed of
                    numerous articulations. The other fins are disposed in pairs, and represent the
                    four external members of the higher classes, such as quadrupeds and birds. Those
                    which correspond to the fore-legs of quadrupeds and the wings of birds are named
                    the <hi rend="italic">pectoral</hi> fins, and are always attached behind the
                    gills; those again which are regarded as the analogues of the hinder extremities
                    of the other classes are named the <hi rend="italic">ventral</hi> fins, and have
                    a considerable range of position in different species, from as far forward as
                    beneath the throat, to the origin of the tail. Like the vertical fins, they also
                    vary in size, and in the number and structure of their rays; and one or even
                    both pairs are occasionally wanting, as in eels, which have no ventral fins, and
                    Murenae, which have neither ventral nor pectoral fins. Indeed the <hi
                        rend="italic">Apterichti</hi> have no fins at all.</p>
                <p part="N">Those fishes arc named <hi rend="smallcaps">Malacopterygian,</hi> of
                    which all the rays of the fins are articulated, and of a softer structure; while
                    such as are characterised by having at least a portion of their rays hard,
                    simple, and in the form of spines, are included under the general title of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Acλnthoptery-gian</hi> fishes.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">It may be here noted, however,
                            that certain malacopterygian kinds, such as carps and siluri, have the
                            articulations of some of the rays soldered together, in such a manner as
                            to appear simply spinous.</p></note> These great divisions apply solely
                    to the osseous species. We have already mentioned that the cartilaginous kinds
                    are distinguished by the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Chondroptery giax,</hi>
                    while two lesser groups, in some respects intermediate between these and the
                    preceding, fall under the orders <hi rend="smallcaps">Lophobranchii</hi> and <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Plectognathi</hi> of Baron Cuvier.</p>
                <p part="N">The differences hitherto alluded to are connected with intimate
                    structure—with the skeleton or bony frame-work of the fisht There are of course
                    others of a slighter or more superficial character. The jaws may be armed with
                    teeth of all sorts, and these weapons sometimes occupy all parts of the mouth,
                    and are found occasionally even in the throat. The lips are frequently furnished
                    with a kind of fleshy beard or barbies, which differ greatly in number, size,
                    and substance. Some have long fleshy isolated filaments hanging to the body, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Scorpaena;</hi> and occasionally one or more of the rays is
                    to a*certain extent detachable from the fin, and susceptible of independent
                    movement.</p>
                <p part="N">The nature of the surface or external tegument of fishes also varies
                    greatly. Some may be called naked, while others are scaly, spinous, or plated,
                    in whole or in part. If to these considerations we add the infinitely varied
                    character of colour in all its admirable distributions, and the differences in
                    size and weight observable in fishes, we shall be able to form a general idea of
                    the external aspect of this great and important class.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">sect.</hi> III. THE OSTEOLOGY OF FISHES.</p>
                <p part="N">In regard to the texture of the bones of fishes, their skeletons are
                    either <hi rend="italic">bony, fibro-cartilaginous,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >truly car</hi><hi rend="italic">tilaginous.</hi> Those distinguished by the
                    last-named charac∙ ter are the chondropterygian groups, such as the sturgeons,
                    sharks, and rays, all of which exhibit throughout the whole of their frame-work,
                    in their branchiae (the external border of which is fixed to the skin, and
                    through which the water is allowed to escape only by narrow openings), and in
                    other important parts of their organization, distinctive characters, which
                    obviously separate them from all other fishes. They are in fact destitute of
                    true bones, their harder parts consisting only of a homogeneous and
                    semitransparent cartilage, which is merely covered on the surface in certain
                    genera by a layer of small, opake, calcareous granules, closely set together. In
                    the lampreys even this envelope is wanting, while among the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ammoccetes</hi> the skeleton continues in an actually membranous condition.
                    The sturgeons and Chimerae partake in some measure of the lamprey character in
                    relation to the softness of their spines, but the first-named genus is possessed
                    of many true bones of the head and shoulder.</p>
                <p part="N">Other fishes differ in their osteological character chiefly in the
                    hardness of their skeleton, and it is without reason that the·
                    fibro-cartilaginous kinds have been associated by some authors with the
                    Chondropterygii. The calcareous matter, that is, the phosphate of lime, is
                    deposited in layers and fibres in the cartilage which forms the basis of their
                    bones, precisely in the same manner as among the hard-boned species, but less
                    abundantly; and the texture of the bone never becomes so hard and homogeneous as
                    among the osseous kinds. Thus in <hi rend="italic">Tetrodon Mola</hi> we
                    perceive, as it were, only scattered fibres amid the membranes, and in <hi
                        rend="italic">Lophius</hi><hi rend="italic">piscatorius</hi> they are nearly
                    as soft. The other Tetrodons and Diodons, the Balistes and the Ostracions, have
                    denser bones; and in some species these parts can scarcely be distinguished from
                    those of the osseous fishes. It is certain also that the bony frame-work of the
                    fibro-cartilaginous kinds is constructed on the same plan as that of the truly
                    osseous species, and not in accordance with those of the Chondropterygii; and it
                    is in opposition to the known truth of nature that both Artedi and Linnaeus have
                    denied them the possession of opercula and branchiostegous rays. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Balistes</hi> have even ribs,—their only osteological
                    difference consisting in the granulation of their jaws; while the <hi
                        rend="italic">Syngnathi</hi> have regular bony jaws, although they want the
                    ribs and branchiostegous rays.</p>
                <p part="N">The majority of osseous fishes have bones fully harder than those of
                    other animals, and it is quite a gratuitous assumption to suppose that the
                    observed longevity of certain species arises from the softer consistence of
                    those parts. Certain fish bones, in fact, exhibit neither pores nor fibres, and
                    appear almost vitreous to the eye. But neither the osseous nor the cartilaginous
                    kinds have either epiphyses to the bones, or medullary canal within them; but
                    there are some, such as the trouts, in which the tissue of the bones is more or
                    less penetrated by an oilyjuice; while in others, such as the Dory, the internal
                    portion continues cartilaginous, while the surface is completely ossified.
                    Finally, in certain species, while the general skeleton is very hard, particular
                    portions of it are cartilaginous. Such are the bones which constitute the head
                    of the pike.</p>
                <p part="N">When viewed in relation to their general structure, the bones of fishes,
                    like those of other vertebrated animals, are composed of an organic base
                    penetrated by earthy matter. The latter consists of phosphate of lime and of
                    magnesia, with oxide of iron, supposed to be united to phosphoric acid. There is
                    also a certain portion <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939817?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-9817-0155"/>of subcarbonate of lime. The animal matter is
                    of two kinds :—the one, of an azotised nature, forms the base of the cartilage;
                    the other is fatty, in the form of a pervading oil. The cartilage of fish bones
                    differs from that of mammiferae and birds, in as far as it yields no gelatine
                    when subjected to the process of boiling. The oil is composed chiefly of oleine,
                    impregnated with an odorous principle and a yellow colouring matter. The oil
                    itself is easily convertible into soap, and then produces oleic acid, glycerine,
                    and a minute portion of margaric acid.</p>
                <p part="N">The skeleton of osseous fishes consists of the head; of the respiratory
                    apparatus, having always a large bony development; of the trunk, including body
                    and tail; and of members, that is, the pectoral and ventral fins. The vertical
                    fins, viz. those of the back, anus, and tail, may likewise be viewed as
                    belonging to the trunk.</p>
                <p part="N">The head, possessing many more moveable parts than that of the Mammalia,
                    is subdivisible into a great many regions, such as the cranium, the maxillae,
                    the bones beneath the cranium and behind the jaws, and which aid in their
                    movement and suspension; the bones of the opercles, which open and shut the
                    overtures of the branchiae; the bones, almost exterior, which surround the
                    nostrils, the eye, and the temples, or which cover a portion of the cheek.</p>
                <p part="N">In the majority of fishes the inter-maxillary bone forms the edge of the
                    upper jaw, and has behind it the maxillary, commonly called the mystax, or
                    labial bone. A palatine arch, composed of the palatine, of the two pterygoid
                    processes, of the jugal, tympanic, and squamous bones, constitutes, as among
                    birds and snakes, a kind of interior jaw, and provides posteriorly an
                    articulation to the lower jaw, which has usually two bones on each side. In the
                    Chondropterygii, however, these various pieces are greatly reduced in
                    number.</p>
                <p part="N">Besides the apparatus of the branchial arches, the hyoid bone carries on
                    each side certain rays which support the branchial membrane; a kind of lid or
                    clapper, composed of three bony pieces, the opercle, the sub-opercle, and the
                    inter-opercle, unites with that membrane to close the great opening of the
                    gills; it articulates with the <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >tympani,</hi> and plays on the piece called the pre-opercle. But, like the
                    parts before mentioned, this apparatus is likewise wantingin many of the
                    Chondropterygii.</p>
                <p part="N">The trunk is composed of the vertebrae of the back and tail (for we can
                    scarcely say that there is any neck, and the sacrum is wanting); of ribs; of the
                    interspinal bones, which give support to the dorsal and anal fins; and of the
                    rays of those fins, and of the caudal. These rays, whether branched and
                    articulated, or simply spinous, may be always divided lengthways into
                    halves.</p>
                <p part="N">The vertebrae of fishes are characterised by the conical hollow on each
                    of their faces. Double hollow cones are thus formed in the interval between two
                    vertebrae, filled by a soft membranous and gelatinous substance, which passes
                    from one void to another by means of an opening through each vertebra, and forms
                    as it were a gelatinous chaplet through the whole. They have, as in other
                    animals, an annular portion in their superior part, for the passage of the
                    spinal marrow.</p>
                <p part="N">Fish rarely possess a sternum properly so called, and when it does
                    exist, it is formed of almost external pieces, which unite the inferior
                    extremities of the ribs.</p>
                <p part="N">The anterior members, commonly called the pectoral fins, consist of the
                    shoulder, an osseous semicircle composed of several bones suspended above from
                    the cranium or the spine, and joined beneath to the corresponding portion of the
                    other side. We can here also distinguish certain bones analogous to the two
                    pieces of the omoplate of reptiles, to the humerus, and to the bones of the
                    lore-arm; and further back there is usually a small projection, composed of two
                    pieces, which have been supposed to represent the coracoid bone, and even the
                    clavicle. What is more assured is, that the two bones which Cuvier compares to
                    the cubitus and radius, bear on their margin a range of little bones, which seem
                    to represent those of the carpus, and which themselves support the rays of the
                    pectoral fin, excepting the first of the latter, which articulates directly with
                    the radial bone.</p>
                <p part="N">The posterior members, much more variable in their position than the
                    corresponding limbs of the Mammalia, and of which the external and moveable
                    portions are named the ventral fins, project sometimes in advance of, sometimes
                    beneath, and sometimes behind, the anterior or pectoral members. They are
                    composed of four bones, of which the largest, which are likewise the most
                    constant, being always placed in advance of the anus and of the generative
                    system, may be regarded as a sort of pubis, and bear upon a portion of their
                    posterior margin the rays of the fin, without any smaller intermediate bones
                    which can be compared either to the femur, the tibia, the peroneum, or tarsal
                    bones. The rays of both the pectoral and ventral fins are likewise divisible
                    lengthwise into halves, like those of the vertical fins before mentioned. These
                    rays, with the exception of the external ventral one of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Acanthopterygii</hi> (which is spinous), are almost always articulated.</p>
                <p part="N">The skeleton of the <hi rend="italic">Chondropterygii,</hi> such as
                    sharks and skates, is composed of pieces consisting of no fibrous tissue
                    characteristic of bone. The interior continues in a cartilaginous state, and the
                    surface alone becomes indurated by the accumulation of small calcareous
                    granules, which produce externally a <hi rend="italic">stippled</hi> aspect. The
                    form of the cranium is similar to that of other fishes, but nevertheless
                    consists of only one enclosure, without sutures. The face is very simple, with
                    only two bones in the palato-temporal arch ;—the first descending from the
                    cranium, at the articulation of the jaws,—the other representing the upper jaw,
                    and bearing the teeth. The maxillary and inter-maxillary bones are merely
                    rudimentary. The under jaw has also but one bone (the articular) on each side,
                    bearing the teeth; of the others only a single vestige is discoverable,
                    concealed beneath the skin of the lip. The opercular apparatus is wanting, but
                    the hyoidean and branchial structure is very conformable with the same parts in
                    osseous fishes. Sharks have, moreover, opposite to the external attachment of
                    each branchia, a slender bone, which may be regarded as the genuine vestige of a
                    rib. The branchial system is situate further back than in osseous fishes, and
                    hence the humeral girdle is also more posterior. The spinal ribs, if they exist,
                    are usually very small, except in the sturgeons. In that genus, indeed, the
                    branchial system is in some respects intermediate between the cartilaginous and
                    osseous fishes. Several bones of the head and shoulder are as hard as stone, yet
                    the spine is almost as soft as that of lampreys.<note anchored="true"

                            but is always suspended to the temporal bones. It is composed of two
                            branches, each consisting office pieces, viz. the styloid, 29, by which
                            it is suspended to the temporal; two large lateral pieces, 37 and 38,
                            placed one behind the other, and forming tlĩe principal portion of the
                            branch (the posterior, 38, being that which attaches to the
                            inter-operculum); lastly, two small pieces, 39 and 40, placed one above

                            respire except by making the water which they have taken into the mouth
                            flow out by the openings behind the lateral part of the head, it thus
                            passes between the branchiae, those well-known comb-like organs, usually
                            four in number on each side, composed of a great quantity of thin,
                            narrow, forked laminae, of a membranous or cartilaginous nature, and
                            placed in files. These four pair of branchiae are supported by four pair
                            of arches, adhering by their inferior extremities to the two sides of a
                            chain of small intermediate bones, which is itself attached to the angle
                            formed by the anterior portions of the hyoid bone, and above the <hi
                                rend="italic">tail</hi> of the latter. These arches ascend in a
                            curve, and are attached at their other extremity beneath the cranium,
                            but by means only of cellulosity, or of ligaments. The intermediate
                            chain of bones just alluded to forms, in a certain sense, a continuation
                            of the lingual bone. There are usually three: the first, 53 (see chiefly
                            fig. 4), is attached at the base of the angle formed by the two branches
                            of the hyoid bone; the second, 54, affords attachment to the first pair
                            of arches; and the third, 55, affords the like attachment to the second
                            pair, while the third pair adheres to its extremity; the fourth pair of
                            arches is connected with the angle of the third pair. Each arch is
                            composed of two parts, moveable on each other, and the interior portion
                            of the first three pair itself consists of two pieces, 57 and 58; in the
                            last pair there is only a single piece, 60. The upper portion of the
                            arches, 61, is simple, except in the first pair, which is usually
                            suspended from the cranium by a small stylus, 59. The inner face of
                            these arches is furnished with small plates or cones of osseous lamina,
                            usually armed with teeth variously disposed according to the species.
                            The most general uses of this armature are to arrest the progress of
                            such substances as the fish is swallowing,—to prevent their escaping
                            with the respired water, or their producing inconvenience amid the
                            interstices of the branchiae. It may be likened in its functions to the
                            epiglottis of quadrupeds, or the dentations of the margins of the
                            larynx*of birds. Besides the interior range of conical plates, the perch
                            possesses an external row of slender pointed teeth, resembling those of
                            a garden rake, upon its first pair of arches, see 63.</p><p part="N"><hi

                            find an interspinal bone which bears no rays, 76. A certain number of
                            these vertical rays are pointed bones, and are then named spines, or
                            spiny rays; others are bony or solid only towards their base, their
                            remainder being formed of a multitude of small articulations, and
                            frequently ramified into lesser branches, themselves still further
                            divided; in these states they are named articulated, soft, or branched
                            rays. Those of the tail, 7B are always soft and articulated; although,
                            towards the root, both above and below, 78, they gradually diminish till
                            only the solid portion of the base remains. In a great number of fishes

                            and even that which follows it, 83, 83, have a great inferior spinous
                            process, to which is joined a more or less voluminous bone, 79,
                            extending behind the anus, and thus forming the posterior boundary of

                            these the ribs terminate.</p><p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Bones of the
                                shoulder and arm.</hi> In osseous fishes, we find on each side,
                            immediately behind the orifice of the gills, a suite of bones, forming a
                            kind of frame, on which the opercle rests when closed. These bones,
                            usually attached to the head from above, and uniting together below,
                            form an osseous belt, surrounding that part of the body. Their inferior
                            symphysis unites by ligaments to the tail of the hyoid bone (formerly
                            mentioned, 42), and forms with it the <hi rend="italic">isthmus,</hi>
                            which separates the external openings of the gills from each other
                            beneath, just as the cranium separates them above. This cincture, when
                            complete, is composed on each side of three bones, which represent the
                            shoulder and the arm, to which adheres, posteriorly, a group of two or
                            three others, occupying the place of the fore arm, and bearing the
                            pectoral fin, which may be considered as the hand; lastly, there is
                            almost always suspended a style, composed of one or two bones, which
                            Cuvier regards as the analogue of the coracoidian bone. The highest of
                            these first three bones, 46, is usually forked, and attached by its two
                            crests to the lateral crests of the cranium. It is visible externally at
                            the top of the branchial opening, resembling a scale, larger than the
                            others, and is sometimes toothed on its edges. The second, 47, continues
                            along the margin of the branchial opening. The third, 48, always the
                            largest, completes the cincture, by uniting with its counterpart beneath
                            the throat. To the inner surface of the last-mentioned bone adheres a
                            fourth, 51, and fifth, 52, placed one above the other. The free side of
                            these bones bears the pectoral fin, but by means of an intermediate
                            range of four or five small bones, 53. These bonelets may be supposed to
                            represent the carpal series; and if so, then the two others, 51 and 52.
                            will be the cubitus and radius. The third <pb

                    extremity acting laterally upon the resistance offered by the water. Generally
                    speaking, neither the pectoral nor the ventral fins are of any material use
                    during swift progressive motion; they rather serve to balance the body, or to
                    aid its gentler movements while in a state of comparative repose. In <hi

                    of such great length and expansion as to support the animal in the air; and the
                    strength of muscular action might probably suffice even for a longer flight, but
                    for the necessity of constant moisture for the purposes of respiration. The
                    drying of the gills in an individual of this class is·attended by results
                    analogous to those produced by submersion in the case of a land animal ;—and a
                    flying fish is obliged to descend to respire, in like manner as a swimming
                    quadruped, or disguised mammiferous animal (as we may term a whale), is under
                    the necessity of ascending for the same purpose.</p>
                <p part="N">The head of fishes exercises but a slight movement independent of the
                    rest of the body; but the jaws, hyoid bone, palato-temporal and branchial
                    arches, and pharyn-gial and opercular bones, are very free in their motions. The
                    muscles of fishes, like those of other vertebrated animals, are composed of
                    fleshy fibres more or less coloured, and of tendinous fibres of a white or
                    silvery colour. With the exception, however, of certain special muscles which
                    are sometimes of a deep red, the flesh of fishes is much paler than that of
                    quadrupeds, and still more so than that of birds. In some species it is even

                <p part="N">The sensitive system of fishes, like that of the higher classes, is
                    composed of the external senses, of a central medullary apparatus, and of nerves
                    of communication. As in the classes alluded to, the central portion of the
                    nervous system, that is, the brain and spinal marrow, occupies the cavity of the
                    cranium and vertebral column.</p>
                <p part="N">As fishes respire through the intervention of water alone, that is, as
                    they can scarcely avail themselves, in rendering their blood <hi rend="italic"
                        >arterial,</hi> of any thing more than the small portion of oxygen contained
                    in the air which is suspended in the water, their blood is necessarily cold, and
                    their general energy, and the activity of their senses and movements, are less
                    than among Mammalia and birds. Their brain also, though of similar composition,
                    is proportionally much smaller; and the external organs of the senses do not
                    seem of such a nature as to be capable of impressing or conveying towards it any
                    vivid excitement. Indeed the most striking characteristic of the brain of fishes
                    is its extreme smallness, when compared either with the total size of the body,
                    with the mass of nerves which proceed from it, or with the cavity of the cranium
                    in which it is contained. In the burbot, or <hi rend="italic">Gadus lota,</hi>
                    the weight of the brain to that of the spinal marrow is estimated by Carus to be
                    as 8 to 12, and to that <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the whole body as 1 to 720. It
                    was previously known that the brain of the pike weighed in proportion to that of
                    the whole body as 1 to 1305. Now, in many small birds, the brain, viewed in
                    relation to the rest of the body, is equal to a twentieth part. In the
                    generality of fishes, the spinal marrow extends along the whole of the caudal
                    vertebrae; and it is thus that it preponderates over the brain. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Lophius</hi><hi rend="italic">piscatorius,</hi> however, and a
                    few other species, form remarkable exceptions to this rule, as in them the
                    spinal marrow disappears before it reaches the eighth vertebra; but in the
                    greater proportion of cases it may be said that the spinal cord in this class

                    fishes by no. means fills up the cavity of the cranium; and the interval between
                    the pia-mater which envelopes the brain itself, and the dura-mater, which lines
                    the interior of the skull, is occupied only by a loose cellulosity, frequently
                    impregnated by an oil, or sometimes, as in the sturgeon and thunny, by a rather
                    compact grease. It has also been remarked, that this void between the cranium
                    and the brain is much less in young subjects than in adults; from which it may
                    be inferred, that the brain does not increase in an equal proportion with the
                    rest of the body. Cuvier, in fact, has found its dimensions nearly the same in
                    different individuals, of which the general size of the one was double that of
                    the other.</p>
                <p part="N">When compared with that of quadrupeds, the brain of fishes has been said
                    to possess an embryonic character, and to have its greatest development in the
                    cerebellum, the seat of the appetites. Of all vertebrated animals, fish in fact
                    exhibit the smallest apparent signs of sensibility. Having no elastic air to act
                    upon, they are necessarily mute, or nearly so; and all the sensations which the
                    delightful faculty of voice has called into being among the higher tribes, are
                    to them unknown. Their glazed immoveable eyes, their fixed and bony faces, their
                    bodies and members moving altogether, if they move at all, admit of little play
                    in their physiognomy, and of scarcely any expression to their emotions. Their
                    ears, surrounded cn every side by the bones of the cranium, destitute of
                    external conch, without any internal cochlea, and composed merely of some sacks
                    and membranous canals, scarcely suffice for the perception of the loudest
                    sounds. Even their sight may be supposed to find but little exercise in those
                    profound depths where so many of the inhabitants of ocean dwell, although the
                    largeness of the visual organs in many species probably in some measure makes
                    amends for this deficiency of light. But even in those species the eye cannot
                    change its direction; still less can it alter its focus, so as to accommodate
                    the vision to a varying distance; for the iris neither dilates nor contracts,
                    and the pupil remains for ever the same in all degrees of light. No tear
                    moistens its glazed surface, no eyelid clears or protects it, and it <pb

                    consequently offers but <hi rend="italic">a</hi> dull and feeble representative
                    of that beautiful and most expressive organ, so full of life and animation in
                    the higher tribes.</p>
                <p part="N">The position, direction, and dimensions of the eyes of fishes vary
                    greatly. In some they have an upward aspect, and are often very close upon each
                    other; in others they are lateral, and so wide apart as to be even directed
                    slightly downwards. But of all anomalies, one of the most extraordinary whieh
                    their position presents, is that of the <hi rend="italic">Pleuronectes</hi>
                    (such as turbot, flounders, soles, &amp;c.), in which the two eyes are placed,
                    as it were, the one above the other, and both upon the same side of the head. In
                    certain species of the eels and <hi rend="italic">Siluri,</hi> they are so small
                    as to be scarcely visible; while in other groups, such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pria-</hi><hi rend="italic">canthus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >'Pomatomus,</hi> they surpass in proportional diameter whatever is known of
                    the same organs in the higher classes. It may be said in general that the eye of
                    fishes is large, and that its pupil especially is broad and open; a character
                    probably connected with the necessity of collecting whatever devious rays of
                    light may penetrate the obscure depth of waters. Fishes have no true eyelids.
                    The skin always passes over the eye, to which it is slightly adherent; and it is
                    for the most part sufficiently transparent for the passage of the solar rays. In
                    some species, such as eels, it passes over without the slightest fold or
                    duplication; while in a few, for example, the <hi rend="italic">Gαstrobranchus
                        coecus</hi> of Bloch, it continues quite opake, so as entirely to conceaľ
                    the eye. In others, as the well-known mackerel and herring, it forms an adipose
                    fold both before and behind; but these folds are fixed, and being unprovided
                    with muscles, have no mobility. Sharks have one, somewhat more moveable, on the
                    inferior margin of the orbit. The globe of the eye itself is very slightly
                    moveable, although, like that of man, it is furnished with six muscles. Perhaps
                    the most singular eye presented by the class of fishes is that of <hi
                        rend="italic">Anableps,</hi> which has two corneae, separated by an opake
                    line, and two pupils pierced in the same iris, so that one might deem it double;
                    but there is only one retina, and a single vitreous and crystalline humour. In
                    accordance with the general structure of the eyes of fishes (which we shall not
                    further detail), the nearly spherical form of the crystalline humour, the
                    immobility of the pupil, and the difficulty with which it changes the length of
                    its axis, we can scarcely doubt that the vision of this class is comparatively
                    imperfect. Images must be but feebly painted in their retina, and their visual
                    perceptions must be indistinct and dull. At the same time it is evident that
                    they perceive their prey from a considerable distance; and the angler, who knows
                    either how rapidly they seize or how cautiously they avoid his lure, and with
                    what discrimination they sometimes prefer one colour or kind of artificial fly
                    to another, must be impressed with the belief that the power of vision, at least
                    of certain species, is by no means devoid of clearness and precision.</p>
                <p part="N">The <hi rend="italic">organ of hearing</hi> in fishes consists of little
                    more than the labyrinth, and that a much less complicated one than the
                    corresponding part in either quadrupeds or birds. They have no external ear,
                    unless we may bestow that name on a small cavity, sometimes slightly spiral,
                    which we find in the rays. It is however always covered by the skin, and is not
                    perceptible among the osseous fishes. A few of the latter, such as the genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Lepidoleprus,</hi> and certain <hi rend="italic">Mormyri,</hi>
                    have merely openings in the cranium closed by the skin, by means of which the
                    vibrations of the element by which they are surrounded may be conducted to the
                    labyrinth. In some other species, as <hi rend="italic">Myripristis,</hi> the
                    cranium is open beneath, and its orifice is closed by a membranous partition, to
                    which the swimming bladder adheres; but these communications are very different
                    from that which takes place by means of the tympanum, and still more by means of
                    the Eustachian tube in other classes.</p>
                <p part="N">Both these parts, as well as the bones, are in fact wanting in the class
                    of fishes. Those who find in the bones of the operculum the four bones of the
                    ear of man suddenly and prodigiously developed, hazard such a notion merely on
                    the assumption that the bony pieces are tlιe same in number in all crania; but
                    it must be borne in mind, that neither the form, nor the relations, nor the
                    functions of these bones, nor their nerves nor muscles, support such a
                    comparison. The ear of fishes, then, is much less complete than that of
                    quadrupeds, birds, or even of the majority of reptiles. There is no doubt that
                    they possess the sense of hearing; but it is merely a general sense of sound,
                    and is in all probability incompetent to perceive any variety or range of
                    intonation. In truth, the simple fact of fishes being as a class entirely mute,
                    is of itself a logical ground for believing that their pereeption of sound is
                    extremely dull.</p>
                <p part="N">. A few lines may now be devoted to the consideration of the <hi
                        rend="italic">sense of smell.</hi> The nostrils of fishes are not so placed
                    as to be traversed either by air or water, in connection with the act of
                    respiration. They consist merely of two openings, situate near the extremity of
                    the muzzle, and lined by the pituitary membrane, which is raised in extremely
                    regular folds. In the ordinary fishes, the bones which Cuvier regards as the
                    nasal serve as the arch or covering; while the vomer, the maxillary, and
                    inter-maxillary contribute to sustain the sides, the first sub-orbitary forming
                    the inferior portion. The shape of the nostrils is sometimes oblong, sometimes
                    round or oval. They are placed either at the end of the muzzle or on its sides;
                    sometimes on its superior face, and even occasionally, as in skates and sharks,
                    on its under surface near the angle of the mouth. In the lamprey they are
                    approximate on the top of the head, and open by one common orifice. In the great
                    majority of fishes, perhaps in all the osseous kinds, each nostril opens by two
                    orifices, the one posterior to the other, and in some cases at a considerable
                    distance. These are what are called double nostrils; an inaccurate term, in as
                    far as each pair of holes leads only to a single cavity. The margins of the
                    anterior orifice are often tubular, as in the eel, and sometimes a single side
                    of the tubular margin is prolonged into a tentacular appendage, as in several
                    Siluri. In the genus <hi rend="italic">Lophius</hi> the nostrils are borne upon
                    a little pedicle, so as somewhat to resemble mushrooms. Various other
                    modifications are observable in different genera, although not necessary to be
                    here narrated. It does not appear, at least in the osseous fishes, that the
                    envelope of the nostrils possesses mobility, or that the orifices are furnished
                    with muscles by means of which they can be opened and shut.</p>
                <p part="N">It is certain, however, that fishes possess the faculty of perceiving
                    odours; that various scents attract or repel them; and there is no reason to
                    doubt that the seat of that perception lies in the nostrils. It maybe reasonably
                    conjectured that its strength depends mainly on the degree of development
                    produced by the number and extent of the interior folds.</p>
                <p part="N">In regard to the <hi rend="italic">sense of taste</hi> in fishes, it is
                    evident that as, with few exceptions, they swallow their food rapidly and
                    without mastication, their perception of that faculty must be in noways acute.
                    The same may be inferred from the fact of their tongue being almost immoveable,
                    often entirely osseous, or beset with teeth or dental plates, and from its
                    receiving very slender nerves, and these but few in number. Even those species
                    of which the jaws are so armed as to enable them to cut and bruize their
                    aliments, cannot long retain the latter in their mouths, on account of the
                    position and the play of the respiratory organs. No salivary glands discharge
                    their moisture on the organs of taste. The tongue itself is not seldom entirely
                    wanting; and even when it exists in its most distinct and apparently fleshy
                    state, it consists merely of a ligament <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192939869?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9869-0159"/>ous or
                    cellular substance, applied on front of the lingual bone. It is never furnished
                    with muscles capable of producing any movement of extension or retraction, as in
                    quadrupeds.</p>
                <p part="N">Fishes cannot be said to be more highly favoured in respect to the <hi
                        rend="italic">organs of touch</hi> than those of taste. The faculty is
                    greatly deadened over the general surface by the coating of scales, and in the
                    particular members by the inflexibility of the rays. It is chiefly confined to
                    the lips, and even these parts in many species are themselves as hard and
                    insensible as bone. Certain soft and delicate appendages called <hi
                        rend="italic">barbies,</hi> possessed by many species, such as the cod and
                    loach, are supposed to enjoy a more delicate perception of the sense of touch.
                    It is by means of the <hi rend="italic">dermis</hi> that that peculiar matter,
                    so remarkable for its silvery metallic lustre, and which bestows so much of
                    brilliancy upon the class, is secreted beneath the scales. It is composed of
                    small polished plates resembling burnished silver, and capable of being removed
                    by washing, either from the skin itself, or from the inferior surface of the
                    scales. It is this substance that is used in the formation of false pearls. It
                    is also secreted by many species in the thickness of the peritoneum, and in the
                    envelopes supplied by that part to particular viscera, especially the swimming
                    bladder. The scales of the majority of fishes are <hi rend="italic"
                        >imbricated,</hi> that is, placed partially over each other, like the tiles
                    or slates of the roof of a house. They are not equally distributed, nor of the
                    same form or consistence, over the general surface of the body. The head is
                    frequently destitute of scales, and those of the lateral line of the body are
                    distinguished from the others by one or more small tubes by which they are
                    perforated, and by other peculiarities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">It thus appears that the external senses of fishes convey to them few
                    lively or distinct impressions; and by whatever scenes in nature they arc
                    surrounded, their perceptions are probably indistinct and dull. Their sexual
                    emotions, cold as their blood, indicate only individual wants. Few species pair,
                    or enjoy any connubial gratification, for the males seek the eggs rather than
                    the females which deposit them, and neither sex ever recognises its offspring.
                    At least the exceptions to these generalities are extremely few, and the
                    prevailing economy of fishes may be said in all these respects to be exactly the
                    reverse of that of birds. These gay creatures of the sky have the power of
                    surveying distinctly at a glance an immeasurable extent of horizon; their acute
                    perception of hearing appreciates all sounds, and every intonation; and their
                    glad voices are exquisitely skilled in their production. Though their bills be
                    hard, and their bodies covered by down and feathers, they are by no means
                    deficient in the sense of touch. They enjoy all the delights of conjugal and
                    parental affection, and perform their incumbent duties with devotedness and
                    courage; they cherish and defend their offspring, and will sometimes die in that
                    defence; and of all the wonderfid labours of instinctive art, none is so
                    beautiful as the formation of their mossy dwellings. With what deep and
                    continuous affection does the female brood over her cherished treasures! how
                    unwearied is the gallant male in his tender assiduities, and in the rich
                    outpouring of that varied song by which he seeks to soothe her sedentary task!
                    The same principle of attachment and discrimination is even made available in a
                    state of domestication by the skill of all-engrossing man. A bird acquires a
                    knowledge of its master, and submits to and obeys that master’s will; and the
                    proud falcon, which in its natural state</p>
                <p part="N">Doth dally with the wind, and scorn the sun, will wheel in airy circles
                    over a well-trained dog, or stoop its boldest flight at some familiar urchin’s
                    call. Other species will even imitate man’s noblest faculty, the power of
                    speech,—and it is thus with somewhat doubtful feelings that we deny to them the
                    gift of reason.</p>
                <p part="N">But the silent dweller in the deep knows few attachments, expresses no
                    language, cherishes no affections. Constructing no dwelling, he merely shelters
                    himself from danger among the cavernous rocks of the ocean, or beneath the murky
                    shade of the overhanging banks of rivers; and the cravings of hunger seem alone
                    to exercise a frequent or influential action over his monotonous movements. We
                    must not, however, suppose that the life of fishes is not one of enjoyment, for
                    we know that the great Creator “careth for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his
                    creatures ;” and it ought perhaps rather to be said that we cannot appreciate
                    the nature of their feelings, than that they are in any way fore-doomed to a
                    negation of pleasure. Assuredly, however, the hand of nature has been most
                    prodigal in bestowing on their external aspect every variety of adornment. Their
                    special forms arc infinite, their proportions often most elegant, their colours
                    lively and diversified, and nothing seems wanting in them to excite the
                    admiration of mankind. Indeed it almost appears as if this prodigality of beauty
                    was intended solely for such an end. The brightness of metallic splendour, the
                    sparkling brilliancy of precious gems, the milder effulgence of the hues of
                    flowers, all combine to signalise fishes as among the most beautiful objects of
                    creation. When newly withdrawn from their native element, or still gliding
                    submerged in its liquid coolness, their colours, fixed or iridescent, are seen
                    mingling in streaks or bands, or broader flashes, always elegant and
                    symmetrical; sometimes richly contrasted, sometimes gradually softened into each
                    other; and in all cases harmonizing with a chaste fulness of effect, which
                    Titian or Rubens might envy, but could never equal. For what reason, then, it
                    has been asked, has all this adornment been so lavishly bestowed on creatures
                    which can scarcely perceive each other amid the dim and perpetual twilight of
                    the deep? Shakspeare has already said that there are “more things in <hi
                        rend="italic">heaven</hi> and <hi rend="italic">earth</hi> than are dream’t
                    of in our philosophy and we fear it is no answer to the foregoing question to
                    add, that the same observation applies with even greater truth to the “<hi

                <p part="N">TION OF FISHES.</p>
                <p part="N">The nutritive functions of fishes follow the same order of progression
                    as those of the other vertebrated classes; they seize and in some measure divide
                    their food with their teeth; they digest it in the stomach, from whence it
                    passes into the intestinal canal, where it receives a supply of bile from the
                    liver, and frequently a liquid similar to that of the pancreas; the nutritive
                    juices absorbed by vessels analogous to lacteals, and probably taken up in part
                    also directly by the veins, are mingled with the venous blood which is flowing
                    towards the heart, from whence it is pushed to the branchiae, in which, coming
                    into contact with the water, it is converted into arterial blood, and then
                    proceeds to the nourishment of the whole body. As in other animals, also,
                    certain properties are carried off from the blood by transpiration, the
                    secreting power of the kidneys, &amp;c.</p>
                <p part="N">Fishes in general arc extremely voracious, and the rule of “eat or be
                    eaten” applies to them with unusual force. They are almost constantly engaged in
                    the pursuit and capture of their prey; their degree of power in these respects
                    depending of course on the dimensions of the mouth <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192939882?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9882-0160"/>and throat,
                    and the strength of the teeth and jaws. If the teeth are sharp and hooked, they
                    are capable of securing the slenderest and most agile animals; if they are broad
                    and strong, they are able to bruise the hardest aliment; if they are feeble or
                    entirely wanting, they are only serviceable in procuring some inert or
                    unresisting prey. Fishes indeed show but little choice in the selection of their
                    food, and their digestive powers are so strong and rapid as to suffice to
                    dissolve very speedily all kinds of animal substances. They greedily swallow
                    other fishes, notwithstanding the sharp spines or bony ridges with which they
                    may be armed; they attack and devour crabs and shell-fish, gulping them entire
                    if they cannot otherwise attain their object; they do not object occasionally to
                    swallow the young even of their own species, and the more powerful kinds carry
                    their warfare into other kingdoms of nature, and revel on rats, reptiles, and
                    young ducklings, to say nothing of the ferocious shark, which not seldom makes a
                    meal even of the lord of the creation. The species which live chiefly on
                    vegetable substances are few in number.</p>
                <p part="N">The growth of fishes depends greatly on the nature and supply of food,
                    and different individuals of the same species exhibit a great disparity in their
                    respective dimensions. They grow less rapidly in small ponds or shallow streams,
                    than in large lakes and deep rivers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p part="N">The writer of this treatise kept a minnow
                            little more than half an inch long in a glass tumbler for a period of
                            two years, during which time there was no perceptible increase in its
                            dimensions. Had it continued in its native stream, subjected to the
                            fattening influence of a continuous flow of water, and a consequent
                            increase in the quantity and variety of its natural food, its cubic
                            dimensions would probably have been twenty times greater; yet it must
                            have attained, prior to the lapse of a couple of years, to the usual
                            period of the adult state.</p></note> The growth itself seems to
                    continue for a great length of time, and we can scarcely set bounds to,
                    certainly we know not with precision, the utmost range of the specific size of
                    fishes. Even among species in no way remarkable for their dimensions, we ever
                    and anon meet with ancient individuals, favourably situated, which vastly exceed
                    the ordinary weight and measurement of their kind.</p>
                <p part="N">The teeth of fishes are sometimes spread over all the bones which
                    envelope the cavities of the mouth and pharynx; on the maxillary,
                    inter-maxillary, and palatine bones; on the vomer, the tongue, the branchial
                    arches, and pharyngeal bones. In certain genera they exist on all those parts;
                    while in others they are wanting on some, or are even entirely absent on all.
                    The denominations of the teeth are derived from their position, that is, from
                    the bones to which they are attached, and are consequently as numerous as the
                    varieties of their situation. Thcir forms are not less varied than their
                    stations, and give rise to terms still more numerous. The majority are conical
                    or hooked, more or less acute. When these hooks are in considerable number, and
                    disposed in several rows, or in quincunx, they are compared to those sharp
                    points which beset the instruments called <hi rend="italic">cards,</hi> used in
                    the working of wool or cotton. It is to this form and distribution that we
                    allude in tlιe descriptive portion of the present treatise when we happen to use
                    the French term <hi rend="italic">en carde.</hi> Sometimes the teeth of fishes
                    are slender, and so closely set together as to resemble to the eye the <hi

                    when they are at the same time extremely short and close, they are likened to
                    smooth velvet; when feeble and elongated, they are said to be brushy or
                    hair-like. Lastly, those kinds of teeth are sometimes so extremely small and
                    short as to be reduced to mere asperities, sensible rather to touch than sight.
                    The whole are simple, and spring from an equally simple pulpy germ.</p>
                <p part="N">In the majority of osseous fishes, besides the lips, which, even when
                    fleshy, having no peculiar muscles, can exert but little strength in retaining
                    the aliments, there is generally in the inside of each jaw, behind the anterior
                    teeth, a kind of membranous fold or valvule, formed by a replication of the
                    interior skin, and directed backwards, of which the effect is to hinder the
                    alimentary substances, and especially the water gulped during respiration, from
                    escaping again by the mouth. This structure, as formerly supposed, does not
                    constitute a character restricted to the genus <hi rend="italic">Zeus,</hi> but
                    exists in an infinity of fishes. The food seized by the teeth of the maxillae,
                    and detained by the valve just mentioned, is carried still farther back by the
                    teeth of the palate and tongue when these exist, and is at the same time
                    prevented by the dentations of the branchial arches from penetrating between the
                    intervals of the branchiae, where it might injure the delicate organs of
                    respiration. The movements of the maxillae and tongue can thus send the food
                    only in the direction of the pharynx, where it undergoes additional action on
                    the part of the teeth of the pharyngeal bones, which triturate or carry it
                    backwards into the oesophagus. The last-named part is clothed by a layer of
                    strong, close-set, muscular fibres, sometimes forming various bundles, the
                    contractions of which push the alimentary matter into the stomach, thus
                    completing the act of deglutition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p part="N">Fishes, in common with -warm-blooded animals, are provided with a
                    complete circulation for the body, and with another equally complete for the
                    organs of respiration, and with a particular abdominal circulation terminating
                    at the liver by means of the vena porta; but their peculiar character consists
                    in this, that the branchial circulation alone is provided at its base with a
                    muscular apparatus or heart, corresponding to the right auricle and ventricle of
                    the higher classes, while nothing of the kind exists at the base of the
                    circulating system of the body; in other words, the left auricle and ventricle
                    are entirely wanting—the branchial veins changing into arteries without any
                    muscular envelope.</p>
                <p part="N">The muscular apparatus of their circulation is composed of the auricle,
                    the ventricle, and the bulb of the pulmonary artery, and the auricle itself is
                    preceded by a large sinus, in which all the veins of the body terminate; a
                    structure which gives rise to four cavities separated by restrictions, into
                    which the blood must flow in its progress from the body to the branehiae. Their
                    size is small in proportion to the dimensions of the body, and does not increase
                    in the same ratio with the growth of the individual. Three of these receptacles,
                    the auricle, the heart, and the bulb, are lodged in a pericardium, which is
                    itself placed beneath the pharyngeal bones, between the inferior parts of the
                    branchial arches, and for the most part protected externally by the humeral
                    bones. The great venous sinus is not placed in the pericardium, but between the
                    posterior partition of that cavity and the membrane which represents the
                    diaphragm, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939895?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-9895-0161"/>and which is merely the anterior portion of
                    the peritoneum strengthened by aponeurotic fibres. This sinus is extended
                    transversely, and receives by several different trunks the veins of the liver,
                    of the generative organs, of the kidneys, of the fins, branchiae, and throat,
                    and finally those of the head, which themselves partly pass by a sinus at the
                    back of the cranium. The first-mentioned sinus sends the whole of this blood by
                    a single orifice of its anterior convexity into the auricle, which receives it
                    through the opening of its anterior portion. Two thin membranous valvules
                    protect this communication, and are turned towards the auricle. The latter organ
                    is placed in the pericardium, in front of the great sinus, and above the
                    ventricle, that is, on its dorsal aspect. It presents very various and often
                    remarkable configurations. In osseous fishes it is usually of a tetrahedral
                    form,—in the cartilaginous kinds more frequently rounded and depressed. It is
                    situate beneath the auricle, the cavity being so turned as to be almost vertical
                    next that organ, and horizontal towards the bulb. Its coats are extremely
                    robust, and furnished internally with powerful fleshy columns, its substance
                    being composed of two different layers. But it is in the bulb of the branchial
                    artery that we find the most vigorous fibres, usually disposed in a circular
                    form. The prolongation of this bulb issues from the pericardium, and becomes the
                    branchial artery, advancing forward beneath the single chain of small bones
                    which unites the arches of the branchiae. The branchial artery soon divides, and
                    in such a manner as to send a branch to each branchia. These branches pass along
                    a hollow groove on the convexity of each branchial arch, and more external than
                    the vein which follows the same track, but in an opposite direction. To the arch
                    are attached a great number of leaflets, parallel to each other, usually
                    terminated in a forked point, and sometimes deeply divided. The principal branch
                    which passes along the groove of the arch gives a smaller branch to each of the
                    leaflets; and this branch, after being twice bifurcated, furnishes an infinity
                    of lesser branchlets, which meander over the surface of each leaflet, till they
                    are finally converted into extremely minute veins. These little vessels meet on
                    each side in a branchial vein, which proceeds along the internal margin of the
                    lateral lobe of the leaflet, and the two veins open into the trunk of the great
                    vein of the branchia.</p>
                <p part="N">On passing out of the dorsal side of the branchia, the branchial veins
                    assume the structure and functions of arteries; even before their arrival at
                    this point, the anterior have already sent several branches to different
                    portions of the head; and it is necessary to remark, that the heart and several
                    parts situate in the chest receive their blood from a branchial vein, by means
                    of an offset issuing from near its source, and consequently anterior to its exit
                    from the branchiae. Nevertheless, it is only by the re-union of the trunks
                    proceeding from the four branchiae that the great artery is formed which carries
                    the blood to the viscera and all the parts of the trunk, and which is by
                    consequence the representative of the aorta of the Mammalia,—but of an aorta
                    which possesses neither auricle nor ventricle at its base. Thus, according to
                    Cuvier’s views, the left cavities of the heart of quadrupeds do not exist in
                    fishes, but are replaced by a simple vascular apparatus, situate above the
                    branchiae, in like manner as the right cavities are placed beneath them.</p>
                <p part="N">SECT. VIII.—THE RESPIRATION OF FISHES.</p>
                <p part="N">It is thus by an almost infinite subdivision of the vessels over the
                    surface of the branchiae or gills, that the blood of fishes becomes subjected to
                    the influence of an ambient fluid. This fluid is of course water, which is made
                    to flow incessantly between the branchiae by the movement of the jaws, and of
                    the opercular and hyoidean apparatus. This mode of respiration is equally
                    necessary to fishes, as the direct respiration of air is to other animals; but
                    the action of water on the blood is much more feeble than that of air. It
                    appears that it is neither the water itself, nor the oxygen contained in it,
                    which effects the respiration, but the small portion of air which is held in
                    solution or mingled with the water. If this is expelled by ebullition, fishes
                    cannot live; and many species are obliged to rise frequently to the surface for
                    the purpose of breathing atmospheric air. It is easy to suffocate various kinds,
                    by keeping them beneath the surface, enclosed in a gauze net. In the respiration
                    of fishes, as in that of other animals, both the atmospheric air and that
                    contained in the water give out their oxygen. The absorption of the latter,
                    however, is very trifling among these aquatics, for it has been calculated that
                    a man consumes fifty thousand times more than is required by a tench. When
                    fishes are deprived of water, they perish not so much for want of oxygen, as
                    because their branchiae become dry, and their blood can no longer circulate with
                    freedom. Hence the species of which the branchial orifice is small, as the eel,
                    or those which possess receptacles for moisture, like <hi rend="italic"
                        >Anabas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oplιicephalus,</hi> long survive
                    exposure; while such as have their gills greatly cleft and open, as the herring,
                    expire almost instantly when withdrawn from their moist abode.</p>
                <p part="N">SECT. IX.—THE SWIMMING BLADDER OF FISHES.</p>
                <p part="N">One of the most remarkable and characteristic organs of fishes is the
                    swimming bladder, commonly so called. In many genera it has no opening or
                    external communication, and the air which it contains must therefore be the
                    result of secretion. It is composed of an extremely fine internal tunic, and of
                    another of a thicker texture and peculiar fibrous structure, remarkable for
                    producing the finest kind of isinglass. It is enclosed within the general
                    coating with which the peritoneum invests the other viscera. It is sometimes
                    simple, as in perch, sometimes furnished with more or less numerous appendages,
                    as in some of the haddock tribe, or branched, as in certain <hi rend="italic"

                            fishes, see Plate CCXCVII. figs. 3, 6, 7, 8∙</p></note> Occasionally we
                    find it divided, as it were, into two parts, by a restriction, as in the genus
                        <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus,</hi> many of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Salmonidoe,</hi> and others. The <hi rend="italic">Catastomoe</hi> have it
                    even divided into three. It is chiefly among the abdominal fishes that we find
                    it communicating by a tube or tunnel with the intestinal canal, and either
                    directly with the oesophagus, as in <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus,</hi> or with the
                    base of the stomach, as in the herring. That of the sturgeon opens into the
                    former portion by means of a large orifice. The contents of the swimming bladder
                    arc usually found to be azote, mingled with some fractional parts of oxygen or
                    carbonic acid. A difference of opinion, however, seems to exist regarding the
                    proportion of oxygen, which is estimated as much greater both by Configliachi
                    and Biot. Some physiologists appear to have regarded the swimming bladder as a
                    true lung, which both admitted and returned the external air; but in many
                    species the air-duct which connects the bladder with the gullet is entirely
                    wanting; and in many others which remain constantly at prodigious depths, the
                    quantity of oxygen gas in the swimming bladder is greater than in those the
                    abode of which is near the surface. Indeed the oxygen is said to increase in
                    quantity in proportion to the depth at which the species dwells. Carus considers
                    it probable that the vessel in question performs a part analogous <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192939908?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9908-0162"/>to that of
                    the expiratory functions of the lungs in the higher classes, by not only
                    separating excrcmentitious azote and superabundant oxygen from the blood, but
                    even discharging those elements in such species as have this particular viscus
                    provided with an air-duct.</p>
                <p part="N">The more obvious use, however, of this organ seems to be to maintain the
                    fish in equilibrium, or to lighten or increase its relative weight, so as to
                    cause an ascension or a sinking, in proportion as the bladder· is compressed or
                    expanded. This is probably effected by the contraction or dilatation of the
                    ribs. At all events, it is certain, that when the air-bladder bursts, the fish
                    remains at the bottom, usually turning up its belly, and exhibiting other
                    irregularities in its locomotion. Another curious effect is observable in regard
                    to fishes -which have been suddenly brought from a great depth by means of a
                    long fishing line, and which having no time either to compress or partially
                    empty the organ in question, the air which it contains being no longer pressed
                    by the heavy weight of water, either expands so as to burst the bladder, or by
                    its dilatation forces the stomach and oesophagus into the fish’s mouth. When the
                    air-bladder is pierced artificially, the fish almost immediately turns upon its
                    back, and sinks to the bottom.</p>
                <p part="N">We have already alluded to the physiological opinion which regards this
                    organ as an auxiliary to the respiratory system, and have likewise adverted to
                    the argument against that opinion, deduced from the fact of its being
                    imperforate in many species, and entirely wanting in others. Wc may add, that
                        Weber<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"><hi

                            &amp;c.</p></note> has pointed out a remarkable connection between the
                    swimming bladder and the organs of hearing. It would appear that the former in
                    several instances subserves the latter aS a membrana tympani; but its primary,
                    or at least most important purpose, seems to be to regulate the ascending or
                    descending movements. Though of the highest importance in the structure of such
                    species as possess it (and these are by far the greater number), yet the
                    swimming bladder is not indispensable in the general economy of the class of
                    fishes. In several genera (e. <hi rend="italic">g. Pleu-τonectesj</hi> it is
                    entirely wanting, and the species in such cases generally remain at the bottom,
                    and, swimming obliquely on one side, propel themselves forward by a nearly
                    vertical motion of the tail. In such cases both eyes are on the same side, and
                    the whole structure of the fish, especially the skeleton of the head, presents
                    an unsymmetrical aspect of a very extraordinary kind.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">In several insects of the genus
                                <hi rend="italic">Blαttα</hi> we have observed a want of symmetry
                            both in the size and markings of the elvtra. We do not mean an
                            accidental variation of one side, but an evidently pre-ordained
                            disparity of form and colour.</p></note> In many cartilaginous fishes,
                    such as rays (commonly called skates), the absence of the swimming bladder seems
                    compensated by the enormous size of the pectoral fins, which, of all the
                    external organs, are probably the most efficient in raising the body, as the
                    caudal extremity is the power chiefly employed during an onward course. The
                    lamprey, which has neither swimming bladder nor pectoral fins, dwells in the
                    mud. Flat fishes being unprovided with swimming bladders, are supposed for that
                    reason to raise themselves with difficulty to the surface; and they do not
                    appear to strike the water laterally like other fishes, but swim rather after
                    the manner of the Cetacea, by a motion alternately up and down. In all the other
                    animals of this class the chief organ of progressive motion is the tail, or
                    prolongation of the body, terminated by a caudal fin, the position of which,
                    unlike that of the great aquatic mammalia called whales, is vertical. The reason
                    of the difference is obviously this: A true fish, possessing the power of
                    extracting air from water by means of its gills, does not (except at rare
                    intervals) require to mount to the surface for the performance of the vital act
                    of respiration; but all cetaceous animals being furnished with lungs, which
                    cannot perform their functions except through an immediate communication with
                    the atmosphere, require their bodies to be terminated by a horizontal expansion,
                    the action of which is the most efficient for an ascending course.</p>
                <p part="N">It is, however, difficult to account for the fact that so considerable
                    an organ as the swimming bladder should have been denied to so many species, not
                    only of the more indolent kinds, which dwell composedly at the bottom of the
                    waters, but to many others which yield to none of their class in the ease and
                    velocity of their movements. Its presence or absence does not even accord with
                    the other conditions of organization; for while it is wanting in the common
                    mackerel, it is found to occur in a closely allied species, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Scomber pneumatophorus</hi> of Laroche.</p>
                <p part="N">Another singular peculiarity connected with the organization of certain
                    fishes maybe also shortly noticed in this place, we mean the power of conveying
                    electrical shocks. In Torpedos, the apparatus consists of membranous tubes
                    filled with mucous matter, divided by transverse chambers closely set together,
                    like the cells of honeycomb, and disposed in two groups placed on each side of
                    the head. They receive enormous branches of nerves from the fifth and eighth
                    pair. In the <hi rend="italic">Gymnotus</hi> this extraordinary structure
                    occupies the under surface of the body throughout its entire extent, and to a
                    considerable thickness. It is composed of parallel plates separated by thin
                    layers of mucilage. The effect of this natural galvanic pile will be detailed in
                    the course of the systematic portion of this article, when we shall have
                    occasion to mention the electric fishes in their proper place.</p>

                    GREAT CLASS IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.</p>
                <p part="N">It results not less from this general exposition of the structure of our
                    present class, than from all observation of special organization, that fishes
                    form a class of animals distinct from every other, and destined by the totality
                    of their conformation to live, move, and have their being in the waters. The
                    liquid element forms their proper place in the creation; there they had their
                    origin, there they must remain till the final consummation of all things,—and it
                    is either through slight and superficial approximations, or by vain metaphysical
                    speculation, that any modern writer could regard them as proceeding from an
                    exalted or more perfect development of the molluscous tribes. Equally unfounded
                    is of course that other and corresponding opinion, which, in the spirit of the
                    same philosophy, looks upon fishes as forming an elementary stage, or foetal
                    condition, of the other vertebrated classes. It is true that the Mollusca, in
                    common with fishes, respire by means of branchiae; they equally possess a
                    nervous and circulating system, an intestinal canal and a liver; “and nobody,”
                    says Cuvier, with a justifiable pride, “knows these things better than I, who
                    was the first to make known with any degree of completeness the anatomy and
                    zoological relations of the molluscous tribes.” As animal life, he

                    happens that some of these organs are common to several classes. But where is in
                    other respects the resemblance? The skeleton of these animals, and their entire
                    system of locomotion, are they comparable in the least of their parts? And even

                    can they be brought into relation with those connections which the latter
                    exhibit with the other vertebrated classes? By what passage does nature conduct
                    us from the one to the other? It is certainly by no means difficult, while
                    disregarding numerous disagreements, so to compose a definition as to embrace
                    only those points which they possess in common; but that definition assuredly
                    will always repose upon a pure abstraction of the mind, a definition simply
                    nominal, an assemblage of vain words, which can never be represented by a
                    harmonious and existing plan, notwithstanding whatever extraneous details may be
                    collected or conceived in support of such visionary views. By a like procedure,
                    there is in truth no two things, however remote or dissimilar, which may not be
                    so allied; for, whatever their disresemblance, there will always be some
                    particular point or other in which they may be found to agree. But when we look
                    to the characters in which objects differ, we shall find reason to view the
                    subject in another light. The heart itself in those Mollusca which have only
                    one, is placed in a contrary mode from that of fishes; it is at the junction of
                    the branchial veins and arteries of the body that that organ is attached; in
                    several the members are placed upon the head, in others the generative system is
                    lateral, and'frequently the respiratory organs are placed above those of
                    digestion, and extend more or less over the dorsal surface. Perhaps all that can
                    be said regarding any positive or important relationship between Mollusca and
                    fishes is, that both classes are possessed of branch iae.</p>
                <p part="N">It may indeed be observed, that whenever we proceed from these purely
                    verbal or metaphysical formula, we find ourselves lost among the most
                    inadmissible comparisons. According to one theorist, the shells of bivalves
                    represent the opercula of fishes; according to another, the buckler of the
                    cuttle-fish is a true fibrous bone; according to a third, the large scales of
                    the sturgeon, and the spines of the diodons, arc to be regarded as an external
                    skeleton. Others search for the desired analogies among the Crustacea, of which
                    the margins of the thorax represent the opercula. Beneath these margins the
                    branchiae actually occur, but if we continue the comparison, all is changed. The
                    medullary cord is towards the abdomen, the heart towards the back, and the
                    latter organ, as among the Mollusca, receives the blood from the branchiae, but
                    does not send it thither. Finally, some observers, apparently despairing of
                    their transcendental cause, perceive the rays or spiny apophyses of vertebrated
                    animals in the legs of the Crustacea, forgetting that, were it so, an obvious
                    degradation rather than amelioration of organic structure must have befallen the
                    class of fishes.</p>
                <p part="N">The affinity of fishes to other classes of vertebrated animals is much
                    better founded. At least we here find the commencement of sensible relations in
                    the number of organic systems, and in their mutual connections; but we are still
                    far from discovering a progressive and continuous course. We cannot in this
                    place report the conclusive reasoning of Baron Cuvier regarding the distinctions
                    of these classes. Wc shall merely state his conclusion to be, that if there is a
                    resemblance between the organs of fishes and those of the other great groups of
                    the animal kingdom, it is only in so far as the functions of such organs are
                    similar; that if we assert either that fishes are Mollusca or an ameliorated or
                    higher grade, or that they represent a commencing or foetal state of reptiles,
                    we can do so. only in an abstract or metaphysical acceptation, and that even
                    with that restriction we by no means convey an accurate notion of their organic
                    structure; that we cannot regard them cither as links of an imaginary chain of
                    successive forms (of which none could serve as the germ of another, since none
                    is capable of a solitary or isolated existence), nor of that other chain, not
                    less fanciful, of simultaneous and transitionary forms, which has no reality but
                    in the imagination of certain naturalists, more poetical than observant. They
                    pertain in truth, and solely, to the actual chain of co-existent beings,—of
                    beings necessary to each other, and which by their mutual action maintain the
                    resplendent order and harmony of created things.</p>

                <p part="N">SECT. XI.—THE CLASSIFICATION OF FISHES.</p>
                <p part="N">The class of fishes is of all others the most difficult to divide into
                    orders, according to fixed and perceptible characters. We shall here give a
                    brief view of Baron Cuvier’s arrangement, the details of which we shall
                    afterwards exhibit in our systematic view.</p>
                <p part="N">Fishes are divisible, in the first place, into two great and distinct
                    series, viz. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes properly so called,</hi> embracing the
                    great majority of species; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Chondropterygian</hi> or <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Cartilaginous Fishes,</hi> such as sharks and rays.</p>
                <p part="N">The general character of the latter series consists in the absence of
                    the bones of the upper jaw, the place of which is supplied by those of the
                    palate. Their entire structure also exhibits sundry analogies, to be afterwards
                    described. Cartilaginous fishes are further divisible into three principal
                    orders.</p>
                <p part="N">Isŕ. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyclostomi,</hi> the jaws of which are
                    soldered into an immoveable ring, and the branchiae open by means of numerous
                    holes. Example, the <hi rend="italic">Lamprey.</hi><hi rend="italic">2d.</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Selacπii,</hi> which possess the branchiae of the
                    Cyclostomi, but not their jaws. Example, <hi rend="italic">Sharks.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">2&gt;d.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Sturiones,</hi> of which the
                    branchial opening is in the usual fissure-like form, and furnished with an
                    opercle. Example. <hi rend="italic">Sturgeons.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The other great series, or that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ordinary
                        Fishes,</hi> presents a first subdivision into those in which the maxillary
                    bone and the palatine arch are fixed to the cranium. They constitute Cuvier’s
                    order <hi rend="smallcaps">Plectognatπi,</hi> which comprises two families, the
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Gymnodontes</hi> aud <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Sclerodermi.</hi> Examples, the genera <hi rend="italic">Diodon</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Ostracion.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">The next subdivision of the ordinary fishes contains certain species
                    with perfect jaws, but the branchiae of which, instead of being comb-shaped,
                    resemble a series of small tufts. They constitute an order called <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Lophobranchii,</hi> which comprises the two genera <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Syngnathus</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pegasus</hi> of
                    Linn. Example, the <hi rend="italic">Pipe-fish.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Of the ordinary fishes there then remains an immense assemblage, to the
                    general classification of which no other characters can be applied than those of
                    the external organs of motion. After a long and laborious research, Baron Cuvier
                    became satisfied that the least objectionable of these characters is still that
                    long ago employed by Ray and Artedi, drawn from the nature of the first rays of
                    the dorsal and anal fins. Thus the great body of the ordinary fishes is divided
                    into <hi rend="smallcaps">Malacopterygπ,</hi> in which all the rays arc soft,
                    with the occasional exception of the first of the dorsal, or of the pectorals;
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Acan-thopterygh,</hi> in which the first portion of the
                    dorsal, or the first dorsal if there are two fins of that kind, is always
                    supported by spinous rays, and where some similar spines are also found in the
                    anal fin, and at least one in each of the ventrals.</p>
                <p part="N">Of these two last-mentioned groups, the former, or <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192939934?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-9934-0164"
                    />Malacopterygĩĩ, may be conveniently subdivided according to the position of
                    the ventral fins, whether situate behind the abdomen, suspended to the apparatus
                    of the shoulder, or entirely wanting. This view furnishes us with three great
                    orders, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Malacopterygiĩ</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Abdominales</hi> (such as pike, salmon, and herring), the Μ. <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Sub-brachiati</hi> (such as cod, haddock, and flat fish),
                    and the Μ. <hi rend="smallcaps">Apodes</hi> (such as eels).</p>
                <p part="N">But such a basis of subdivision is altogether inapplicable to the
                    remaining group <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ordinary fishes, viz. the <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Acan-thoíterygii,</hi> which at present can only be placed
                    together in a certain series of natural families. Fortunately, several of these
                    families are possessed of characters almost as precise as those which could be
                    assigned to genuine orders. It is, however, impossible to assign to the families
                    of fish the same marked gradation so perceptible among those of the Mammalia.
                    Thus the Chondropterygians are related to serpents on the one hand by the organs
                    of the senses, and in certain cases even by the generative system; while, on the
                    other, they bear an alliance to the Mollusca and worms in the occasional
                    imperfection of their skeleton.</p>
                <p part="N">Before proceeding with our systematic exposition of the minor divisions,
                    we shall present our readers with a sketch of Baron Cuvier’s views regarding the
                    general character and relations of certain groups. After forty years devoted to
                    the study of Ichthyology, that great observer became convinced that no
                    acanthopterygian species ought to be mingled in classification with the fishes
                    of other families, as attempted by many of his predecessors; and he also came to
                    the conclusion that the acanthopterygian order, which comprises about three
                    fourths of the entire class, contains the characteristic type, and is the most
                    accordant and homogeneous, even amid all the variations which it undergoes.</p>
                <p part="N">The acanthopterygian character prevails over all the others, and these
                    ought to be employed only as subservient to it, and never in opposition; but the
                    extreme constancy of the general plan, and the predominating influence of the
                    regulating character, render it a matter of greater difficulty to apply precise
                    and perceptible characters of a subordinate nature. It is thus that the various
                    families of the acanthopterygian order pass so insensibly from one to another,
                    that we are often at a loss to define the transition. The family of Percidae,
                    for example, which is essentially distinguished from that of the Sciaenidae by
                    its palatinal teeth, comprises a group of some extent, and extremely natural in
                    its construction, which yet contains a portion of species possessed of those
                    teeth, while the other portion is without them. The same thing happens in the
                    family with mailed cheeks (joues cuirassées), the majority of which are allied
                    to the perches,—the others to the Sciaenidae. The sciaenoid genera themselves
                    approach in part to the Chaetodontes in the scales which in several instances
                    more or less cover their vertical fins, and yet it is necessary to assimilate
                    them still more closely to the Sparidae, by reason, in many other instances, of
                    the entire absence of those scales.</p>
                <p part="N">The malacopterygian families are distinguished by stronger and more
                    obvious differences, and several of them are not only natural, but subjected to
                    fixed limits, so that each, in its separation from the other, preserves within
                    itself a great resemblance in details. This precision is so sensible, that the
                    majority of natural families established by Cuvier in this part of the class had
                    been already signalised by Artedi as generic groups. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Siluri, Cyprini, Salmones,</hi><hi rend="italic">Clupeoe,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Esoces,</hi> may remain unbroken, and there is even no
                    inconvenience in distributing them according to the position of the ventral
                    fins, because in those genera the character in question, however trivial in
                    itself, is constant; but it is clearly impossible to preserve the distinction of
                    jugular, thoracic, and abdominal fishes, in the mode established by Linnaeus. It
                    is, as Cuvier observes, of small consequence, in fact, whether the ventrals
                    manifest themselves externally a little before or a little behind the pectorals,
                    or immediately beneath them; but the circumstance of importance, as connected
                    with the structure of the fish, is to ascertain whether the pelvis be attached
                    to the bones of the shoulder, or whether it is simply suspended in the muscles
                    of the abdomen. To designate the fish belonging to the former category, the-name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Sub-braxhians</hi> has been bestowed by Cuvier, and that
                    without any reference to the external position of the ventrals,—that
                    circumstance being dependent on the greater or less extent of the bones of the
                    pelvis. To those of the second category he leaves the older name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Abdominals.</hi> Lastly, the term <hi rend="italic"
                        >Apodes</hi> naturally designates the Malacopterygians destitute of ventral
                    fins.</p>
                <p part="N">Cuvier’s systematic exposition of fishes commences with the
                    Acanthopterygians, which constitute in reality only a single family of vast
                    extent. He then places in succession the various families of Malacopterygians,
                    in the order in which they seem allied to the preceding great division; but he
                    guards the student from inferring that these relations follow only in a single
                    line or series. If the abdominal Malacopterygians may be so arranged, and may
                    even be made to commence with those which possess some spiny rays, they are not
                    followed in so natural a succession by either the apodal or sub∙brachian tribes.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Gaãi,</hi> for example, are as nearly related as any of
                    the Abdominals to certain species of the acanthopterygian order, and 'there
                    would be no reason for placing them after the Abdominals if the question were
                    mooted respecting the station they should hold in nature. If they are actually
                    arranged subsequent to the latter in our systems, it is because the exposition
                    of facts in a book necessarily requires a successive order.</p>
                <p part="N">The spirit of the same observation is applicable to the rest of the
                    fishes ;—to those of which the upper jaw is fixed <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Pleetognathi),</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> to such as have tufted
                    branchiae <hi rend="italic">{Loρhobranchii),</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> and,
                    above all, to the great and important series of Chondropterygians, which
                    terminate the class. It is indeed chiefly among those last mentioned that we
                    perceive the futility of whatever system seeks to arrange the objects of
                    creation in a single line. Several of the genera alluded to, the rays and
                    sharks, for example, may be said to rise above the rank of ordinary fishes by
                    the complicated nature of some of their organs of sense, and by that of the
                    generative system, which is more fully developed in some particulars than even
                    that of birds ;— while other genera of the same series, and at which we arrive
                    by graduated transitions, such as the Lampreys and Ammocaetes, become so
                    simplified in their structure, that they have even been regarded as affording a
                    connecting link between the class of fishes and that of the articulated worms.
                    The genus <hi rend="italic">Ammocaetes</hi> certainly possesses no skeleton, and
                    its muscular apparatus is attached solely to tendinous or membranous
                    supports.</p>
                <p part="N">Let it not therefore be imagined, says Cuvier, that because one genus or
                    family is placed anterior to another, it is for that reason to be regarded as
                    more perfect, or superior to those that follow. He alone will indulge in that
                    fond fancy, who pursues the chimerical project of ranging beings in a single
                    series,—a project, be it remembered, now renounced by philosophy. The further wc
                    advance into the penetralia of the temple of nature, the more we shall feel
                    convinced that a falser notion was never entertained in relation to natural
                    history. Genuine systems view each being not as intermediate merely to two
                    others, but as central among many ;—they show the wonderful radiations that link
                    it more or less immediately with the vast web of organic life; and it is by such
                    extended views alone that <pb break="no" facs="nls:192939947?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-9947-0165"/>we shall acquire ideas worthy of nature and of
                    nature’s God. It is therefore not so much in the position which a being occupies
                    in our published systems, which are necessarily linear or consecutive, that we
                    are to seek for those multifarious relations, or for the actual degree of
                    organisation,—but in accurate descriptions of structure afforded by those who
                    possess the use of their eyes and pen. It is not, however, to be in any way
                    maintained that no direct classification is possible, or that species should not
                    be formed into groups, and embraced by definitions. These approximations are on
                    the contrary so real, that the natural understanding of man has ever inclined
                    towards them, and in all ages and countries the vulgar as well as the learned
                    have formed their genera. It is in truth one of the great objects of science to
                    render the various groups into which, for our own convenience, we must arrange
                    the objects of creation, as natural in themselves, and as nearly related to
                    their neighbours, as is consistent with the necessity of placing them in our
                    descriptive systems in a single fixed position,—a position, be it remembered, in
                    which their numerous and mixed relations can neither be philosophically
                    exhibited nor fully expressed.</p>

                <p part="N">These, as already mentioned, form much the most numerous division of the
                    class. They are distinguished by the spines, which occupy the place of the first
                    rays of the dorsal fin, or which alone sustain the anterior dorsal when there
                    are two. Sometimes, instead of an anterior dorsal, there are only a few free
                    spines. The first rays of their anal fin are also spinous, and there is
                    generally one of a similar nature to each of the ventrals. The Acanthopterygians
                    bear so many relations to each other,—their several natural families exhibit so
                    many variations in the apparent characters which one might suppose capable of
                    indicating orders or other subdivisions,—that it has been found impossible to
                    divide them, otherwise than by those natural families themselves, which are thus
                    left without any higher combinations.</p>

                    estimation, although the character given of it in that respect by Ausonius is
                    higher than accords with modern views. The female deposits her ova, united
                    together by a viscid matter, in lengthened strings, a peculiarity noted by
                    Aristotle. The number of these eggs sometimes amounts to nearly a million. The
                    perch occurs over all Europe, and most of the northern districts of Asia.

                <p part="N">The genera of this group, besides possessing eight branchial rays, are
                    distinguished by this further peculiarity, otherwise unexampled among the
                    acanthopterygian tribes, that they possess, besides the spine, seven soft rays,
                    or even more, to each of the ventral fins. Many of the species are remarkable

                    furnished at its angle with a strong spine directed backwards.</p>
                <p part="N">The species of this genus are widely distributed, occurring in the
                    warmer portions of both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Few species are more
                    remarkable, either for the magnificence of their integuments, or the strength of
                    their spines. The lustre of their scales equals that of a mirror, and is
                    rendered still more brilliant by bands of red and spots of brown variously
                    distributed. They bear a close resemblance to each other. That which we have

                    been brought from the African coast, and seems identical with specimens more
                    recently collected by MM. Quoy and Gaymard at the Cape de Verd Islands.</p>

                    dentated margin, and wants the spine at the angle.</p>
                <p part="N">This genus is remarkable for its swimming bladder being divided into two
                    portions, of which the anterior is bilobed and attached to the cranium in two
                    places, where it is merely covered by a membrane, and which correspond to the
                    cavities of the ears.</p>

                        >Trachichtys</hi> are nearly allied to the preceding. The latter was
                    originally characterised, and somewhat vaguely, by Dr Shaw, from a specimen
                    received from the New Holland seas.</p>
                <p part="N">All the percoid fishes to which we have hitherto alluded are
                    characterised by having their ventral fins inserted beneath the pectorals. But
                    in several genera these important organs are otherwise placed. Thus, in the
                    ensuing group, their position is in advance of the pectorals, that is, upon the
                    throat. They are hence called <hi rend="smallcaps">Jugular Percidae.</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Genus Trachinus,</hi> Linn. Head compressed;

                <p part="N">Several of the species occur in the European seas, and two species,
                    known in our own country as the greater and lesser weevers (<hi rend="italic">T.

                    English coasts. They remain concealed in the sand, and the wounds inflicted by
                    their spines are not only painful, but dangerous.</p>
                <p part="N">“That the greater weever,” observes Mr Yarrell, <hi rend="superscript">

                    is tenacious of life when caught, and that its flesh is excellent, are four
                    points that have been already noticed; but this subject, in reference to fishes
                    generally, may be farther illustrated. It may be considered as a law, that those
                    fish that swim near the surface of the water have a high standard of
                    respiration, a low degree of muscular irritability, great necessity for oxygen,
                    die soon, almost immediately, when taken out of water, and have flesh prone to
                    rapid deeomposition. On the contrary, those fish that live near the bottom of
                    the water have a low standard of respiration, a high degree of muscular
                    irritability, and less necessity for oxygen; they sustain life long after they
                    are taken out of the water, and their flesh remains good for several days. The
                    carp, the tench, the various flat fish, and the eel, are seen gaping and
                    writhing on the stalls of the fishmongers for hours in succession; but no one
                    sees any symptom of motion in the mackerel, the salmon, the trout, or the
                    herring, unless present at the capture. These four last named, and many others
                    of the same habits, to be eaten in the greatest perfection, should be prepared
                    for table the same day they are caught;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            Isaac Walton says, “But take this rule with you—that a chub newly taken

                    be kept till the second day with advantage, and even longer without injury; and
                    fishmongers generally are well aware of the circumstance, that fish from deep
                    water have the muscle more dense in structure, —in their language, more firm to

                <p part="N">In the third principal division of the percoid family the ventral fins
                    are inserted behind the pectorals. They are hence named <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p part="N">The species are allied to the Percidae in general by the close set teeth
                    upon their jaws, vomer, and palate; but they possess the arched or convex snout,
                    and the scaly· vertical fins, which distinguish so many of the Sciaenidae. Their
                    two dorsals are distant; their pre-opercle dentated, and their mouths greatly
                    cleft. They appear to inhabit the seas of all warm countries. <hi rend="italic"

                        >mango</hi><hi rend="italic">fish</hi> of India, so called from its fine
                    yellow colour. According to Russel and Hamilton Buchanan, it is the most
                    delicious of all the species eaten in Bengal. It is fished for all the year
                    round, at the mouths of rivers, where the waters are saline. It ascends to some
                    distance about spawning time in spring, but not beyond the influence of the
                    tide. When in prime condition, the mango-fish, though only a few inches long,
                    sells so high as a rupee. The eggs are also much esteemed. The colours of this
                    species, like those of other fishes, seem to vary greatly, probably in relation
                    to the condition of individuals, or the season of the year. Μ. Dussumier
                    describes it as of a citron yellow, with the fins and filaments of a beautiful
                    orange. Buchanan states that the greater number are silvery, with reflections of
                    gold and purple, and a greenish tint upon the back; the fins being then yellow,
                    and the upper parts spotted with black. The same author names the silvery
                    mango-fish <hi rend="italic">P. risua,</hi> and the yellow ones <hi
                        rend="italic">P. aureus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he hesitates to
                    make them distinct species, and rather opines that the fine colour is the result
                    of season, and that it continues only during spawning time. This view of the
                    subject is well confirmed by the fact, that the high-coloured specimens sent to
                    Europe by Μ. Dussumier were full either of roe or milt, and is moreover in exact
                    conformity with the observations of all practical anglers and Ichthyologists in
                    relation to the species of our own country. We here figure (Plate CCXCVIH. fig.

                    elongated; two distant dorsals; head oblong, with the lower jaw forming a

                    extremely similar. This fish, though used as an article of food, is occasionally
                    poisonous. Μ. Poey alleges that the malady produced by eating it is sometimes
                    mortal; but he adds that it is easy to distinguish the dangerous individuals
                    beforehand, by a peculiar blackness at the base of their teeth. Another species

                    among the Antilles, is said to be extremely formidable, on account of its
                    ferocious habits. It is among the number of those marine monsters of which
                    Rochefort speaks in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                    slightest effect in producing intimidation; on the contrary, such signs of
                    dislike only excite it to a greater readiness to seize upon its victim. It must

                    of the Percidae, and we shall therefore follow that great authority in this as

                <p part="N">To this sub-genus belongs the famous red mullet (JZ. <hi rend="italic"
                        >barbatus'),</hi> Plate CCXCVHI. fig. 12, which, by reason both of its great
                    personal beauty, and the exquisite flavour of its flesh, has for so many ages
                    ministered to the degenerate and heartless luxury of man. It is very frequent in
                    the Mediterranean, and also occurs occasionally along the outer and more
                    northern coasts of Europe. It is brought occasionally to the London markets
                    during the mackerel season; but it is doubtful whether Müller is not in error in
                    assigning to it so northern a locality as Denmark. “The great and rich among the
                    Romans were in the habit, according to Varro, of preserving the red mullet in
                    artificial waters, as one of the most convincing proofs of their individual
                    wealth. Cicero has ridiculed the senseless ostentation with which they exhibited
                    fine specimens of this fish, domiciliated in their own ponds; but Seneca and
                    Pliny have rendered their countrymen odious in the eyes of posterity, and of
                    other nations, by relating the cruelty with which, in their disgusting orgies,
                    they revelled over the dying mullet, while the bright red colour of its healthy
                    state passed through various shades of purple, violet, blue, and white, as life
                    gradually receded, till the convulsions of death put an end to the <hi
                        rend="italic">pleasing</hi> spectacle. They had these devoted fish enclosed
                    in water in vessels with sides of crystal, over a slow fire, on their tables,
                    and derived a fiend-like pleasure from the lingering sufferings of their victims
                    as the increasing heat of the water gradually destroyed them, before the final
                    operation of boiling had rendered them fit to gratify the refined taste of
                    civilization. One cannot indeed read these revolting histories of old time
                    without a blush at certain modern practices far too analogous with them: the
                    sense of taste may, in the cases alluded to, be alone consulted; but the
                    difference is nothing to the suffering animal, whether its torments gratify one
                    or more of the evil passions of its tormentors. The skinning of eels, and the
                    boiling of live Crustacea, would be as disgusting as the gradual boiling of a
                    mullet, did not, in this as in many other cases, the practice of evil destroy
                    the feeling of its iniquity. So extravagant was the folly of the Romans with
                    regard to this fish, that they often gave for them immense prices. Martial
                    mentions one of four pounds weight, which had cost 1300 sesterces; and it is
                    said that the Emperor Tiberius sold one weighing nearly five pounds for 4000
                    sesterces. Asinius Celer, one of the consuls, is reported by Pliny to have paid
                    8000; and, according to Suetonius, 30,000 sesterces had been given for three
                        mullets.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                    London fish-mongers throughout the year, though in much greater plenty during
                    May and June, at which time their colours are most vivid, and the fish, as food,
                    is in the best condition. The striped red mullet spawns in spring, and the young

                    the singular aspect of their variously-armed heads bestows so peculiar a
                    physiognomy, that they have always been classed together in special genera. As
                    examples, we may mention the gurnards, father-lashers, and river bull-heads,
                    belonging to <hi rend="italic">Tτigla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cottus.</hi>
                    The common character of all these fishes consists in the sub-orbital bone being
                    more or less extended over the cheek, and articulating behind with the
                    pre-opercle. The genus <hi rend="italic">Uτanoscopus</hi> alone of the preceding
                    family exhibits some affinity to this form of structure; but still in that case,
                    the sub-orbital, though very broad, is connected posteriorly, not with the
                    opercle, but with the temporal bones. It is then from this peculiar extension
                    and attachment of one or both of the suborbitals that the family of the <hi

                    is strongly marked. An enormous sub-orbital covers the entire cheek, and even

                    way possesses no separate movement; the sides of the head are nearly vertical,
                    producing a form approaching that of a cube or of a parallelopiped, and the

                    species too remarkable for its functions, so opposite to those of its class m
                    general, not to have attracted from an early period the attention of mankind. It
                    is extremely common in the Mediterranean, and has been mentioned by all the
                    authors who have treated of the fishes of that inland sea. lhe ardour with which
                    it is pursued by the dolphins and bonitos, the sudden effort which it makes to
                    escape these predaceous creatures by vaulting into the air, the new and probably
                    unthought of dangers which there await it from gulls and other aquatic birds,
                    render it an object of the highest interest to the unaccustomed landsman,
                    somewhat wearied with the monotony of a sailor’s life. “It is by the extension
                    of the pectoral rays and membrane that the fish is enabled to raise itself from
                    its proper element to the regions of the air, though this is by no means a
                    continual flight, for the utmost it can do is to describe an arch over the
                    surface of the water extending to a distance of about 120 feet, and sufficiently
                    elevated for the fish sometimes to fall on the deck of a large vessel. This
                    power of flight or momentary suspension would be much greater if the pectoral
                    membrane could preserve its humidity longer: this is soon evaporated in the heat
                    of the tropics; and the membrane, as it becomes dry, loses its buoyant power,
                    and the fish falls. They are sometimes so numerous as to afford much pleasure to
                    the spectator by their repeated flights; and at particular times, especially on
                    the approach of rough weather, in the night, numbers of them may be seen, by the
                    phosphoric light they emit, marking their arched passages in apparent streams of
                        fire.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                <p part="N">It is singular that the species to which we now allude <hi rend="italic"

                    Mediterranean, should be almost entirely unknown along the oceanic coasts of
                    Europe. Still more singular is it, in relation to that exclusion, that it should
                    at the same time be found across the Atlantic, and spreading not only along all
                    the central and southern shores of the New World, but extending even as far
                    north as the chilly waters of Newfoundland. The great Gulf Stream may however
                    prove influential in the northern distribution of many western species.</p>
                <p part="N">We shall conclude this notice by observing, that the fish in question
                    measures about a foot in length; it is brown above, reddish below, with blackish
                    fins, variously spotted with blue. Its most formidable weapon of offence
                    consists of the long and pointed spine of the opercle, which it can raise and
                    render almost perpendicular to its body. With this organ it is easy to conceive
                    that it may produce serious, or even dangerous wounds; and we therefore wonder
                    the less that a poet like Oppian should have declared them mortal.</p>

                    rather as a mass or unformed lump of corrupted jelly. “Totum corpus,” says
                    Gommerson, “muco squalidum et quasi ulcerosum.” Its head and members seem

                    form a fin, and in the pelvis being united to larger humerais than usual, thus
                    furnishing the abdomen with a kind of bony cuirass. The ventrals, placed

                    in Switzerland; but the contrary has been long since ascertained. Our most

                    is supposed that more than a single kind ha’s been confounded. It is an active
                    and greedy little fish, extremely destructive of the fry of other species, and
                    consequently injurious in ponds where these are sought to be preserved. Mr Henry
                    Baker informs us that it will spring not less than a foot perpendicularly out of
                    the water, and to a much greater distance in an oblique direction, when it
                    desires to overcome any opposing obstacle. “It is scarcely to be conceived,” he
                    adds, “what damage these little fish do, and how greatly detrimental they are to
                    the increase of all the fish in general among whicĥ they live; for it is with
                    the utmost industry, sagacity, and greediness that they seek out and destroy all
                    the young fry that come in their way, which are pursued with the utmost
                    eagerness, and swallowed down without distinction, provided they are not too
                    large; and in proof of this, I must assert that a bannstic-kle which I kept for
                    some time, did, on the 4th of May, devour, in five hours’ time, seventy-four
                    young dace, which were about a quarter of an inch long, and of the thickness of
                    a horse-hair. Two days after it swallowed sixty-two; and would, I am persuaded,
                    have eat as many every day, could I have procured them for it.” The stickle-back
                    sometimes swarms in prodigious numbers. Pennant states, that at Spalding, in
                    Lincolnshire, there are once in seven years amazing shoals, which appear in the
                    Welland, coming up the river in the form of a vast column. This concourse is
                    supposed to arise from the multitudes which have been washed out of the fens by
                    the floods of several years, and which collect in deep holes, till, overcharged
                    with numbers, they are obliged to attempt a change of place. The quantity may
                    perhaps be conceived from the tact, that a man employed in collecting them
                    gained for a considerable time four shillings a day by selling them at the rate
                    of a halfpenny a bushel. <hi rend="italic">G. pungitivus,</hi> commonly called

                <p part="N">.We shall here conclude our exposition of the family with mailed
                    cheeks.</p>
                <p part="N">FAMILY III—SCIAENIDAE.</p>
                <p part="N">This family is closely related to the Percidae, and exhibits almost all
                    the same combinations of external characters, especially the dentations of the
                    pre-opercle, and the opercular spines; but the Sciaenidae have never any teeth
                    either on the vomer or palatines; the bones of the face and cranium are
                    generally cavernous, and the muzzle more or less gibbous; a form rarely observed
                    among the Percidae. The vertical fins are frequently somewhat scaly.</p>
                <p part="N">Even in its interior organization our present family bears a
                    considerable resemblance to the perches; but there are greater variations, and
                    especially a more complicated structure of the swimming bladder. In several
                    species that organ is furnished with a multitude of branched appendages (See
                    Plate CCXCVH. figs. 6, 7, 8); and although we cannot trace in it any connection
                    with the exterior, yet when we consider that many of the Sciaenidae are more
                    remarkable even than the gurnards for the production of extraordinary sounds, it
                    is difficult to believe that the peculiar structure of the swimming bladder is
                    not in some way connected with their utterance. The Sciaenidae are almost as
                    numerous as the perches; they are characterised in a great measure by similar
                    habits, and present the same advantages to the human race. They almost all
                    afford excellent eating; of several, indeed, the flavour is exquisite; and a few
                    are of great size. The famous <hi rend="italic">maigre,</hi> for example (*S <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi>. <hi rend="italic">aquila,</hi> Cuv.), commonly
                    weighs about sixty pounds, and sometimes attains to the length of six feet.</p>
                <p part="N">A. <hi rend="italic">Two dorsal fins.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus
                        Sciaena, Cuv.</hi> Head gibbous, supported by cavernous bones; two dorsals,
                    or one deeply emarginate, with its softer portion much longer than the spinous;
                    a short anal fin; a dentated pre-opercle; an opercle terminated by points; heven
                    branchial rays.</p>
                <p part="N">The species bear a great resemblance to perch, except that they want the
                    teeth upon the palate. Their whole head is scaly, their swimming bladder
                    frequently furnished with remarkable appendages, and the stony bones of the ear
                    are larger than in most fishes. One of the most remarkable is the <hi
                        rend="italic">maigre</hi> above alluded to (N. <hi rend="italic"
                        >aquila),</hi> called <hi rend="italic">Umbrina</hi> by the Romans, and held
                    in high esteem even at the present day. (Plate CCXCIX. fig. 10.) It is a rare
                    fish on the outer coasts of Europe, and disappears almost entirely towards the
                    north. The only example with which we are acquainted of its appearance in the
                    northern parts of our own country is recorded by Dr Patrick Neill.<note

                    November 1819, and was first observed by the fishermen while endeavouring to
                    escape from a seal. It measured five feet four inches in length, and when lifted
                    into the boat, made its usual “purring sound.” Other instances are mentioned by
                    Mr Yarrell. It is, however, extremely common in many parts of the Mediterranean,
                    especially along the Roman states. Paul Jovius mentions that many are taken
                    there at the mouths of rivers, along with sturgeons. They swim in troops, and
                    are said to utter at times a singular low bellowing beneath the waters. It is
                    recorded that three fishermen, guided by this sound, dropt their net on one
                    occasion so successfully as to secure twenty fine fish at a single throw. The
                    noise may be heard at a depth of twenty fathoms, and is often very perceptible
                    when the ear is placed upon the gunnel of the boat. Its tone seems to vary, as
                    some have compared it to a dull buzzing, others to a sharp whistle. Some of the
                    fishermen allege that the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192940090?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-0090-0176"/>males alone are musical during spawning time,
                    and that it is quite possible to capture them without any bait, merely by
                    imitating this peculiar sound. One alluded to by Cuvier as having been entangled
                    in a net spread along the shore at Dieppe, was at first found sleeping; but on
                    being handled, it roused itself so suddenly, and with such violence, as to
                    precipitate the fisherman into the water, and force him to call for assistance
                    .before he could become its master. High, though of course imaginary virtues,
                    were formerly attributed to the stones which occur in the ear of this, as of
                    other osseous fishes. They were worn on the neck, set in gold; and Belon says
                    they were called <hi rend="italic">colicstones,</hi> being renowned for the
                    cure, and even prevention, of that complaint. It was necessary, however, that
                    they should be received as a gift,—such as were purchased being found to lose
                    their virtue.</p>
                <p part="N">The species above mentioned belongs to the genus Scι- <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">aena</hi> proper of Cuvier, a subdivision characterised by
                    the feebleness of the anal spines, and by the want of canine teeth and
                    barbles.</p>
                <p part="N">Other subdivisions of the principal genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Sciaena</hi> are as follows :— <hi rend="smallcaps">Otolithus</hi> and <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Ancylodon</hi> are foreign groups (from India and America),
                    which we shall merely name. <hi rend="smallcaps">Corvina</hi> of Cuvier differs
                    from Sciaena proper chiefly in the much greater strength of the second anal
                    spine. An abundant species in the Mediterranean is the <hi rend="italic">C.
                        nigra,</hi> of a silvery brown colour, with the ventral and anal fins black.
                    It occurs in salt marshes and the sea, but does not appear to ascend rivers. It
                    is less esteemed than the maigre, but is not unfrequently sold for that fish in
                    the Italian markets. <hi rend="smallcaps">Johnius</hi> of Bloch is closely
                    allied to the preceding. We here figure as an example of that minor group, the
                        <hi rend="italic">C. dentex</hi> of Cuv., a species from St Domingo. (Plate
                    CCXCIX. fig. 12.) Several of the fishes used as food in India belong to the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Johnius.</hi> Their flesh is light, but not highly
                    flavoured. They are called <hi rend="italic">τvhitings</hi> by the English in
                    Bengal. The species are tolerably numerous, and inhabit both seas and rivers.
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Umbrina</hi> of Cuvier is distinguished from the other
                    Sciaenae by bearing a barble on the symphysis of the lower jaw. (Ibid. fig. 11.)
                    The species represented (<hi rend="italic">U. coroides)</hi> is a native of
                    Brazil. The bearded Umbrina (<hi rend="italic">lJ. vulgaris,</hi> Cuv.), a
                    species frequent on the coasts of France, Italy, and Spain, was captured in the
                    river Eye in 1827, as recorded in the minute-book of the Linnaean Society. <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Pogonias,</hi> Lacépède, resembles the preceding; but it is
                    furnished with several barbles instead of one. The species are remarkable for
                    their size, some of them weighing occasionallyaboveahundred pounds, and for the
                    singular sounds uttered by them, and which have gained them the vulgar name of
                        <hi rend="italic">drums.</hi> Mr John White, an American lieutenant, who (in
                    1824) published a Voyage to the China Seas, relates, that being at the mouth of
                    the river Cambodia, himself and crew were greatly astonished by certain
                    extraordinary sounds, which were heard from around and beneath the vessel. They
                    resembled a combination of the base of an organ, the sound of bells, and the
                    guttural cries of a large frog, with certain tones, which the imagination might
                    attribute to a gigantic harp. It might almost have been said that the vessel
                    trembled at those uncertain sounds. For some time they increased, and finally
                    formed a loud and universal chorus, the entire length of the vessel, and on
                    either side. In proportion as they ascended the river the mysterious sounds
                    diminished, and finally altogether ceased. The interpreter gave the information
                    that they were produced by a troop of fishes of a flattened oval form, which
                    possess the faculty of adhering firmly to various bodies by their mouths. A
                    similar phenomenon was noticed by the illustrious Humboldt in the South Seas,
                    although he was unable at the time to divine the cause. It would, as Cuvier has
                    remarked, be an object of curious research to discover by what organ these
                    sounds are produced. We have already mentioned, that the majority of the
                    Sciaenidae, especially such as are the most remarkable for the utterance of the
                    sounds in question, have large swimming bladders, furnished with strong muscles.
                    In some species the organ is characterised by prolongations, more or less
                    complicated, which even penetrate the intervals of the ribs. It must, however,
                    be borne in mind that these swimming bladders have no communication with the
                    intestinal canal, nor in general with any part of the exterior. The example of

                    of which they embellish by the splendour of their colours, which are in general
                    extremely brilliant. They may be perceived swimming about incessantly, and with
                    great vivacity, among the rocks, and in the watery pools left by the ebbing
                    tide. Although for the most part eatable, none of the species furnishes an
                    important article of consumption, on account of the smallness of their size, and
                    their not occurring in numerous shoals.</p>

                <p part="N">The genera of this family, like those of the Sciaenidae, have the palate
                    destitute of teeth, and in their general forms, as well as in several
                    particulars of their organization, they bear a strong alliance to that family;
                    but they have no scales upon the fins. Their muzzle is not gibbous, nor the
                    bones of their head cavernous. There are no dentations to the pre-opercle, nor
                    spines to the opercle. The pylorus is furnished with caecal appendages. None of
                    the species possesses more than six rays to the branchiae. They are further
                    divisible according to the form of their teeth.</p>

                    they easily crush with their molar teeth. Certain kinds appear to devour fuci,

                    others from the Atlantic Ocean, filled with that marine vegetation. Many vague
                    notices of the Sargi are contained in ancient authors. AElian and Oppian inform
                    us that the male is polygamous, and fights with great fury against his own sex
                    for the possession of many females·</p>

                <p part="N">The same authors attribute to it a feeling still more extraordinary,—a
                    lively passion for goats, which it exhibits by always swimming with great
                    rapidity towards those animals, and indulging in playful gambols before them. So
                    blind was this passion, that a fisherman (it was so alleged) might catch as many
                    as he pleased by disguising himself with the skin and horns of a goat,'and
                    scattering in the water flour steeped in goats’ broth. We have somewhere seen a
                    doggrel rhyme in allusion to this strange and foundationless fancy (it may have
                    been an attempted translation of an ancient epigram), in which it was expressed

                <p part="N">The best-known species inhabits the Mediterranean. It is the »S'. <hi
                        rend="italic">Pondeletii</hi> of Cuv. (Plate CCC. fig. 12.) The American
                    shores produce several others, one of which <hi rend="italic">(S. οvis)</hi> is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">sheeps-head</hi> by the Americans. Dr Mitchell
                    speaks in the most eulogistic terms of the superexcellence of its flesh, and of
                    the high esteem in which it is held at the tables of New York. It yields in his
                    opinion to few fishes, and is worthy of being served at the most sumptuous
                    entertainments. The price varies from a dollar to a dollar and a half for a
                    middle-sized individual, and above that size the price ranges even so high as
                    from four to seven pounds sterling. They sometimes weigh from fourteen to
                    fifteen pounds. The fishery of this species forms an object of importance along
                    the coasts of the state of New York. It approaches those of Long Island in the
                    hot season from the month of June till the middle of September, after which it
                    secms to seek retirement in the deep abysses of the ocean. As they swim in
                    troops, they may be advantageously fished for with the net, and many hundreds
                    are sometimes taken at a single cast. With the great nets used at Rayner town,
                    and the two islands, thousands are drawn ashore. They are immediately packed in
                    ice, and despatched during the cool of the night to the markets of New York. It
                    is difficult to take the <hi rend="italic">sheep s-head</hi> with a line,
                    because it contrives to snap the very hooks asunder with its cutting teeth.</p>

                        rend="italic">Aurata,</hi> a term applied to them by ancient authors. The
                    Greeks named them Chrysophris, which signifies golden eye-brow, in allusion to
                    the brilliant spot of gold which the common species bears between its eyes. That
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aurata</hi> of the Latins was identical with the <hi

                    in Pliny, which is obviously borrowed from Aristotle, and where the former word
                    is used as the translation of the latter. According to Columella, the Aurata was
                    among the number of the fishes brought up by the Romans in their <hi

                    vivaria, one Sergius Orata, is supposed to have derived his surname from the
                    fish in question. AElian tells us that the Chrysophrĩs is the most timid of all
                    fishes, and that branches of poplars planted in the sand during a reflux so
                    terrified a party of these fishes which were carried upwards by the flux, that
                    in the succeeding reflux they did not dare to pass the poplars, but allowed
                    themselves to be taken by the hand.</p>

                    The fishermen informed that author that it agitates the sand forcibly with its
                    tail, so as to discover the shell-fish which may lie beneath concealed. It is
                    extremely fond of muscles, and its near presence is sometimes ascertained by the
                    noise which it makes while breaking their shells with its teeth. It greatly
                    dreads cold, and many were observed to perish during the severe winter of 1766.

                    distinguished by a filament which results from the prolongation of one or more
                    of the soft rays of the dorsal fin. The genus is very extensive, containing
                    upwards of sixty species even in its restricted constitution. We must here

                    eight inches in length, and is remarkable for the following peculiarity. It
                    feeds on flies and other winged insects, and when it perceives one of these
                    either hovering over the surface, or settled on a twig or blade of grass, it
                    ejects against it with considerable force a drop of liquid from ist tubular
                    snout, so as to drive it into the water. In shooting at a sitting insect it
                    generally approaches cautiously within a few feet before it explodes the water.
                    Schlosser has described this curious device in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1764, after Hummel, and it has since
                    been confirmed by Reinwardt. It is even said to be an amusement of the Chinese
                    in Java to keep this fish in confinement in a large vessel of water, with a view
                    to observe its dexterity in the practice of this admirable instinct. They fasten
                    a fly or other insect to the side of the vessel, when the Chelmon immediately
                    bombards it with such precision as very rarely to miss the mark. In a state of
                    nature it is said to inhabit both the coasts and rivers of Java. We are as yet

                    large size, its singular form, its extreme abundance, and the exquisite flavour
                    of its flesh. In spite of all these circumstances, most modern authors seem to
                    have written regarding it as if they were blindfolded. Bloch regarded it as a
                    northern fish, simply because so far back as 1681 a specimen was thrown ashore
                    on our Yorkshire coast; and Lacépède describes it as an oceanic species. The

                <p part="N">When considered isolately, these celcbratcd fishes are by no means
                    difficult to characterise. The simple separation of the posterior of the second
                    dorsal, and of those of the anal fin, would of itself suffice; but the species
                    above named are the chiefs of a numerous series of genera and sub-gencra, in
                    which the more typical form gradually alters, and passes insensibly into others
                    which do not exhibit either the character just mentioned, or almost any other by
                    which the principal types arc distinguished. Scales usually very small, causing
                    the greater part of the skin to appear as if entirely smooth; opercular pieces
                    without spines or dentations, and in general numerous caeca ;—these arc almost
                    the only prevailing characters which can be assigned to the family, which at the
                    same time exhibits a likeness in the aspect of its constituent groups which
                    never leaves it. In short, it forms what botanists call a family by series or
                    transition. The majority have the sides of the caudal extremity carinated, or
                    armed with scales or shields, which are themselves carinated; or the terminal
                    rays of the second dorsal or of the anal arc free; or the spiny rays of that
                    dorsal want their uniting membrane. Most frequently the caudal fin is of great
                    size, and corresponding vigour. In the majority, also, the first spiny rays of
                    the anal fin are separated from the others, and form, as it were, a small
                    distinct fin by themselves. But none of these characters is common to the

                    refer to the spotted appearance of the upper parts, and to be derived from the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">macularius.</hi> We shall here avail ourselves of Mr
                    Yarrelľs history of this important species.</p>
                <p part="N">“The mackerel was supposed by Anderson, Duhamel, and others, to be a
                    fish of passage, performing, like some birds, certain periodicaI migrations, and
                    making long voyages from north to south at one season of the year, and the
                    reverse at another. It does not appear to have been sufficiently considered,
                    that, inhabiting a medium which varied but little either in its temperature or
                    productions, locally, fishes are removed beyond the influence of the two
                    principal causes which make a temporary change of situation necessary.
                    Independently of the difficulty of tracing the course pursued through so vast an
                    expanse of water, the order of the appearance of the fish at different places on
                    the shores of the temperate and southern parts of Europe is the reverse of that
                    which, according to their theory, ought to have happened. It is known that this
                    fish is now taken, even on some parts of our own coast, in every month of the
                    year. It is probable that the mackerel inhabits almost the whole of the European
                    seas; and the law of nature which obliges them and many others to visit the
                    shallower water of the shores at a particular season, appears to be one of those
                    wise and bountiful provisions of the Creator, by which not only is the species
                    perpetuated with tire greatest certainty, but a large portion of the parent
                    animals are thus brought within the reach of man, who, but for the action of
                    this law, would be deprived of many of those species most valuable to him as
                    food. For the mackerel dispersed over the immense surface of the deep, no
                    effective fishery could be carried on; but, approaching the shore as they do
                    from all directions, and roving along the coast collected in immense shoals,
                    millions are caught, which yet form but a very small portion compared with the
                    myriads that escape.</p>
                <p part="N">“This subject receives farther illustration from a freshwater fish, as
                    stated in the Magazine of Natural History, vol. vii. p. 637: ‘ W <hi
                        rend="superscript"> τ</hi> hen the char spawn, they are seen in the shallow
                    parts of the rocky lakes (in which only they are found), and some of the streams
                    that run into them: they are then taken in abundance, but so soon as the
                    spawning is over, they retire into the deepest parts of the lake, and are but
                    rarely caught.’</p>
                <p part="N">“It may be observed farther, that as there is scarcely a month
                    throughout the year in which the fishes of some one or more species are not
                    brought within the reach of man by the operation of the imperative law of nature
                    referred to, a constant succession of wholesome food is thus spread before him,
                    which, in the first instance, costs him little beyond the exercise of his
                    ingenuity and labour to obtain.</p>
                <p part="N">“On the coast of Ireland, the mackerel is taken from he county of Kerry
                    in the west, along the southern shore, eastward to Cork and Waterford; from
                    thence northward to Antrim, and north-west to Londonderry and Donegal. Dr M <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> Culloch says it visits some of the lochs of the
                    Western Islands, but is not considered very abundant. On the Cornish coast this
                    fish in some seasons occurs as early as the month of March, and appears to be
                    pursuing a course from west to east. They are plentiful on the Devonshire coast,
                    and swarm in West Bay about June. On the Hampshire and Sussex coast,
                    particularly the latter, they arrive as early as March; and sometimes, as will
                    be shown, even in February: and the earlier in the year the fishermen go to look
                    for them, the farther from the shore do they seek for and find them. Duhamel
                    says the mackerel are caught earlier at Dunkirk than at Dieppe or Havre: ∙ upon
                    our own eastern coast, however, the fishing is later. The fishermen of
                    Lowestoffe and Yarmouth gain their great harvest from the mackerel in May and
                    June. Mr Neill says they occur in the Forth at the end of summer; and Mr Low, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Fauna Orcadensis,</hi> states that they do not make their
                    appearance there till the last week in July or the first week in August.</p>
                <p part="N">“The mackerel spawns in June; and, according to Bloch, five hundred and
                    forty thousand ova have been counted in one female. I have observed, by the
                    mackerel sent to the London market from the shallow shores of Worthing and its
                    vieinity, that these fish mature and deposit their roe earlier on that flat
                    sandy shore than those caught in the deep water off Brighton. The young
                    mackerel, which are called shiners, are from four to six inches long by the end
                    of August. They are half grown by November; when they retire, says Mr Conch, ‘
                    to deep water, and are seen no more that winter: but the adult fishes never
                    wholly quit the Cornish coast; and it is common to see some taken with lines in
                    every month of the year.’ Their principal food is probably the fry of other
                    fish; and at Hastings the mackerel follow towards the shore a small species of
                        <hi rend="italic">Clupea,</hi> which is there called, in consequence, the
                    mackerel mint. I have been unable hitherto to obtain any specimens of this small
                    fish; but, from various descriptions, I think it is probably the young of the
                    sprat. It is described as being about one inch long in July.</p>
                <p part="N">“The mackerel as feeders are voracious, and their growth is rapid. The
                    ordinary length varies from fourteen to sixteen inches, and their weight is
                    about two pounds each; but they are said to attain the length of twenty inches,
                    with a proportionate increase in weight. The largest fish are not, however,
                    considered the best for the table.</p>
                <p part="N">“As an article of food they are in great request; and those taken in the
                    months of May and June are generally considered to be superior in flavour to
                    those taken cither earlier in spring, or in autumn. To be eaten in perfection,
                    this fish should be very fresh. As it soon becomes unfit for food, some
                    facilities in the way of sale have been afforded to the dealers in a commodity
                    so perishable. Mackerel were first allowed to be cried through the streets of
                    London on a Sunday in 1698, and the practice prevails to the present time.</p>
                <p part="N">“At our various fishing towns on the coast, the mackerel season is one
                    of great bustle and activity. The frequent departures and arrivals of boats at
                    this time form a lively contrast to the more ordinary routine of other periods;
                    the high price obtained for the early cargoes, and the large return gained
                    generally from the enormous numbers of this fish sometimes captured in a single
                    night, being the inducement to great exertions. A few particulars from various
                    sources may not be uninteresting.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> In May 1807, the first Brighton
                    boat-load of mackerel sold at Billingsgate for forty guineas per hundred—seven
                    shillings each, reckoning six score to a hundred; the highest price ever known
                    at that market. The next boat-load produced but thirteen guineas per hundred.
                    Mackerel were so plentiful at Dover in 1808 that they were sold sixty for a
                    shilling. At Brighton, in June of the same year, the shoal of mackerel was so
                    great, that one of the boats had the meshes of her nets so completely occupied
                    by them, that it was impossible to drag them in; the fish and nets, therefore,
                    in the end, sunk together, the fishermen thereby sustaining a loss of nearly
                    sixty pounds, exclusive of what the cargo, could it have been got into the boat,
                    would have produced. The success of the fishery in 1821 was beyond all
                    precedent. The value of the catch of sixteen boats from Lowestoffe, on the 30th
                    of June, amounted to L.5252; and it is supposed that there was no less an amount
                    than L. 14,000 altogether realised by the <pb break="no"

                    crew from Hastings cleared L.100 by the fish caught in one night; and a large
                    quantity of very fine mackerel appeared in the London market in the second week
                    of the same month. They were cried through the streets of London three for a
                    shilling on the 14th and 22d of March 1834, and had then been plentiful for a
                    month. The boats engaged in fishing are usually attended by other fast-sailing
                    vessels, which are sent away with the fish taken. From some situations these
                    vessels sail away direct for the London market; at others they make for the
                    nearest point from which they can obtain land-carriage for their fish. From
                    Hastings and other fishing towns on the Sussex coast the fish are brought to
                    London by vans, which travel up during the night.</p>
                <p part="N">“The most common mode of fishing for mackerel, and the way in which the
                    greatest numbers are taken, is by drift-nets. The drift-net is twenty fect deep,
                    by onc hundred and twenty feet long; well corked at the top, but without lead at
                    the bottom. They are made of small fine twine, which is tanned of a
                    reddish-brown colour, to preserve it from the action of the sea-water; and it is
                    thereby rendered much more durable. The size of the mesh is about two and a half
                    inches, or rather larger. Twelve, fifteen, and sometimes eighteen of these nets
                    are attached lengthways, by tying along a thick rope, called the driftrope, and
                    at the ends of each net, to each other. When arranged for depositing in the sea,
                    a large buoy attached to the end of the drift-rope is thrown overboard, the
                    vessel is put before the wind, and, as she sails along, the rope, with the nets
                    thus attached, is passed over the stern into the water till the whole of the
                    nets are run out. The net thus deposited hangs suspended in the water
                    perpendicularly twenty feet deep from the drift-ropc, and extending from three
                    quarters of a mile to a mile, or even a mile and a half, depending on the number
                    of nets belonging to the party or company engaged in fishing together. When the
                    whole of the nets are thus handed out, the drift-rope is shifted from the stern
                    to the bow of the vessel, and she rides by it as if at anchor. The benefit
                    gained by the boat’s hanging at the end of the drift-rope is, that the net is
                    kept strained in a straight line, which, without this pull upon it, would not be
                    the case. The nets arc shot in the evening, and sometimes hauled once during the
                    night, at others allowed to remain in the water all night. The fish roving in
                    the dark through the water, hang in the meshes of the net, which are large
                    enough to admit them beyond the gill-covers and pectoral fins, but not large
                    enough to allow the thickest part of the body to pass through. In the morning
                    early, preparations are made for hauling the nets. A capstan on the deck is
                    manned, about which two turns of the drift-rope are taken. One man stands
                    forward to untie the upper edge of each net from the drift-rope, which is called
                    casting off the lashings; others hand in the net with the fish caught, to which
                    one side of the vessel is devoted; the other side is occupied by the drift-rope,
                    which is wound in by the men at the capstan. The whole of the net in, and the
                    fish secured, the vessel runs back into harbour with her fish; or, depositing
                    them on board some other boat in company, that carries for the party to the
                    nearest market, the fishing vessel remains at sea for the next night’s
                        operation.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"

                <p part="N">Another mode of fishing is with a hook and line, angled with a coarse
                    rod, from a boat under rapid sail. A slice from the mackerel’s own body affords
                    an excellent bait, and even a piece of scarlet cloth or leather is often used
                    with great success. The line is weighed down by a heavy plummet; and when the
                    fish are numerous, two men will thus capture from 500 to 1000 in a single day.
                    It is a singular fact, that the common mackerel has no swimming bladder,
                    although that organ is found in several closely allied species. What necessity
                    of nature, Cuvier asks, can require it in the one, and not in the other? What
                    can have produced it? These are great problems, both in the study of final
                    causes, and in the general philosophy of nature.</p>

                    fishery of the tunny dates from the most remote antiquity; and the city of
                    Byzantium was more especially enriched by it. The shoals which entered the
                    Bosphorus were said to meet near Chalcedon with a white rock, which so terrified
                    them that they turned into the Gulf of Byzantium, now the port of
                    Constantinople. It was, according to Cuvier, in consequence of this abundance of
                    tunnies, that the gulf in question received the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Golden Horn</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the oracle of Apollo
                    designated Chalcedon as the <hi rend="italic">City of the Blind,</hi> because
                    its founders did not perceive the inferiority of its site in relation to these
                    valued fish. Gibbon, however, tells us, that “the curve which it describes might
                    be compared to the horn of a stag, or, as it should seem, with more propriety,
                    to that of an ox. The epithet <hi rend="italic">golden</hi> was expressive of
                    the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant countries into the
                    secure and capacious port of Constantinople.” The same prodigious quantities of
                    the tunny are still seen there as in ancient times. According to Syllius, twenty
                    vessels might be filled by a single cast of the net; and they may frequently be
                    taken by the hand without the aid of nets. When ascending towards the port, they
                    may be killed with stones; and even women take them in quantities, merely by
                    suspending a large basket by a cord from the windows.<note anchored="true"

                    beyond the columns of Hercules. It is thus that we find the tunny on the

                    in the beautiful Gairloch, opposite Greenock, in July 1831. It is preserved in

                    pursuit of the flying fish. The bonito of the Mediterranean, however, be it

                    close-set kind of teeth. The species inhabit the warmer parts both of the

                    half an inch. The weight, without the intestines, was about six pounds.

                <p part="N">Another group of Scomberidae, or rather a branch of the first great
                    tribe, contains the sword-fish, and a few other species, which modern
                    Ichthyologists, anterior to the time of Cuvier, placed too much apart from each
                    other, solely because some were possessed of ventral fins, while in others those
                    parts were wanting, “difference,” observes our author, “qui ne sert qu’à prouver
                    de plus en plus le peu d’importance de ces nageoires pour un méthode

                    still less appreciated, although very obvious in the form of the tail, the

                    parasitical animals by which they are infested; but as they differ in wanting
                    the false fins, ah actual resemblances have been set aside, at least in regard
                    to such as are destitute of ventral fins.</p>

                    Pertains to the family Scomberidae, and approaches the tunnies especially in the
                    extreme smallness of the scales, the carination of the sides of the tail, the
                    strength of the caudal fin, and the whole of the interior organization. The
                    distinctive character consists in the lengthened beak or sword-like prolongation
                    of the muzzle or upper jaw, which forms a powerful weapon of offence, and
                    enables them to attack and overcome the largest marine animals. This beak is
                    composed chiefly of the vomer and intermaxillaries, strengthened towards the
                    base by the ethmoid, the frontals, and maxillaries. The branchiae are not
                    divided like the toothing of a comb, but formed each of two large parallel
                    plates, of which the surface is reticulated. The rapidity of their course is
                    excessive, the quality of their flesh excellent.</p>

                        >Xiphias,</hi> all indicate the formidable weapon with which the front is
                    armed. So remarkable a creature in size and structure could indeed have scarcely
                    remained unknown at any period. All ancient writers within whose province it
                    could possibly fall, speak of it in such a manner as clearly to prove an
                    intimate knowledge of its nature. They describe its offensive weapon, the blows
                    which it inflicts, the dreadful combats which it sustains, the attacks which are
                    made upon it, and the stratagems by which, in spite of its strength, it is lured
                    to its destruction. Although, in relation to its European distribution, the
                    Mediterranean may be said to be its chief dominion, yet the older individuals
                    especially often enter the ocean, and astonish the natives of colder climes by
                    spreading along the northern shores. It has been frequently captured on the
                    British coasts. It even enters the Baltic, and has been seen near Lubeck, of an

                            sword-fish on one side, and an enormous whale on the other. It was in
                            the middle of summer, and the weather being clear, and the fish close to
                            the vessel, we had a fine opportunity of witnessing the contest-As soon
                            as the. whale’s back appeared above the water, the thrashers, springing
                            several yards into the air, descended with great violence upon the
                            object of their rancour, and inflicted upon him the most severe slaps
                            with their long tails, the sound of which resembled the reports oí
                            muskets fired at a distance. The sword-fish, in their turn, attacked the
                            distressed whale, stabbing from below; and thus beset on all sides, and
                            wounded, when the poor creature appeared, the water around him was dyed
                            with blood. In this manner they continued tormenting and wounding him
                            for many hours, until we lost sight of him; aud I have no doubt they in

                    American species, although it is named as such by Catesby. It is not noticed by
                    Dr Mitchell, in his description of the fishes of New York, and for this reason
                    Baron Cuvier does not admit that it crosses the Atlantic. It is, however, fully
                    described by Dr Smith, in his <hi rend="italic">Fishes of Massachusetts</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> and the same writer assures us, on the authority of an
                    old pilot, that the swordfish is by no means uncommon off that portion of the
                    American shore. It cannot, however, be traced far south in any part of the
                    western world; whilst, like many of the Mediterranean species, it advances along
                    the African coast as far as the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
                <p part="N">The fish now alluded to is the <hi rend="italic">Xiphias</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">gladius,</hi> Linn. (Plate CCCH. fig. 7.) Its horizontal snout
                    is flat and cutting, like the blade of a sword. The sides of its tail are
                    strongly carinated∙ It has but one dorsal fin, which rises both before and
                    behind, but of which the middle portion in the adults becomes in some manner so
                    worn away, that an appearance is at last presented of two dorsal fins. This will
                    be perfectly understood by comparing the figure last referred to, with fig. 10
                    of the same plate, where we have represented the young of the present

                            was probably this disparity of the dorsal fin in different individuals

                <p part="N">Sword-fish, though by no means uncommon, are seldom captured, owing to
                    their extreme vigilance. Captain Beechey informs us, that while in the Pacific
                    Ocean, near Easter Island, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> as the line was
                    hauling in, a large swordfish bit at the tin case which contained our
                    thermometer, but fortunately failed in carrying it off.” Their mode of capture
                    in the Mediterranean may be likened to whale fishing in miniature, and is said
                    to be a veryamusing and exciting sport. A watchman placed upon a mast, or
                    standing on the summit of a neighbouring rock, gives warning by signal when he
                    sees a fish approach. The fishermen then row towards it; and, being so skilful
                    as frequently to strike the fish from a great distance, they throw a harpoon
                    into it attached to a long line. An arduous struggle then commences, during
                    which the aggressors are sometimes pulled about by the fish for many hours
                    before they can get it into the boat.</p>
                <p part="N">We shall conclude Dy observing,’ that the sword-fish is not only one of
                    the largest species of the European seas, attaining sometimes to a length of
                    fifteen feet, but that it is also much esteemed as an article of diet. When
                    young, especially, the flesh is white, firm, and of excellent flavour.</p>

                    sometimes attains to so great a size as to have been compared to a small whale.
                    When swimming near the surface, its dorsal fin may be seen projecting, from the
                    distance of a league at sea. Many years ago a letter was addressed to Sir Joseph
                    Banks by the captain of an East Indiaman, containing an account of the
                    astonishing strength occasionally exerted by this species. The bottom of the
                    ship was pierced through by it in such a manner that the snout or sword was
                    buried almost toits base, and the animal itself was killed by the violence of
                    the blow. Accidents of a similar nature have also occurred with the common
                    sword-fish; and it is the opinion of naturalists that both species mistake our
                    wooden walls for the vast abdomen of some great cetaceous animal which they
                    desire to encounter and destroy.</p>

                    that, notwithstanding its minute size, it ought not to be regarded as the young

                    of keeping company with ships at sea, and frequently swimming beneath their
                    bows. It would seem, from early indications of a similar instinct, to be the <hi
                        rend="italic">Pompilius</hi> of the ancients, described as pointing out the
                    way to dubious or embarrassed sailors, and as announcing the vicinity of land by
                    its sudden disappearance. It was thus regarded as a sacred fish. The other story
                    of its serving as a guide to the shark does not appear to have been transmitted
                    to us from so remote a source. It is not mentioned even by the Ichthyologists of
                    the sixteenth century; and Cuvier regards as the first allusion to it, that of
                    Dutertre in his <hi rend="italic">Description of the Antilles,</hi> printed in
                    1667. Since that period it has been carefully repeated by all voyagers and
                    compilers; and Osbeck even makes it a subject of pious reflection on the
                    wonderful ways of Providence. We are told by a greater than Osbeck that “they
                    that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see
                    the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep but the fact in the present
                    instance seems reducible to this, that the pilot accompanies both ships and
                    sharks, sometimes swimming before, sometimes behind, for the sake of preying
                    upon whatever may be thrown over board in the one case, or left uneaten in the
                    other. It is true that the shark never attacks it; but it is also true that the
                    hawk does not attack the swallow; and in both instances the reason is the same;
                    the pilot being too nimble for the unwieldy shark in the water, just as the
                    feebler but more agile bird is too swift in its movements for <hi rend="italic"
                        >falco</hi> in the air. It is thus that the apparent alliance of these
                    dissimilar fishes may be explained even upon general principles, to say nothing
                    of Bose’s observation, who assures us that he has seen hundreds of pilot-fish,
                    that they always keep at a respectful distance from the shark, and swim about
                    swiftly in different directions, that they may more certainly avoid it. If any
                    food be thrown over board, the pilot stops to seize it, and abandons both the
                    shark and vessel. Geoffroy no doubt tells a story of two pilot-fish having been

                    the details, it is clear, that whatever advantage might eventually accrue to the
                    conductors, the probable result to the shark was a cruel death, and one is
                    consequently the more inclined to admire how the narrative itself should find

                            further illustration of the subject, we shall subjoin a short extract
                            from a recent publication, Dr Aleyen’s <hi rend="italic">Reise</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">urn die</hi><hi rend="italic">Erde.</hi> “The pilot
                            swims constantly in front of the shark; we ourselves have seen three
                            instances in which the shark was led by the pilot. When the sea-angel
                            neared the ship, the pilot swam close to the snout, or near one of the
                            breast fins of the animal; sometimes he darted rapidly forwards or
                            sidewards, as if looking for something, and constantly went back again
                            to the shark. When we threw overboard a piece of bacon fastened on a
                            great hook, the shark was about twenty paces from the ship. ΛVith the
                            quickness of lightning the pilot came up, smelt at the dainty, and
                            instantly swam back again to the shark, swimming many times round his
                            snout, and splashing, as if to give him exact information as to the
                            bacon. The shark now began to put himself in motion, the pilot showing
                            him the way, andin a moment he was fast upon the hook. Once we watched a
                            pilot for many days, who kept constantly swimming close before the keel
                            of the ship. The sailors say, as of a thing well known and familiar,
                            that such a fish so situated has lost his shark, and is seeking another.
                            Upon a later occasion, we observed two pilots in sedulous attendance on
                            a blue shark, which we caught in the Chinese Sea. It seems probable that
                            the pilot feeds on the shark’s excrements, keeps his company for that
                            purpose, and directs his operations solely from this selfish view.” On
                            this very singular subject we arc tempted to quote another anecdote,
                            which, notwithstanding what we have said in the text above, if correctly
                            observed and recorded, would certainly indicate something remarkable in
                            the association of these species. The account was furnished to the
                            editor of the English edition of the <hi rend="italic">Animal
                                Kingdom</hi> (vol. x. p. 636), by Colonel Hamilton Smith, an
                            accurate and accomplished naturalist. “Captain Richards, R. N., during
                            his last station in the Mediterranean, saw on a fine day a blue shark,
                            which followed the ship, attracted perhaps by a corpse which had been
                            committed to the waves. After some time a shark-hook, baited with pork,
                            was flung out. The shark, attended by four pilot-fish, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Scomber ductor,</hi> repeatedly approached the bait; and every time
                            that he did so, one of the pilots, preceding him, was distinctly seen
                            from the taftrail of the ship to run his snout against the side of the
                            shark’s head, to turn it away. After some farther play, the fish swam
                            off in the wake of the vessel, his dorsal fin being long distinctly
                            visible above the water. » hen he had gone, however, a considerable
                            distance, he suddenly turned round, darted after the vessel, and before
                            the pilot-fish could overtake him and interpose, snapped at the bait and
                            was taken. In hoisting him up, one of the pilots was observed to cling
                            to his side until he was half above water, when it fell off. All the
                            pilot fishes then swam about awhile, as if in search of their friend,
                            with every apparent mark of anxiety and distress, and afterwards darted
                            suddenly down into the depths of the sea. Colonel H. Smith has himself
                            witnessed, with intense curiosity, an event in all respects precisely
                            similar.”</p></note></p>
                <p part="N">The pilot-fish in question is chiefly a Mediterranean species, although
                    it also spreads into distant oceans, having been found by Daldorf under the
                    equator. A great extent of geographical distribution may indeed be expected in
                    reference to a species which is said to suffer itself to be led away immense
                    distances in its eager pursuit of ships. Dutertre records that he saw one which
                    followed his vessel for more than 500 leagues. Whether he kept his eye upon it
                    night and day during all that time, or in what other way he ascertained it to be
                    the same individual throughout so long a traverse, is what he does not state,
                    and we therefore cannot explain. “In the year 1831,” Mr Yarrell observes, “two
                    specimens of pilot-fish were caught on the opposite side of the British Channel,
                    and more than one instance has occurred of their following ships into Guernsey.
                    A few years since, a pair accompanied a ship from the Mediterranean into
                    Falmouth, and were both taken with a net. In January 1831, the Peru, Graham
                    master, put into Plymouth, on her voyage from Alexandria for London, after a
                    passage of eighty-two days. About two days after she left Alexandria, two
                    pilot-fish, <hi rend="italic">Gasterοsteus ductor,</hi> made their appearance
                    close alongside the vessel, were constantly seen near her during the homeward
                    voyage, and followed her into Plymouth. After she came to an anchor in Catwater,
                    their attachment appeared to have increased; they kept constant guard to the
                    vessel, and made themselves so familiar, that one of them was actually captured
                    by a gentleman in a boat alongside, but, by a strong effort, it escaped from his
                    grasp, and regained the water. After this the two fish separated; but they were
                    both taken the same evening, and, when dressed the next day, were found to be
                    excellent eating. In October 1833 nearly one hundred pilot-fish accompanied a
                    vessel from Sicily into Catwater, but they were not taken.”<note anchored="true"

                    widely distributed, from Syria to the isles of Sunda, the Moluccas, and China.
                    Their snouts are furnished with a delicate organ of touch, and it appears that
                    they employ it while searching in the mud for small worms, or other slender
                    substances on whieh they feed. They are generally regarded as <hi rend="italic"

                        rend="italic">N. Nasus</hi> is the sole species) is characteristic of the
                    most northern seas.</p>
                <p part="N">We next proceed to a group of the Scomberidae which forms the <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Third Great Tribe,</hi> distinguished by having <hi
                        rend="italic">the sides furnished with a cuirassed lateral line.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">In the tunnies, sword-fish, and other Scomberidae already discussed, a
                    projecting cartilaginous portion is observable, forming a kind of ridge or keel
                    on each side of the tail, at the extremity of the lateral line. In the genera of
                    the same family of which we have now to treat, this ridge is no longer a simple
                    prominence of the dermis, but is covered by scaly shields, themselves crested,
                    and overlapping each other. These shields, frequently ending in a point or hook,
                    are not always confined to the termination of the lateral line, but sometimes
                    spread over its entire length, and usually occupy a considerable portion. In
                    relation to this character, however, the tribe may be divided into two sections:
                    the first of which, comprising only the great genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Caranx,</hi> exhibits this kind of armour in its greatest strength and
                    extension; while the second (of which the genus <hi rend="italic">Vomer</hi> is
                    the type) shows its gradual reduction to small scales, not surpassing those of
                    the rest of the body.</p>

                    greater or less extent with scaly shields, raised into a keel, and pointed.</p>
                <p part="N">As an example, we here figure the <hi rend="italic">Caranx boops,</hi> a
                    beautiful fish from Amboyna, of a fine silvery hue, tinted towards the back with
                    brilliant steel blue, with green reflections. A pure line of orange extends from
                    the gills to the tail, but this ornamental character is said to disappear
                    speedily after death. The pectoral fins are likewise orange. It varies from a
                    few inches to a foot in length. See Plate CCCII. fig. 12. The genus is extremely
                    numerous, containing probably not fewer than seventy different kinds; but the
                    only other species we shall here notice is a fish called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >scad,</hi> or horse-mackerel <hi rend="italic">{Caranx trachurus,</hi>
                    Lacép. and Cuv.), which occasionally occurs in prodigious shoals along the
                    British shores. Ten thousand have been taken by a foot-sean in a single evening
                    in August. It likewise occurs in the Mediterranean, and in the vicinity of
                    Madeira.</p>

                <p part="N">The genera of this tribe, it will be perceived, are combined by means of
                    merely negative characters, and it may therefore be expected that they will
                    exhibit mutual relations of a less intimate kind than those of the preceding
                    tribes. They form in fact a group, as it were, by continuity,—one of those
                    series of which there are many in nature, and of which the agreement is not the
                    less evident and harmonious, although it may be difficult to point out a precise
                    character in common.</p>
                <p part="N">As we have little to say of general interest regarding their history or

                    principal portion of our allotted space for the elucidation of those species
                    concerning which some important or amusing information has been recorded,· We
                    shall therefore do little more than name the genera of our present tribe.</p>

                    and dwells in deep and inaccessible places of the sea, rarely approaching the
                    shores, unless when compelled to do so by hunger. Its flesh is of a reddish
                    colour, firm, and of an exquisite flavour.</p>
                <p part="N">The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Temnodon</hi> greatly resembles the

                        >ship-jack</hi> by the Americans. Its geographical distribution is extremely

                        >Cuv.</hi> was for a long time combined with the Gobies. It is related in
                    several particulars to <hi rend="italic">Seriola,</hi> but the very large broad
                    ventrals, attached to the body by their inner edge, produce a peculiar character
                    and aspect. We here figure a small species, of which the ground colour is like
                    brilliant silver. The ventrals are traversed by two black bands. It was

                <p part="N">The species are still in some measure indistinctly characterized. They
                    occur in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea, and are
                    remarkable, among other things, for their keen pursuit of flying fish, which, in
                    the first place, they force to leave their native element, and then following
                    swiftly in a corresponding track, receive with open mouth the moment they
                    descend exhausted to the surface. The Coryphaenae may be regarded as among the
                    most brilliant inhabitants'of the sea. It is necessary, according to Bose, to
                    have seen them following a vessel in troops, before we can form a proper
                    estimate of their beauty. When they swim embodied near the surface, and beneath
                    the light of a cloudless sky, they seem effulgent with the richest gold,
                    combined with the sparkling lustre of the topaz, the emerald, and the
                    sapphire,—and every brilliant hue in perpetual change, accordant with the
                    vivacity and varied grace of their movements. It is indeed a spectacle
                    sufficient anywhere to excite our unfeigned admiration; and when seen suddenly
                    amid the waves of the lonely and monotonous ocean, it comes upon us like a glad
                    surprise. The beauty of these fishes has in every age attracted the wonder</p>
                <p part="N">Of all who on the wide deep wandering are; and it is so far to be
                    regretted, that their fugitive colours have been the chief object of
                    attention,—their more precise description and specific discrimination having
                    been greatly disregarded.</p>
                <p part="N">The Coryphaenae are strong, active, and voracious fishes. While swimming
                    rapidly, they seem rather as if impelled or projected forwards by some exterior
                    force, than by any exertion of their own. But, on attentive examination, a
                    strong and rapid muscular movement may be detected, by the constant undulation
                    of the long dorsal fin, a movement which greatly contributes to the throwing off
                    of those lustrous metallic reflections for which they have so long been noted.

                    sometimes attains to the length of five feet. Its colours, so far as they are
                    capable of description, are silvery blue above, with markings of a deeper azure,
                    and reflections of pure gold—the lower parts citron yellow, marked with pale
                    blue. The pectoral fins are partly lead colour, partly yellow; the ventrals are
                    yellow on their under surface, and black above; the anal fin is yellow. The iris
                    of the eye is made of apparent gold.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    which appears to have been first misapplied to the Coryphaenae by the Dutch. It
                    is scarcely necessary to observe, that the English word Dolphin, as synonymous
                    with the Greek ∆sλp∕g, the Latin Delphinus, and the French Dauphin, was
                    originally, and is still correctly, applied only to designate a group of
                    cetaceous animals (allied in structure to the whales), to which the classical
                    dolphin of antiquity assuredly belonged. But by some conversion, into the
                    history of which it is not worth while to inquire, the term has been applied by
                    most modern writers, particularly poets, to a creature of another class, a

                    can be imputed to the naturalist, if the general misapplication of the term is

                    it in the air; but in that case the fish must fly, as a flounder swims, upon its
                    side. The species are unfortunately so rare, that it may be long before an

                            following: St Christopher, while wading through an arm of the sea, and
                            bearing the infant Saviour, is said to have caught a dory, and to have
                            impressed its sides with the two peculiar marks, as a perpetual record
                            of the fact. The name was therefore said to be from the French <hi

                            sacred. The designation of <hi rend="italic">John</hi> Doιy is in all

                    that it was from the mouth of this species that the apostle extracted the
                    tribute-money, and the black spot on either side of its body is supposed to be a
                    record of its capture at that time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            tradition.</p></note> The dory is a fish greatly esteemed for the table.
                    It occurs both in the Mediterranean Sea, and along the oceanic coasts of Europe.
                    According to Pennant, the largest are found in the Bay of Biscay. Willughby
                    alludes to it as common in his day on the shores of Cornwall; and it is still
                    taken both there and along the Devonshire coast, occasionally even in profusion.
                    Mr Couch, as quoted by Mr Yarrell, considers the dory rather as a wandering than
                    a migratory fish, and as regulated in a great measure by the movements of the
                    smaller kinds on which it preys. When the pilchards approach the shore, it is
                    frequently taken in considerable numbers. In the autumn of 1829, more than sixty
                    were hauled on shore at once in a net, some of them of large size, and yet the
                    whole were sold together for nine shillings. The largest specimens of the London
                    market weigh from ten to twelve pounds, but the average weight is scarcely more
                    than five. The dory is a bold, voracious species, pr <hi rend="subscript">

                    all sorts of bait. Its flesh was highly esteemed in the time of Pliny.
                    Columella, who was a native of Cadiz (where it was regarded as the best of
                    fishes), has recorded that it had been long known by the name of <hi

                <p part="N">By this term Baron Cuvier means to designate the peculiar structure of a
                    part of the upper pharyngeal bones, which are divided into leaflets more or less
                    numerous and irregular. This formation produces cells capable of containing
                    water, which flows upon and moistens the branchiae for some time after the fish
                    itself has been removed from its natural element; and this refreshing influence
                    is rendered the more effectual by the closeness of the opercula or gill-covers.
                    The consequence is, that most of the species possess the power of quitting their
                    streams and pools, and creeping, as it were, to some little distance from their
                    watery homes,—a faculty not unknown to ancient writers, and one which in India
                    has led to the belief that these fishes fall from heaven.</p>

                    and there are others beneath the back of the cranium. The body is round, covered

                    the lateral line interrupted about its posterior third. The margins of the
                    opercle, sub-opercle, and inter-opercle, are strongly toothed, but not those of
                    the pre-opercle. The branchial membrane has five rays. There are many spiny rays
                    to the dorsal, and even to the anal fin. The stomach is of medium size, rounded.
                    The pylorus has only three appendices.</p>

                    At the same time other respectable observers who have attended to this species
                    in its natural state, make no mention of the fact. Μ. Reinwardt has frequently
                    taken the Anabas at Java, but never heard any climbing propensities attributed
                    to it; Μ. Leschenault, who transmitted several specimens to Pondicherry, simply
                    observes that they dwell in rivers and fresh-water ponds; while Mr Hamilton
                    Buchanan proceeds still further, and not only denies the fact, but regards it as
                    contrary to the laws of nature. One point, however, is certain, that it is
                    capable of living an unusual length of time out of the water, a fact in perfect
                    accordance with the peculiar structure of its pharyngeals. It also creeps about
                    upon the ground for hours together, and the fishermen are alleged to keep it
                    alive for five or six days in a dry vessel. It is thus brought alive to the
                    markets of Calcutta from the great marshes of the district of Yazor, which are
                    distant more than a hundred and fifty miles. “Les charlatans et jongleurs,” says
                    Cuvier, “dont l’Inde abonde, ont généralement de ces poissons avec eux dans des

                    recorded in his manuscript that he never tasted so exquisite a fish,—“Nihil

                    colonies in South America by Captain Philibert. Its importation to Europe would
                    be well worth attempting, and would probably be attended by success if the

                    acanthopterygian fishes, is the absence of spines to the fins, except the single
                    one to the ventrals, which itself, though simple, is neither stiff nor pointed.
                    The body is elongated, and almost cylindriçal; the muzzle short and obtuse; the
                    head depressed, and furnished with polygonal scales, or rather plates, as in <hi
                        rend="italic">Anabas.</hi> It may be said, however, that it is by means of
                    the solitary ventral spines alone that they exhibit the normal character of the
                    great division of acanthopterygian fishes with which we have been hitherto
                    engaged. They thus, by such ambiguous combination of character, almost break up
                    the grand distinction of acanthopterygian and malacopterygian species, a
                    distinction otherwise so well grounded as to have hitherto produced no
                    disruption of the relations of natural affinity. “If it were possible,” says
                    Cuvier, “to admit that anomalous beings existed in nature, there is certainly
                    none to which the title is so justly due as to the Ophicephali.” Their watery
                    reservoirs enable them to journey from one marsh to another, and they are
                    moreover so tenacious of life that their bowels may be torn out, and themselves
                    cut to pieces, without producing immediate death. They are often thus carried
                    about alive, or sold in the markets slice by slice; and the consumers refuse to
                    give the best price when so much has been cut away that the remainder ceases to
                    move. This seems a parallel case to that of the beef-steaks from the oxen of
                    Abyssinia. Wc here figure as an example of this singular genus the <hi
                        rend="italic">Ophicephalus</hi><hi rend="italic">striatus,</hi> a species
                    which seems spread over the whole of India. See Plate CCCIH. fig. 12. Buchanan
                    describes another species under the name of <hi rend="italic">Gachua
                        (Oph.</hi><hi rend="italic">marginatus,</hi> Cuv. ?), which sometimes grows
                    to a foot in length. It is very common in the ponds and fosses of Bengal, and is
                    one of the species most generally believed to fall from the clouds in wet
                    weather. During the first heavy showers of the rainy season, they are certainly
                    seen crawling on the grass; but their object in so doing is doubtless to escape
                    from the corrupted water of the narrow dykes which they had previously
                    inhabited, and to go in search of a purer element, and a fresher and more ample
                    food. The species called <hi rend="italic">Earca</hi> by Buchanan lives in holes
                    in the vertical banks of the Brahmapootra, with nothing visible but its head,
                    that it may the more readily observe and seize its prey. It is a large fish,
                    measuring three feet in length, and is regarded as good eating. On the whole,
                    however, the species of this genus are consumed rather by natives than
                    Europeans,—the latter probably regarding them too much in the light of reptiles.
                    We may add, that the <hi rend="italic">Ophicephali</hi> are often exhibited by
                    the Indian jugglers, and that even the children amuse themselves by íorcing them
                    to crawl upon the ground.</p>
                <p part="N">FAMILY XI.—MUGILIDAE.</p>
                <p part="N">The fishes which compose our present group (corresponding to the genus
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mugil</hi> of Linn.) exhibit so many peculiarities of
                    organization, that Cuvier has deemed it advisable to form them into a distinct
                    family. The body is almost cylindrical, covered with large scales, and furnished
                    with two distinct dorsal fins, the first of which has only four spiny rays. The
                    ventrals are attached somewhat behind the pectorals. The gills have six rays.
                    The head is rather depressed, also covered with large scales or polygonal
                    plates. The muzzle is very short. The transverse mouth forms an angle by means
                    of a prominence of the middle of the lower jaw, corresponding to a depression of
                    the upper one; and the teeth are excessively fine, indeed m some cases
                    imperceptible. The pharyngeal bones, greatly developed, give an angular form to
                    the oesophagus resembling that of the mouth, which permits only fluids or very
                    small substances to enter the stomach, notwithstanding which the latter
                    terminates in a kind of fleshy gizzard, analogous to that of birds. The pyloric
                    appendices are few in number, but the intestine is long and folded.</p>
                <p part="N">The species are excellent as articles of food. They resort in vast

                    described), is distinguished from all the other European species by its eyes,
                    which are half covered by two adipose veils adherent to the anterior and
                    posterior margin of the orbit, and by the peculiar concealment of the maxillary
                    bone, which, when the mouth is closed, is completely hidden beneath the
                    sub-orbital. The base of the pectoral fin is surmounted by a long carinated
                    scale. See Plate CCCHI. fig. 13. The species just referred to is the best and
                    largest of the Mediterranean kinds. It weighs about ten or twelve pounds, and
                    does not appear to have been yet detected in the seas or estuaries of Britain,
                    nor along the oceanic shores of France. It is very common on the coast of Spain,
                    especially around the island of Ivica, where the fishermen are said to recognise

                    advanced, that it can live on vegetable substances. It appears to be of a stupid
                    character, a fact which was known in the time of Pliny, for that author tells us
                    that there is something ludicrous in the disposition of the mullets; for if they
                    are afraid they con ceal their heads, and thus imagine they are entirely
                    withdrawn from the observation of their enemies.</p>

                    fishes of this species, excited by the necessity of living in the fresh water,
                    approach the shores and advance towards the mouths of the rivers, they form such
                    numerous troops that the water through which they are seen, without being
                    clearly distinguished, appears to be bluish. This particularly happens in the
                    Garonne and the Loire at these periods. The fishermen there adopt the plan of
                    surrounding these legions of mullets with nets, the enclosure of which they
                    gradually contract, taking care to make a noise to frighten the fish, and oblige
                    them to press together, and heap themselves as it were one upon the other.</p>
                <p part="N">“Of the mullets thus taken some are eaten fresh, others are salted and
                    smoke-dried; it is with their eggs salted, washed, pressed, and dried, that the

                    condiment greatly in request in Italy and the southern provinces of France. The
                    flesh of this mullet is tender, delicate, and of an agreeable flavour; it is
                    fatter and more in estimation when it is taken in the fresh water. The ancients,
                    who from the time of Aristotle were acquainted with this fish, had it in great
                    request; and the consumption of it is still very considerable in most of the
                    southern countries of Europe. According to the report of Athenaeus, those
                    mullets were formerly in very high esteem which were taken in the neighbourhood
                    of Sinope and Abdera; while, as Paulus Jovius informs us, those were very little

                    Scomberidae, while the second partakes of characters intermediate between the
                    Mugilidae in general, and the ensuing family of Gobioidae.</p>

                    but higher and short, with an anal of corresponding form; the ventrals are a
                    little behind the pectorals; the branches of the lower jaw are vertically
                    raised, and furnished with a range of pointed cutting teeth, forming as it were
                    a saw, and fitting, when the mouth is closed, into those of the upper jaw. The

                    several species had been confounded under that name; and Mr Yarrell has
                    ascertained that the British species, commonly called the Atherine, coincides in

                    visitors during the winter months. It partakes of the cucumber smell and flavour
                    of the true smelt, and is a small handsome fish, measuring from five to six
                    inches. It is rarely brought to the London market. It spawns in May and

                    and compressed, and they bear only a single dorsal, composed almost entirely of
                    simple and flexible rays. They live in small companies in rocky streams, and can
                    survive for a considerable time out of the water, in consequence of their skin
                    being covered with a kind of mucus, a circumstance which has caused the Greek

                    peculiarity which is chiefly observable among cartilaginous fishes, that,
                    namely, of producing its young alive. These are so matured at the time of their
                    birth, that on their first exclusion they swim about with the utmost agility. No
                    fewer than 200 or 300 young are sometimes produced by an individual, and the
                    abdomen of the mother is so distended before parturition, that it is impossible
                    to touch it without causing them to be extruded. Full-grown individuals seldom
                    exceed twelve inches in length; the body is slender and smooth; the colour
                    yellowish olive, pale beneath, and marked on the upper parts with dusky spots.
                    It is a littoral fish, and of frequent occurrence under stones. When boiled, the
                    back-bone acquires a green colour. America produces a much larger species, which
                    sometimes exceeds the length of three feet. It has been described under the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Blennius</hi><hi rend="italic">labrosus.</hi><hi

                    The dorsal fin, entirely composed of simple rays, but without stiffness, begins
                    at the nape, and extends, in common with the anal one, nearly to the caudal fin,
                    which is rounded like the pectorals. The whole body is smooth and covered with
                    mucus. Their palatines, vomer, and mandibles, arc armed with large osseous
                    tubercles, which are crowned with small enamelled teeth; but the anterior teeth
                    are longer and conical. Such a conformation of the teeth makes them very
                    powerful instruments, and these fishes, from their large size, are thereby
                    rendered ferocious and dangerous. They have six rays in the gills; the stomach
                    is short and fleshy, with the pylorus near its base; the intestine short, thick,
                    and without caeca; and the swimming bladder is wanting.</p>

                    sometimes occur nearly double that size. The colour is obscure livid brown, with
                    several transverse stripes or bands of a darker hue. The dorsal fin, as already
                    mentioned, extends along the whole length of the back, and is composed of
                    seventy-three rays. The fore teeth project considerably, and diverge a little
                    from each other, forming a powerful kind of armature, moved by jaws of such
                    strength that the animal has been known to imprint the marks of its teeth on a
                    bar of iron. The uninviting aspect of this fish has probably not .been without
                    influence in producing a prejudice against it as an article of food. Its flesh,
                    however, is far from being unsavoury, and bears considerable resemblance to that
                    of the eel. It is in great request among the Icelanders, who eat it dry and
                    salted; while the other parts of the fish are likewise converted to useful

                    having a clay bottom, and pass the winter in excavations which they make for

                    with Fuci, and cover it with the roots of the Zostera: the male remains there

                    so many distinctive characters, that it may not improperly be regarded as the
                    type of a new family group. The body is elongated, and garnished with ciliated
                    scales; the head small and unarmed; the mouth but slightly cleft, and furnished

                    Their intestines are without caecal appendages; they have often a tuft on the

                    soft rays, as is usual in the allied species. All the known kinds, amounting to
                    six or seven in number, are from the sea of Kamschatka, and were first described

                    semi-cartilaginous nature of the skeleton, and the want of scales on the skin,
                    has for its general character pectorals supported as if by two arms, each of
                    them sustained by two bones, which have been compared to the radius and cubitus,
                    but which in reality belong to the carpus, and arc more elongated in this genus
                    than in any other. The ventrals are placed greatly in advance of the pectorals,
                    and the opercles and rays of the branchiae are enveloped in the skin, while the
                    gills open only by a single hole, pierced behind the pectorals. The species are
                    voracious; they have a large stomach and a short intestine, and are able to live
                    for a very long period out of the water, on account of the small opening of
                    their gills. The kinds now included in this genus, in the restricted sense
                    attached to it by Cuvier, have the head excessively large in proportion to the
                    rest of the body, and at the same time broad and depressed, and spiny in many
                    places; the opening of the mouth very wide, and armed with pointed teeth; and
                    the lower jaw furnished with numerous barbels. There are two distinct dorsals,
                    of which the anterior possesses some detached rays, moveable over the head,
                    where they rest on a horizontal inter-spinal; the branchial membrane forming a
                    very large sac opening in the axilla, and supported by six very long rays; the
                    operculum small. It is asserted that they lie among the mud, and by putting in
                    motion the rays of their head, attract small fishes, which, mistaking the broad
                    and fleshy extremities of these rays for worms, thus become the prey of the
                    Lophii. It is also said that they can seize and retain their prey by means of
                    their large branchial sacs. Their intestine has two very short caeca towards its

                    times united into a single fin. Their body and head are compressed, and the

                    the back. The whole body is sometimes garnished with cutaneous appendages. The
                    branchiae are four in number; the swimming bladder is large, and the intestine
                    of moderate size and without caeca. By filling their enormous stomach with air,
                    after the manner of the Tetrodons, they can inflate their abdomen like a
                    balloon. When on land, their fins assist them in creeping, which they do almost
                    after the manner of small quadrupeds, the pectorals, from their position,
                    performing the office of hinder legs. Moving about in this manner, they can live

                    which is immediately connected with the jaws, and the other with the
                    sub-orbitals; the gills are serrated, and have five rays; the maxillary teeth
                    conic, the middle and anterior ones being longest; the pharyngeal teeth

                    their inter-maxillary and pre-mandibularybones), which are convex, rounded, and
                    garnished with teeth like scales upon their edges and anterior surface; these
                    teeth succeed each other from behind forwards, so that those of the base are the
                    newest, and in time come to form a range upon the cutting edge. Naturalists have
                    erroneously thought that the jaw-bones themselves were naked or exposed. These
                    jaws are, besides, covered while the fish is alive by fleshy lips, but there is
                    no double lip adherent to the sub-orbitaries. The species have the oblong form
                    of Labrus, with large scales, and the lateral line interrupted; they bear on
                    their pharynx two plates above and one below, garnished with teeth like the
                    pharyngeal plates of the Labri, but these teeth are in the form of transverse

                    bladder is of considerable size. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Centriscus</hi><hi

                    small scales, and have several broad and denticulated plates on the apparatus

                    long, and of a silvery lustre. (See Plate CCC1V. fig. 7.) It occurs occasionally
                    on the south-western coasts of England. In the sub-genus <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p part="N">These are distinguished by having their ventrals suspended to the under
                    part of the abdomen, and behind the pectorals, without any attachment to the
                    shoulder bone. This is the most numerous of the three orders, and includes a
                    large proportion of the fresh-water fishes. It is divisible into five
                    families.</p>
                <p part="N">FAMILY I—CYPRINIDAE.</p>
                <p part="N">May be known by having the mouth but slightly cleft, the jaws weak and
                    generally without teeth, and their edge formed by the inter-maxillaries; by
                    pharyngeals strongly toothed, thus compensating for the imperfect armature of
                    the jaws; and by the branchial rays being few in number. Their body is scaly,
                    and there is no adipose dorsal, such as is observed in Siluri and salmon. Their
                    stomach has no cul-de-sac, and the pylorus is without caecal appendages. They
                    are the least carnivorous of fishes.</p>
                <p part="N">The typical genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyprinus</hi> is a very natural
                    one, and comprehends a great number of species, which are readily distinguished
                    by the small mouth, toothless jaws, and the three flat branchial rays. Their
                    tongue is smooth, and the palate provided with a soft and singularly irritable
                    substance, vulgarly knoιvn by the name of <hi rend="italic">Carps tongue.</hi>
                    The pharynx presents a powerful instrument for mastication, consisting of large
                    teeth attached to the inferior pharyngeal bones, and capable of pressing the
                    food between them, and a stony disk enclosed in a wide cavity under an apophysis
                    of the basilary bone. These fishes have only one dorsal, and the body is covered
                    with scales, most frequently of large size. They inhabit fresh waters, and are
                    perhaps the least carnivorous of their class, subsisting chiefly on grains,
                    grass, and even on mud. Their stomach is continuous, with a short intestine
                    without caeca, and the bladder is divided into two by a constriction.</p>

                    for the second ray. Of these, some have barbels at the angles of the upper jaw,
                    and others are destitute of these appendages. Of the former we may cite as an
                    example the common carp; and the goldfish of China affords an instance of the
                    latter.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">carpio,</hi> the common
                    carp. This well-known fish is of an olive-green, yellowish beneath, having the
                    anal and dorsal spines strong and denticulated, and the barbels short; the
                    pharyngeal teeth are flat and striated on the crown. It is a native of the
                    central countries of Europe; but, owing to its value as an article of food, it
                    was early distributed by human agency over the whole of that Continent. The ease
                    with which it can be transported from one place to another, and its speedy
                    growth and propagation in ponds and artificial reservoirs, afforded great
                    facilities for its rapid dispersion. The year 1614 is assigned as the date of
                    its first introduction into England; but it was naturalized in Germany and
                    Sweden nearly half a century before that period. It delights in tranquil waters,
                    preferring such as have a muddy bottom, and the surface partially shaded with
                    plants. Its food consists of the larvae of aquatic insects, minute Testacea,
                    λvorms, and the tender blades and shoots of plants. The leaves of lettuce, and
                    other succulent plants of a similar kind, are said to be particularly agreeable
                    to them, and to fatten them sooner than any other food. Although the carp eats
                    with great voracity when its supply of aliment is abundant,—to such a degree,
                    indeed, as sometimes to produce indigestion, which occasionally proves fatal,—it
                    can subsist for an astonishing length of time without nourishment. In the
                    winter, when they assemble in great numbers, and bury themselves among the mud
                    and the roots of plants, they often remain for many months without eating. They
                    can also be preserved alive for a considerable length of time out of the water,
                    especially if care be taken to moisten them occasionally as they become dry.
                    Advantage is often taken of this circumstance to transport them alive, by
                    packing them among damp herbage, or wet linen; and the operation is said to be
                    unattended with any risk to the animal, especially if the precaution be taken to
                    put a piece of bread in its mouth <hi rend="italic">steeped in brandy!</hi> In a
                    similar way, the Dutch preserve them by suspending them from the roof of a damp
                    apartment in a bag-net filled with moss, which is continually kept moist, <pb

                    and they are fed with vegetables and bread steeped in milk,—a mode of treatment
                    by which they are not only kept alive, but actually thrive and fatten.</p>
                <p part="N">The fecundity of these fishes is very great, and their numbers
                    consequently would soon become excessive, but for the many enemies by which
                    their spawn is destroyed. No fewer than 700,000 eggs have been found in the
                    ovaria of a single carp, and that too by no means an individual of the largest
                    size. Their growth is very rapid, more so perhaps than that of any other
                    fresh-water fish, and the size which they sometimes attain is very considerable.
                    In certain lakes in Germany and Prussia, individuals are occasionally taken
                    weighing thirty or forty pounds; and Pallas relates that they occur in the Volga
                    five feet in leagth, and even of greater weight than the examples just alluded
                    to. The largest of which we have any account is that mentioned by Bloch, taken
                    near Frankfort-on-the-Oder, which weighed seventy pounds, and measured nearly
                    nine feet in length.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Cyprinus auratus</hi> (gold fish). This beautiful
                    species, the most brilliantly adorned of all our fresh-water fishes, and
                    scarcely surpassed even by the more richly ornamented inhabitants of the ocean,
                    is well known to be a native of China, although it is now domesticated, so to
                    speak, in almost every country, both of the old and new world. Like the carp, it
                    has the dorsal and anal spines denticulated. When young it is of a blackish
                    colour, and it gradually acquires the fine golden red by which it is
                    characterised; but some examples are of a silvery hue, and others are variegated
                    with three different shades of colour. Like most other animals that have been
                    long estranged from their natural habits, and subjected to artificial
                    influences, this species presents a great many varieties, extending even to some
                    important parts of structure. Individuals occur without a dorsal, others with a
                    very large one, others with the caudal greatly enlarged, and divided into three
                    or four lobes; and in some instances the eyes are enormously dilated.<note

                    confined to a lake near the mountain <hi rend="italic">Tsieηkmg,</hi> in the
                    province of <hi rend="italic">The-kiang,</hi> in China, about the 30th degree
                        <hi rend="italic">of</hi> N. lat. It was first brought to England in 1691,
                    but was very scarce till 1728, when a considerable number were imported, and
                    they soon became generally known. They do not flourish in rivers and open ponds,
                    not, however, because such places are uncongenial to them, but because they are
                    exposed to many enemies, against which they have no means of defence. When kept
                    in confinement they ought to be nourished with fine crumbs of bread, small
                    worms, flies, and yolks of eggs dried and powdered, and the water ought to be
                    frequently changed. The ordinary length of this species is from four to six
                    inches; but they have been sometimes known to reach a foot. Although natives of
                    a warm climate, they can sustain a great degree of cold uninjured. An
                    individual, which was accidentally exposed during the night, was completely
                    frozen up in the centre of its glass jar; but as the ice thawed it recovered its
                    vigour, and seemed to suffer no further inconvenience.</p>
                <p part="N">To this group belongs the smallest of the European Cyprini, viz. <hi
                        rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">amarus,</hi> which is about an inch
                    long, greenish above, and of a fine red beneath. During the time of spawning,
                    which takes place in April, it has a steel-blue line on each side of the tail;
                    the second dorsal ray forms a rather stiff spine.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Barbus</hi> of Cuvier, contains such species
                    as have the dorsal and anal short, with a strong spine for the second or third
                    ray of the dorsal, and four barbels, two of which are at the extremity, and two
                    at the angles of the upper jaw. As an example, we may refer to the <hi

                    may be known by its oblong head. It is very common in clear and running waters,
                    where it sometimes attains to a length exceeding ten feet. Several allied
                    species are found in Italy, having the spine weaker, but which, nevertheless,
                    differ from the following genus by possessing four barbels. Such are <hi

                    of Europe in small lakes and gently flowing rivers. It is of a pale olive-brown
                    colour, slightly spotted with black, especially on the fins, the sides and
                    abdomen being silvery white. It spawns in the spring, and as it deposits its ova
                    at distant intervals, the operation generally continues for a considerable time.
                    It is a very prolific fish; and as its flesh is of a very delicate flavour, it
                    is much sought after for the table.</p>

                    of a deep yellowish brown, sometimes, however, assuming a fine golden colour.
                    Its usual length is from twelve to fourteen inches; but instances are on record
                    of its having reached three feet. It inhabits stagnant waters with a muddy
                    bottom; and in the winter conceals itself among the mud, and seems to undergo a
                    kind of torpidity. In May and June it deposits its ova among aquatic plants;
                    these are very minute, of a green colour, and so numerous that 297,000 have been
                    reckoned in one female. The tench is very extensively distributed, appearing to
                    occur throughout the whole globe. Its flesh is not much esteemed, as it is soft,

                    fish in this subdivision; there are twenty-nine rays in the anal, and all the
                    fins are obscure. It is common in slow flowing rivers and lakes in most European
                    countries. It sometimes acquires two feet and a half in length, but its ordinary
                    dimensions may be stated to be about a foot. Worms, confervae, and aquatic
                    plants are its usual food; but, like many allied species, it often swallows mud,
                    which renders its flesh unsavoury. “There exists in the river Trent, in the
                    neighbourhood of Newark, two species or varieties of bream. The common bream,

                    this subdivision are considerable in amount, but they are held in little
                    estimation as articles of food. They are distinguished by the position of the
                    dorsal, a character, however, which is not always sufficiently defined. In some
                    it corresponds to the position of the ventrals; such is the case with <hi

                        >rutilus</hi> (the roach), has the body compressed and silvery, and all the

                    between the ventrals and the anal. This is exemplified in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Leuc.</hi><hi rend="italic">alburnus</hi> (the bleak), in which the body is
                    narrow, and of a brilliant silvery hue; the fins pale; the forehead straight,
                    and the inferior jaws somewhat elongated. It is common throughout Europe; and is
                    one of the fishes whose nacre (or silvery-looking substance) is employed in
                    fabricating artificial pearls. <hi rend="italic">Leuc. phoxiηus</hi> (common
                    minnow) likewise pertains to this group. The appearance of this beautiful little
                    fish is familiar to all. It is the smallest species of the genus found in
                    Europe, the greatest length which it attains seldom exceeding three inches. It
                    first makes its appearance in March, and disappears in October, passing the
                    winter beneath the mud. It is well known to be a gregarious species, and small
                    shoals are to be found in almost every shallow stream, especially in clear
                    weather, as they seem to delight in warmth and sunshine. They usually spawn in
                    the month of June, but their ova are often found at a much later period. The
                    flesh of the minnow is delicate and well flavoured, but its size is too small to
                    admit of its being of much value as an article of food. It is principally used
                    as a bait for the capture of larger kinds.</p>

                    rather strongly dentated, their intestines are without any caeca, and their
                    swimming bladder, which is very small, is enclosed in an osseous bilobate case,
                    attached to the third and fourth vertebrae. Three species are found in the fresh

                    a well-known fish in this country, as it occurs plentifully in almost every

                    does not occur in Britain, measures sometimes afoot m length. It dwells in the
                    mud of ponds, and is so tenacious of life as to live a long time after being
                    stiffly frozen, or even dried. In stormy weather it rises to the surface and
                    agitates the water. It swallows quantities of air, which it converts, according
                    to Μ. Ehrman’s observations, into carbonic acid. Its flesh is soft, and savours
                    of mud. The third species was introduced into the British Fauna by Berkenhout.

                    loaches, although they afford characters of a very distinctive kind. Their eyes,
                    which are very salient, and placed under an arch formed on each side by the

                    that bone, the maxillary is without teeth, and concealed in the thickness of the

                    but the maxillaries occupying the sides are without teeth. The vomer, the
                    palatines, the tongue, the pharyngeals, and the arches of the branchiae, are
                    covered with teeth resembling those of a card; and, in addition to these, a
                    series of long pointed teeth occupy the sides of the lower jaw. Tire snout is
                    oblong and obtuse, broad and depressed; and there is only one dorsal opposite
                    the anal. The stomach, which is large and plicate, is continuous with a slender
                    doubly-folded intestine without caeca. The swimming bladder is very large. There
                    is only one European species, viz. <hi rend="italic">Esox lucius,</hi> Linn,
                    (the common pike), Plate CCCIV. fig. 9. During the earliest stage of its life it
                    is of a greenish hue, but in the second year it becomes gray with pale spots,
                    the latter ultimately acquiring a yellowish colour. Its markings, however, are
                    very variable, and instances have occurred of its being perfectly white. It is
                    one of the largest of fresh-water fishes, and indeed, if the accounts which some
                    writers give are not exaggerated, it occasionally attains a size not greatly
                    inferior to the gigantic inhabitants of the ocean. Individuals are recorded as
                    measuring from five to nine feet in length. They frequently weigh above thirty
                    pounds in the lakes of the north of England; and Dr Grierson mentions one taken
                    in Loch Ken, in Galloway, which weighed sixty-one pounds. Bloch indeed examined
                    a portion of the skeleton of another which could not be less than eight feet in
                    length. The most remarkable pike, however, of which we have any authentic
                    account, is that caught at Kaiserslautern, near Manheim, in 1497, which was
                    nearly nineteen feet in length, and weighed 350 pounds. The skeleton of this
                    extraordinary specimen was for a long time preserved, and bore a brass ring with
                    an inscription to the effect that the fish was put into a pond by the hands of
                    the Emperor Frederick II., the 5th of October 1262. From this it is inferred
                    that it was upwards of 235 years old. Pikes are proverbially voracious. There
                    seems indeed to be no bounds to their gluttony, for they devour indiscriminately
                    whatever edible substances they fall in with, and almost every animal they are
                    able to subdue. “It is,” says Μ. de Lacépèđe, “the shark of the fresh waters; it
                    reigns there a devastating tyrant, like the shark in the midst of the ocean;
                    insatiable in its appetites, it ravages with fearful rapidity the streams, the
                    lakes, and the fish-ponds where it inhabits. Blindly ferocious, it does not
                    spare its species, and even devours its own young; gluttonous without choice, it
                    tears and swallows with a sort of fury, the remains even of putrified carcasses.
                    This blood-thirsty animal is also one of those to which nature has accorded the
                    longest duration of .years; for ages it terrifies, agitates, pursues, destroys,
                    and consumes the feeble inhabitants of the waters which it infests; and as if,
                    in spite of its insatiable cruelty, it was meant that it should receive every
                    advantage, it has not only been gifted with strength, with size, with numerous
                    weapons, but it has also been adorned with elegance of form, symmetry of
                    proportions, and variety and richness of colour.”<note anchored="true"

                    especially for convalescents, and others of weakly habit. It is most tender and
                    nutritive in young individuals, but full-grown pikes are occasionally found, in
                    which the flesh on the back and near the vertebral column acquires a greenish

                    their fine green colour. The intestines differ in their structure from those of
                    the pikes. One species inhabits the European coasts, which is about two feet
                    long, green above, and white beneath. It affords a good dish, in spite of the
                    prejudice caused by the colour of its bones. It is the <hi rend="italic">Esox

                    species are to be found in the warm latitudes of both hemispheres. Although
                    their flesh is oily, it is of an agreeable taste.</p>
                <p part="N">We now come to a tribe of fishes which have attracted much attention,
                    owing to the power they possess of leaping to a great height into the air, and
                    even sustaining themselves in that element for a perceptible time. This faculty,
                    which has caused them to be named <hi rend="italic">flying fishes,</hi> they owe
                    to the excessive development of their pectorals, a peculiarity which readily
                    distinguishes them from all other abdominal fishes. Their bead and body are
                    clothed with scales, and a longitudinal series of carinated scales forms a
                    salient line at the bottom of each flank, as in some of the genera last
                    described. The head is flattened above and on the sides; the dorsal is placed
                    above the anal, the eyes are large, the inter-maxillaries without pedicles, and
                    themselves forming the edge of the upper jaw. The two jaws are furnished with
                    small pointed teeth, and the pharyngeal bones with teeth <hi rend="italic"
                        >en</hi><hi rend="italic">pave.</hi> Such as present these characters are to
                    be referred to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Exocetus,</hi> Linn., a name which
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">lying out,</hi> and which was given by the ancient
                    Greeks to a fish that was reported to be in the habit of coming to repose on
                    shore. They are further characterised by having ten branchial rays, a very large
                    swimming bladder, and straight intestines without caeca; the upper lobe of the
                    caudal fin is the shortest.</p>

                    Bloch, 398 (sce Plate CCCIV. fig. 11), is a well-known flying fish of the ocean
                    (but not to be confounded, as it has sometimes been, with the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Trigla</hi><hi rend="italic">volitans,</hi> or flying gurnard, already
                    alluded to under the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Dactylopterus).</hi> It is
                    common in many of the warmer parts of the northern hemisphere, especially
                    between Teneriffe and the line. It is also said to occur occasionally in the
                    Mediterranean, and may be recognised by its large eyes, and the smallness of the
                    ventral fins, which are placed in advance of the centre of the body. Its mouth
                    is slightly tubular, its scales deciduous, and its size from six to twelve
                    inches. A species more common in the Mediterranean is the <hi rend="italic">E.
                        exiliens,</hi> Bloch, 397, of which the ventrals are long, and placed behind
                    the centre of the body. It attains to the length of fifteen inches. The young
                    have black bands upon the fins.</p>
                <p part="N">Some difference of opinion scems still to exist in regard to the mode of
                    flight in these fishes. Mr Bennet supposes, that because they do not use their
                    pectoral fins in the air precisely as birds use their wings, that their
                    progression ought rather to be termed leaping than flying. “In fish,” he
                    observes, “the organ of motion for propelling them through the water is the
                    tail, and the fins direct their course; in birds, on the contrary, the wings are
                    the organs of motion, and the tail the rudder. The only use of the extended
                    pectoral fins in the fish is for the purpose of supporting the animal in the
                    air, like a parachute, after it has leaped from the water by <hi rend="italic"
                        >some power</hi> which is possessed even by the whale. From the structure of
                    the fin, I cannot consider it at all calculated for repeated percussions out of
                    the water; while in that fluid, it continues its natural action uninjured; but
                    it soon dries when brought into contact with the air, and the delicacy of the
                    membrane between the rays would very readily become injured were the organ
                    similarly exerted in that medium. The greatest length of time that I have seen
                    these <hi rend="italic">volatile</hi> fish on the <hi rend="italic">fin,</hi>
                    has been thirty seconds by the watch.... Their usual height of flight is from
                    two to three feet; but I have known them come on board at a height of fourteen
                    feet; and they have been well ascertained to come into the channels of a
                    line-of-battle ship, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> as high as twenty feet and
                    upwards. But it must not be supposed that they have the power of elevating
                    themselves in the air, after having left their native element: on watching them,
                    I have often seen them fall much below the elevation at which they first rose
                    from the water, but never in any one instance could I observe them raise
                    themselves above that height. I therefore regard the elevation they take to
                    depend on the power of the first spring or leap they make on leaving their
                    native element.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    regards that opinion as erroneous which limits their aerial movements to a

                    whether ancient or modern, have recorded the delight with which they witnessed
                    these sudden emergencies; and Bose in particular describes the flying fish as
                    sometimes rising in hundreds, and even thousands, around his vessel, and darting
                    over the waves in all directions, scouring away, as Coleridge has beautifully
                    said in relation to another group of animals, “like a Tartar troop over the
                    wilderness.” We shall conclude this notice by observing that the flesh of flying
                    fishes is savoury and delicate, and that they thus present another claim to the
                    attention of the voyager.</p>

                    leaving for their aperture only a vertical cleft, a circumstance which has
                    caused some naturalists to deny the existence of opercula, although they are as
                    complete as in any other fish, and to assign to them only two branchial rays,
                    although there are five or six. The opening of the mouth is very small, almost
                    as in those Mammalia named anteaters, and the maxillaries form its angles. The
                    teeth, which are slender and notched at the end, cover the inter-maxillaries and
                    the lower jaw; while on the tongue, and under the vomer, there is a band of

                    numerous genus, known by its want of scales, the mouth cleft at the end of the

                    pectoral being composed of a strong spine. This is articulated to the shoulder
                    bone, in such a manner that the animal at pleasure can either draw it towards
                    its body or erect it perpendicularly, in which case it becomes a dangerous
                    weapon, and inflicts wounds which in some countries are considered venomous,
                    doubtless because tetanus or lock-jaw sometimes ensues. The head of the <hi

                    more especially so named by Artedi and Gronovius, the small dorsal is without
                    any apparent spine; the teeth on both jaws are like those of a wool card, and
                    behind the inter-maxillary band of teeth there is a vomerian band. Of this kind
                    of structure an example is found in <hi rend="italic">Silurus glanis,</hi> L.
                    which is the largest of European fresh-water fishes, and the only one of this

                    smooth, greenish black, spotted with black above, and yellowish-white beneath.
                    The head is large, with six barbels. It sometimes attains the length of twelve
                    or fifteen feet, and the weight of 300 or 400 pounds. As this creature is
                    somewhat unwieldy in its motions, it does not pursue its prey, which consists of
                    small fishes, but lies concealed among the mud, and seizes such unwary
                    stragglers as happen to come within reach. It has occasionally been observed in
                    the sea, but always near the mouths of rivers, and in such other situations as
                    to leave no doubt that its appearance there is to be ascribed to accidental
                    causes. The, flesh is fat and sweet, and its lard has been employed in ,some

                    which bestow upon them a very singular appearance. They constitute the genus <hi

                    of fishes, many of which present so many differences in appearance and
                    structure, that it is necessary that they should be grouped in several
                    subordinate genera. The first of these, established by Cuvier, and which he
                    names <hi rend="smallcaps">Bagrus,</hi> has in each jaw a band of small crowded
                    teeth, and behind those of the upper jaw a parallel band which belongs to the
                    vomer. They admit of still further subdivision, from the number of their barbels
                    and the form of their head. Among those having eight barbels, some have the head
                    oblong and depressed; in others it is broad and short. Of such as are furnished
                    with six barbels, the most remarkable have the muzzle depressed and broad, after
                    the manner of the pike; while others have the head of an oval form, and its
                    shagreened bones forming a kind of helmet. The <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    teeth, some are observed to have the head helmeted, and a distinct osseous plate
                    or buckler between the helmet and the spine of the dorsal. Such is <hi
                        rend="italic">Sil. clarias,</hi> Bl. XXXV. 1, 2. In others the buckler is
                    united to the helmet, añd forms only a single body with it, the helmet thus
                    extending from the muzzle as far as the dorsal. In some instances the head is
                    oval, clothed only by the skin, through which the bones do not appear; in this
                    group the species have cither six or eight barbels. In those called <hi

                    Numerous other modifications of structure are to be found in this extensive
                    genus, of which the greater proportion of the constituent species have but
                    recently become known to naturalists. Several have the muzzle elongated, and
                    these lead to a group of still more remarkable conformation, viz.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Synodontis, Cuv.</hi> In which the muzzle is
                    narrow, and the lower jaw supports a packet of teeth much flattened laterally,
                    terminating in hooks, and each suspended by a flexible pedicle; a kind of
                    dentition of which no other example is known. The rough helmet, formed by the
                    cranium of these fishes, is continuous, without any interruption, with an
                    osseous plate, which extends to the base of the spine of the first dorsal; and
                    that spine is very strong, as is likewise the case with those of the pectorals.
                    The lower barbels, and sometimes also the maxillaries, have lateral barbels. The
                    species are found in the Nile and Senegal, and are known to the inhabitants of
                    Lower Egypt by the general name of <hi rend="italic">Schal,</hi> while in the

                    by Geoffroy distinguishes them from all other fishes, viz. that besides the
                    ordinary branchiae, they have ramified appendages like trees adhering to the
                    superior branch of the third and fourth branchial arch, and which appear to be a
                    kind of supernumerary branchiae. All the species pertaining to this genus are
                    found in the Nile, Senegal, and a few of the Asiatic rivers. Their flesh is
                    either of indifferent quality, or altogether unfit for food. This is not the

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Plotosus,</hi> Lacép. Is characterised by a

                    at the caudal, form a point, as in the eel. Their lips are fleshy and pendent;
                    the throat armed anteriorly with conical teeth, behind which there are others of
                    a globular form, which at the upper jaw pertain to the vomer. The head, as well
                    as the rest of the body, is enveloped in a thick skin, and the branchial
                    membrane has nine or ten rays. All the known species are from the East Indies.
                    They have eight barbels, and, behind the anus, the fleshy and conical tubercle

                    there is, besides, a fleshy ramified appendage, the functions of which, though

                    dentated, and of considerable size. Such is <hi rend="italic">Platystacus
                        aηguillaris,</hi> Bl. 373, while others have them concealed beneath the

                    Buchan, xv. 44. Certain fishes referred by Linnaeus to the genus <hi

                    there is likewise on the head a compartment of these pieces. The extremity of
                    the muzzle, however, is naked, as well as the under side of the body. The second
                    dorsal has but a single ray in its anterior edge; the pectoral spine is strong,
                    but the dorsal is slender or short. The mouth is but little cleft, and the teeth
                    nearly imperceptible; the barbels, four in number; the eyes small, and placed on
                    the sides of the head. These fishes can crawl for some time on dry land like the
                    eel. In some the pectoral spine is merely rough, in others it is dentate, as in

                    thick as the body, which is inflated in front. It is the famous electric Silurus

                    are in pairs, one behind the other. Globules are seen on some of these fishes,

                    lengthened form, the body covered with scales of no great size, and furnished
                    with two dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is composed of soft rays; the second,
                    generally of a fatty substance, resembling a fold of the skin, is usually of
                    small size. The tail is remarkably powerful, acting as an elastic lever, and, as
                    usual, constitutes the principal organ of locomotion. The margins of the jaws
                    are formed by the maxillary and inter-maxillary bones, and, with the vomer and
                    palate bones, are commonly thickly studded with teeth, strong, conical, and
                    bending backwards. The maxillary and inter-maxillary bones constitute a single
                    continuous arch, as in the higher animals. The pyloric portion of the stomach is
                    furnished with numerous appendices connected with a pancreas. The swimming
                    bladder is large and oblong, and opens into the gullet near the extremity. They
                    are voracious, feed on insects, the less Crustacea, and small fishes. Many of
                    the species are migratory, and approach the mouths of rivers, or ascend their
                    streams for the purpose of spawning. In the breeding season they are marked by
                    some appendage peculiar to the time, or by a change to colouring of more
                    brilliant tints. They reach a large size. The flesh is well flavoured and

                    hooked during the breeding season. The silvery colours change to gray and red.
                    The species inhabit the sea and fresh waters. Some migrate at the breeding
                    season; all spawn in shallow streams, and both sexes assist in forming the
                    spawning bcd. They inhabit Europe, Asia, and America.</p>
                <p part="N">The fishes which constitute this genus are of great importance, and are
                    by far the most esteemed and valuable of all those which inhabit the fresh
                    waters. The value of the fisheries, with the number of men engaged in them, is
                    very great, and the expense of the materials which are consumed in the capture
                    of one or two species is immense. In Britain they are mostly consumed in the
                    great towns, either in a recent or prepared condition. In the north of Europe
                    and America numbers are salted or otherwise cured for exportation. At the
                    commencement of the genus is generally placed <hi rend="italic">Salma
                        sglar,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">common salmon,</hi> a species which
                    likewise occųpiąą theforemost place in the estimation of both sportsman ąnd
                    çpicure. The salmon is a fish of great elegance, combining a form fitted alike
                    for strength and swiftness; and its depth and thickness, while in good
                    condition, are so proportioned to its length as at once to convey the idea of a
                    pleasing, symmetry. The body above is of a rich bluish or greenish gray,
                    changing below to silvery, sprinkled above the lateral line with rather large
                    sub-cruciform black spots, a few of which at the shoulders generally extend
                    below the line. The characters which distinguish it from its British congeners
                    are the different form of the opercular bones, which show a rounded outline to
                    the posterior edge of the gill-covers, the longest diameter of which to the nose
                    would be in a line through the eye, while in all the other British migratory
                    species the same line would pass much below the eye. The black inner surface of
                    the pectoral fin is nearly a constant mark. The tail is forked in the young
                    state, but fills up to a nearly square outline in the adult, in which the width
                    between the extremities is proportionally wider than in <hi rend="italic">S.
                        eriox,</hi> the only migratory species which attains a weight at all
                    approaching that of the salmon. The outline of the scales also presents
                    distinguishable differences.</p>
                <p part="N">The common salmon inhabits the seas around Great Britain, and extends to
                    the north of Europe and to Asia; but it is not properly ascertained that those
                    found in North America are identical. Its true abode may be called the sea; for
                    as soon as it has entered the rivers it begins to deteriorate in condition, the
                    scales lose their brilliant silvery lustre, and the flesh becomes soft and pale.
                    It is drawn to the fresh waters by that natural instinct so wisely implanted for
                    the purpose of its reproduction, an instinct which enables it to stem the
                    current of the most rapid rivers, to ascend precipitous falls, and to pass
                    through weirs and obstacles of human intervention, which no other power could
                    overcome. This desire of looking for a suitable place in which to deposit their
                    ova is their sole reason for thus seeking the “rivers of water,” the torment of
                    sea insects, or other causes which have been assigned, having no influence. This
                    may be at once understood from the fact of the barren fish continuing their
                    usual haunts along the coast, while a great many do not for a year at all enter
                    the fresh waters. It is during this run to the proper spawning beds that the
                    greatest numbers are captured, either by weirs, cruives, nets, or the rod; and
                    it is then also that the sporting angler alone can ply his vocation, almost all
                    attempts to angle the salmon in salt water having yet proved unsuccessful. Many
                    fish far advanced with spawn are by these means destroyed; for unfortunately the
                    most advanced are the most voracious, and a needy fisherman looks more to his
                    present gain than to an expected produce of another year. It would be well and
                    wise if the net fisheries of this valuable species were more confined to the
                    tide-ways, where, in some estuaries, they are extensively carried on (as well as
                    in the rivers) by means of stake-nets. These are so constructed as to intercept
                    the fish entering the rivers, all in a high state of condition, and are
                    sometimes wrought to such an extent as to employ several miles of netting.</p>
                <p part="N">Salmon generally delay entering the rivers in great numbers until the
                    streams become somewhat swollen by rains, although in the larger rivers there
                    may be said to be a limite¢ daily run. When the flood has fairly mingled with,
                    and to a certain extent has saturated, the estuaries, the rush of fish is often
                    very great, especially if there has been a continued tract of dry weather. In
                    the latter case they collect at the mouths of rivers, and are seen and often
                    taken in vast numbers; but they do not then attempt an ascent, deterred perhaps
                    by the clearness of the stream, or by some instinctive feeling that the water
                    would yet be deficient to carry them through. As tlιeJA⅛'Λ approaches, however,
                    an increased activity may be perceived; and, as íàr as we can judge, the change
                    is probably indicated by the nostrils receiving a sense of the mixture of the
                    waters, by means of the large ramification of nerves with which they are
                    supplied; and to this same sense may perhaps be attributed the singular fact of
                    the greater proportion of salmon returning to the very streams in which they
                    were spawned. The fish, on entering the river, rush forward as long as the flood
                    continues, seldom resting in their course during the time that the water
                    continues discoloured. From ten to twenty-five miles daily is the rate, as far
                    as can be ascertained, at which they are supposed to travel.</p>
                <p part="N">In their more lengthened courses, where the rivers are deeper and the
                    interruptions less frequent, the rate at <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192940467?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0467-0205"/>which
                    salmon travel is probably much more rapid. We know indeed little as yet
                    regarding the identity of species between our own and those of foreign regions ,
                    but if, as some suppose, our salmon attains to the lofty Cordilleras of South
                    America, by means of the mighty Maragnon, then it must run a course of about 800
                    leagues. Bearing in mind, however, that the salmon is a truly northern fish
                    (that they occur in <hi rend="italic">some</hi> abundance in the arctic regions,
                    may be inferred from the fact, that Commander Ross, during his recent voyage,
                    took <hi rend="italic">three thousand three hundred and seventy-eight</hi> at
                    one haul, in the month of July; and that his uncle Sir John obtained a <hi
                        rend="italic">ton weight</hi> of salmon from an Esquimaux, in exchange for
                    one or two knives !), and also remembering those laws of distribution which
                    regulate, and, with a few exceptions, circumscribe, the localities of living
                    creatures, we think it more than likely that the South American salmon belong to
                    another species. We know, however, that our common kind <hi rend="italic">(Salmo
                        salar)</hi> makes its way by the Elbe into Bohemia, and through the Loire as
                    far as the environs of Puy, in the ancient Velay. We also know that it works its
                    way up the Rhine, and visits a portion of the rivers of Switzerland, although
                    the irresistible torrent of the Falls of Schaffhausen prevents its ingress to
                    any part of the basin of the great Lake of Constance. But we feel less assured
                    of its occurrence in the Persian Gulf, or of the identity of the species found
                    in the Caspian Sea. Neither can we credit that it advances unrepelled by the
                    gloomy terrors of a subterranean journey, and that salmon from the Gulf, adorned
                    by the fanciful Persians with rings of gold and silver, have been found in the
                    Caspian. The non-existence of the supposed communication is of itself a pretty
                    sufficient barrier, even did no other exist in the laws of nature, and were
                    light and atmospheric air dispensable.</p>
                <p part="N">In our lower and clearer waters, however, they travel at a much slower
                    rate than that above alluded to,—resting for some time in the pools by the way,
                    and now and then taking a regular <hi rend="italic">lie</hi> in some chosen
                    spot, which they will return to daily as long as the river continues unfitted
                    for their progress. Upon the least accession, however, to the water, cither
                    directly or from some swollen tributary, they are again upon the alert; and it
                    is often felt by them several hours before the quickest or most cxperienccd
                    human eye can perceive a rise upon the river. Having ascended to a considerable
                    height, they remain more stationary, and proceed more slowly with the subsequent
                    floods, till the spawn increases in size. This increase, if not influenced by,
                    is at least so connected with, the commencement of the colder weather, as then
                    to proceed at a more rapid rate. As the spawn advances, the symmetry of the form
                    is disfigured; the female becomes disproportionately large, the colours lose the
                    brightness of their silvery tints, and become dull and gray. The male becomes
                    thin upon the back, the nose elongates, and the under jaw turns up in a large
                    and strong hook, which enters a hollow in the nose before the inter-maxillary
                    bones. The colours and markings become brown and red, those on the head and
                    gill-covers being particularly brilliant, and disposed in lines almost like the
                    marking of a <hi rend="italic">Sparus.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    some ford or shallow stream, and commence to excavate a trench or furrow
                    (chiefly by the exertions of the female). In this the spawn is deposited, and
                    impregnated at the same time, and finally covered with gravel by the exertions
                    of the fish. The furrow is generally from six to nine inches in depth; and when
                    the spawn has appeared to be covered beyond that depth, this has occurred from
                    some other circumstances,— such as the stream or floods having carried downward
                    additional masses of gravel, &amp;c. After this great effort has been
                    accomplished, both sexes are reduced to a state of remarkable emaciation. The
                    elongated nose, and hooked jaw, and brilliant colours, are almost immediately
                    lost; the old scales are cast, and the fish retire to some pool to regain their
                    strength and complete their new clothing. They finally redescend to the sea by
                    easy stages, where their former condition and silvery lustre are regained, their
                    strength invigorated, and all their functions so repaired as to enable them ere
                    long to renew their visit to the flowing-streams, again to multiply their
                    race.</p>
                <p part="N">The ova continue covered by the gravel during the winter, and begin to
                    vivify from about the end of March to the commencement of April. The fry remove
                    from under the gravel when nearly an inch in length, with the ovum still
                    attached; and at this period, if the spawning bed or furrow be turned up, it
                    will appear in motion. When disengaged from the ova, the fish increase in size
                    most rapidly, and about the end of April and during May commence and perform
                    their first migration or journey to the sea. At this time they are from four to
                    six inches in length, of a greenish gray above, silvery below, the scales
                    extremely delicate and very deciduous. From the time they reach the sea, for two
                    months or ten weeks, we lose sight of them, and can only infer their growth from
                    the fact, that after the lapse of that period we find them again ascending the
                    rivers with a weight of from two and a half to four pounds. They are then known
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">gilse</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >grilse</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and their size, as they ascend from the
                    sea, increases with the advance of the season. The gilsc which thus ascend spawn
                    during the ensuing winter, and are then entitled to the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">salmon.</hi> Descending in a weak state (as before mentioned),
                    they return again in the summer of the following year, as fish of from ten to
                    fifteen pounds weight, according to special circumstances. A third year would
                    still increase their weight, as would several ensuing seasons, till the
                    attainment of an enormous size. Pennant, for example, mentions a salmon which
                    weighed seventy-four pounds; and although we now regard with something of wonder
                    a fish which weighs even the half of that amount, yet there is no doubt that not
                    many years ago salmon of forty pounds were much more frequent than in these
                    degenerate days.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p
                            part="N">We observe that a salmon above fifty pounds weight was recently
                            taken at the mouth of the Leven in Dumbartonshire. The general capture
                            this season (1835) has been very great in Scotland. Nearly 800 were
                            taken at one haul in a bay of the island of Islay; and our calculation,
                            from accurate data, is, that for some time past about a <hi

                            been shipped in Scotland <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> from our eastern

                    salmon of the largest class from many of the Scotch rivers, where they formerly
                    abounded, is in fact owing to the injudicious perfection of our fisheries, which
                    occasions the constant capture of the species in the state of gilse, or other
                    early condition; and the chances are by consequence greatly against any
                    individual escaping the various dangers by which it is environed, for such a
                    succession of years as is likely to admit of its attaining to its full
                    dimensions. The destruction by poachers in the higher parts of the rivers, of
                    the large enfeebled <hi rend="italic">helts,</hi> or fish which have completed
                    their spawning operations, is also extremely prejudicial; for these individuals
                    (almost utterly useless as food at the time alluded to) would, if allowed to
                    descend to the salubrious sea, ere long revisit their native streams, greatly
                    increased in size, and full of health and vigour.<note anchored="true"

                    proportion to its length than the salmon; the fins are much more muscular; the
                    tail particularly so, and perfectly square at the end in all the stages of
                    growth, while the distance between the two extremes of the web is smaller
                    proportionally than in any of the other species. The head is larger in
                    proportion than that of the salmon of a similar weight, and the opercular
                    covering is more lengthened. The toothing is very strong. The general colours
                    are, above greenish gray, the lower parts silvery white; the body above the
                    lateral line being thickly covered with large cruciform black spots. In the
                    breeding dress they assume a much blacker tint than the salmon, and want much of
                    the red markings. All the under parts, jaws, and cheeks, become blotched with
                    deep blackish gray. The flesh is of a yellowish tint, and is coarse, except in
                    the young state; it has the least flavour, and is consequently less esteemed in
                    the market than any of the other species. The hook of the under jaw of the male
                    does not become so elongated as in the salmon. The old fish commence to enter
                    the rivers about the end of July, and appear to deposit their spawn and return
                    to the sea about a month earlier than the salmon. The young fish, of from two to
                    three pounds weight, and in this state known as <hi rend="italic"
                        >τvhitlings,</hi> enter the rivers about the beginning of June. In all its
                    states it is a very powerful fish, and feeds voraciously and indiscriminately.
                    When hooked it springs repeatedly from the water, and runs (to use an angler’s
                    expression) with extraordinary vigour to free itself. The river Tweed and its
                    tributaries are among the principal localities for this fish. It occurs also,
                    though more sparingly, in some of the rivers of the Solway, but appears to be
                    rare on the west and north coasts of Scotland.<note anchored="true"

                    by most modern Ichthyologists described as distinct. The characters of each,
                    however, are extremely difficult to determine; and it is most probable that they
                    will both be found to merge into one species, entitled to the name of <hi

                    abundant, and are taken in great quantities in the Solway and its tributaries,
                    and along the greater part of the west and north coasts of Scotland. In the
                    first-named locality, they bear the name of <hi rend="italic">sea trout,

                    easily conceive the immense confusion that may and has arisen from the use or
                    abuse of provincial names. Along the south-east coast of Scotland they appear
                    less abundant; but this may arise from the larger mesh employed in the nettings.
                    The Tay and the Forth supply the Edinburgh market. In its largest state, or as
                    known under the specific title of <hi rend="italic">trutta,</hi> it enters the
                    rivers from two and a half to six pounds weight in the end of May. It is of an
                    elegant form, and possesses all the symmetry of the salmon. The head is small,
                    the back remarkably broad when viewed from above; the tail slightly forked, and
                    wide at the extremity of the web; the colour above greenish, inclining to
                    bluish-gray, lower parts of the clearest silver; body above the line spotted, as
                    in /S'. <hi rend="italic">eτiox,</hi> with large, deepblack spots, but generally
                    much fewer in number. The flesh is pink, richly flavoured, and much esteemed for
                    the table. It ranks next to that of the salmon, and by many is esteemed more
                    delicate than even that prized species. The N. <hi rend="italic">albus,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">or</hi> smaller and younger state in which it is found, is
                    very nearly of the same proportion, form, and colours. They approach the mouths
                    of the rivers in the end of July and commencement of August, in immense
                    profusion, and immediately enter the fresh waters, where an angler may take
                    almost any quantity without the exercise of great skill. In the north they form
                    a perquisite to the taxmen or kayners of the salmon fisheries,—above a thousand
                    being sometimes taken at a sweep of the net. In the Solway they are taken in
                    equal abundance in houses of the stake-net, covered for the purpose with net of
                    a small mesh, and are then carried to the various country markets, and during
                    the height of the run to the villages, in cart-loads, for sale. The flesh of
                    this smaller fish (whether species or variety, as the case may be) is also pink,
                    and delicately flavoured. Its food is likewise the same as that of the larger
                    kind; in the sea small Crustacea <hi rend="italic">(Talitrus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">locusta</hi> being a favourite and common food),—in fresh
                    water aquatic insects, worms, minnows, or other small fish. They appear also to
                    spawn rather earlier than the salmon, and after the same manner. The colours of
                    both sorts during the breeding season are deep-grayish black, slightly tinted
                    with brown in the males; and at this time they offer a most marked contrast
                    (being black and lean) to the symmetrical form and brilliant silvery tints of
                    their perfect condition.</p>

                    Danube, but most probably migratory to the Black Sea, and certainly not a native
                    of the British waters, though inserted in many of our lists. It is a fish of
                    extraordinary power, attaining to the weight of sixty pounds; and is of more
                    lengthened proportions than the common salmon. The flesh pale coloured, and
                    rather coarse. The young have large transverse bands upon the back and sides;
                    with age these break up into spots, and gradually disappear, till the ground
                    colour becomes uniform, and is only broken by the ordinarily black or violet
                    spotting. In America, again, we have in this division the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">Hearnii,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Copper-mine

                    other salmon of America, are much smaller than those of the European species,
                    and in this fish they possess peculiar lustre. The teeth are weak and few, their
                    size inferior to those of the common salmon. Their flesh is red. This fish is
                    abundant during July and August, below the falls of the Copper-mine River.</p>
                <p part="N">The migratory salmon are distinguished from those which inhabit only the
                    fresh waters by the clear grayish blue of the upper half of the body, and the
                    brilliant silvery lustre of the belly and lower parts. Among those <pb

                        >trouts,</hi> the colouring is more varied and of brighter tints, in which
                    yellow and orange predominate, changing to various shades according to locality.
                    The best and most familiar example is <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">fario.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">common trout.</hi> This
                    lovely fish is most extensively distributed over the whole of Northern Europe,
                    being found in every burn and tarn, in every lake and river. It may be also said
                    to be one of the most pleasing in its appearance; and, when newly taken in
                    “golden glory” from some translucent stream, is exquisitely beautiful. The
                    variation of the tints of the ground colour is infinite; yellow, however, is the
                    most predominant, varying to the most brilliant orange; while at other times the
                    ground colour of the body runs from a dark-greenish black to violet, in most
                    instances numerously spotted with black and red. Sometimes, however, the black
                    is alone present in the form of large round spots, placedin a pale circle, but
                    in all cases beautifully relieved, and breaking up the uniformity of the other
                    colours. In a few instances the spots have been observed to be wanting
                    altogether. One cause of the variation in the trout, is the difference of food;
                    and, according to every information we possess, those which feed on fresh-water
                    shells, <hi rend="italic">Gammari</hi> (screws, or fresh-water shrimps, as they
                    are sometimes called), are of the most brilliant tint, and also of the finest
                    flavour, with a decided pinkness in their flesh. Those feeding on the ordinary
                    water insects are next in brilliancy and flavour, while such as live chiefly
                    upon aquatic vegetables are dull in colour, and of soft consistence. This is
                    further confirmed by the trout in <hi rend="italic">stews</hi> being always
                    finished, or <hi rend="italic">fed off</hi> as it is called, on the foresaid
                    Gammari, collected often from a distance. It is only in this way also that we
                    can account for the variation in the appearance and flavour of trout found in
                    two adjoining bays of the same lake. The individuals, in fact, do not appear to
                    stray to any distance, but seem to be satisfied with whatever food is found
                    within a limited district, and which of course will be in many instances of a
                    peculiar and local kind. It is also true, that the colours of trout accommodate
                    themselves to the tint of the water, and to the prevailing <hi rend="italic"
                        >tone of</hi> the bottom, whether of rock or gravel, or of softer substance;
                    and so constantly is this the case, that an experienced and observant angler has
                    little difficulty in accurately predicating the general aspectof the fish of any
                    lake or river. The presence of moss, so frequent in alpine districts, has
                    invariably the effect of deepening the tints, particularly the shades of green
                    and yellow.</p>
                <p part="N">In form this fish, when in perfect condition, may be said to be nearly
                    symmetrical; the head only being sometimes rather large in proportion to the
                    body, when considered in relation to what we regard as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >beau ideal.</hi> The fins are of moderate strength, those of the body
                    assuming a variation of form, from a rounded to a lengthened extremity. The tail
                    is almost always forked; the fins are always coloured, that is, never of the
                    transparent whiteness observable in the migratory species; and their tints are
                    generally of a paler shade than those of the corresponding parts of the body.
                    The anal fin is often bordered on its lower surface with white. The scaling is
                    proportionally less than in the migratory kinds. The toothing is in general
                    strong, and very prominent on both the tongue and vomer.</p>
                <p part="N">The average growth of the common trout, taking the species generally,
                    may be stated at about a pound, and certainly not more than a pound and a half.
                    In almost all rivers, fish weighing beyond this may certainly be found; but they
                    are comparatively uncommon. Individuals from two to six pounds weight are
                    occasionally taken, even in what may be termed a “wild state.” In ponds or
                    stews, again, they reach a much greater size, but cannot be said to be in the
                    natural condition of unenclosed fish. The Thames trout seem to reach most
                    frequently the largest size, being short compared to their length, but of great
                    thickness and well flavoured. Two were lately taken, the one of eleven, the
                    other of fifteen pounds weight. The lakes in the north of England produce trout
                    of very fine quality, and which are often passed oft' for char. Loch Leven, too
                    (of which the barren isle and now dismantled castle are famous in history as the
                    prison-place of the beautiful Queen Mary), has long been celebrated for its
                    breed ot trout. These, however, have fallen off of late considerably in their
                    general flavour and condition, owing, it is said, to the partial drainage of the
                    loch having destroyed their best feeding ground, by exposing the beds of
                    freshwater shells, which formed the greater portion of their food. Farther north
                    (as in Sutherlandshire) the immense multitude of lochs produce a corresponding
                    abundance and variety of trout. Of these, however, only a few are of superior
                    quality; but these few may assuredly vie with the trout of any country in the
                        world.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">We
                            may here note the existence of a strongly marked and peculiar variety,
                            called the <hi rend="italic">glllαroo trout</hi> of Galway. It is
                            remarkable for feeding on shell-fish, in consequence of which (as is
                            supposed) the coats of the stomach acquire a great degree of thickness,—
                            from which peculiarity it is sometimes called the <hi rend="italic"
                                >gizzard trout.</hi></p></note> Another large species, occurring in
                    the British waters, and not yet distinctly known elsewhere, is the <hi
                        rend="italic">Salmo ferox,</hi> Jardine. This species reaches a weight of
                    twenty-eight pounds, and is of very great power compared with its size. The
                    characters which distinguish this fish from <hi rend="italic">S.fario</hi> are
                    the great size which it attains in a natural state, the large proportional size
                    of the head, the square extremity of the tail in all the stages of its growth,
                    the relative position of the fins, and the number of rays in the dorsal, which
                    vary from 2—11 to 4—11. The external skin or covering of the scales is also
                    extremely tough; and there is a difference in the form of the scales of the
                    lateral line. In colour the upper parts are generally of a deep purplish brown,
                    shading into purplish gray, and finally, on the lower parts, to greenish or
                    grayish yellow, more or less tinted with orange. The spotting is large and not
                    numerous, and consists of black spots placed in a pale circle, and of large pink
                    spots with a similar light area. These extend over the gill-covers, upper fins,
                    and often over the tail itself. A variety occurs in Loch Loyal, in Sutherland,
                    above purplish brown, beneath blackish gray, the whole body spotted over with
                    dark se-pio-coloured spots, of a smaller size on the lower portions. <hi
                        rend="italic">Salmo ferox</hi> appears to be entirely confined to the lakes,
                    seldom ascending or descending rivers, or wandering in and out of them, and
                    never migrating to the sea. When spawning, it ascends for a short way up the

                    descends those which run out of them. It inhabits, among the English lakes,
                    Ulswater; but does not there reach a size above ten or eleven pounds. In
                    Ireland, as far as we can yet learn (specimens having not yet reached us on this
                    side of the water), it is found in Loch Neagh and some other large lakes; and in
                    Scotland we have taken it in Loch Awe, Loch Laggan, the upper end of Loch Shin,
                    and Lochs Loyal and Assynt. It is a fish of remarkable ferocity, and as great an
                    enemy to its smaller companions as the pike. It may be taken by night lines, or
                    by strong trolling tackle, baited with a small trout, and will return a second
                    and third time to the bait, even after it has been dragged for forty or fifty

                    streams in England and Wales, and the south of Scotland; but in the last-named
                    country it begins to decrease, so as to become comparatively rare, towards the
                    north. It frequents the clearest streams, delighting in the shallower fords
                    having a fine gravelly bottom, and hanging there in shoals, in constant activity
                    apparently both day and night. It is found during the whole year in the rivers;
                    but its breeding has not yet been discovered, though the fish are found in such
                    a state as to shed their spawn when handled, close to the verge of the tideway.
                    It is a remarkably beautiful little fish when newly taken from the water, above
                    of a greenish gray, beneath white inclining to yellowish, the sides marked with
                    dull bluish patches of an oval form, and the body above the lateral line
                    sparingly spotted with brownish-black and red. On the gill-covers there are two
                    black spots, one of which is often indistinct. This fish has been always
                    confounded, and still is so, with other species. Many maintain it to be the
                    young of the salmon, while others insist that it bears that relationship to the
                    common trout. The presence of the dark finger-like markings upon their sides has
                    naturally assisted in this confusion. These marks, however, are distinguished by
                    being always narrower in their form than in the trout or young salmon.<note

                            is, that this noble fish is so seldom got here, that it is considered as

                            or four instances of salmon being taken in Orkney, three of which (if
                            they were all salmon) were killed and brought on shore by the otter from
                            the sea, and picked up by the country people, and a fourth which stuck
                            in a mill-wheel, and was caught by the miller.” The same writer, under
                            the article <hi rend="italic">Parr,</hi> observes, “Pretty <hi

                            will also bear in mind, that as we advance northwards in our own island,
                            the parr becomes scarcer, the salmon more abundant,—and that while in
                            the icy streams of the arctic regions the former has not yet been
                            detected, the latter swarms in (elsewhere) unequalled numbers. It is
                            scarcely worth while to allude to the opinion maintained by the late Sir
                            Humphry Davy and others, that the parr is a hybrid or mule between the
                            trout and salmon!</p></note> Besides the external aspect being so
                    distinct that any observer will without difficulty separate them when seen
                    together, the whole skeleton of our present species is more delicately formed,
                    as are also the teeth. The form of the opercular bones is likewise different,
                    and the length of the maxillary bones is much less in the N. <hi rend="italic"

                    mouths of the different fish are exhibited together. Another distinction is, the
                    great width and power of the pectoral fins, evidently a special provision, as
                    the principal organ of support in those rapid streams where this little fish is
                    almost always found.</p>
                <p part="N">Although the history of the parr is still, in truth, obscure, we
                    certainly deem ourselves authorized to state that it is not the young of the
                    salmon. It may be found in rivers throughout the year, and is more especially
                    abundant during those midsummer months in which the acknowledged young of the
                    salmon is unknown except as a fish returning from the sea. The most
                    characteristic and irrepressible instinct of the latter seems to consist in its
                    descent to the sea a few weeks after exclusion from the egg; and if our summer
                    parr is also the young of the salmon, the fact presents a very rare and
                    remarkable example of different individuals of the same species varying in their
                    instinctive habits. The occurrence of parr in rivers so long after midsummer,
                    and the entire disappearance of <hi rend="italic">smoults</hi> (as the young
                    salmon are sometimes called) anterior to that period, is a main argument in
                    favour of their being distinct kinds; and we cannot get over the difficulty by
                    simply asserting, that such as go down to the sea early are parr, and that such
                    as go down late are parr also. It is admitted that the ova of salmon are hatched
                    in spring, and that the growth of the young (by whatever name we choose to call
                    it) is extremely rapid. Now, as nobody ever finds a parr above a few inches long
                    (six inches is a large one), and as by the end of summer they must be several
                    months old, how can we (in the belief of their being young salmon) reconcile
                    their imputed age with their actual dimensions?<note anchored="true"

                    This fish is of great repute in the Lake of Geneva, and is also found in many of
                    the alpine lakes of northern Europe. The common char reaches a considerable
                    size, being sometimes taken in Britain above two pounds in weight, although the
                    more usual weight is under three quarters of a pound. When in full condition, it
                    is a fish of very great beauty, above of a grayish green, shading into the most
                    delicate white on the lower parts, and tinted with a blush which is comparable
                    to that seen on the breasts of some of the gull tribe when newly shot in spring.
                    The body is sprinkled over with pale spots of a considerable size. In this state
                    they remain in the deeper parts of the lakes, and are not frequently taken,
                    although we doubt not they might be so were the practice adopted of hanging a
                    herring-net in the deep water, instead of trying only the <hi rend="italic"

                    when, in truth, they begin to fall off in their condition. At this season the

                            the left-hand branch (as we ascend from the lake), and draws its sources
                            from the mountain vales of Langdale, reaching Windermere without any
                            resting place,—while the Rothay has previously formed and flowed from
                            two consecutive lakes, Grassmere and Rydal. The char, in ascending from
                            Windermere to spawn, invariably turn to the left, and ascend the Brathay
                            (though to no great distance), and as invariably avoid the
                            lake-descended waters of the Rothay. They also spawn lower down the Lake
                            of Windermere, at the mouth (or a short way upwards) of the stream
                            called Troutbeck, which is also derived from the flow of mountain
                            tributaries, without any lesser or intermediate lake.</p></note> Let
                    these facts be duly regarded in determining upon the distinction or identity of
                    species. We hope ere long to investigate the subject steadily. In the mean time,
                    to illustrate the character of colour, we shall extract from our note-book some
                    memoranda made <hi rend="italic">a</hi> few seasons ago, on six specimens of
                    char (supposed to exhibit examples of the different varieties or kinds) selected
                    from a hawl taken (by net) in Windermere on the 12th December. “No. 1 is a very
                    beautiful fish,— the ground colour of the body pale ashy brown, somewhat lighter
                    beneath the lateral line. The sides are richly marked with scarlet spots of
                    different sizes; the whole of the under surface, from the pectoral fins to the
                    tail, are brilliant scarlet. The fins are margined anteriorly with an opake
                    white stripe, followed by a blackish-brown portion, passing posteriorly into
                    deep crimson. The tail is blackish brown. The nose and front part of the head
                    are marked by a black spot. The dorsal fin is of .the same pale-brown colour as
                    the back, slightly inclining to blue.” This seemed a male. “No. 2 is a smaller
                    fish, brown upon the back, and becoming gradually paler beneath; the abdomen and
                    lower parts are dingy white, tinged with bluish colour. The ventral and anal
                    fins are margined with white, their other parts flesh colour; the pectoral fins
                    are reddish brown; the dorsal fin and tail blackish brown. The sides of this
                    specimen are indistinctly marked with pale yellowish-red spots.” This was a male
                    red char, which appeared to have spawned, “No. 3 is of a blackish-brown colour,
                    somewhat silvery, paler beneath the lateral line, and passing into yellowish
                    white on the belly. The pectoral, ventral, and anal fins are brown, tinged with
                    red. The dorsal fin and tail are brownish black. The upper part of the head is
                    also black. The sides of this specimen are distinctly marked with numerous very
                    pale, almost colourless, spots. No. 4 resembles the last described, but is
                    smaller.” These the fishermen called two <hi rend="italic">geld fish,</hi> full
                    grown and half grown. “No. 5 is a very dark fish, brownish black upon the back
                    and sides, becoming, as usual, gradually paler beneath the lateral line. <hi
                        rend="italic">The pectoral, ventral, and anal fins are distinctly
                        margined</hi> anteriorly with opake white; the central portion of these fins
                    are brownish black, and their interior margins flesh colour. The upper part of
                    the head is dark; the belly of a dingy red. No. 6 resembles the preceding,
                    except that the under surface, instead of being dingy red, is pale reddish
                    white. The <hi rend="italic">ventral and anal fins</hi> are reddish brown, <hi

                    reddish brown, the dorsal fins are brownish black. Both these specimens are
                    marked on the sides with obscure pale-reddish spots.” These two fish were what
                    the fishermen called <hi rend="italic">case char</hi> (Salmo alpinus ?), male
                    and female, —yet the pectoral, ventral, and anal fins of the former, and the
                    ventral and anal fins of the latter sex, were conspicuously margined with white,
                    although that character is usually regarded as distinctive of the torgoch or <hi
                        rend="italic">red char.</hi> Perhaps the fact of the male having the
                    pectorals so margined, while those of the female were of uniform colour, may be
                    regarded as of some importance, as tending to show that the character itself is
                    in some measure variable, and therefore insufficient to constitute a specific
                        distinction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                    fishes, and therefore makes us acquainted with an important portion of their
                    natural history. For this reason we insert the following memoranda, transmitted
                    to us by Mr John Wilson, junior:—“The season for fishing char (with rod and
                    line) in Windermere and Coniston commences about the end of May, and, I should
                    say, is over by the first or second week in July. Trolling with a smallish
                    minnow is by far the most successful mode of angling for this fish. It may,
                    however, be taken with the artificial fly, the green and gray drake being the
                    .favourites. I killed three one day in May last with a small red <hi

                            considerable skill in angling.</p></note> A Bowness fisherman on the

                    that has been taken in Windermere, in a single day, by one person, for many
                    years. In Coniston, where this fish is more abundant, I believe it is by no
                    means uncommon to kill three or four dozen in a day. In regard to the size of
                    char in Windermere, I should say they average three to the pound. I never saw
                    one that was a pound. Billy Balmer told me that he once saw one that was a pound
                    and a quarter, and that it was the largest ever taken in Windermere.” In
                    relation to the same subject, in a different locality, we may also add the
                    following extract from another hand. “A small red char is found in Loch Achilty,
                    Ross-shire, on the property of Sir George Mackenzie. It takes the fly greedily
                    in warm, still weather, and, what is singular, during all the summer and
                    autumnal months. I have captured eighteen in a forenoon in July,—raising many
                    more. My flics were of various sorts, from a midge to one as large as a
                    sea-trout fly. The water of Loch Achilty is singularly deep and transparent,—the
                    soil is rich and loamy, and contains large quantities of imbedded wood,—black
                    oak especially. It is supplied by numbers of minute streams, but has no visible
                    outlet, being supposed to discharge itself subter-raneously. The char found in
                    it average eight or nine inches in length; we, however, caught one much larger.
                    They rise with less velocity than the trout, and on missing the fly, unless
                    injured, will return to the hook. In Strathglass there is a Loch Bruiach, where
                    char are caught of a much larger size, but chiefly with the net,— except in the
                    month of October, when, as our informant, the Rev. Mr Chisholm, told us, they
                    may be taken in the shallows with the rod, but at no other season.”<note

                <p part="N">On dissecting the char which we killed last summer in Sutherland, with a

                    spotted, the branchial membrane with seven or eight rays. The stomach is very
                    muscular. They inhabit rivers, and feed on aquatic insects, &amp;c. England
                    produces a beautiful species, commonly called the grayling, or <hi rend="italic"

                            ><p part="N">So named from its supposed scent or flavour resembling
                            thyme.</p></note> Salvianus. The grayling delights in clear rapid
                    streams, and is found in many of those bearing that character in the more hilly
                    or mountainous parts of England, particularly in Shropshire, Yorkshire, and
                    Derbyshire,—reaching as far north as some of the tributaries of the Tyne in
                    Northumberland. The European range of this fish seems extensive, if all the
                    authors are correct in their designation. According to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Flora Lapponica,</hi> it is common in Lapland, and the viscera are there
                    used instead of rennet, with the milk of the reindeer. It is also found in
                    Siberia, in Prussia, and Pomerania. It is a very beautiful fish, above of a
                    dusky bluish green, changing to a fine silvery gray. The lower edges of the
                    scales are dusky, which gives the appearance of dark streaks running along the
                    fish. The most marked feature is the dorsal fin, of very large size, and darkly
                    spotted between the rays, in the form of transverse bands. The ordinary size is
                    from a foot to sixteen inches in length, but instances of one or two from four
                    to five pounds are recorded. By some authors the grayling is said to be a
                    migratory fish, passing the winter in the open sea, and the summer in the fresh
                    waters. This may, however, be the habit of the fish in some countries only, as
                    in certain of the English rivers they seem to remain during the winter. This
                    species, as far as we know, appears to be the sole example of the form in
                    Europe; and it is only seen again in North America, in a very beautiful fish,

                    grayling was met with by the expedition under Captain Franklin, in the strong
                    rapids and clear rivers to the northward of Great Slave Lake, where it rose
                    eagerly at artificial flies, and afforded good sport from its <pb break="no"

                    motions in the water. Dr Richardson describes its sides as tinged with lavender
                    purple, mixed with bluish gray, without streaks; the belly blackish gray, with
                    several irregular white blotches; and there are five or six longitudinal rows of
                    uniform quadrangular spots of Prussian blue on the anterior part of the body.
                    There is a large blue mark underneath the lower jaw on each side. The dorsal
                    fin, which forms a prominent feature in the fish, is of a blackish-gray colour,
                    with some lighter blotches. Superiorly it.has a narrow margin of light lake-red,
                    and posteriorly it is beautifully ornamented with spots of Berlin blue. The
                    ventrals are streaked with red, and with whitish lines in the direction of their
                    rays. The scales are moderately large, and have no great lustre; their exterior
                    margins are rotund and entire, or very slightly undulated, those on the anterior
                    part of the belly being much smaller than the others. Of the fins the dorsal is
                    the most extraordinary, being, according to Dr Richardson, “probably by far the
                    largest in this genus.” Its colours, as above mentioned, are beautiful, and,
                    with its great size, form the chief ornament of the fish. It contains
                    twenty-four rays; the first two or three are small; but the others increasing
                    rapidly in height, as their origin is more posterior, become more and more
                    branched, and cause the fin to play loosely like a flag over the posterior part
                    of the body; the insertion of the fin occupies about one third of the length of
                    the body, and the extremity of the posterior ray, which is five inches long,
                    reaches as far as the adipose fin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    contains from twenty-two to thirty-four rays; but the posterior ones do not
                    branch out in the same manner, and scarcely exceed the others in height; hence
                    the fin has a very different aspect. It is about one inch high, has a dark
                    bluish-gray colour, with several rows of spots, having purple centres and

                    were shown to Mons. Agassiz during the autumn of 1834, he considered them
                    distinct from the species known to the continental Ichthyologists as <hi

                        >vendace</hi> of Lochmaben, whatever scientific name it may ultimately
                    receive, or whether it may be identical or not with the species inhabiting the
                    lakes of Continental Europe, may be described as an interesting example of the
                    genus. It is one of the most elegant, though of a small size, reaching from four
                    to ten inches in length. The head is of an angular shape, and small compared
                    with the size and depth of the body. The crown of the head is very transparent,
                    and the form of the brain, which is heart-shaped, is seen through the
                    integuments. This peculiarity is one of the first things pointed out to the
                    stranger naturalist who visits Lochmaben to see this species. The eye is large
                    and brilliant; the body rises gracefully to the back fin, and recedes with a
                    gradual line to the tail; the under line is nearly straight from the gills to
                    the ventral fin. The upper parts are of a delicate greenish brown, shading
                    gradually into a clear silvery white; the dorsal fin greenish brown, the
                    anterior edge much lengthened and pointed; the lower fins all bluish white; the
                    tail much forked. They spawn about the commencement of November. The roe is
                    minute and abundant, and of a bright orange colour. The flesh is white and rich,
                    and highly prized as food; but as it requires almost to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >eaten on the spot,</hi> it is not useful as a market commodity when

                    authentic British habitat for this species.</p>
                <p part="N">Several other species inhabit the Swiss lakes, and are known chiefly
                    from the works of the continental Ichthyologists, particularly Μ. Jurine, who

                    from three (the ordinary size) to twenty pounds. It abounds in every lake and
                    river, and is much esteemed as food, in many parts forming the sole article of
                    diet for years together, without producing satiety. The stomach is of great
                    thickness, generally filled with earth mixed with slender roots, and small white
                    worms. It spawns in October. Another species is <hi rend="italic">C.

                    of blackish gray round their exterior margins; the belly white, with a pearly
                    lustre; the eye moderately large, the iris with a silvery hue; the mouth without

                    The stomach not thickened. The food small insects. Inhabits the Arctic Sea, and
                    the small rivers about Fort Enterprise. The average size is about fifteen inches

                    being transparent, and giving a clear brilliancy to the colours. The upper parts

                    They embrace two forms, which, he thinks, will eventually be converted into
                    sub-genera. They are of small size, the body high, and very compressed; the
                    mouth directed upwards. The humeral bones form on the fore-part a sharp crest or
                    ridge, terminated below by a small spine. The pelvic bones form another and
                    similar crest, also terminated by a small spine placed before the ventral fins,
                    which are so minute as to have escaped the observation of the first observer. On
                    each side of the last ridge there is a row of small hollows, which has been
                    regarded as a fold of the sternum, and has suggested the name of <hi

                <p part="N">FAMILY V—CLUPIDAE.</p>
                <p part="N">Fishes allied to herrings are easily recognised by their having no
                    adipose fins; their upper jaw is formed as in trouts,—in the middle by
                    inter-maxillary bones without pedicles, and on the sides by the maxillarybones;
                    their body is always very scaly. The majority of the species possess a swimming
                    bladder and numerous caeca. Those which ascend rivers are comparatively few in
                    number.</p>
                <p part="N">The great genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Clupea</hi> of Linnaeus may be
                    known by two well-marked characters; IsĄ by the narrow and short inter-maxillary
                    bones, which constitute only a small portion of the upper jaw, the sides of
                    which are completed by the maxillaries in such a way that the lateral parts only
                    are protractile; and, 2√, by the compressed and sharp inferior edge of the body,
                    upon which the scales project like the teeth of a saw. Besides, the maxil]aries
                    are divided into three picees. The branchial openings are very much cleft; and
                    hence these fishes speedily die when removed from their native element.</p>
                <p part="N">Their branchial arches are furnished on the side next the mouth with
                    pectiniform dentations. The stomach has the form of an elongated pouch; the
                    swimming bladder is long and pointed, and in some species sends forwards two
                    long and small processes, which communicate with the internal ear in a
                    remarkable manner. Their caeca are numerous. Of all fishes, these have the most

                    This well-known fish has visible teeth in both its jaws; the carina of the belly
                    is but slightly marked; the sub-opercle is rounded; there are veins on the
                    sub-orbital, pre-opercle, and upper part of the opercle. The attachment of the
                    ventral fins corresponds to the middle of the dorsal; the head is one fifth of
                    the length of the whole fish, and by carrying backwards from the first dorsal
                    fin the distance of that organ from the snout, we arrive at the middle of the
                    caudal. The anal fin has sixteen rays.</p>
                <p part="N">The investigation of the habits of this fish has not received that
                    attention which its importance as an article of food to the inhabitants of this
                    country demands; and there are several circumstances respecting its economy
                    which still require farther examination. It is generally believed that the
                    herring inhabits in winter the depths of the Arctic Ocean, or other seas in
                    northern latitudes, and that during the rest of the year it makes migrations
                    southwards. In summer and autumn they appear on the north and west coasts of
                    Europe in immense shoals, and about the same season they arrive at some parts of
                    the coast of America and Asia. It has been supposed that those coming from the
                    north divide into two detachments, one of which proceeds along Newfoundland to
                    America, the other along Norway to the south of Europe, and that one subdivision
                    of this second detachment goes up the Baltic, while the other proceeds along
                    Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Franee, as far as the western coast of
                    Spain.</p>
                <p part="N">This is the description of the annual migrations of the herring given by
                    Pennant; but some doubts have been entertained as to its accuracy, from the
                    circumstances, Isř, that while in some places the herrings do not make their
                    appearance for years, in others they are taken in abundance all the year round;
                    and, <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> that they have never been observed on their
                    return northwards. Other naturalists suppose that they come merely from the deep
                    into shallow water during the spawning season, and that in so doing they do not
                    make any very lengthened journeys. In truth, we are not as yet furnished with
                    sufficient data to decide the question; but, in the mean time, we do not feel
                    inclined entirely to reject the generally received opinion, that the herrings
                    migrate from north to south in summer and autumn.</p>
                <p part="N">In migrating, the herrings proceed in vast troops,—so great, indeed,
                    that the sea is sometimes covered with them for miles, and that they have even
                    been known to be stranded or crushed in immense quantities in confined bays, or
                    when thrown by the wind or by currents upon the shore. The shoals are said to be
                    generally preceded, sometimes for days, by one or two males. The largest
                    generally go first, to act in some measure as guides; and, as they proceed
                    onwards, immense numbers fall an easy and unresisting prey to rapacious birds,
                    or to their own not less rapacious kindred of the sea.</p>
                <p part="N">It is generally believed that the herrings captured far north are
                    larger, fatter, and of a better quality, than those of the south; and for this
                    reason, in the month of July, our fishermen go out to meet the shoals as far as
                    Orkney and Shetland. The greatest number are taken on the coasts of Norway and
                    Sweden, in the first of which countries it is said that about 400 millions are
                    taken in one year, and sometimes twenty millions in a single fishery. The
                    inhabitants in the neighbourhood of Gothenburg, in Sweden, take as many as 700
                    millions in a year. Herrings are fished also in great quantity in this country,
                    Germany, France, Holland, the United States, and Kamtschatka.</p>
                <p part="N">The average size of the herring is stated to be about ten inches.
                    According to Dr Knox, the females are considerably larger than the males,—the
                    largest female he found on the east coast of. Scotland measuring eleven inches,

                <p part="N">Considerable doubt has at all times prevailed regarding the food of the
                    herring. They were generally stated to live on small crabs and fishes, and on a
                    minute crustaccous animal named by Fabricius <hi rend="italic">Astacus
                        harengum.</hi> But this was chiefly matter of supposition, for most
                    practical fishermen described the stomach of the fish when in good state as
                    quite empty, or, at most, as containing a little brownish mucus; and it has
                    appeared difficult to reconcile the fact, that it is when the stomach appears
                    thus empty that the fish is in its best condition, viz. fullest, with the finest
                    flavour, and most capable of keeping,—with the notion, that when it appears upon
                    our coasts it has quitted its natural feeding ground, and has been longer and
                    longer in a state of starvation the more southern the latitude in which it is
                    found. Dr Knox’s interesting observation, that the principal food of the salmon
                    and vendace consisted of minute crustaceous animals, led him to examine
                    carefully with the microscope the brownish matter contained in the alleged empty
                    stomaehs of the herring; and he then formed the opinion, that this matter
                    consisted of the debris of a very minute entomostracous animal.<note

                <p part="N">It is well known that the herrings caught upon the east coast of
                    Scotland are much inferior to those taken on the west coast, and more
                    particularly to those of Loch Fine, and other lochs of Argyleshire. Dr Knox
                    states that the herrings taken near the Firth of Forth in July are foul, or are
                    engaged in spawning, while those of the west coast, in the same season, have the
                    organs of reproduction very slightly developed; and he conjectures that that
                    species of crustaceous animal which forms their appropriate and most favourite
                    food may exist abundantly in the bays on the west coast of Scotland, and either
                    not at all, or not in <pb break="no" facs="nls:192940597?mode=fullsize"

                    coasts. It appears to be chiefly after these fishes have been absent for some
                    time from their proper feeding places that they eat marine worms and small
                    fishes; and when so feeding they lose much of their flavour, and run rapidly
                    into putrefaction after being captured. The time of spawning seems to vary
                    considerably, both in the same and in different districts; so that we may have
                    spring, summer, and autumn herrings, as we know they have in some parts of the
                    Baltic. During the spawning season they are seen to rub their bellies against
                    the rocks or sand. As many as 68,606 eggs have been counted in one female. The
                    young do not accompany the larger herrings in their migrations.</p>

                    number of its vertebrae is forty-eight, and the dorsal fin is placed farther
                    back than in the herring. It has no veins on the opercle; a gilded band runs
                    along the sides in the spawning season. This fish is eaten in considerable
                    quantity in this country, both in the fresh and salted condition. It appears in
                    the Thames from November to March.</p>

                        Breitling,</hi> Germ.) has the body more compressed, and the belly sharper,
                    than the herring. The length of its head, and height of its body, are each one
                    fourth of the whole length of the fish. The dorsal fin is placed farther
                    forwards, the anal is longer and situate nearer the caudal fin, than in the
                    herring.</p>
                <p part="N">Considerable difference of opinion formerly existed among ichthyological
                    writers as to the exact specific nature of the white-bait. Pennant and Shaw
                    considered it as allied to the bleak, <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus alburnus.</hi>
                    Turton, Donovan, and Fleming, regard it as the young of the shad <hi
                        rend="italic">Clupeα alosa,</hi> an opinion which was generally received as
                    correct, until Mr Yarrell in 1828 ascertained that the number of vertebrae in
                    the white-bait is invariably fifty-six, and in the shad only fifty-five; and he
                    is thus supposed to have demonstrated that the well-known <hi rend="italic"
                        >white-bait</hi> ought to be regarded as a species distinct from every
                    other. It is a very small fish, seldom exceeding four inches in length. It is of
                    a very brilliant silvery colour, and has a black spot on the end of the snout.
                    The flavour of the white-bait is considered as particularly delicate, and great
                    numbers are eaten by the Londoners in the month of July, at which time
                    innumerable quantities make their appearance in the Thames.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Clupea</hi><hi rend="italic">pilchαrdus,</hi> Bl. The
                    pilchard <hi rend="italic">(le</hi><hi rend="italic">Célan,</hi> Fr.) nearly
                    equals the herring in size, and bears a considerable resemblance to it in form.
                    The sub-opercle is quadrangular, the pre-operclc and operclc striated; the head
                    proportionally shorter than in the herring, and the dorsal fin placed farther
                    forwards. The ventral fins begin as it were under the end of the dorsal; the
                    anal consists of eighteen rays; and on each side of the caudal two scales longer
                    than the rest project. The habits of this fish seem to be nearly the same as
                    those of the herring. It is believed, like it, to reside in winter and spring in
                    the northern seas, and to proceed southwards in the beginning of summer. It is
                    fished in enormous quantities off the coast of Cornwall for the purpose of
                    salting and exporting to the Mediterranean, «specially to Naples. It appears
                    there in July. Its flavour is considered by some as even superior to that of the
                    herring.</p>

                    sardine, which is esteemed for the extreme delicacy of its flavour, differs only
                    in size from the pilchard. Numbers are taken off the coast of Brittany, and also

                    is distinguished by the absence of sensible teeth, and by an irregular black
                    spot behind the gills. This fish is much larger than the herring, attaining
                    sometimes to the length of three feet. It is also of a much flatter shape; its
                    tail is much forked; and on each side of the lower margin of the belly the
                    scales are very large. It is a native of the Mediterranean, as well as of the
                    North Atlantic and Caspian Seas. According to Pennant, the best in this country
                    are found in the Severn. The shad ascends rivers in spring and the beginning of
                    summer, and it is then highly esteemed; but it is of a dry and disagreeable
                    flavour when taken at sea. The Russians believe that the shad has deleterious
                    properties. The Arabs smoke-dry it. This species lives chiefly on vermes,
                    insects, and small fishes; and Dr Fleming informs us that he has taken small
                    herrings from its stomach. The number ascending rivers varies very much in
                    different years.</p>

                    attached to the throat. The body is moderately elongated, slightly compressed,
                    and covered with soft and not very large scales. The head is well proportioned,
                    and without scales; all the fins are soft. The jaws, and the front of the vomer,
                    are armed with several rows of pointed, irregular, middle-sized, or small teeth,
                    forming a sort of currycomb or rasp. Their gillcovers are large, with seven
                    rays. Most of the species have two or three fins on the back, one or two behind
                    the anus, and a distinct caudal. Their stomach forms a large muscular sac; the
                    caeca are very numerous. The swimming bladder is large, and has strong parietes,
                    frequently đentated on the sides.</p>
                <p part="N">These fishes generally live in cold or temperate climates, and
                    constitute a very important article of fishery. The greater number are
                    considered wholesome, and form a light and agreeable food,—the flesh separating
                    easily by boiling, into white flaky layers. The great sand bank of Newfoundland
                    is the most famous station of the cod fisheries, and is resorted to by English
                    fishermen, who chiefly use the hook and line. The fish abound in this place
                    probably on account of the great quantity of the smaller animals which serve as
                    food, viz. mussels, clams, &amp;c.</p>

                    digestive powers are seemingly very great. It feeds upon smaller fishes, such as
                    herrings, on Mollusca, worms, and Crustacea, and even on the young of its own
                    species. It has a strong muscular stomach, and is said to possess the power of
                    rejecting by the mouth substances, such as wood, &amp;c. which it finds
                    indigestible.</p>
                <p part="N">In spring they come nearer the shore in order to deposit their spawn.
                    This happens in January in England, in February in Norway, Denmark, and

                    re-appears in some districts cn a stated day is quite remarkable. On the coast
                    of Yorkshire, since the year 1766, they have annually made their appearance on
                    the 10th of December. At this place they are supposed to form an immense shoal
                    three miles broad, and extending eighty miles in length,—from Flamborough Head
                    to the mouth of the Tyne. It is in autumn that they visit the shores of Holland
                    and East Friesland, and the neighbourhood of Heligoland.</p>

                    although the largest are taken in winter. The flesh is generally best in the
                    months of May and June.</p>
                <p part="N">It is stated, that in the north, when the sea is frozen near the shore,
                    these fish collect in troops beneath any openings in the ice, and the
                    Greenlanders are thus enabled to catch them in considerable numbers. The seals
                    and foxes adopt the same method of securing them for food. The food of the
                    haddock is very similar to that of the cod, which species it resembles in its
                    voracious habits.</p>

                    than the haddock, being only eleven or twelve inches long. It is spotted like
                    the cod, and has the upper jaw longer than the under. The lateral line is placed
                    near the back. It resembles the whiting in taste, and is considered by many as
                    the best eating fish of all the Gadus tribe. It is much sought after on the
                    shores of the Baltic.</p>
                <p part="N">This fish frequents the mouths of large rivers, which it sometimes
                    ascends along with the salt water. It is generally taken in June. The Icelanders
                    salt and dry it, and the Greenlanders are said frequently to eat it in a state

                    sometimes occupy a space three miles long, and one and a half broad. It is
                    generally fished in summer in this country, and is taken both with the line and

                    occasion we killed thirty-three dozen with the rod in a few hours, using a line
                    with six small flies. By giving the line one or two additional turns through the

                    article of exportation from our northern coasts. In Norway the poor feed upon
                    it; and oil is made from its liver. The adult fish is taken principally in

                    into a sinus in the thickness of the two sides of the tail, in which some

                    the pectoral fin. Its scales are rougher than in the preceding species, and to
                    this character it owes its name (from <hi rend="italic">lima,</hi> file). Its

                    This fish, so highly prized on account of its delicate flavour, and the
                    wholesomeness of its flesh, is distinguished by the rhomboidal shape of its
                    body, which is nearly as high as it is long. It is bristled on the brown side
                    with small tubercles; has the lateral line curved; and the eyes on the left
                    side.</p>
                <p part="N">This species is usually much smaller than the holibut; it is frequently
                    two feet long, with a weight of twenty pounds; but it is stated sometimes to
                    attain the length of five or six feet. Extensive turbot fisheries are
                    established on different parts of our coast. The turbot is taken with the hook;
                    it is very voracious, and may be lured by various baits, such as portions of
                    herring or haddock, mussels, limpets, and other shell-fish; but all these must
                    be very fresh. Indeed the species very sensibly prefers live bait without hooks,
                    more especially the small river-lamprey. Mr Pennant has particularly described
                    the extensive turbot fishery at Scarborough. There are three men in each of the
                    fishing-boats, each man having three lines, and each line 280 hooks. All the
                    nine lines are fastened together, and then extend to about three miles in
                    length; they are laid across the current, and are allowed to remain for six
                    hours before they are hauled. This fish is called the water or seapheasant, by
                    the French common people, on account of its fine flavour.</p>

                    beneath the throat by a trans verse membrane, directed forwards, which is formed
                    by the union of the two ventral fins. The body is smooth and without scales; the
                    head broad and depressed; the muzzle projecting and extensile; the branchial
                    openings small; the gill-covering furnished with four or five rays. There is
                    only one soft dorsal fin, opposite to an anal of a similar kind. The intestine
                    is short, straight, and without caeca. There is no swimming bladder, but
                    nevertheless the species swim rapidly along the shores. The genus is divisible
                    as follows:</p>

                    properly so called. The membrane already mentioned, which takes the place of the
                    ventral fins, extends circularly under the pelvis, and forms a concave disk; on
                    the other hand, the bones of the shoulder form a slight projection behind, which
                    completes a second disk with the membrane uniting the pectorals.</p>
                <p part="N">Several species inhabit the Mediterranean and neighbouring seas. In some
                    the dorsal and anal fins are distinct from the caudal, with which tlιeir
                    membrane is however sometimes continuous, though it at the same time becomes
                    narrower. Of this kind are the <hi rend="italic">Lcp. Gouani,</hi><hi

                    Interval between the pectoral and ventral fins not divided into a double disk,
                    but forming only a large single disk, cleft on both sides, and prolonged by the
                    membranes. The dorsal and anal fins are short, and distinct from the caudal. The
                    branchial apertures are larger than in the preceding. A British species, known

                    than an inch and a half. Montagu found it adhering to stones and old shells, and
                    obtained it in abundance, by dredging, near Forcross.<note anchored="true"

                    disk, which the fish employs as a sucker to fix itself to the rocks. Besides
                    this, their mouth is wide, and furnished on both jaws and pharyngeal bones with
                    small pointed teeth. Their opercles are small; their branchial openings closed
                    towards the bottom, and furnished with six rays. Their pectoral fins are very
                    large, and unite almost under the throat, embracing as it were the disk of the
                    ventrals. Their skeleton does not harden much; and their skin, viscous and
                    without scales, has small hard grains scattered here and there upon its surface.
                    They have a stomach of considerable size, many caeca, a long intestine, and a

                    has its first dorsal fin so much enveloped in a thick tubercular skin, that

                    north, on Medusae and other gelatinous animals. Its flesh is soft, insipid,
                    somewhat oily, and is seldom<pb break="no" facs="nls:192940688?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-0688-0222"/> used for food by those who can provide
                    better. It is, however, held in some estimation by the Greenlanders, themselves
                    an oily people, whose lines do not always fall in pleasant places. They also eat
                    its roe (which is a very large one), after having reduced it by boiling to a
                    pulp. In Ireland it is sometimes salted. This fish is very unwieldy, and,
                    possessing few means of defence, it generally remains at the bottom of the sea,
                    adhering to the rocks. It thus becomes an easy prey both to seals and sharks.
                    Large placid oily spots upon the surface of the sea are often seen above the
                    places where the lump-fish have been seized and slain. We also occasionally find
                    their skins floating empty along the shore, the flesh and blood having been
                    previously extracted by their insatiate foes. The male is said to preserve with
                    great care the eggs which he has fecundated, and he has moreover been famed in
                    fable for his affectionate behaviour to the female. There does not, however,
                    appear to be any real foundation for this trait in his character,—a very
                    unfrequent one in that of any member of the fishy tribes.</p>

                    This genus, so different from its neighbours, might, like the old Linnaean genus
                    Pleuronectes, almost form a separate family of the sub-brachian malacopterygian
                    fishes. The species called <hi rend="italic">Remoras</hi> are remarkable for the
                    flattened disk they bear upon their heads, and by means of which they can adhere
                    to other bodies with considerable firmness. These disks are composed of a
                    certain number of transverse cartilaginous plates, directed obliquely backwards;
                    dentated or spinous at their posterior edge, and moveable in such a manner that
                    the fish can create a vacancy between them; and thus, aided also by the toothed
                    margin, it fixes itself securely either to rocks or floating bodies.</p>
                <p part="N">This genus has the body elongated, and clothed with small scales; a
                    single soft dorsal fin opposite to the anal; the head quite flat above; the
                    mouth cleft horizontally, and rounded; the lower jaw placed more forwards, and
                    furnished, as well as the inter-maxillary bones, with small pectiniform teeth.
                    There is a row of regularly-set small teeth, like cilia, along the edge of the
                    maxillaries, which form the external margin of the upper jaw; the vomer is
                    furnished with cardiform teeth, as well as the tongue. They have eight
                    branchiostegous rays. Their stomach is a wide cul-de-sac; the caeca six or eight
                    in number; the intestine wide, but short. They have no swimming bladder.</p>
                <p part="N">The species are few in number. Of these, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Echeneis</hi><hi rend="italic">remora,</hi> Linn., the famous <hi

                    best known. It has usually eighteen plates in its cranial disk.</p>
                <p part="N">The extraordinary power possessed by this fish, of adhering tenaciously
                    to any flattish surface, was known to ancient writers, as well as to the curious
                    inquirers of modern times. Pliny luxuriates upon it with his usual discursive
                    verbosity. The reader may possibly be amused by Philemon Holland’s translation
                    of the passages in question. “Having so far proceeded in the discourse of
                    nature’s historié, that I am now arrived at the very heigth òf her forces, and
                    come into a world of examples, I cannot chuse but in the first place consider
                    the power of her operations, and the infinitnesse of her secrets, which offer
                    themselves before our eyes in the sea: for in no part else of this universal
                    frame is it possible to observe the like majestie of nature: insomuch, as we
                    need not seeke any farther, nay, we ought not to make more search into her
                    divinitie, considering there cannot be found any thing equall or like unto this
                    one element, wherein she hath surmounted and gone beyond her own selfe in a
                    wonderfull number of respects. For, first and foremost, is there any thing more
                    violent than the sea; and namely when it is troubled with blustring winds,
                    whirlepuffs, storms, and tempests? or wherein hath the wit of man been more
                    employed (seeke out all parts of the know n world) than in seconding the waves
                    and billows of the sea, by saile and ore? Finally, is there ought more admirable
                    than the inerrable force of the rcciprocall tides of the sea, ebbing and flowing
                    as it doth, whereby it keepeth a current also, as it were the stream of some
                    great river <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi></p>
                <p part="N">‘‘ The current of the sea is great, the tide much, the wands vehement
                    and forcible; and more than that, ores and sailes withall to help forward the
                    rest, are mightie and powerfull: and yet there is one little sillie fish, named
                    echeneis, that checketh, scorneth, and arresteth them all. Let the winds blow as
                    much as they will, rage the storms and tempests what they can, yet this little
                    fish commaundeth their furie, restraineth their puissance, and, maugre all their
                    force, as great as it is, compelleth ships to stand still: a thing which no
                    cables, be they never so big and able as they will, can perform. She bridleth
                    the violence and tameth the greatest rage of this universall world, and that
                    without any paine that she putteth herselfe unto, without any holding or putting
                    backe, or any other meanes save only by cleaving and sticking fast to a vesscll:
                    in such a sort as this one small and poore fish is sufficient to resist and
                    withstand so great a power both of sea and navie, yea and to stop the passage of
                    a ship, doe they all wdιat they can possible to the contrarie. What should our
                    fleets and armadoes at sea make such turrets in their decks and forecastles?
                    what should they fortifie their ships in warlike manner, to fight from them upon
                    the sea, as it were from mure and rampier on firme land? See the vanitie of man!
                    alas, how foolish are we to make all this adoe? When one little fish, not above
                    half a foot long, is able to arrest and stay per force, yea, and hold as
                    prisoners, our goodly tall and proud ships, so well armed in the beakehead with

                    to stand still, presentlie a number of tall fellows leapt out of their ships
                    into the sea, to search what the reason might be that it stirred not; and found
                    one of these fishes sticking fast to the very helme: which being reported unto
                        <hi rend="italic">Caius</hi><hi rend="italic">Caligula,</hi> he fumed and
                    fared as an emperour, taking great indignation that so small a thing as it
                    should hold him back perforce, and check the strength of all his mariners,
                    notwithstanding there were no fewer than foure hundred lustie men in his galley
                    that laboured at the ore all that ever they could to the contrarie. But this
                    prince (as it is for certain knowne) was most astonied at this, namely, that the
                    fish sticking only to the ship, should hold it fast; and the same being brought
                    into the ship and there laid, not worke the like effect. They who at that time
                    and afterward saw the fish, report that it resembled for all the world a snaile
                    of the greatest making: but as touching the form and sundrie kinds thereof, many
                    have written diversly, whose opinions I have set downe in my treatise of living
                    creatures belonging to the waters, and namely in the particular discourse of
                    this fish: neither doe I doubt but all the sorte of fishes are able to doe as
                    much: for this we are to believe, that Pourcellans also be of the same vertue,
                    since it was well knowne by a notorious example, that one of them did the like
                    by a ship sent from <hi rend="italic">Periander</hi> to the Cape of Gnidos: in
                    regard whereof, the inhabitants of Gnidos doe honour and consecrat the said
                    Porcellane within their temples of <hi rend="italic">Venus.</hi> Some of our
                    Latin writers do call the said fish that thus staieth a ship, by the name of
                    Remora.”</p>
                <p part="N">Another species, <hi rend="italic">Echeneis Naucrates,</hi> Linn. (Plate
                    CCCV. fig. 10), commonly called the Indian Remora, has usually twenty-two plates
                    upon the head. In its habits it resembles the preceding; but it seems to be more
                    frequent in the seas of India and America, than in those of Europe. The
                    manuscripts of Commerson, as quoted by Count Lacépède, inform us that it is
                    common along the coasts of Mosambique, where it is made use of in a singular way
                    for the purpose of catching turtles. A ring is first fastened round its tail,
                    and then a long cord is attached to the ring. When thus accoutred, the fish,
                    placed in a vessel of seawater. is carried out in a boat; and as soon as the
                    fishermen perceive a sleeping turtle, they row gently towards it, and throw the
                    remora into the water, with a sufficient length of cord. It seldom fails
                    speedily to attach itself to the unconscious turtle,· which by the tenacity of
                    its adherence is immediately drawn towards the boat and captured.</p>

                    posteriorly by a sort of tubular orifice. This structure, by giving a more
                    perfect command over the closure of the gills, enables them to remain longer out
                    of water without injury than the generality of fishes. They have

                    general, as distinguished from <hi rend="italic">Muroenoe,</hi> are

                    middle a peculiar glandular body; their stomach has a long cul-de-sac; their
                    intestine is almost straight.</p>
                <p part="N">The more restricted genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Anguilla,</hi> or <hi

                    the lower; such as the <hi rend="italic">Anguilla vulgaris,</hi> or common eel.
                    (Plate CCCVI. fig. 1.) This fish is universally distributed, and scarcely
                    requires description. The usual colour is an olive tint above, and a silvery
                    colour below; but in some instances the back is spotted with brown. We have
                    observed these fish in considerable numbers leaving fresh-water lakes in the
                    night time, and frequenting meadows, seemingly for the purpose of preying on
                    slugs and snails. They easily move on the land, with α motion resembling that of
                    snakes. The eel grows to the size of two or three feet, and is sometimes said to
                    reach five or six feet in length. It abounds in many European rivers. Eels are
                    caught in immense numbers in the rivers emptying themselves into the Baltic; and
                    they form a considerable article of trade. Two thousand are stated to have been
                    caught at one sweep in Jutland; and in the Garonne 60,000 were taken in one day
                    by a single net.</p>
                <p part="N">“That eels migrate towards brackish water,” observes Mr Jesse, “in order
                    to deposit their roe, I have but little doubt, for the following reasons. From
                    the month of November until the end of January, provided the frost is not very
                    serious, eels migrate towards the sea. The Thames fishermen are so aware of this
                    fact, that they invariably set their pots or baskets with their mouths up stream
                    during those months, while later in the spring and summer they are set down
                    stream. The best time, however, for taking eels, is during their passage towards
                    the sea. The eel-traps, also, which are set in three different streams near
                    Hampton Court (the contents of which, at different times, I have had
                    opportunities of examining<pb break="no" facs="nls:192940714?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0712-0714-0224"/>), have invariably been supplied with eels
                    sufficiently large to be breeders, during the months I have mentioned. This
                    migratory disposition is not shown by small eels; and it may therefore be
                    assumed that they remain nearly stationary till they are old enough to have
                    spawn. I have also ascertained that eels are taken in greater or lesser numbers
                    during the months of November or December, all the way down the river to the
                    brackish water. From thence the young eels migrate, as soon as they arc
                    sufficiently large and strong to encounter the several currents of the river,
                    and make their way to the different contributary streams. I have also been able
                    to trace the procession of young eels, or, as it is called here, the <hi
                        rend="italic">eel-fair,</hi> from the neighbourhood of Blackfriar’s Bridge,
                    as far up the river as Chestrey, although they probably make their way as far,
                    or farther than Oxford. So strong, indeed, is their migratory disposition, that
                    it is well known few things will prevent their progress, as, even at the locks
                    at Teddington and Hampton, the young eels have been seen to ascend the large
                    posts of the flood-gates, in order to make their way, when the gates have been
                    shut longer than usual. Those which die stick to the posts; others, which get a
                    little higher, meet with the same fate, until at last a sufficient layer of them
                    is formed to enable the rest to overcome the difficulty of the passage. A
                    curious instance of the means which young eels will have recourse to, in order
                    to perform their migrations, is annually proved in the neighbourhood of Bristol.
                    _ Near that city there is a large pond, immediately adjoining which is a stream.
                    On the bank between these two waters a large tree grows, the branches of which
                    hang into the pond. By means of these branches, the young eels ascend into the
                    tree, and from thence let themselves drop into the stream below, thus migrating
                    to far distant waters, where they increase in size, and become useful and
                    beneficial to man. A friend of mine, who was a casual witness of this
                    circumstance, informed me that the tree appeared to be quite alive with these
                    little animals. The rapid and unsteady motion of the boughs did not appear to
                    impede their progress.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p

                <p part="N">“All authors agree,” adds Mr Yarrell, “that eels are extremely averse to
                    cold. There are no eels in the arctic regions, none in the rivers of Siberia,
                    the Wolga, the Danube, or any of its tributary streams. It is said there are no
                    eels in the Caspian or Black Seas, but they abound in the Mediterranean; and Μ.
                    Risso has described eight species in his work on the Natural History of the
                    Environs of Nice. There is no doubt, also, that fishes in general, and eels more
                    particularly, are able to appreciate even minute alterations of temperature in
                    the water they inhabit. The brackish water they seek to remain in during the
                    colder months of the year, is of a higher temperature than that of the pure
                    fresh water of the river, or that of the sea. It is a well-known law in
                    chemistry, that when two fluids of different densities come in contact, the
                    temperature of the mixture is elevated for a time, in proportion to the
                    difference in density of the two fluids, from the mutual penetration and
                    condensation. Such a mixture is constantly taking place in rivers that run into
                    the sea, and the temperature of the mixed water is accordingly elevated.”<note

                    in ponds, it may be inferred that their descent to the brackish water, though

                    from the common eels in having the upper jaw the longest, and the dorsal fin
                    commencing almost over the pectorals. The chief species are the following: <hi

                    of six feet or more, and is as thick as a man’s leg. The conger is found around
                    all our coasts. The skin has a leaden hue above, and is white below, with darker
                    spots along the sides. The dorsal is bordered with black. The teeth are sharp,
                    and when captured the fish is capable of giving very severe bites. The fishermen
                    are stated also to dread injury to their legs from a large conger twining round
                    them. It has been said to attack swimmers by coiling round them, and preying on
                    their bodies. It is voracious, and has not unfrequently been found within the
                    carcasses of dead animals, on which it was evidently feeding. The conger fishery
                    was at one time of some consequence on the Cornish coasts, for the supply of
                    Spain and Portugal. The fish were cured by drying, during which they lost much
                    fat. <hi rend="italic">Anguilla</hi><hi rend="italic">myrus</hi> (Rondelet) has
                    a sharp snout, a thin roundish body of a dark colour, without spots, except

                    which is thus deprived of fin, and ends in a sharpened point. The intestine

                    distinguished sufficiently by the total want of pectoral fins. Their branchial
                    apertures are minute lateral holes; their opercles are so small, and their
                    branchiostegous rays so slender, and so concealed within the skin, that some
                    able naturalists have denied their existence in this genus. Their stomach is a
                    short pouch; and their swimming bladder is small, oval, and placed towards the
                    upper part of the abdomen. Some of them have the dorsal and anal fins distinctly

                    the top of the abdomen; the posterior is cylindrical, and occupies a sinus in
                    the abdominal cavity. The true gymnotes are confined to the rivers of America.
                    The best-known species is <hi rend="italic">Gymnotus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >electricus,</hi> or electric eel (Plate CCCVI. fig. 5). This animal has
                    been well described by Dr Garden of Charlestown, by John Hunter, and by
                    Humboldt. It is remarkable for the violence of its electric shocks, which are
                    often so powerful as to stu-pify a man or a horse. The researches of Hunter
                    detected an organ in the posterior part of this fish, resembling the electric
                    apparatus of the torpedo. See Plate CCCVI. fig. 6. This organ consists of four
                    longitudinal fasciculi, which occupy one half the thickness of the part in which
                    they occur, and about one third of the whole animal. The larger pair lie above,
                    the smaller below. Each fasciculus is composed of flat partitions or septa, with
                    transverse divisions between them. The outer edge of the septa appear in nearly
                    parallel lines in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the body, and
                    consist of thin membranes, which are easily torn; they serve the same purpose as
                    the columns in the analogous organ of the torpedo, making the walls or abutments
                    for the perpendicular and transverse dissepiments, which are exceedingly
                    numerous, and so closely aggregated as to seem almost in contact. The minute
                    prismatic cells, intercepted between these two sorts of plates, contain a
                    gelatinous matter; the septa are about one thirtieth of an inch from each other,
                    and one inch in length contains a series of 240 cells, giving an enormous
                    surface to the electric organs. The whole apparatus is abundantly supplied with
                    nerves from the medula spinalis; and these nerves are seen coming out in pairs
                    from between the vertebrae. In their course they give out branches to the
                    muscles of the back, and to the skin of the animal. In the gymnote, as in the
                    torpedo, the nerves supplying the electric organs are much larger than those
                    bestowed on any part for the purposes of sensation or movement. Hunter thinks,
                    however, that these nerves are more considerable in point of size in the torpedo
                    than in the gymnote. These organs are attached loosely to the muscles of the
                    back which lie between the larger, and they are immediately connected with the
                    skin by a loose cellular texture. Humboldt has given a very interesting and
                    lively description of the mode of capturing the electric gymnote, as practised
                    in South America, near the town of Calabozo.</p>
                <p part="N">These fish abound in the stagnant pools of that vicinity. The Indians
                    are well aware of the danger of encountering the gymnote when its powers are
                    unexhausted. They therefore collect twenty or thirty wild horses, force them
                    into the pools, and when the fish have exhausted their electric batteries on the
                    poor horses, they are laid hold of without difficulty. The horses at first
                    exhibit much agitation and terror; they are prevented leaving the pool by an
                    enclosing band of Indians, who goad them with bamboos whenever they attempt to
                    escape. “The eels,” says Humboldt, “stunned and confused by the noise of the
                    horses, defended themselves by reiterated discharges of their electric
                    batteries. For some time they seemed likely to gain the victory over the horses
                    and mules; these were seen in every direction, stunned by the frequency and
                    force of the shocks, to disappear under water. Some horses, however, rose again,
                    and, in spite of the active vigilance of the Indians, gained the shore,
                    exhausted with fatigue; and their limbs being benumbed by the electric
                    explosions, they stretched themselves out upon the ground.” “I remember the
                    superb picture of a horse entering a cavern, <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:192940740?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0740-0226"/>and
                    terrified at the sight of a lion. The expression of terror is not there stronger
                    than what we witnessed in this unequal conflict. In less than five minutes two
                    horses were already drowned. The eel, more than five feet long, glides under the
                    belly of the horse or mule; it then makes a discharge from the whole extent of
                    its electric organs, which at once attacks the heart, the viscera, and
                    especially the gastric plexus of nerves.” <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> After
                    this commencement, I was afraid that the sport might end very tragically. But
                    the Indians assured us that the fishing would soon be finished, and that nothing
                    is to be dreaded but the first assault of the gymnoŧiļs. In fact, whether the
                    galvanic electricity is accumulated in repose, or the electric organ ceases to
                    perform its functions when fatigued by too long-continued use, the eels, after a
                    time, resemble discharged batteries. Their muscular motion is still equally
                    active, but they no longer have the power of giving energetic shocks. When the
                    combat had lasted a quarter of an hour, the mules and horses appeared less
                    affrighted; they no longer bristled up the mane, and the eye was less expressive
                    of suffering and of terror. They no longer were seen to fall backwards; and the
                    gymnotes, swimming with the body half out of the water, and now flying from the
                    horses instead of attacking them, began themselves, in their turn, to approach
                    the shore.”</p>
                <p part="N">The electric gymnote is by no means fierce or voracious; but its
                    electric organs are the instruments by which it procures its prey, and defends

                    been observed by several other British naturalists.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Ophidium,</hi> Linn. This genus has the anus
                    far behind; the dorsal and anal fins join in a point at the tail; the body is
                    long and compressed, and covered with small irregular scales, scattered in the
                    thickness of the skin. But these fish differ from eels, in having open gills,
                    furnished with a large operculum, and a branchiostegous membrane, with short
                    rays. The dorsal rays are articulated, but not branched.</p>
                <p part="N">The genus is subdivided into two sub-genera, viz. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ophidium proper,</hi> in which the throat is provided with two cirrhi
                    adhering to the point of the os hyoides. The best-known species is <hi
                        rend="italic">Oρhidium bαrbαturn,</hi> which grows to eight inches; general
                    colour silvery, but the vertical fins banded with black; the surface smooth,
                    scales attached by their centre to the skin; two bifid cirrhi on the throat;
                    skin spotted with small red spots. The swimming bladder is oval, large, and
                    thick, for the size of the fish, and is supported by three peculiar bones
                    suspended under the first vertebra, and moveable by particular muscles. This
                    fish abounds in the Mediterranean, where it is in request as an article of diet.
                        <hi rend="italic">Oρhidium Vassali</hi> is a small species, also found in
                    the Mediterranean; but in the South Seas a large species has been caught. It is

                    The dorsal fin is so slight as only to seem a fold of the skin; the swimming

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Ammodytes,</hi> Linn. Has a thin and
                    elongated form. The dorsal fin is furnished with articulated rays, but is simple
                    for a considerable part of its extent. There is a second fin behind the anus,
                    and a third at the end of the tail, which is forked. These three fins are quite
                    distinct, or separate from each other. The snout is pointed; the upper jaw
                    susceptible of extension, but the lower is longer than the upper when the latter
                    is not extended. The stomach is angular and fleshy; there is no swimming bladder
                    nor caeca. Only one Britişh species is as yet distinctly known, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Ammodytes tobianus</hi> (our common launce), a fish about
                    eight or ten inches long, the body somewhat of a square form, but the angles not
                    sharp, and the sides slightly convex. It is very frequent on our sandy coasts.
                    Its back is bluish, the rest rich silvery. This fish lives on vermes and other
                    marine animals, which it is believed to pursue by burrowing in the sand, from
                    whence it is often dug up at the depth of a foot. It is prized as food, and is
                    considered as an excellent bait for turbot and mackerel. It is the favourite
                    prey of the latter fish; and the porpoise ploughs up the sand at the bottom of
                    the sea with his nose, in the manner of a hog, in search of this species, which
                    has often been found in his stomach. It is also sought for by salmon, which have
                    been captured in the sandy bays of Sutherland, by means of a hook baited by a

                <p part="N">The various genera of fishes with which we have been hitherto engaged,
                    not only possess an osseous or fibrous skeleton, and free and complete jaws, but
                    their branchiae are constantly pectiniform, that is, in the shape of laminae or
                    combs. We now proceed to others, in which the respiratory organs assume another
                    form.</p>
                <p part="N">ORDER V.—LOPHOBRANCΠΠ.</p>
                <p part="N">Jaws complete and free, as in the preceding orders, but the branchiae,
                    instead of being comb-shaped, are divided into little rounded tufts, disposed in
                    pairs along the branchial arches. The branchiae have this further peculiarity,
                    that they are entirely enclosed beneath a large operculum, attached all round by
                    a membrane, which permits the water to escape merely through a small hole, and
                    exhibits only vestiges of rays.</p>
                <p part="N">The genera of this order may be distinguished externally by the <hi
                        rend="italic">cuirassed</hi> aspect of their bodies, which are strongly
                    plated, very angular, and frequently furnished with spiny projections. The
                    species are meagre creatures, of small size, and very extraordinary aspect. They
                    have scarcely any <hi rend="italic">flesh</hi> upon their bones. The intestine
                    is uniform, and without caeca; the swimming bladder is thin, but tolerably large
                    in proportion to the other parts. The order is almost entirely composed of the
                    old genera <hi rend="italic">Syng-ηαthus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pegasus</hi>
                    of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p part="N">The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Syngnathes</hi> of the great Swedish
                    naturalist consisted of a rather numerous assemblage of species, distinguished
                    by a tubular muzzle, formed, like that of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Fistularidae,</hi> by a prolongation of the ethmoid, vomer, and tympanic
                    bones, of the pre-opercles, sub-opercles, &amp;c. and terminated by a mouth of
                    the ordinary kind, but almost vertically cleft. The respiratory opening is
                    towards the nape of the neck, and the ventral fins arc wanting. The generative
                    system is characterised by this peculiarity, that the eggs slip into, and are
                    hatched in∣ a kind of sac or pocket, formed by a pursing of the skin—in some
                    beneath the belly, in others at the base of the tail. This pouch opens in due
                    time for the escape of the young. In this respect, then, these fishes may be
                    said to connect the osseous with the cartilaginous kinds, for the eggs are
                    hatched internally, and the young are produced alive. This fact was observed by
                    Aristotle, and has lately been confirmed (so far, at least, as concerns <hi
                        rend="italic">S. acus)</hi> by Cavolini. The genus is now subdivided into
                    three minor groups, as follows :—</p>
                <p part="N">Is/, Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Syngnatiius</hi> properly so called.
                    Body very long, thin, and differing but little in its diameter throughout.
                    Several species occur in all our seas. They differ in the character and number
                    of their fins.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Hippocampus,
                        Cuv.</hi> Body laterally compressed, and obviously higher than at the tail.
                    The surface is raised into ridges, its edges are angular and incised, and the
                    hinder parts of the body and tail have the appearance of being divided into
                    segments. The caudal fin is wanting.</p>
                <p part="N">, Of this genus several species are found in the European seas, and one
                    or two occur along the British shores. The greater number, however, are exotic.
                    In the dried specimens the head is usually bent at right angles with the body,
                    the thorax curved, and the tail bent nwards. From the peculiar aspect which they
                    exhibit in this condition, they have received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >sea-horses.</hi> The most remarkable species with which we are acquainted
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Hippocampus foliatus</hi> of Shaw, or foliated
                    pipe-fish. (Sec Plate CCCVI. fig. 7.) This rare and very singularly constructed
                    fish is a native of the Southern Ocean. The specimen described by Shaw was
                    transmitted from New Holland to Sir Joseph Banks. The one here figured was sent
                    to Professor Jameson from Van Liemen’s Land. We should not have hesitated to
                    consider this species as synonymous with <hi rend="italic">S. taeniolatus</hi>
                    of Lacépèđe (and the more readily as they seem to be regarded as identical by
                        Cuvier<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N"><hi

                    specimen possesses two large appendages on the dorsal outline, not represented
                    by the author of the earlier <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat. des Poissons.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">3d,</hi> Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Solenostoma,</hi> Seb. and
                    Lacép. Differs from <hi rend="italic">Syngnathus</hi> chiefly in possessing very
                    large ventrals placed behind the pectorals, and united together and with the
                    body so as to form a kind of apron, which, like the pouch of the genus just
                    named, serves to retain the ova. There is also a dorsal, with few rays, but
                    elevated, and placed near the nape; another very small fin on the origin of the
                    tail; and a large pointed caudal. In other respects the genus bears a great
                    resemblance to <hi rend="italic">Hippocampus.</hi> There is only a single
                    species known, the <hi rend="italic">Eistιdαriα pa radoxa</hi> of Pallas.<note

                    resembles that of the sturgeon, although it is composed of the same bones as the
                    mouth of ordinary fishes.</p>
                <p part="N">The body in this genus is cuirassed like that of <hi rend="italic">Hippo

                    depressed, the branchial opening lateral, and there are two distinct ventral
                    fins behind the pectorals, which are often large and wing-like, and have given
                    rise to the generic name. The dorsal and anal are opposite to each other. The
                    species are chiefly from the Indian seas. See Plate CCCVL fig. 10.</p>

                <p part="N">ORDER VI.~PLECTOGNATHI.</p>
                <p part="N">The fishes of this order approach the great chondropterygian division in
                    the imperfection of their jaws, and the slowness with which their skeleton
                    hardens; yet that skeleton is fibrous, and its general structure resembles that
                    of the ordinary or osseous fishes. The principal distinctive character, however,
                    of the Plectognathi, consists in the maxillary bone being soldered or firmly
                    attached on the side of the inter-maxillary, which alone forms the jaw, and in
                    the palatine arch being connected by suture with the cranium, which consequently
                    renders it immoveable. Moreover, the rays and opercles are concealed beneath a
                    thick skin, which permits only a small branchial cleft to be visible externally.
                    The vestiges of ribs are very slight. The true ventrals are wanting. The
                    intestinal canal is ample, but without caeca, and almost all the species are
                    provided with a rather large swimming bladder.</p>
                <p part="N">The order comprises two very natural families, characterised by the
                    different armature of the jaws.</p>
                <p part="N">FAMILY I—GYMNODONTES.</p>
                <p part="N">Instead of apparent teeth, the jaws are furnished with a substance like
                    ivory, divided internally into laminae or plates, the totality of which
                    resembles the beak of a parrot, and is essentially composed of true teeth united
                    together, and succeeding each other as they become used by trituration. The
                    opercles are small, their rays five in number on each side, and the whole
                    greatly concealed. The species live on Crustacea and Fuci. Their flesh is in
                    general mucous, and slightly esteemed. Some indeed are even poisonous, at least
                    during certain seasons.</p>
                <p part="N">Two of the genera (<hi rend="italic">Tetraodon</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Diodon),</hi> commonly called orbs or balloon-fish, possess a
                    singular faculty of inflating their bodies by swallowing great quantities of
                    air. When thus swollen, they roll over and float upon the surface, belly
                    uppermost, apparently unable to direct their course. They are not, however,
                    defenceless, for the spines with which their skin is armed project in all
                    directions. Their swimming bladder has two lobes, and their kidneys, which are
                    placed very high up, have been sometimes mistaken for lungs. There are büt three
                    branchiae on each side. Each nostril is furnished with a double fleshy
                    tentaculum.</p>

                    but one piece above and another below,—from whence the generic name, which
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">two teeth.</hi> Behind each cutting edge is a
                    rounded portion, transversely grooved, and forming a powerful instrument of

                            part="N">Baron Cuvier observes, that the jaws of these fishes are by no
                            means unfrequent among petrifactions.</p></note> The skin is armed on
                    all sides by strong, pointed spines, so that, when inflated, these creatures
                    bear a resemblance to a gigantic burr of a chestnut tree.</p>
                <p part="N">The species are numerous in the warmer seas. One of the most common is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Diodon atinga</hi> of Bloch, which measures about a foot
                    in diameter. It inhabits the seas of India, America, and Southern Africa, and
                    feeds on the smaller fishes, Crustacea, and shell-fish, the calcareous covering
                    of which it breaks with great facility, by means of its robust and bony jaws. It
                    is a dangerous species to meddle with, owing to the sudden and hedgehog-like
                    manner in which it bristles up its spines. It seems synonymous with <hi
                        rend="italic">D.</hi><hi rend="italic">hystrix</hi> of Linn., commonly
                    called the sea-porcupine, and was formerly a frequent and dustyappendage in the
                    shop of the apothecary. (See Plate CCCVI. fig. 8.) <hi rend="italic">Diodon
                        holocanthus</hi> inhabits almost all the seas between the tropics. When
                    taken by means of a hook, it exhibits the most ungovernable
                    movements,—alternately inflates and compresses its body, ascends and descends
                    with rapidity and violence, and is extremely dangerous to lay hold of. It is
                    fished for both in the Red Sea and along the coast of Japan; and, according to
                    Dutertre, the hooks are baited with Crustacea. The bait, it appears, is first
                    approached with caution, then tasted, left, returned to, and finally swallowed.
                    It no sooner, however, finds itself fairjy hooked, than it swells itself up like
                    a balloon, utters a dull sound like that produced by a turkey-cock while making
                    its wheel, and then becomes exceedingly furious. It next has recourse to an

                    times the original genus has been divided into the four following groups.</p>
                <p part="N">In <hi rend="smallcaps">Balistes</hi> (properly so called) of Cuvier,
                    the w+ole body is clothed by large, hard, rhomboidal scales, which not being
                    imbricated, or encroaching on each other, present the appearance of compartments
                    on the skin; their anterior dorsal has three spines, of which the first is much
                    the largest, the third being very small, and placed somewhat apart behind. The
                    extremity of the «pelvis is always prickly and projecting, and behind it are
                    some spines involved in the skin, which in the lengthened species have been
                    regarded as rays of the ventral fins. Some have no particular armature on the
                    sides of the tail; others have the lateral portion of that part armed by a
                    certain number of ranges of spines curved forwards.</p>
                <p part="N">In <hi rend="smallcaps">Monocanthus, Cuv.,</hi> the scales are very
                    small, and beset by close asperities; the extremity of the pelvis is projecting
                    and spiny, as in the preceding group, but there is only one large dentated spine
                    to the first dorsal, or, if the second exists, it is almost imperceptible.</p>
                <p part="N">In <hi rend="smallcaps">Aluteres, Cuv.,</hi> the body is elongated, and
                    covered by scarcely visible, small, close-set grains; there is a single spine to
                    the first dorsal; and the pelvis is entirely subcutaneous, not forming that
                    spiny projection visible in the other <hi rend="italic">Balistes.</hi> See Plate

                <p part="N">In <hi rend="smallcaps">Tri acanthus, Cuv.,</hi> the species are
                    distinguished by possessing a kind of ventral fins, each sustained by a large
                    single spiny ray, and adhering to an unprojecting pelvis.) The first dorsal,
                    posterior to its principal spine, has three or four smaller ones. The skin is
                    covered by small, closeset scales, and the tail is more elongated than in the
                    other groups. There is only one species known, a small fish from the Indian
                    seas, figured by Bloch (148, 2) under the name of <hi rend="italic">Balistes
                        bi-aculeatus.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Ostracion,</hi> Linn. Instead
                    of scales, the species of this genus have the head and body covered by regular
                    and bony compartments, soldered together so as to form an inflexible cuirass,
                    which leaves nothing moveable but the tail, fins, mouth, and a small lip which
                    borders the gills. The majority even of the vertebral joints are also as it were
                    soldered. Each jaw is armed with from ten to twelve conical teeth. The branchiae
                    open only by a small cleft, furnished with a cutaneous lobe; but internally they
                    are provided with an opercle and six rays. Both the pelvic bones and ventral
                    fins are wanting, and there is only a single dorsal and anal fin, each small of
                    its kind.</p>
                <p part="N">These anomalous-looking fishes are sparingly supplied with flesh; but
                    their liver is large, and yields an abundant supply of oil. Some are suspected
                    of being poisonous. The species are called <hi rend="italic">trunk-fish</hi> by

                <p part="N">THE CHONDROPTERYG1I, OR CARTILAGINOUS FISHES.</p>
                <p part="N">This division of fishes, by the peculiarities of the organs of hearing
                    and generation in some genera, approaches to the class of reptiles; while others
                    have a skeleton so defective, and such simplicity of organization, that we might
                    almost arrange them with Vermes. We may thus consider them, says Cuvier, as
                    bearing the same relation to the first series as the marsupial animals do to the
                    other mammifera furnished with clawè.</p>
                <p part="N">Their skeleton is distinctly cartilaginous, destitute of true bony
                    matter, as the calcareous portion is not disposed into a fibrous structure, but
                    is deposited in grains in a substance essentially gelatinous. The skull is
                    composed of a single piece, and consequently is destitute of sutures, but
                    possesses foramina, prominences, and fossulae, like the cranium of other fishes.
                    The facial articulations are also wanting; and it forms one of their
                    characteristics to want the maxillary and inter-maxillary bones, which
                    ordinarily support the teeth of the upper jaw; or they have only vestiges of
                    these parts, while their functions are performed by bones analogous to the
                    palatines or the vomer. In some the vertebral column, as in the lamprey, forms
                    but a single piece; in others, as in certain rays, several vertebrae are joined·
                    together. The gelatinous inter-vertebral substance, which in other fishes
                    communicates from one to another through a small foramen, is in several of this
                    series a cord of equal thickness, perforating all the vertebrae. Yet their
                    nervous system, connected with the organs of digestion, is as complete as in
                    other fishes; and some of them have organs of copulation and generation quite as
                    perfect as in the class of reptiles.</p>
                <p part="N">This series is divided into two orders; one distinguished by having the
                    gills free, as in other fishes; the other with fixed branchiae.</p>

                <p part="N">The few genera of this order approach to ordinary fishes, by their gills
                    being attached only at one extremity. They have but one branchial aperture,
                    which is very open; they have but one operculum, and are without rays to the
                    membrane of the gills.</p>

                    Linn.; Sturgeon. The general form of this genus resembles that of the sharks;
                    but they are distinguished by longitudinal rows of bony plates or bosses
                    implanted on the skin; the head is defended by similar plates; the mouth is
                    small, and. as in sharks, placed below the snout; the palatal bones are united
                    to the maxillaries, and vestiges of the inter-maxillaries may be traced in the
                    lips, while the mouth is capable of some degree of projection, by its position
                    on a style with three articulations. Instead of teeth, the mouth is furnished
                    with a sort of horny process on the jaws. The nostrils and eyes are on the sides
                    of the head; the muzzle is furnished with vermiform cirrhi. There is no vestige
                    of an external ear, but the labyrinth is perfect within the bones of the head.
                    The dorsal fin is behind the ventrals, and the anal immediately below the
                    dorsal. The caudal fin surrounds the extremity of the spine, and its upper lobe
                    is longer than the lower. Internally there exists the spiral intestinal valve,
                    and the pancreas forming a single mass; but we also find a very large and strong
                    swimming bladder, communicating by a wide aperture with the gullet. They prey on
                    the smaller fishes, in pursuing which they can exert much speed; but in the
                    rivers they frequent they are said to search for Vermes in the oozy bottom,
                    which they explore with their snout, like swine.</p>

                    particularly in the large rivers that disembogue themselves into the Black Sea
                    and Caspian, and the rivers of France and Prussia; they abound also in the large

                    with a viscid mucus; the snout and cirrhi are shorter. This species is chiefly
                    found in the Caspian and Euxine, or the rivers that flow into those seas; but
                    the large sturgeons sometimes caught in the northern seas appear also to belong
                    to the same species. The best isinglass is formed of its air-bladder.</p>

                    This genus, which consists but of a single species, is at once recognised by the
                    enormous prolongation of its snout, which has a dilated middle, something
                    resembling the leaf of a tree when viewed from above. The habit of the body
                    resembles the sturgeon; but the spinal column is formed of one piece, as in the
                    lamprey. The upper jaw is formed of the maxillary and palate bones united
                    together, and the pedicle of the mouth has two articulations; the mouth is
                    small, and furnished with numerous minute teeth. The spiracle is wide, and
                    covered by a very large, soft operculum, extending to the middle of the body.
                    The intestine is provided with the spiral valve, so frequent among the
                    Chondropterygii; but the pancreas exhibits the commencement of a subdivision
                    into lobules. The existence of an air-bladder sufficiently distinguisheş it from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Squati.</hi> It has only been found in the Mississippi,
                    and does not exceed a foot in length.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Chimaera,</hi> Linn. This genus has a strong
                    affinity to the Squali in general shape, and in the position of the fins, but
                    the gills have only one aperture on each side; yet, on inspecting more
                    accurately, we see that the rays are attached by most of the edges, and that
                    there are really five holes opening into the bottom of a general cavity. A
                    rudiment of an operculum is found in the skin; the jaws are still less complex
                    than in the Squali, for the upper jaw is represented only by the vomer, and the
                    palate bones and tympana are merely rudimentary, attached to the sides of the
                    muzzle. Instead of teeth, the mouth is furnished with undivided hard plates, of
                    which four are above and two below. The snout resembles that of the shark, and
                    also has regular ranges of pores. The first dorsal fin is armed with a strong
                    spine, and is placed over the pectorals. The males, as in the Squali, are
                    distinguished by the cartilaginous appendages of the ventral fins, divided into
                    three branches, and have two spiny plates before the base of the ventrals. These
                    fish have also on their front a fleshy caruncle, garnished with a group of small
                    prickles. The intestine of this genus is short, and has a spiral valve. The
                    female lays eggs of a large size and coriaceous consistence, flattened, and
                    hairy. The only species is <hi rend="italic">Chimaera borealis,</hi> or northern
                    chimera. It is found in the Northern Ocean, where it is believed to feed on the
                    numerous Mollusca and Crustacea of that sea. It is rarely taken, because it
                    keeps much in deep water; but it has been occasionally caught among our northern
                    islands, and is sometimes seen of the length of three or four feet. Its head is
                    the thickest part of the body, whence it tapers uniformly to the tail. It is
                    most çommon on the coasts of Norway, where its eggs are eaten, and the oil of
                    its liver is used as a stimulant embrocation. It also occurs in the
                    Mediterranean.</p>

                    snout. The second dorsal fin commences over the ventrals, and terminates
                    opposite to the commencement of the lower part of the tail. The only known
                    species inhabits the Southern Ocean. See Plate CCCVH. figs. 2 and 3.</p>
                <p part="N">ORDER II.—CHONDROPTERYGΠ WITH FIXED BRANCHIAE.</p>
                <p part="N">Instead of having the gills free at their external edge, in this order
                    we find them fixed all round; and in respiration water is emitted through as
                    many apertures as there are intervals between the rays. Another peculiarity of
                    this order consists in the small cartilaginous arches suspended from the soft
                    parts at the outer edge of the branchiae.</p>
                <p part="N">The Linnaean genera <hi rend="italic">Squalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Raia</hi> are the principal members of this order; but Cuvier and the later
                    Ichthyologists have subdivided these into several genera, according to marked
                    peculiarities in their anatomical structure.</p>
                <p part="N">FAMILY I SELACHΠ, OR PLAGIOSTOMI.</p>
                <p part="N">The palatal and post-mandibular bones support the teeth, while the bones
                    corresponding to the jaws in other fishes are merely rudimentary. A single bone
                    connects these jaws with the cranium, and represents at the same time tympana,
                    jugal, and temporal bones. The os hyoides is attached to a single pedicle, and,
                    as in ordinary fishes, supports the rays of the gills. The labyrinth is
                    membranous, and included in the cartilaginous substance of the cranium; the sac
                    attached to it does not contain, as in fishes, the porcelanous concretions, but
                    masses that are easily pulverized. The pancreas has the form of a conglomerate
                    gland. The intestinal canal is short; but one part of the tube is furnished
                    internally with a spiral lamina, that seems intended to prevent the too rapid
                    passage of the food.</p>
                <p part="N">The Selachii have pectoral and ventral fins; the latter placed behind
                    the abdomen, and on the sides of the anus.</p>
                <p part="N">In some respects their sexual intercourse resembles that of Mammifera.
                    The females have well-developed oviducts, which serve the purpose of a matrix in
                    the species whose young are perfected within the body; while in others the ova
                    are covered by a tough and horny envelope, to the formation of which a large
                    gland surrounding each oviduct is subservient. These eggs, especially in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Squali,</hi> have the form of a parallelogram with long
                    filamentous tendrils at each corner, intended for attaching the egg to Fuci or
                    sub-marine rocks during the maturation of the young included animals. Many of
                    these eggs are found in a female, but only two appear to be perfected at once.
                    In these the foetus is coiled up, and to its umbilical region is attached a
                    large pyriform bag, of a white colour, by a slender tube. On opening this bag it
                    is found filled with a yellowish, thin liquid, like the yolk of a hen’s egg,
                    intended for the nourishment of the foetus. When the young animal becomes able
                    to collect its own food, the coriaceous egg opens at one end, the creature
                    escapes, and soon the bag, now empty and useless, drops off. The males are
                    provided with two peculiar organs, placed at the inner edge of the ventral fins.
                    Some have supposed that these are <hi rend="italic">intimately</hi> connected
                    with the generative process; others regard them as mere <hi rend="italic"

                    Shark. This forms the first great genus of our present order. The general form
                    is elongated; the tail is thick, with the spinal column continued into the upper
                    lobe; the pectoral fins are of considerable size; the spiracles are on the sides
                    of the neck; and the eyes on each side of the head. The muzzle is&lt; supported
                    by three cartilaginous projections, proceeding from the anterior part of the
                    cranium; and we can easily observe in the skeleton the rudimentary jaws. The
                    scapula is suspended in the flesh behind the gills. Some of the sharks are
                    oviparous, while others are viviparous. Distinct but small branchial rays; there
                    are rudiments of ribs along the spine; and that column is divided into regular
                    vertebrae.</p>
                <p part="N">The original genus is numerous, and may be divided as follows.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Scyllium, Cuv.</hi> This division is
                    characterised by a short, obtuse muzzle, by nostrils near the mouth, continued
                    in grooves which reach to the edge of the lip, and more or less closed by one or
                    two cuticular lobules. Their teeth have a central point and two lateral prongs.
                    They have spiracles, partly over the pectoral fins. Their dorsal fins are placed
                    far back, the anterior not being before the ventrals. All have an anal fin; and,
                    in some species, its position corresponds to the interval between the two
                    dorsals; the tail is elongated, truncated, not forked.</p>
                <p part="N">The most common on our coasts are the following species.</p>

                    numerous distinct small, blackish, spots: the female, of which some naturalists
                    have made another species, is larger than the male, of a more red hue,
                    variegated with deep-brown spots disposed in an ocellated pattern on the sides.

                    the fifth branchial aperture is often concealed in the fourth, and the lobes of

                    observed of the length of fourteen or fifteen feet, with a large and blunt head,
                    and tapering body. (See Plate CCCVII. fig. 4.) A few years ago one of them was
                    observed for several hours to follow a Liverpool East Indiaman off Madagascar.
                    It was elegantly transversely banded with alternate whitish and dark brown or
                    blackish fasciae; and was further variegated by ocellated spots or rings on
                    various parts of its body, which seemed to be about fourteen feet long. Its head
                    appeared to be four and a half feet across; but the thickest part of its body
                    did not seem more than two feet in diameter. It was accompanied by several <hi

                    it never ventured to seize one of them. The lower jaw was distinctly visible
                    whenever it opened its mouth, into which the accompanying fishes seemed to the
                    spectators to enter and to leave at pleasure.</p>

                    have extremely sharp-pointed teeth, often serrated on their edges. Of these,
                    their jaws are armed with several rows, which they have the power of elevating
                    or depressing, and can use with remarkable effect, from the strength of the
                    muscles moving the lower jaw. The first dorsal fin is considerably before the
                    ventrals, and the second is almost opposite to the anal. The posterior branchial
                    apertures are over the pectoral fins.</p>

                    shark, the dread of seamen in hot climates, and not unfrequently seen on our own
                    coasts. It is a very large fish, growing, it is said, to more than thirty feet,
                    and often observed to measure from fifteen to twenty-five feet. The teeth are,
                    in full-grown animals, in six rows; those in the upper jaw are nearly isosceles
                    triangles, with sharp, dentated edges; those in the lower jaw have a narrow
                    lancet-shaped point on a broader basis, with smooth-cutting edges. From the
                    position of the mouth in this species, the animal turns on its side on seizing
                    its prey. Its voracity is well known, and it has been seen to leap out of the
                    water in its eagerness to snatch a suspended morsel. The jaws are so powerful as
                    to bite at once through the body of a man. The gullet is very large, and the
                    intestine short. One killed near Marseilles is alleged to have had the entire
                    body of a man, and several fish, in its stomach; and one captured off the island
                    of St Margaretta is even said to have contained the whole body of a horse. This
                    one had the enormous weight of 1500 pounds.</p>
                <p part="N">The sailors believe that the pilot-fish, which is so constant an
                    attendant on this species, directs him to his prey; and, by touching his head,
                    warns him against a baited hook. Certain it is, that the pilot-fish have been
                    repeatedly seen clinging to a shark while he was hoisting on deck, and appeared
                    as if distressed on separation from their formidable comrade, who has never been
                    known, in his utmost voracity, to attack his friendly guides. What the instinct

                    animal. A shark ten feet long has been found to contain forty ova, three or four

                    has the fin along its under side, it gives the organ some resemblance to a fox’s

                    placed towards the middle of the back, and is rather large; the second is near

                    almost surrounding the neck. It is the gills of this species that have been

                    it has been captured in various parts of Scotland. They grow to thirty or
                    thirty-six feet or more, and are fishes of great strength, but are harmless,
                    indolent, and not very sensible to slight wounds. They often lie on the surface
                    of the water, with their large dorsal fin exposed, and permit the approach of
                    boats until the harpoon can be securely fixed in their bodies. They sometimes
                    appear in shoals, but more commonly in pairs; and enter the bays on the western
                    and northern shores of Britain in the months of June and July, but retire from
                    the land on the approach of cold weather. The liver of a full-grown fish has
                    been known to afford eight barrels of fine oil; and on this account the basking

                        borealis.</hi> It wants the anal fin, but has the temporal orifices. It
                    grows to the length of twelve or fourteen feet, and is six or eight in
                    circumference. Scoresby mentions the singular appendages which he invariably
                    found attached to the cornea of this animal. Some have supposed them to be
                    parasitic animals. If so, it is singular that they should be so uniformly in the
                    same position, and <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the same size, about one or two
                    inches long, and cleft at their fore extremity into two parts. This shark is
                    peculiarly attracted by a dead whale, out of which it scoops at once masses of
                    blubber as large as a man’s head. The sailors believe this species to be blind,
                    from its returning to feed on its favourite morsel, even after having a flensing
                    knife run through its body; but this only shows its fondness for whale
                    blubber,—to which circumstance we may also attribute the comparative safety of
                    Greenland sailors who have fallen into the water when flensing the whale. But,
                    if we may credit Fabricius, when this delectable food is not present, he will

                    extended laterally into two arms, at the extremity of which are the eyes, giving
                    to the animal the form of a hammer. The mouth is below' the centre of this

                    being composed of two projections of the muzzle, which stretch sidewise, and
                    unite with the pectorals. The space between these last and the head is entirely
                    filled with the very extraordinary electric apparatus first accurately described
                    by John Hunter. It consists of irregular columns, varying from one and a half
                    inch to one fourth of an inch in length by 0∙2 broad. They are irregular
                    hexagons or pentagons, reaching from surface to surface of the fish, and forming
                    (in that dissected by Hunter) an electric organ five inches long, varying in
                    breadth from three to about one and a half inches. Their number on both sides is
                    about 940 in a small fish; but in a large one there were 2364. Their coats are
                    thin and transparent; they are horizontally divided by thin partitions, so
                    numerous that one inch of these columns contained 150 dissepiments filled with
                    fluid. This curious apparatus is supplied with numerous nerves from the eighth
                    pair. The columns are firmly united by cellular substance. When the skin
                    covering this apparatus is touched, the person receives a violent shock at each
                    contact; and it is probable that in this way the species stuns its prey. The
                    animal can give the shock at pleasure; but if often reiterated, the shocks are
                    weakened, until the nervous energy of the fish is recruited by rest. This animal
                    electricity is conducted and intercepted by the same substances that conduct and
                    intercept ordinary artificial electricity. Wehere figure <hi rend="italic"

                            seen one, the smallest of three, which swam round about the vessel,
                            about twenty-five feet long and more than thirty wide; and Sonnini

                <p part="N">The suckers, as far as their skeleton is concerned, are the most
                    imperfect of all vertebrate animals. The bodies of all their vertebrae are
                    traversed by a single tendinous cord, uniformly tapering from head to tail,
                    which almost reduces the vertebrae to cartilaginous rings, scarcely distinct
                    from one another, and not even cartilaginous through tHeir whole circumference.
                    The body is terminated abruptly in front by a fleshy circular or semicircular
                    mouth, supported on a cartilaginous ring formed by the union of the palatal and
                    maxillary bones. No ribs are distinguishable: there are no solid branchial
                    arches; but the small branchial rays, scarcely recognisable in <hi rend="italic"

                    sacs, from the union of each gill with that adjacent. The labyrinth is enclosed
                    in the cranium, the nostrils have only a single aperture, in front of which is a
                    cul-de-sac, mistaken by some authors for a temporal orifice. The intestine is

                    The tongue is furnished with two longitudinal ranges of small teeth, and is
                    capable of vigorous motion. The tongue acting like a piston in the circular
                    mouth, is an essential part of the mechanism by which the fish is enabled to
                    attach itself firmly to stones, or to fasten itself to the larger fishes, which
                    it is thus enabled to suck and devour at its leisure. In respiration, the water
                    is carried from the mouth to the gills by a canal under the gullet, and pierced
                    with lateral apertures. The dorsal fin is farther forward than the anus, and a

                    in particular performs the office of a piston in exhausting the mouth, so as to
                    enable them to adhere to other bodies, like the lamprey. The lips arc furnished
                    with eight cirrhi, and above is an aperture communicating with the mouth; the
                    body is nearly cylindrical, and terminates in a fin which surrounds the tail.
                    The intestine is simple, wide, and straight, as viewed externally; but it is
                    plaited within: the liver has two lobes: the eggs grow to a considerable size.
                    When taken and confined in a large glass jar, a single fish will pour so much
                    mucus from its lateral pores as to give the water the appearance of jelly.</p>
                <p part="N">Three species are known, which Cuvier makes the types of a corresponding
                    number of sub-genera, as follows:</p>

                        Dom-beyi,</hi> found on the coast of South America by Dombey. It has a
                    rounded head; the teeth are sharp, and arranged in two rows, respectively of
                    fourteen and twenty-two, and with one longer than the rest in the upper part of
                    the mouth; tail rounded at the extremity, and terminated by a very shallow
                    fin.</p>

                    Bloch. The intervals of the branchial rays open into a common canal for each
                    side, and these two canals terminate in two apertures under the heart of the
                    animal, about one third of its length from the head.</p>
                <p part="N">The only known species is the European <hi rend="italic">Myxine</hi><hi

                <p part="N">We have now brought our exposition ef the modern system of Ichthyology
                    to a close. The subjects of which it treats are of deep and sustaining interest,
                    in a philosophical point of view, and of the highest and most immediate
                    importance when considered in relation to the economical advantages derivable by
                    the human race. W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> e have endeavoured to combine
                    with the precise and technical expression of the generic and other characters
                    such miscellaneous information as could be collected from authentic sources,
                    with a view to render the subject more palatable to the general reader ;—and if
                    any great deficiency in that department is observable, we hope it may in some
                    measure be attributed to the nature of this branch of natural history, the
                    objects of which inhabiting another element from ourselves, have thus their
                    on-goings too often veiled from mortal sight by a “world of waters,” —which no
                    eye can pierce but the eye of <hi rend="smallcaps">Him</hi> who called the light
                    out of darkness, and who created the “heavens and the earth, the sea, and all
                    that in them is.”</p>
                <p part="N">We shall conclude with a brief allusion to a subject of the highest
                    interest to the naturalist,—one to which we believe no reference has been made
                    in the introductory portion of the present treatise, and which, we regret, our
                    now exhausted space must prevent us from exhibiting at greater length,—we mean
                    the <hi rend="italic">geographical distribution</hi> of fishes. Our knowledge of
                    the laws which regulate that distribution is meagre in the extreme; in other
                    words, the facts concerning their true localities are few, and have never been
                    properly generalised. From the immeasurable extent and continuous nature of the
                    fluid which they inhabit, they are supplied by nature with greater facilities of
                    dispersion than most other animals; and the greater equality of the temperature
                    of water, compared with that ot earth or air, admits in several instances of the
                    same species inhabiting almost every latitude from pole to pole. Those races
                    especially, which, travelling together in vast shoals, speedily consume the
                    natural food which each particular spot affords, are obliged, like the pastoral
                    tribes of old, or the woodland hunters of America, to remove from place to place
                    in search of additional supplies; and thus the species acquires a more widely
                    extended distribution. It is thus that the cod and herring are spread over the
                    whole extent of the Northern Ocean, and in undiminished numbers, notwithstanding
                    the war of extermination which man and other voracious animals appear to wage
                    against them. Those species which lead a solitary, and, as it may be called, a
                    stationary life, are frequently confined within very narrow limits. The
                    Chaetodons, for example, which delight in rocky coasts covered with madrepores,
                    attach themselves to the torrid zone, which produces so abundantly those
                    magnificent ornaments of the sea. But though thus confined to particular spots,
                    from which the individuals of the species seldom wander, the species itself may
                    be said to be repeated again in different regions, separated from each other by
                    almost insurmountable obstacles. Thus many of what may be termed stationary
                    species are found identically the same along the coasts of Brazil, in the
                    Arabian Gulf, and over the multiplied shores of Polynesia. It has hence been
                    concluded, that such species, incapable of colonizing themselves by leaving
                    their accustomed shores, and hazarding a journey across unknown oceans, have
                    either been created in more places than one, or have been enabled to transport
                    themselves by means different from any of those that are now available in the
                    ordinary course of nature.</p>
                <p part="N">If the natural means by which the more powerful species inhabiting the
                    saline waters of the ocean have spread themselves from clime to dime, be to a
                    certain extent within the reach of our comprehension, it is otherwise with those
                    peculiar to rivers, and the waters of inland lakes. How these have contrived to
                    migrate from one region to another, and to people with identical species the
                    depth of far-removed and solitary waters, separated from each other by chains of
                    lofty mountains, or wide extended wastes of desert sand, is a problem which, in
                    the present state of our knowledge, we seek in vain to solve. It may indeed at
                    times happen that spawn or ova are carried by water-fowl <pb break="no"

                    suffices to account for the general diffusion of certain species, and still less
                    for the narrow restriction of others equally exposed to the chances of that
