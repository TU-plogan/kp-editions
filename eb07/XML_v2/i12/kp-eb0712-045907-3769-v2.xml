                    Some suppose her to be the same as Io, who was changed into a cow, and restored
                    to her human form in Egypt, where she taught agriculture, and governed the
                    people with mildness and equity, for which reasons she received divine honours
                    after death. According to some tarditions mentioned by Plutarch, Isis married
                    her brother Osiris, and was pregnant by him even before she had left her
                    mother’s womb. These two ancient deities, as some authors observe, comprehended
                    all nature and all the gods of the heathens. Isis was the Venus of Cyprus, the
                    Minerva of Athens, the Cybele of the Phrygians, the Ceres of Eleusis, the
                    Proserpine of Sicily, the Diana of Crete, and the Bellona of the Romans. Osiris
                    and Isis reigned conjointly in Egypt; but the rebellion of Typhon, the brother
                    of Osiris, proved fatal to this sovereign. The ox and the cow were the symbols
                    of Osiris and Isis; because these deities, whilst on earth, had diligently
                    applied themselves to the cultivating of the earth. Since Isis was supposed to
                    be the moon, as Osiris was the sun, she was represented as holding a globe in
                    her hand, with a vessel full of ears of corn. The Egyptians believed that the
                    yearly and regular inundations of the Nile proceeded from the abundant tears
                    which Isis shed for the loss of Osiris, whom Typhon had basely murdered. The
                    word <hi rend="italic">Isis,</hi> according to some, signifies “ancient,” and on
                    that account the inscriptions on the statues of the goddess were often in these
                    words: “I am all that has been, that shall be; and none amongst mortals has
                    hitherto taken off my veil.” The worship of Isis was universal in Egypt, and her
                    priests were obliged to observe perpetual chastity; their heads were closely
                    shaved, and they always walked barefooted, and clothed themselves in linen
                    garments. They never ate onions, they abstained from salt with their meat, and
                    they were forbidden to eat the flesh of sheep and of hogs. During the night they
                    were employed in continual devotion near the statue of the goddess. Cleopatra,
                    the beautiful queen of Egypt, was wont to dress herself like this goddess, and
                    affected to be called a second Isis.</p>
                <p part="N">Isis, or <hi rend="italic">Thames,</hi> a river that takes its rise in
                    Gloucestershire, and flows through only a small part of Wiltshire. It enters
                    this county near its source, and begins to be navigable for boats at Cricklade;
                    but after running in a serpentine manner about four miles, it leaves
                    Gloucestershire at a village called Castle Eaton.</p>
