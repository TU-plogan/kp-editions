                    Calabria, a province of the south of Italy, to the east of Tarentum, born 239
                    before Christ, in the consulship of Q. Valerius Falto and C. Mamilius Turrinus.
                    Descended from one of the petty princes who ruled over this portion of Italy, he
                    had inherited nothing from them except the barren nobility of blood. His early
                    years, if not spent in the eamp, must at least have been disturbed by rumours of
                    war and threatened invasion. The inroad of Hannibal, 218 before Christ, and the
                    fearful struggle which ensued between the two powerful nations of Rome and
                    Carthage, eould scarcely have taken place without extending its shock to the
                    most remote villages of Italy. In the earlier period of the contest, we are
                    ignorant of the side to which Ennius adhered; but we find him, in 204 before
                    Christ, when he was thirty-five years of age, serving as a soldier in Sardinia,
                    with such distinction as to attract the notice of Cato the elder, at that time
                    commander of the island. By him he was brought to Rome, where his high character
                    and literary attainments introduced him to the acquaintance of the most
                    distinguished characters of that eity. Scipio Africanus the elder became his
                    intimate friend. At Rome he seems to have employed his time in extending the
                    knowledge of the Greek language amongst the younger branches of the nobility.
                    Even Cato did not disdain to become his pupil; and the example which he thus set
                    no doubt tended much to divert the minds of his countrymen towards pursuits of a
                    more refined and intellectual character than had hitherto engaged their
                    attention. His genius procured him the freedom of the city, an honour which had
                    not yet become worthless from an indiscriminate distinction. He passed into
                    AEtolia, in 183 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> with the consul Fulvius, to
                    whose care the war in that country was intrusted; and he no doubt seized this
                    opportunity of visiting the various states of Greece. He seems, however, to have
                    returned to Rome, where he died of the gout in 169 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                        c.,</hi> in the seventieth year of his age. Scipio, before he died, had
                    expressed a wish that their bodies should rest in the same grave; and wc know
                    that a statue was erected to his honour on the tomb of the Scipios.</p>
                <p part="N">Ennius must be considered as the father of Roman epic poetry; and the
                    eminent services which he performed for the literature of Rome were fully
                    appreciated by ancient writers. Throughout his works there ran a strain of noble
                    and passionate feeling. The language, though sometimes rough and unpolished, was
                    full of power, and even of sublimity. The structure of the verse was more
                    regular, from the introduction of hexameters, than that in which his
                    predecessors had sung. The principal work, from which we have numerous
                    fragments, was the <hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi> an eρie poem in eighteen
                    books, in which Ennius sang the <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> history of Rome,
                    from its foundation till his own times. In another work, written in catalectic
                    tetrameter, he celebrated the deeds of the elder Scipio. Besides, he had
                    composed satires and other minor poems, which seem, however, to have been rather
                    translations from the Greek writers: <hi rend="italic">Edesphagetica</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Phagetica,</hi> in
                    hexameters, a gastronomie poem after the Greek of Arehestratus; several
                    epigrams; <hi rend="italic">Epicharmus,</hi> a didactic poem on the nature of
                    things, in trocheesand hexameters, from the Greek of Epicharmus; <hi
                        rend="italic">Prοtrepticus,</hi> of a moral nature; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Preecepta,</hi> perhaps the same as the preceding; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Asotus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sotadicus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    also a Latin prose translation of the well-known Greek work of Euhemerus on the
                    Gods; and perhaps in prose, a work on the Rape of the Sabines.</p>

                <p part="N">His tragedies seem to have been generally composed in imitation of the
                    Greek dramatic writers, AEschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and others. Those whose
                    titles have been preserved to us are the following: Medea, Iphigenia (after
                    Euripides), Achilles, Ajax (after Sophocles), Telamon, Hectoris Lustra,
                    Alexander, Andromache, Hecuba, Eumenides (after AEschylus), Dulorestes,
                    Erechtheus, Cres-phon, Athamas, Andromeda, Telephas, Thyestes, Phoenix,
                    Melanippa, Alcmaeon, Cressae, Alcestis, Nemea, Ilione or Polydorus, and Antiope.
                    The fragments of several of his comedies which have been preserved are,
                    Amphithraso, Ambracia, Pancratiastes. The fragments of Ennius were published by
                    Columna (at Naples 1590), and again in the <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Poetarum</hi> by Hesselius (4to, Amstel. 1707). The fragments
                    of the Annals were collected and published by P.Merula(Lugdun. Bat. 1595),and by
                    Spangenberg (Leipsic, 1825). The tragedy of Medea was published in part, with a
                    selection of other fragments, and a learned commentary, by H. Μ. Plauck
                    (Hanover, 1807, 4to).</p>
