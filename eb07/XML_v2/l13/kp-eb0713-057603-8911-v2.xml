                <p part="N"><label type="entry">LOVE</label>, in the enlarged sense of the word,
                    denotes all those affections of the pleasing kind which objects and incidents
                    excite in our minds. Thus we are said to <hi rend="italic">love</hi> not only
                    intelligent agents of morally good dispositions, but also sensual pleasures,
                    riches, and honours.</p>
                <p part="N">But <hi rend="italic">love,</hi> in its usual and more appropriate
                    signification, may be defined, “that affection which, being compounded of animal
                    desire, esteem, and benevolence, becomes the bond of attachment and union
                    between individuals of the different sexes, and makes them enjoy in the society
                    of each other a species of happiness which they experience nowhere else.” We
                    call it an <hi rend="italic">affection</hi> rather than a <hi rend="italic"
                        >passion,</hi> because it involves a desire of the happiness of its object;
                    and that its constituent parts are such as have just been enumerated we shall
                    first endeavour to prove, and then proceed to trace its rise and progress from a
                    selfish appetite to a generous sentiment.</p>
                <p part="N">Mere animal desire has nothing in view but the species and the sex of
                    its object; and before it makes a selection, it must be combined with sentiments
                    very different from itself. The first sentiment with which it is combined, and
                    by which a man is induced to prefer one woman to another, seems to be that by
                    which we are delighted with gracefulness of person, regularity of features, and
                    beauty of complexion. It is not indeed to be denied that there is something
                    irresistible in female beauty. The most severe will not pretend that they do not
                    feel an immediate prepossession in favour of a handsome woman; but this
                    prepossession, even when combined with animal desire, does not constitute the
                    whole of that affection which is called <hi rend="italic">love.</hi> Savages
                    feel the influence of the sensual appetite, and it is extremely probable that
                    they have some ideas of beauty; but amongst savages the affection of love is
                    seldom known. Even amongst the lower orders of society it seems to be a very
                    gross passion, and to have in it more of the selfishness of appetite than of the
                    generosity of esteem. To these observations many exceptions will no doubt be
                        found;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p part="N">Such

                    body of the labouring poor, who, in the choice of their mates, do not study, and
                    indeed are incapable of studying, that rectitude of mind, and those delicacies
                    of sentiment, without which neither man nor woman can deserve to be
                    esteemed.</p>
                <p part="N">In the savage state, and even in the first stages of refinement, the
                    bond of union between the sexes seems to consist of nothing more than mere
                    animal desire and instinctive tenderness for their infant progeny. The former
                    impels them to unite for the propagation of the species, and the latter
                    preserves the union until the children who are the fruit of it be able to
                    provide for their own subsistence. That in such unions, whether casual or
                    permanent, there is little mutual esteem and benevolence, is apparent from the
                    state of subjection in which women are held in rude and uncultivated nations, as
                    well as from the manner in which marriages are contracted.</p>
                <p part="N">Sweetness of temper, a capital article with us in the female character,
                    displays itself externally in mild looks and gentle manners, and is the first
                    and perhaps the most powerful inducement to love in a cultivated mind. “But such
                    graces,” says Lord Kames, “are scarce discernible in a female savage, and even
                    in the most polished woman would not be perceived by a male savage. Among
                    savages, strength and boldness are the only valuable qualities. In these,
                    females are miserably deficient; for which reason they are contemned by the
                    males, as beings of an inferior order. The North American tribes glory in
                    idleness; the drudgery of labour degrades a man in their opinion, and is proper
                    for women only. To join young persons in marriage is accordingly the business of
                    the parents; and it would be unpardonable meanness in the bridegroom to show any
                    fondness for the bride. In Guiana a woman never eats with her husband, but after
                    every meal attends him with water for washing; and in the Caribbee islands she
                    is not even permitted to eat in the presence of her husband. Dampier observes in
                    general, that among all the wild nations with which he was acquainted, the women
                    carry the burdens, while the men walk before and carry nothing but their arms;
                    and that women even of the highest rank are not better treated. In Siberia, and
                    even in Russia, the capital excepted, men, till very lately, treated their wives
                        <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208924?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-8924-0577"/> in every respect like slaves. It might indeed
                    be thought that animal desire, were there nothing else, should have 'raised
                    women to some degree of estimation among men; but male savages, utter strangers
                    to decency and refinement, gratify animal desire with as little ceremony as they
                    do hunger or thirst. Hence it was that in the early ages of society a man
                    purchased a woman to be his wife, as one purchases an ox or a sheep to be food;
                    and valued her only as she contributed to his sensual gratification.”</p>
                <p part="N">But if amongst savages and the vulgar, love be unknown, it cannot
                    possibly be an instinctive affection; and therefore it may be asked how it gets
                    possession of the human heart, and by what means we can judge whether in any
                    particular instance it be real or imaginary. These questions are of importance,
                    and deserve to be fully answered, though many circumstances conspire to render
                    it no easy task to give to them such answers as may be perfectly satisfactory.
                    Love can subsist only between individuals of the different sexes. A man can
                    hardly love two women at the same time; and we believe that a woman is still ess
                    capable of loving at once more than one man. Love, therefore, has a natural
                    tendency to make men and women pair, or, in other words, it is the source of
                    marriage; jut in polished society, where alone this affection has any )lace, so
                    many things besides mutual attachment are ne- &gt;essary to make the married
                    life comfortable, that we rare-y see young persons uniting from the impulse of
                    love, and ιavc therefore but few opportunities of tracing the rise, )rogrcss,
                    and consequences of the affection. We shall, ιowcver, throw together such
                    reflections as have occurred ,o us on the subject, not without indulging a hope
                    that hey may be useful to the younger part of our readers vhen forming the most
                    important connexion in life.</p>
                <p part="N">Wc have said that the perception of beauty, combined vith animal desire,
                    is the first inducement which a man :an have to prefer one woman to another. It
                    may be ιdded, that elegance of figure, a placid masculine counte-ιance, with a
                    person which indicates strength and agility, .re the qualities which first tend
                    to attach any woman to I particular man. Beauty has been defined by Buffier, í
                    that particular form which is the most common of all articular forms to be met
                    with in the same species of seings.” Let us apply this definition to our own
                    species, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> nd try, by means of it, to ascertain
                    what constitutes the ⅛eauty of the human face. It is evident, that of
                    countenances we find a number almost infinite of different forms; ∣f which,
                    however, one only constitutes beauty, whilst the est, however numerous,
                    constitute what is not beauty, ut deformity or ugliness. To an attentive
                    observer, .owcver, it is evident, that of the numerous particular jrms of
                    ugliness, there is not one which includes so many ices as are formed after that
                    particular cast which con-titutes beauty. Every particular species of the animal
                    s well as the vegetable creation may be said to have a xed or determinate form,
                    to which, as to a centre, nature ∣L continually inclining. Or it may be compared
                    to pen- .ulums vibrating in different directions over one central oint; and as
                    they all cross the centre, though only one l asses through any other point, so
                    it will be found i hat perfect beauty is oftener produced by nature than
                    eformity; we do not mean than deformity in general, ut than any one kind and
                    degree of deformity. To ini tance in a particular part of a human feature; the
                    line ∕hich forms the ridge of the nose is deemed beautiful I /hen it is
                    straight; but this is likewise the central form, I zhich is oftener found than
                    any one particular degree of i oncave, convex, or any other irregular form that
                    may be I imposed. As we are then more accustomed to beauty han deformity, we may
                    conclude that that is the reason zhy we approve and admire it, just as we
                    approve and admire fashions or dress for no other reason than that we are used
                    to them. The same thing may be said of colour as of form. It is custom alone
                    which determines our preference of the colour of the Europeans to that of the
                    Ethiopians, and which makes them prefer their own colour to ours; so that though
                    habit and custom cannot be the cause of beauty, they are certainly the cause of
                    our liking it.</p>
                <p part="N">That we do like it cannot be denied. Every one is conscious of a
                    pleasing emotion when contemplating beauty either in man or woman; and when that
                    pleasure is combined with the gratification of the sensual appetite, it is
                    obvious that the sum of enjoyment must be greatly increased. The perception of
                    beauty, therefore, necessarily directs the energy of the sensual appetite to a
                    particular object; but still this combination is a mere selfish feeling, which
                    regards its object only as the best of many similar instruments of pleasure.
                    Before it can deserve the name of love, it must be combined with esteem, which
                    is never bestowed but upon moral character and internal worth; for let a woman
                    be ever so beautiful, and of course ever so desirable as an instrument of
                    sensual gratification, if she be not possessed of the virtues and dispositions
                    which are peculiar to her sex, she will inspire no man with a generous
                    affection. With regard to the outlines, indeed, whether of internal disposition
                    or of external form, men and women are the same; but nature, intending them for
                    mates, has given them dispositions which, though concordant, are however
                    different, so as to produce together delicious harmony. « The man, more robust,
                    is fitted for severe labour, and for field exercise; the woman, more delicate,
                    is fitted for sedentary occupations, and particularly for nursing children. The
                    man, bold and vigorous, is qualified for being a protector; the woman, delicate
                    and timid, requires protection. Hence it is that a man never admires a woman for
                    possessing bodily strength or personal courage; and women always despise men who
                    are totally destitute of these qualities. The man, as a protector, is directed
                    by nature to govern; the woman, conscious of inferiority, is disposed to obey.
                    Their intellectual powers correspond to the destination of nature. Men have
                    penetration and solid judgment to fit them for governing, women have sufficient
                    understanding to make a decent figure under a good government; a greater portion
                    would excite dangerous rivalship between the sexes, which nature has avoided by
                    giving them different talents. Women have more imagination and sensibility than
                    men, which make all their enjoyments more exquisite; at the same time that they
                    are better qualified to communicate enjoyment. Add another capital difference of
                    disposition: The gentle and insinuating manners of the female sex tend to soften
                    the roughness of the other sex; and wherever women are indulged with any
                    freedom, they polish sooner than men.</p>
                <p part="N">“These are not the only particulars that distinguish the sexes. With
                    respect to the ultimate end of love, it is the privilege of the male, as
                    superior and protector, to make a choice; the female preferred has no privilege
                    but barely to consent or to refuse. Whether this distinction be the immediate
                    result of the originally different dispositions of the sexes, or only the effect
                    of associations inevitably formed, may be questioned; but among all nations it
                    is the practice for men to court, and for women to be courted; and were the most
                    beautiful woman on earth to invert this practice, she would forfeit the esteem,
                    however by her external grace she might excite the desire, of the man whom she
                    addressed. The great moral virtues which may be comprehended under the general
                    term integrity, are all absolutely necessary to make either men or women
                    estimable; but to procure esteem to the female character, the modesty peculiar
                    to their sex is a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208937?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-8937-0578"/>very essential circumstance. Nature hath
                    provided them with it as a defence against the artful solicitations of the other
                    sex before marriage, and’also as a support of conju-</p>
                <p part="N">A woman, therefore, whose dispositions are gentle, delicate, and rather
                    timid than bold, who is possessed of a large share of sensibility and modesty,
                    and whose manners are soft and insinuating, must, upon moral principles, command
                    the esteem and benevolence of every individual of the other sex who is possessed
                    of sound understanding; but if her person be deformed, or not such as to excite
                    some degree of animal desire, she will attract no man’s love. In like manner, a
                    man whose moral character is good, whose understanding is acute, and whose
                    conversation is instructive, must command the esteem of every sensible and
                    virtuous woman; but if his figure be disagreeable, his manner unpolished, his
                    habits slovenly, and, above all, if he be deficient in personal courage, he will
                    hardly excite desire in the female breast. It is only when the qualities which
                    command esteem are, in the same person, united with those which excite desire,
                    that the individual so accomplished can be an object of love to one of the other
                    sex; but when these qualities are thus united, each of them increases the other
                    in the imagination of the lover. The beauty of his mistress gives her, in his
                    apprehension, a greater share of gentleness, modesty, and every thing which
                    adorns the female character, than perhaps she really possesses; whilst his
                    persuasion of her internal worth makes him, on the other hand, apprehend her
                    beauty to be absolutely unrivalled.</p>
                <p part="N">To this theory an objection readily offers itself, which it is incumbent
                    upon us to obviate. Men and women sometimes fall in love at first sight, and
                    very often before they have opportunities of forming a just estimate of each
                    other’s moral character. How is this circumstance to be reconciled with the
                    progressive generation of love? We answer, by an association of ideas, which is
                    formed upon principles of physiognomy. Every passion and habitual disposition of
                    mind gives a particular cast to the countenance, and is apt to discover itself
                    in some feature of the face. This we learn by experience; and in time, without
                    any effort of our own, the idea of each particular cast of countenance comes to
                    be so closely associated in our minds with the internal disposition which it
                    indicates, that the one can never afterwards be presented to our view without
                    instantly suggesting the other to the imagination. Hence it is that every man,
                    who has been accustomed to make observations, naturally forms to himself, from
                    the features and lineaments of a stranger’s face, some opinion of his character
                    and fortune. We are no sooner presented to a person for the first time, than we
                    are immediately impressed with the idea of a proud, a reserved, an affable, or a
                    good-natured man; and upon our going into a company of absolute strangers, our
                    benevolence or aversion, our awe or contempt, rises instantly towards particular
                    persons, before we have heard them speak a word, or know so much as their names
                    or designations. The same thing happens when we are presented to the fair sex.
                    If a woman, seen for the first time, have that particular cast of countenance,
                    and that expression of features, with which we have associated notions of
                    gentleness, modesty, and other female virtues, she instantly commands our
                    esteem; and if she have likewise so much beauty as to make her an object of
                    particular desire, esteem and desire become suddenly combined, and that
                    combination constitutes the affection of love. Such, too, is the nature of all
                    mental associations, that each part of which they are composed adds strength and
                    vividness to the other parts; so that, in the present instance, desire makes us
                    imagine virtues in the woman which her countenance perhaps does not indicate,
                    and the virtues which are there actually visible make us apprehend her beauty as
                    more perfect than it is.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Love,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Medicine.</hi> The
                    symptoms produced by this passion as a disease, according to medical writers,
                    are various. The eyelids often twinkle; the eyes are hollow, and yet appear as
                    if full with pleasure; the pulse is not peculiar to the passion, but the same
                    with that which attends solicitude and care. When the object of this affection
                    is thought of, particularly if the id¾a be sudden, the spirits are confused, the
                    pulse changes, and its force and time are very variable. In some instances, the
                    person is sad and watchful; in others, the person, not being conscious of his
                    state, pines away, is slothful, and regardless of food; though the wiser, when
                    they find themselves in love, seek pleasant company and active entertainments.
                    As the force of love prevails, sighs grow deeper; a tremor affects the heart and
                    pulse; the countenance is alternately pale and red; the voice is suppressed in
                    the fauces; the eyes grow dim; cold sweats break out; sleep absents itself, at
                    least until the morning; the secretions become disturbed; and a loss of
                    appetite, a hectic fever, melancholy, or perhaps madness, if not death,
                    constitutes the catastrophe. (On this subject the curious may consult AEgineta,
                    lib. iii. 17; Oribat. <hi rend="italic">Synoη.</hi> lib. viii. cap. 9; ora
                    treatise on Love as a distemper, by John Ferrard, Oxford, 1640.)</p>
                <p part="N">The manners of the Greeks and Romans were similar to each other in the
                    affairs of love. They generally made a discovery of their passion by writing
                    upon trees, walls, doors, and other places, the name of their beloved. They
                    usually decked the door of their dulcinea with flowers and garlands, and made
                    libations of wine before their houses, sprinkling the posts with the same
                    liquor, as if the object of their affection was a real goddess. For a man’s
                    garland to be untied, and for a woman to compose a garland, were held to be
                    indubitable indications of love.</p>
                <p part="N">When their love was without success, they used several arts to excite
                    affection in the object of their desire. They had recourse to enchantresses, of
                    whom the Thessalian were in the highest estimation. The means made use of were
                    most commonly philtres or love potions, the operation of which was violent and
                    dangerous, and frequently deprived such as drank them of their reason. Some of
                    the most remarkable ingredients of which they were composed were the hippomanes,
                    the jynx, insects bred from putrefaction, the fish remora, the lizard, the
                    brains of a calf, the hairs on the tip of a wolf’s tail, his secret parts, the
                    bones of the left side of a toad eaten with ants, the blood of doves, the bones
                    of snakes, feathers of screech-owls, twisted cords of wool in which a person had
                    hanged himself, rags, torches, reliques, a nest of swallows buried and famished
                    in the earth, bones snatched from hungry bitches, the marrow of a boy famished
                    in the midst of plenty, dried human liver; to which may be added several herbs
                    growing out of putrid substances. Such were the ingredients that entered into
                    the composition of that infernal draught called a love potion.</p>
                <p part="N">But, besides the philtres, various other arts were used to excite love;
                    in which the application of certain substances was to have a magical influence
                    on the person against whom they levelled their skill. A hyena’s udder worn under
                    the left arm, they fancied would draw the affections of whatever woman they
                    fixed their eyes upon. That species of olives called <hi rend="italic"
                        >μιτυξα,</hi> and barley-bran made into a paste, and thrown into the fire,
                    they thought would excite the passion of love. Flour was used with the same
                    intention; and burning laurel, and melted wax, were supposed to have a similar
                    effect. When one heart was to be hardened and another mollified, clay and wax
                    were exposed to the fire together. Images of wax were frequently used,
                    representing the persons on whom they wished to <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193208950?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8950-0579"/>make an
                    impression; and whatever was done to the substitute of wax, they imagined was
                    felt by the person represented. Enchanted medicaments were often sprinkled upon
                    some part of the house where the person resided. Love-pledges were supposed to
                    be of singular use and efficacy; these they placed under the threshold, to
                    preserve the affections of the owner from wandering. Love-knots were also of
                    singular power, and the number three was particularly observed in all they did.
                    But no good effect was expected if the use of these things had not been attended
                    with charms or magical verses and forms of words.</p>
                <p part="N">Having mentioned their arts of exciting love, it may not be amiss to
                    take notice that the ancients imagined that love excited by magic might be
                    allayed by more powerful spells and medicaments, or by application to demons
                    more powerful than those who had been concerned in raising that passion. But
                    love inspired without magic had no sure; Apollo himself could find no remedy,
                    but exclaimed, “Hei mihi quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis.” The antidotes
                    against love were generally, <hi rend="italic">agnus castus,</hi> which ιas the
                    power of weakening the generative faculty; sprinkling the dust in which a mule
                    had rolled herself; tying toads in the hide of a beast newly slain; applying
                    amulets of minerals or herbs, which were supposed of great efficacy in other
                    cases; and invoking the assistance of the nferior deities. Another cure for love
                    was bathing in the waters of the river Selemnus; to which we may add, the
                    lover’s leap, or jumping down from the Leucadian promontory.</p>
