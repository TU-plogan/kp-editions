                    formed part of its northern portion, was parcelled out amongst twelve companies
                    of London tradesmen, by whom, or their representatives, the greater part of it
                    is still held. Their names are the drapers, salters, vintners, mercers,
                    ironmongers, merchant tailors, cloth-workers, haberdashers, fishmongers,
                    grocers, goldsmiths, and skinners, forming together a body or corporation called
                    the Irish Society. It is now divided into the baronies of Coleraine, Kenaught,
                    Loughinsholin,and Tyrkerrin, together with the liberties of Londonderry and
                    Coleraine, which have separate jurisdictions. In this arrangement it is
                    remarkable that each of the two latter divisions is situated beyond what may be
                    deemed the natural boundaries of the county, the former lying west of the river
                    Foyle, and the latter east of the river Bann. These greater divisions are
                    subdivided into thirty-five parishes, twenty-seven of which are in the diocese
                    of Derry, five in that of Armagh, and three in that of Connor.</p>
                <p part="N">The diocese of Derry is much larger, both as to number of parishes and
                    extent of surface, than the county, comprehending, besides the twenty-seven
                    parishes above named as being within the civil boundary, ten in Donegal, eleven
                    in Tyrone, and part of a parish in Antrim. By a curious anomaly, the
                    ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the parishes in the liberties of Coleraine
                    belongs to the Bishop of Down and Connor. The seat of the see is in the city of
                    Derry, where is the cathedral, a building in the Gothic style, erected in 1633.
                    The chapter consists of a dean, an archdeacon, and three prebendaries.</p>
                <p part="N">The neighbourhood of the great Western Ocean, and the height of the
                    mountain ranges, which either intersect or skirt the county, may account for the
                    fall of a considerable quantity of rain; yet the popular notion of the peculiar
                    wetness of the climate here arises more from the frequency of showers than from
                    the amount of water discharged by them. The maximum annual quantity of rain,
                    during a period of seven years, did not amount to thirty-five inches, the
                    minimum twenty-five inches. The average of rain taken during a period of seven
                    years here and at Keswick in Cumberland, and Kendal in Westmoreland, exhibits
                    the following results:</p>

                <p part="N">Neither does it appear that the north-west wind, so prevalent here,
                    however unfavourable to vegetable, is at all injurious to animal life. On the
                    contrary, the most remarkable instances of longevity have been found on the
                    coast, and in the peninsula of Magilligan. Several instances have occurred of
                    the extension of human life to ninety and even to a hundred and ten years.</p>
                <p part="N">The surface of the county presents an appearance of valleys separated
                    from each other by ridges of rugged, but not very elevated mountains, and
                    expanding, as they approach the coast, into alluvial plains. The most elevated
                    of the mountains are, Sawel, 2236 feet high; Slieve Gallen, 1730 feet;
                    Cairntogher, 1521 feet; Donald’s Hill, 1310 feet; Benyevenagh, 1262 feet; and
                    Legavannon, 1290 feet.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal river is the Roe, which, receiving as it flows in a
                    northerly direction the tributary streams of the Owenbeg, Owenmore, Gelvan,
                    Castle, and Curley, discharges itself into Lough Foyle; it is subject to sudden
                    and violent floods. The mud deposited near its mouth forms shifting banks, which
                    prevent it from being a useful port for small craft, otherwise the channel is
                    deep enough to be navigated for two miles by flat-bottomed barges. The Faghan
                    rises in the south, and discharges itself into Lough Foyle near Culmore. The
                    Moyola takes a south-eastern course, and falls into Lough Neagh. A small portion
                    only of the fine navigable river Foyle belongs to the county, passing in its
                    course through the liberties of Londonderry. It is navigable for vessels of
                    large burden as far as the city of Londonderry, and thence to Lifford in Donegal
                    for lighters of twenty tons. The Bann, from Lough Neagh, forms the eastern
                    boundary until it approaches Coleraine, where it separates the barony from the
                    liberties of the town. The navigation of this river is impeded by shoals, which
                    form a dangerous bar.</p>
                <p part="N">The valleys formed by these rivers, and their subordinate branches, are
                    called <hi rend="italic">slacks.</hi> That of the Faghan presents some scenery
                    that is peculiarly picturesque, as also does that called the slack of Feeny, a
                    pass which connects the valleys of the Faghan and the Roe. Several glens
                    discharge their streams into this slack; the most beautiful is that of Fin-Glen.
                    On the western side of the ridge of Benyevenagh there is a very uncommon surface
                    called a shaking quag, and also named the Gray Lough. It spreads over many
                    acres. Cattle can pass freely through it in summer, yet at every step the soil
                    yields to the pressure, communicating an undulating motion all around. The
                    surface is broken in every direction by pits full of water of unfathomable
                    depth, and all invariably rectangular parallelograms, very much resembling
                    tan-pits. The quag is surrounded by declivities on almost every side, and
                    therefore it is difficult to account for the cause of its retaining such a
                    quantity of water without any apparent supply. The structure of its margin,
                    formed of stratified substances covered with turf, may, however, account for the
                    retention of the water. There may have been a large lake here, which, by the
                    interlacing roots of the aquatic plants, is now covered with a kind of network
                    that supports the foot, except in places where the workings of the surface
                    produce a fissure. But the cause of this extraordinary regularity of shape in
                    the pits thus formed still remains without satisfactory explanation. The only
                    lake is Lough Finn, situated in the confines of Tyrone; it is of very
                        inconsiderable<pb break="no" facs="nls:193208586?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-8586-0551"/> dimensions. Lough Neagh touches the county in
                    a small portion of its south-eastern boundary. The small port of Ballyronan, in
                    the north-west angle of the lough, affords accommodation for sloops of sixty
                    tons to load and unload. The fine inlet of the Atlantic called Lough Foyle forms
                    the principal part of the western boundary. Having a narrow entrance, but with
                    ten fathoms of water, between Culmore Fort and Magilligan Point, it expands
                    itself into a gulf of fifteen miles in length and seven in breadth, with a
                    channel fourteen fathoms deep at low water, but of difficult navigation from its
                    great narrowness.</p>
                <p part="N">The soil in the northern part, along the sea-coast, is a stiff and
                    reddish clay, interspersed with knolls of basalt, and resting on a substratum of
                    white lime, which occasionally shows itself on the surface. Near the mouth of
                    the Roe is an extensive tract of a marly nature, formed of layers of ouze and
                    shells alternating to a depth of several feet. Fossil shells are frequently
                    found in the ditches. The lands lying between the loamy soil in the low grounds
                    and the higher wastes are either of a blue clay with fragments of quartz, slate,
                    and a shallow covering of peat moss, or a shingle of slate interspersed with red
                    ochreous sand or with gravel and loam. Above the lime is the region of the
                    basalt, and the soil is thenceforth without clay, being merely an oxide of the
                    softer parts of this ironstone, having neither cohesion nor strength, and
                    producing little but potatoes and straw. The country people significantly call
                    it draff land. Yet its summits are admirable as sheep walks; for, how high
                    soever the elevation of a basaltic mountain may be, if the immediate substratum
                    be of the fossil known by the name of zeolite trap, the soil is fertile and the
                    herbage sweet, presenting an elegant carpeting of shamrock, daisy, butter-cup,
                    and plantain, which is eagerly browsed on by sheep.</p>
                <p part="N">The valley of the Roe divides the county into two districts, totally
                    different in respect to their geological character. On the west lies the
                    territory of schist, on the east that of basalt, each accompanied with its
                    peculiar fossil organization. The prevalent species of schist is a kind of
                    flag-rock or schistose mica, next to which in quantity is the laminated schist
                    or flag, the dip of which is generally northwest. The great mountain of Sawel is
                    composed of several varieties of this rock, surmounted towards the summit by
                    amorphous whinstone, interspersed with blocks of quartz. Slieve Gallen is also a
                    mass of basalt, resting upon a bed of granite, which emerges from beneath in
                    various places. Limestone may be found everywhere, from the sea to Benbradagh.
                    The most remarkable cavern on the coast is in the white limestone; it is very
                    appropriately called the Robber’s Cave, having at one time been the asylum of a
                    formidable banditti. A species of blue limestone has been used for various
                    architectural purposes. Sandstone is universally found below the basalt, and is
                    occasionally intermingled with schist. A species of it, of a bright tawny
                    colour, not unlike to that of the Portland stone, is raised in large quantities
                    near Dungiven. Many of the principal buildings are constructed of it. Coal has
                    not yet been discovered in any quantities deserving of notice. Iron is found in
                    great abundance, either in an ochreous state, or mixed with manganese, when it
                    is known by the name of bog ore or woad. The base of Sawel is a mass of martial
                    pyrites mingled with schist. To the abundance of this metal in the peat moss is
                    to be attributed the red colour of the ashes, which are so heavy as to keep in
                    heaps even in a breeze of wind. The metal was formerly smelted, but the
                    operation has been ultimately relinquished as an unprofitable speculation.
                    Copper and lead, in small veins, have been discovered. Boate states that pure
                    gold had been found in a rivulet which discharges itself into Lough Neagh; but
                    the fact has not been substantiated by subsequent discoveries, further than that
                    some specimens of quartz have been observed to contain thin laminae of that
                    metal. Quartz and flint are common in all parts. The flint sometimes exhibits
                    marine impressions, the quartz never. As to crystals, they are of great variety.
                    Zeolite, in rose-cut surfaces, in points, and in thistledown, all beautiful, are
                    common in basalt. The rock-crystals are found exclusively in the schistose
                    regions. They are harder than those found in Kerry. In shape they are truncated
                    prisms of six sides and six facets, and weigh from two to twelve ounces. In all
                    the mountains composed of pyritic schist the streamlets show strong indications
                    of iron, to such a degree, indeed, that in some places the water is not fit for
                    drinking.</p>
                <p part="N">The population has increased progressively from the earliest period at
                    which any probable estimate of its amount was made, as appears by the statements

                <p part="N">In religious persuasion, the numbers stated in the latter of these
                    returns stand thus:—Of the Established Church 2446, Roman Catholics 4494,
                    Dissenters 6695, besides 255 whose religious tenets were not ascertained.
                    According to the same return, the number of schools was 380, out of which,
                    forty-nine, affording instruction to 3119 children, were supported by grants of
                    public money; fifty-three, affording instruction to 2748 children, were
                    maintained by the voluntary contributions of individuals or societies; whilst
                    the remaining 278 schools, in which 8023 children were educated, depended wholly
                    on the fees of the pupils. The diocesan school in the city affords the means of
                    liberal education to the sons of the gentry. It is an extensive and
                    well-conducted establishment. The endowment consists of a salary from the London
                    Society, and a subscription from the bishop and beneficed clergy. A mercantile
                    school in Coleraine has also been endowed by the same society.</p>
                <p part="N">The treatment of arable ground differs little from that generally
                    practised throughout the province. The principal crops are barley, oats, and
                    potatoes; the implements the Scotch and Irish ploughs; the manures sea-weed, and
                    composts of which it forms a part, near the coast, and lime and turf-mould in
                    the interior. In Magilligan, the mossy sands are alternately ploughed and laid
                    up in meadow. The fiorin grass springs up luxuriantly here. Amongst the more
                    uncommon species of grasses may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Parnassia
                        palustris,</hi> commonly called crottel, in Irish crou-tuil; when
                    manufactured, it produces the litmus, turnsolblue or archil. Extensive dairies
                    are uncommon; the care of milk and butter forms generally a part of the
                        domestic<pb break="no" facs="nls:193208599?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-8599-0552"/> economy of the working farmer. Sheep are
                    mostly brought in at fairs from other districts. There are no herds of goats in
                    the mountains, but individually they are found in many of the habitations of the
                    cottiers. Magilligan contains a very large rabbit-warren, extending over 1500
                    acres. The annual number of skins sent out of it is 2000; they are sold by
                    auction to the Dublin hatters. The poultry are large. Geese are both large and
                    abundant. They fatten in summer on the vetches and tares which abound in the
                    bottoms, in autumn on the stubble, and in winter on the potato-ridge. Wild and
                    sea fowl are abundant. The county was once remarkable for the quantity of honey
                    it produced; latterly the produce has decreased.</p>
                <p part="N">The linen manufacture is the staple here, and contributes greatly to the
                    comfortable support of the population. The yarn and linen are generally of a
                    coarser staple than in the neighbouring county of Antrim. Sacking is made of the
                    tow-yarn. Potteries, in which the coarser kinds of earthenware are manufactured,
                    are carried on in some places. There are several large distilleries and
                    breweries, and some salt-works. One of the most productive salmon-fisheries in
                    Ireland is on the Bann, near Coleraine. Lampreys are caught at low water at the
                    mouth of the same river. Eels are plentiful in all the streams. The sea
                    furnishes most kinds of fish taken upon other parts of the coast. The sturgeon
                    and sun-fish have been caught in Lough Foyle. An unique specimen of the opah or
                    kingfish was thrown on shore upon the sands of Magilligan. Whales of various
                    species have also been taken on the coast. The seal, porpoise, and grampus are
                    frequent. A species of the pearl mussel has been found in the rivulet which
                    flows through Claady into the Bann.</p>
                <p part="N">The residences of the nobility, and landed proprietors of large fortune,
                    are elegant, and in some instances magnificent. Two mansions, erected by the
                    Earl of Bristol, who had been Bishop of Derry, the one at Downhill, the other at
                    Ballyscullion, were constructed in a style of Grecian architecture. The latter
                    has been suffered to fall into ruin. The habitations of the farmers in some of
                    the richest districts, where stone is scarce, are built of clay, and almost
                    universally covered with thatch; presenting, however, with few exceptions, an
                    appearance of comfort and good order. In all cases, they are built and kept in
                    repair by the tenant. In the houses on the Antrim side of the Bann, the
                    fire-place is advanced some feet from the gable-wall, so that the family can
                    nearly sit round it. It does not appear that the nuisance of smoke is so much
                    felt in houses thus constructed as in those in other parts of the country, in
                    which its smell, and its action upon the eyes, are very offensive to strangers.
                    In the districts where lime is plentiful, the outside of the cabin is
                    whitewashed, and sometimes roughcast; whence, amongst the wildest mountains,
                    scenes of domestic neatness often unexpectedly arrest the eye. Coal is little
                    burned in the country parts. In the open and more fertile districts, which are
                    consequently most thickly peopled, the peat mosses are nearly exhausted. In such
                    situations, when the turf can no longer be cut, it is collected into heaps of
                    wet mire, and moulded by the hand. It is then called baked turf, and makes bad
                    fuel. Providence seems to have compensated the dreary exposure of the mountain
                    districts, by affording them plenty of turbary, which has allured a crowded
                    population to every arable spot, however remote or dreary, where turf is to be
                    had in plenty. The article, when prepared for fuel, is carried down to the
                    lowlands on slide cars, through winding ruts, which present to the inexperienced
                    eye insuperable difficulties in the way of its transit. Bog fir is used amongst
                    the wealthier classes as a good substitute for cannel coal. The cottier cuts it
                    up into laths, called splits, not thicker than the blade of a knife. These are
                    used instead of candles, and serve to give light enough to guide the operations
                    of humble domestic industry during the long winter evenings.</p>
                <p part="N">The manners of the common people exhibit much kindness and courtesy. A
                    stranger, on visiting the cabin, is offered a chair brought from the inner
                    apartment. A remarkable tone of piety pervades their usual conversation. Few
                    make a promise for the future without adding, “with the help of God,” or some
                    other phrase of similar import. They talk much of “the second means,” and,
                    through an over confidence in providential interference, often disregard human
                    aids in cases of sickness. Superstitious notions are prevalent, some of them in
                    common with those in other parts of Ulster, others more peculiar to themselves.
                    When the cottier’s cow is supposed to be “elf-shot,” recourse is not had to
                    animal medicines, but salt and water poured on three halfpence and a petrified
                    sea-urchin called “the fairy’s bullet,"and common in limestone, is deemed an
                    infallible remedy. The weasel is accounted “sawncy,” that is, lucky, about the
                    house. If a cow dies in calving, her flesh must be eaten by “Christians,” and
                    not given to the dogs. There is an almost insurmountable objection to taking an
                    oath according to the usual form. It is most prevalent amongst the seceders, to
                    whose prejudices in this respect the legislature has wisely yielded, by
                    accepting their testimony on asseveration with uplifted hand. At weddings,
                    amongst the Scotch part of the population, the bridegroom and his friends vie
                    with each other in being the first to gallop to the house of the bride. During
                    the race they are greeted with shots from guns and pistols in every village they
                    pass through. A bowl of broth, called “brose,” stands ready prepared at the
                    winning-post, as the reward for the victor in the race. The forms of an Irish
                    wedding in the mountain districts are very different. However suitable the match
                    may be to the wishes of all parties, it is considered as but a sorry exploit
                    unless the bride be run away with. After a few days the parties return, and a
                    liberal carouse, to which every well-wisher of either party is expected to
                    contribute, forms the celebration of a kind of second nuptial.</p>
                <p part="N">The most remarkable relic of ancient fortification is the Giant’s
                    Sconce, situated in the pass between Drumbo and Largantea. It was formed on an
                    isolated knoll of basalt, difficult of access on all sides but the north-east,
                    where art has supplied the deficiency by a wall of massive masonry. The interior
                    was hollowed, as if for a receptacle for men and stores; whilst a covered way,
                    admitting only one person in a stooping posture to pass at a time, surrounded
                    the whole. Several cromleachs are still in existence, some of them surrounded by
                    a circle of upright pillars, somewhat like Stonehenge. The most remarkable is
                    that at Slacht Manus. Cairns are too numerous to admit of special notice. To the
                    present time they are kept up, if not enlarged, by the custom of travellers
                    adding a stone to them as they pass. Danish ditches are sometimes dug up.
                    Sepulchral pillars are numerous, and one peculiarly remarkable stands near
                    Dungiven. Artificial caverns, evidently constructed for the concealment of men
                    and property, are frequently discovered. They are rudely built of stone, without
                    cement; and flags or long stones form the roof. They consist of narrow
                    galleries, some at right angles with the main entrance, others paraJlel to it.
                    The entrance is usually concealed by a rock or grassy sod. Moats, the body of
                    which seems to have been formed of the earth thrown out of the foss, have been
                    found. These enclosures are too low for safety or strength, and so small as not
                    to contain more than thirty persons. Coins, antique pins, rings, and forks, were
                    found in one of them. Castles of acknowledged Irish erection are few. That of
                    Carrickreagh is looked upon as amongst the most ancient. Near Ballyaghran was
                    another. Both are said to have been residences of the family of the M'Quillans.
                    Pieces of pit-coal, found in the cement <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193208612?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8612-0553"/>of the
                    walls, lead to the opinion that the operations of miners were practised in those
                    remote ages. Some of the castellated mansions of the first English settlers,
                    with their bawns, are still in a state of preservation; as at Kil-lolod,
                    Dungiven, Salterstown, and Muff.</p>
                <p part="N">The most ancient monastic building is the abbey of Derry, founded by
                    Columbkill in the sixth century. The present cathedral stands on its site. At
                    Coleraine were two monasteries, one of Dominicans, the other of regular canons.
                    At Camus, on the Bann, was a very celebrated monastic structure, attributed to
                    St Comgal. The only remains of it at present existing are the fort, with a
                    pillar curiously carved. The remains of the abbey of Dungiven are the most
                    interesting in the county. It was the burial-place of the O’Cahans or O’Kanes,
                    several of whose tombs have resisted the attacks <hi rend="italic">of</hi> time.
                    The principal monument is that of one of the chieftains, named Cooey-na-gal.
                    There is a tower at the north-west side of the building, and a sepulchral pillar
                    placed on an artificial mount. A smaller tumulus in the vicinity, when opened,
                    was found to contain an urn of earthenware with bones. The urn ∣was surrounded
                    with white stones. Other tumuli, when examined, exhibit similar results.</p>
                <p part="N">The city of Londonderry is situated at the western side of the river
                    Foyle, near to its junction with the lough, spreading itself over the summit and
                    sides of a hill, which here projects into the river, and which was once covered
                    with oak trees, whence the place derived the name of Derry Calgach, “the
                    eminence covered with oaks,” which it still partially retains. Its monastery
                    first drew inhabitants thither. The town was entirely ecclesiastical, consisting
                    almost exclusively of churches and the dwellings of the clergy and their
                    dependents. The English government, after having been baffled in several
                    attempts to plant a garrison here during the war against the Earl of Tyrone, at
                    length succeeded, in 1600, in gaining possession of the place, and securing it
                    against any efforts of the Irish to dislodge them. It was surrounded with a
                    substantial wall, strengthened with bastions, and had four main streets
                    diverging at right angles from a point on the summit of the hill, now called the
                    Diamond, to a gate at the other extremity of each. The strength of these
                    fortifications was tested in the subsequent wars of 1642 and 1688, in each of
                    which the town maintained a successful stand against its besiegers. After a
                    lapse of more than two centuries, the walls still retain, in most parts, their
                    original form and character. The external ditch, indeed, has disappeared. The
                    gates have been rebuilt in a more flegant style of architecture, and two new
                    ones have been ìdded. One bastion has been removed to make way for a
                    outter-market, and another has been appropriated as the site of a pillar
                    commemorative of the military services of the Reverend George Walker during the
                    memorable siege of 1688. In other respects the walls still remain unaltered, now
                    forming the ornament, as they were once the protection, of the city. They are
                    the favourite walk of the inhabitants, frequented by the beauty and fashion of
                    the city, and commanding, at various points, interesting and extended views of a
                    wooded and watered landscape. The cathedral stands within the walls, in the
                    southern part of the city. It consists of a nave, divided into a central and
                    lateral aisle, separated by pointed arches. The chapel of ease is a plain
                    rectangular structure, of small dimensions. A free church, for the use of the
                    poor, Was opened in 1830, at the expense of the late bishop. There are four
                    meeting-houses, one for the Presbyterian or Scotch church, a second for the
                    Seceders, a third for the Covenanters, and a fourth for the Independents. There
                    are also two Methodist chapels, and a Roman Catholic chapel capable of
                    accommodating 2000 persons. The diocesan school is a simple but handsome stone
                    edifice, consisting of a central pavilion and two wings. It was erected by
                    grants from the London companies, and a large contribution from the bishop. Near
                    to it is the parish or poor school, with accommodations for children of both
                    sexes. The corporation hall stands in the centre of the Diamond. It is
                    surrounded by a colonnade, with embat-tlements; and the same kind of military
                    ornament surrounds its roof. The court-house exhibits much architectural beauty.
                    The other more remarkable public buildings are, the lunatic asylum, the
                    infirmary and fever hospital, the gaol, the custom-house, the linen-hall, the
                    barrack, and the magazine. The bridge is the peculiar boast of Derry. It is
                    built of wood, and extends in length 1068 feet, by a breadth <hi rend="italic"

                <p part="N">Coleraine, the second town in importance, is situated on the eastern or
                    Antrim side of the Bann, near its mouth. Like Londonderry, it owes its existence
                    chiefly to the fostering care of the London companies. Some of the houses built
                    of frame or cage-work in the time of Elizabeth and James I. are yet in
                    preservation. According to the fashion of those days, they have pent-ways or
                    piazzas. The population at present amounts to 5752 souls. The other more
                    remarkable towns are, Newtown-Limavady, Magherafelt, Killreagh, Dungiven,
                    Garvagh, Maghera, Moneymore, Tubbermore, Castledawson, and Bellaghy.</p>
