                    the guard hem or fringe of a garment, is a plain or ornamented network,
                    consisting of threads of gold, silver, silk, flax, or cotton, tastefully
                    interwoven so as to form a beautiful texture. This delicate fabric has no doubt
                    claims to high antiquity, but its origin is involved in considerable obscurity.
                    That it was worn by Grecian females is certain, and the derivation of the word
                        <hi rend="italic">lace</hi> affords presumptive evidence that it was also in
                    use amongst the Romans. In Venice, and the neighbouring states of Italy, it was
                    very early worn; and Mary of Medicis is supposed to have been the first who
                    introduced its use into France; but as early as 1483 we find it included in a
                    list of articles prohibited to be imported into England. The inference which
                    maybe drawn from this circumstance is, that it had begun to be made in this
                    country <hi rend="italic">prior</hi> to the period above mentioned, and that
                    this prohibition, like many other subsequent acts, was for the protection and
                    encouragement of home manufactures. Butins, which are indispensable in the
                    process of lace-making, were not known till long afterwards; so that it is
                    probable the fabric made was neither very fine in texture, nor produced to any
                    great extent. It is uncertain by whom the manufacture of lace was originally
                    introduced into this country, nor is it of great importance to know. About
                    themiddle of the seventeenth century, the lace trade was a flourishing concern
                    in Buckinghamshire; and so greatly had it advanced in England, that, by a royal
                    ordonnance in France, passed in 1660, a mark was established upon the thread
                    lace imported from this country and from Flanders, and upon point-lace from
                    Genoa, Venice, and other countries.</p>
                <p part="N">Pillow-lace, the original manufacture, is worked upon a hard-stuffed
                    pillow, with silk, flax, or cotton threads, according to a parchment pattern
                    placed upon it, by means of pins, bobbins, and spindles, which are placed and
                    displaced, twisting and interweaving the threads, so as to imitate the pattern
                    designed. This manufacture has been long pursued in many counties in England,
                    and at various places on the Continent. Of the number of persons employed on the
                    Continent no estimate can be formed; but at Brussels alone no less than 10,000
                    individuals are said to be engaged in the manufacture. It is supposed that the
                    first lace ever made in this country was that called Brussels point, in which
                    the network is "made by bone bobbins on the pillow, and the pattern and sprigs
                    are worked with the needle. This, from different portraits now in existence,
                    appears to have been the kind worn in the time of Charles I. and during the
                    reigns of several subsequent sovereigns. Various improvements have from time to
                    time taken place in the manufacture of this article; but, about the year 1778,
                    the point-ground was introduced by the inhabitants of Buckingham and its
                    neighbourhood, which quickly superseded all the others. The origin of the modern
                    pillow-lace may be dated from this period; but the most striking improvements
                    did not take place till the commencement of the present century, and since then,
                    for several years, they were astonishing and unprecedented. - During the war,
                    veils of this lace sold at a very high rate; but their value has been greatly
                    depreciated by the introduction of the new manufacture, which is the product of
                    machinery. Since 1815, the competition in this article has been very great, and
                    the manufacture of pillow-lace has consequently declined so much as to be now in
                    a very languishing condition.</p>
                <p part="N">The first who made lace by machinery was a framework knitter of
                    Nottingham, about the year 1768. This individual employed his common
                    stocking-frame in the manufacture; but, about the same time, another person in
                    the same place introduced a machine ostensibly for lace, called a pin-machine.
                    Single-press <hi rend="italic">point-net,</hi> in imitation of the Brussels
                    ground, was the article produced. In 1782 the warp-frame was introduced, and is
                    still in use for making warp-lace. In 1809, Mr Heathcoat of Tiverton succeeded
                    in discovering the correct principle of the bobbin-net frame, and obtained a
                    patent for fourteen years for his invention. The expiration of this patent,
                    combined with the application of steam-power, which had now become general, gave
                    a great stimulus to the trade. The demand became immense, arid prices fell in
                    proportion as production increased. The Nottingham lace-frame became the organ
                    of general supply, rivalling and supplanting in plain nets the most finished
                    productions of France and the Netherlands. In a work relative to this
                    manufacture, published in 1833, the state of the trade is given as follows:</p>
                <p part="N">Total capital employed in the trade L.1,932,000</p>
                <p part="N">Total number of hands employed 159,300</p>
                <p part="N">The annual produce in 1831 was estimated at 23,400,000 square yards,
                    worth L. 1,891,875. In 1834, above 7,000,000 square yards more were annually
                    produced, an increase which is understood to have arisen from the new and
                    improved machinery introduced into the manufacture. A considerable increase has
                    also taken place in bobbin-net machinery on the Continent, particularly at
                    Calais, where, in 1823, there were not thirty-five machines, and probably not
                    one hundred on the Continent altogether. According to the authority above
                    mentioned, there are now above 700 machines at Calais alone; and the total
                    number on the Continent has been estimated at 1850. The produce of these
                    machines has been calculated at 9,824,000 square yards of net, of the value of
                    L.570,250. The manufacture is now'beginning to be established in different parts
                    of Europe, where it has hitherto been unknown; and even from some places in
                    Persia orders have been received in this country for bobbin-net frames; but
                    government has restricted the exportation of machinery. The English manufacture
                    from machinery is now confined to <hi rend="italic">point-net, warp-net,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">bobbin-net,</hi> so called from the peculiar construction
                    of the machines by which they are produced. There were various other
                    descriptions made, but they are now discontinued. Nottingham is the depot of the
                    lace trade; and the supplies collected from all the surrounding villages, and
                    even from the more distant counties where it is manufactured, are thence
                    distributed to various quarters of the world. The Nottingham trade is by no
                    means in so prosperous a condition as it once was; a result which may probably
                    be attributed to the great influx of capital and hands into the trade, which a
                    successful novelty is at all times calculated to attract. An extraordinary
                    increase in the powers of production followed; and as the demand for some time
                    kept pace with the supply, the latter became a question of <hi rend="italic"
                        >quantity</hi> rather than of <hi rend="italic">quality,</hi> and a great
                    depression of price was the consequence, l· rom becoming cheap and common, lace
                    lost its attractions in the fashionable circles, and has to a considerable
                    extent been superseded by other kinds of manufacture. The natural result of the
                    increase in power machinery, and the application of speedier machines, is to
                    depress the condition of the workmen, and for some <pb break="no"

                    have suffered much; nor is any immediate amelioration likely to take place. The
                    following observations on the importance of the trade to Britain are extracted
                    from M <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Culloch ’ s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary
                        of Commerce</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> “By comparing the value of
                    1,270,000 lbs. of Sea Island cotton, worth L.148,000, and about L.10,000 worth
                    of thrown silk, which appears to be annually used in this manufacture, with the
                    manufactured value of the same, worked into 30,771,000 square yards of
                    bobbin-net, the estimated value of which is L.1,850,650, the great national
                    utility of this trade becomes at once evident. A clear surplus of more than a
                    pound sterling is realized upon every pound avoirdupois of the raw material,
                    which is distributed over the trade in rent, profit, and wages; and this is
                    altogether independent of the profits arising from embroidering, in itself a
                    most extensive and important branch. About half, or perhaps three fourths, of
                    this production is supposed to be exported in a plain state, chiefly to Hamburg,
                    the Leipsic and Frankfort fairs, Antwerp and the rest of Belgium, to France
                    (contraband), Italy, Sicily, and North and South America. Of the remainder,
                    three fourths are sold unembroidered, and the remaining fourth embroidered, in
                    this country.”</p>
                <p part="N">“The most celebrated laces are,—1. Brussels, the most valuable. There
                    are two kinds: Brussels ground, having a hexagon mesh, formed by platting and
                    twisting four threads of flax to a perpendicular line of mesh: Brussels wire
                    ground, made of silk; meshes partly straight and partly arched. The pattern is
                    worked separately, and set on by the needle. 2. Mechlin: a hexagon mesh, formed
                    of three flax threads twisted and platted to a perpendicular line or pillar. The
                    pattern is worked in the net. 3. Valenciennes: an irregular hexagonal, formed of
                    two threads, partly twisted and platted at the top of the mesh. The pattern is
                    worked in the net similar to Mechlin lace. 4. Lisle: a diamond mesh, formed of
                    two threads platted to a pillar. 5. Alençon, called blond: hexagon, of two
                    threads, twisted similar to Buckingham lace; considered the most inferior of any
                    made on the cushion. 6. Alençon point: formed of two threads to a pillar, with
                    octagon and square meshes alternately.</p>

                <p part="N">Mr Babbage gives the following account of lace made by the <hi
                        rend="italic">phaelenapandilla</hi> or caterpillar. The invention is by a
                    gentleman of Munich. He makes a paste of the leaves of the plant which is the
                    usual food of the species of caterpillar he employs, and spreads it thinly over
                    a stone or other flat substance; then, with a camel-hair pencil dipped in olive
                    oil, he'draws upon the coating of paste the pattern he wishes the insects to
                    leave open. The stone being placed in an inclined position, a species of
                    caterpillar which spins a strong web is laid at thę bottom, and.the animals,
                    commencing from that point, eat and spin their way up to the top, carefully
                    avoiding every part touched by the oil, but devouring all the rest of the paste.
                    These veils have not a great deal of strength, but they are surprisingly light.
                    One of them, measuring twenty-six inches and a half by seventeen inches, weighed
                    only 1∙51 grain; a degree of ligntness which will appear more strongly by
                    contrast with other fabrics. One square yard of the substance of which these
                    ve'lsare made weighs four grains and three fourths, whilst one square yard of
                    silk gauze weighs 137 grains, and one square yard of the finest patent net
                    weighs 262∣ grains.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Method of Cleaning Gold Lace and Embroidery when
                        tarnished.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> For this purpose alkaline liquors
                    are by no means to be used; because, whilst they clean the gold, they corrode
                    the silk, and change or discharge its colour. Soap also alters the shade, and
                    even the species of certain colours. But spirit of wine may be employed without
                    any danger of its injuring either the colour or quality of the subject; and in
                    many cases it proves as effectual, for restoring the lustre of the gold, as the
                    corrosive detergents. A rich brocade, flowered with a variety of colours, after
                    being disagreeably tarnished, had the lustre of the gold perfectly restored by
                    washing it with a soft brush dipped in warm spirit of wine; and some of the
                    colours of the silk, which were likewise soiled, became at the same time
                    remarkably bright and lively. Spirit of wine seems to be the only material
                    adapted to this purpose, and probably the boasted secret of certain artists is
                    no other than this spirit disguised. Amongst liquids, Dr Lewis says, he doesnot
                    knowof any other that is of sufficient activity in discharging the foul matter,
                    without being hurtful to the silk. As to powders, however fine, and however
                    cautiously used, they scratch and wear the gold, which here is only superficial,
                    and of extreme tenuity. But though spirit of wine is the most innocent material
                    that can be employed for this purpose, it is not in all cases proper. The golden
                    covering may be in some parts worn off, or the base metal with which it had been
                    iniquitously alloyed may be corroded by the air, so as to leave the particles of
                    the gold disunited, whilst the silver underneath, tarnished to a yellow hue, may
                    continue of a tolerable colour; in which cases it is apparent that the removal
                    of the tarnish would be prejudicial to the colour, and make the lace or
                    embroidery less like gold than it was before. A piece of old tarnished gold
                    lace, cleaned by spirit of wine, was deprived, with its tarnish, of the greater
                    part of its golden hue, and looked almost like silver lace.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Method of separating the Gold and Silver from Lace
                        without burning it.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Cut the lace in pieces,
                    and, having-separated the thread from it by which it was sewed to the garment,
                    tie it up in a linen cloth, and boil it in soap ley diluted with water, till it
                    becomes diminished in bulk, which will require but little time, unless the
                    quantity of lace be very considerable. Next take out the cloth, and wash it
                    several times in cold water, squeezing it pretty hard with your foot, or beating
                    it with a mallet, to clear it of the soap ley; then untie the cloth, and you
                    will have the metallic part of the lace pure, and nowhere altered in colour or
                    diminished in weight. This method is much more convenient and less troublesome
                    than the common way of burning; and as a small quantity of the ley will be
                    sufficient, the expense will be trifling, especially as the same ley may be used
                    several times, if cleared of the silky calcination. The ley may be had at the
                    soapboilers, or it may be made of pearl ash and quicklime boiled together in a
                    sufficient quantity of water. The reason of this sudden change in the lace will
                    be evident to those who are acquainted with chemistry. For silk, on which all
                    our laces are woven, is an animal substance, and all animal substances are
                    soluble in alkalies, especially when rendered more caustic by the addition of
                    quicklime; but the linen in which it is tied, being a vegetable, will remain
                    unaltered.</p>
