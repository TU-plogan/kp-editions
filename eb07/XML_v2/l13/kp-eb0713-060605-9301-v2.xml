                    Phoenician word <hi rend="italic">lud,</hi> in which he agrees in some measure
                    with Stephanus, who derives the name of Maeonia ’ τora Maeon, the ancient name
                    of the Maeander. Some take ,the word <hi rend="italic">Maeonia</hi> to be a
                    translation of a Hebrew word sig-ιifying metal, because, according to them, that
                    country was In former times rich above any other with mines. Though Lydia and
                    Maeonia are by most authors indifferently used nr one and the same country, yet
                    they are sometimes distinguished; that part including Mount Tmolus, and watered
                    by the Pactolus, being properly called <hi rend="italic">Maeonia;</hi> and the
                    other, situated upon the coast, <hi rend="italic">Lydia.</hi> This distinction s
                    observed by Homer, Callimachus, Dionysius, and other indent writers. In after
                    ages, when the Ionians, who had &gt;lanted a colony on the coast of the AEgean
                    Sea, began to nake some figure, that part was called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ionia,</hi> and the name »f <hi rend="italic">Lydia</hi> given to the
                    ancient Maeonia. Lydia, according to Pliny, Ptolemy’, and other ancient
                    geographers, was Sounded by Mysia Major on the north, by Caria on the ιouth, by
                    Phrygia Major on the east, and by Ionia on the vest, and was situated between
                    the thirty-seventh and ,hirty-ninth degrees of north latitude. But what the
                    an-ñents style the kingdom of <hi rend="italic">Lydia</hi> was not confined
                    within hese narrow boundaries; it extended from Halys to the Egean Sea. Pliny’s
                    description includes AEolia, situated )etween the Hermus and the Caïcus.</p>
                <p part="N">As to the origin of the Lydians, Josephus, and after him ill the
                    ecclesiastical writers, derive them from Lud, Shem’s burth son; but this opinion
                    has no other foundation than he similitude of names. Some of the ancients
                    conceive the ^ydians to have been a mixed colony of Phrygians, Mysians, ιnd
                    Carians; but others, finding some conformity in religion and religious
                    ceremonies between the Egyptians and Tuscans, who were a Lydian colony,
                    conclude, without further evidence, that they were originally Egyptians. All ve
                    know for certain is, that the Lydians were a very annent nation; and this is
                    manifest from their fables; for pltys, Tantalus, Pelops, Niobe, and Arachne, are
                    all said to ιave been the children of Lydus. Zanthus, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lydiaca,</hi> Quoted by Stephanus, informs us, that the ancient city of
                    lscalon, one of the five satrapies of the Philistines, men- ,ioned in the books
                    of Joshua and the Judges, was built by me Ascalus a Lydian, whom Achiamus, king
                    of Lydia, had ιppointed to command a body of troops which he sent into syria, we
                    know not on what occasion. The Heraclidae, or dngs of Lydia descended from
                    Hercules, began to reign ιefore the Trojan war, and had been preceded by a long
                    ine of sovereigns sprung from Atys, and hence styled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Myadae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a strong proof of the antiquity of that
                    kingdom. I The Lydians began very early to be governed by kings, ∣vhose
                    authority seems to have been despotic, and the brown hereditary. We read of
                    three distinct races of kings eigning over Lydia; the Atyadae, the Heraclidae,
                    and the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> VIermnadae/ The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Atyadae</hi> were so called from Atys the )on of Cotys, and grandson of
                    Manes the first Lydian king. I lut the history of this family is obscure and
                    fabulous. The ítyadae were succeeded by the <hi rend="italic">Heraclidae,</hi>
                    or the descen-lants of Hercules. This hero having, by the direction i &gt;f the
                    oracle, been sold as a slave to Omphale, queen of Lydia, in order to expiate the
                    murder of Iphitus, had, by me of her slaves, during his captivity, a son named
                    Cleo-aus, whose grandson Argon was the first of the Heraclidae vho ascended the
                    throne of Lydia. This race is said to ιave reigned 505 years, the son succeeding
                    the father for wenty-two generations. They began to reign about the ime of the
                    Trojan war. The last of the family was the unhappy Candaules, who lost both his
                    life and kingdom by his imprudence. Of this event an account is given by
                    Herodotus. Candaules had a wife whom he passionately loved, and believed to be
                    the most beautiful of her sex. He extolled her charms to Gyges his favourite,
                    whom he used to intrust with his most important affairs; and, to convince him
                    the more of her beauty, resolved to show her to him quite undressed. He
                    accordingly placed Gyges in the porch of the chamber where the queen used to
                    undress when she went to bed, ordering him to retire after he should have seen
                    her, and take the utmost possible care not to be observed. But notwithstanding
                    all the caution he employed, she plainly discovered him going out; and though
                    she did not doubt that it was her husband’s contrivance, yet she passed that
                    night in seeming tranquillity, suppressing her resentment till next morning,
                    when she sent for Gyges, and resolutely told him that he must either by his
                    death atone for the criminal action he had been guilty of, or put to death
                    Candaules, the contriver of it, and receive both her and the kingdom of Lydia as
                    his reward. Gyges at first earnestly begged of her that she would not drive him
                    to the necessity of such a choice; but finding that he could not prevail with
                    her, and that he must either kill his master or be killed himself, he chose the
                    former part of the alternative. Being led by the queen to the same place where
                    her husband had posted him the night before, he stabbed the king whilst he was
                    asleep, marrièd the queen, and took possession of the kingdom, in which he was
                    confirmed by the response of the oracle of Delphi. But the Lydians having taken
                    up arms to revenge the death of their prince, an agreement was made between them
                    and the followers of Gyges, that if the oracle should declare him to be lawful
                    king of Lydia, he would be permitted to reign; if not, that he should resign the
                    crown to the Heraclidae. The answer of the oracle proved favourable to Gyges,
                    and he was universally acknowledged as lawful king of Lydia. Candaules is said
                    to have purchased, for its weight in gold, a picture painted by Bularchas,
                    representing a battle of the Magnetes; a circumstance which shows how early the
                    art of painting had begun to be appreciated in that country, Candaules having
                    been contemporary with Romulus.</p>
                <p part="N">Gygcs, having thus possessed himself of the kingdom of Lydia, sent many
                    rich and valuable presents to the oracle of Delphos, amongst which were six cups
                    of gold, weighing thirty talents, and greatly esteemed for the workmanship. He
                    made war upon Miletus and Smyrna, took the city of Colophon, and subdued the
                    whole country of Troas. In his reign, and by his permission, the city of Abydus
                    was built by the Milesians. Plutarch and other writers give a different account
                    of his accession to the crown of Lydia, and inform us, without making any
                    mention of the queen, that Gyges rebelled against Candaules, and slew him in an
                    engagement. In Gyges commenced the third race called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mermnadae,</hi> who were also, properly speaking, Heraclidae, being
                    descended from a son of Hercules by Omphale.</p>
                <p part="N">Gyges reigned thirty-eight years, and was succeeded on the throne by his
                    son Ardyes. This prince carried on the war against the Milesians which his
                    father had begun, and possessed himself of Priene, which in those days was a
                    strong city. In his reign the Cimmerians invaded and overran all Asia Minor; but
                    what battles were fought between the Lydians and these invaders, and with what
                    success, we find nowhere mentioned. Herodotus only informs us, that in the time
                    of Ardyes they possessed themselves of Sardis, the metropolis of Lydia, but that
                    they failed to reduce the castle. Ardyes reigned forty-nine years, and was
                    succeeded by his son Sadyattes, who reigned twelve years, during most part of
                    which he carried on war with the Milesians.</p>
                <p part="N">After him came his son Alyattes, who for the space of five years
                    continued the war which his father had begun <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193209327?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9327-0608"/>against the
                    Milesians, ravaging their country, and about harvest· time carrying away all
                    their corn yearly, in order to oblige them, from want of provisions, to
                    surrender their city, which he knew he could not reduce in any other way, the
                    Milesians being at that time masters of the sea. In the twelfth year of this war
                    the Lydians having set fire to the corn in the fields, the flames were carried
                    by a violent wind, which happened at that time to blow, to the temple of Minerva
                    at Assesus, and burned it down to the ground. Not long afterwards, Alyattes
                    falling sick, sent to consult the oracle at Delphos; but the god refused to
                    return any answer until the king should rebuild the temple of Minerva at
                    Assesus. Alyattes, thus warned, despatched ambassadors to Miletus, enjoining
                    them to conclude a truce with the Milesians until the temple should be rebuilt.
                    On the arrival of the ambassadors, Thrasybulus, then king of Miletus, having
                    commanded all the corn which was at that time in the city to be brought into the
                    market-place, ordered the citizens to banquet in public, and to revel as if the
                    city were plentifully stored with all manner of provisions. This stratagem
                    Thrasybulus practised, that the ambassadors, seeing such quantities of corn, and
                    the people everywhere diverting themselves, might acquaint their master with his
                    affluence, and thus divert him from pursuing the war. As Thrasybulus had
                    intended, so it happened. Alyattes, who believed the Milesians greatly
                    distressed for provisions, receiving a different account from his ambassadors,
                    changed the truce into a lasting peace, and ever afterwards lived in amity and
                    friendship with Thrasybulus and the Milesians.</p>
                <p part="N">After a reign of fifty-seven years, he was succeeded by his son Croesus,
                    whose uninterrupted prosperity, in the first years of his reign, far eclipsed
                    the glory of his predecessors. He was the first who made war on the Ephesians,
                    whose city he besieged and took, notwithstanding their consecrating it to Diana,
                    and fastening the walls by a rope to her temple, which was seven stadia distant
                    from the city. After the reduction of Ephesus, he under various pretences
                    attacked the Ionians and AEolians, obliging them, and all the other Greek states
                    of Asia, to pay him an annual tribute. Having met with such extraordinary
                    success by land, the Lydian prince determined to render his power equally
                    conspicuous by sea. For this purpose he had serious thoughts of equipping a
                    fleet, with which he purposed to invade and conquer the Grecian islands directly
                    opposite to his dominions. But this design, which, considering the slow progress
                    of maritime power amongst the nations most diligent in attaining it, would
                    probably have failed of success, was prevented by the advice of a philosophical
                    traveller, conveyed in such a lively turn of wit as easily changed the
                    resolution of the king. Bias of Priene in Ionia (some say Pittacus of Mitylene
                    in the isle of Lesbos), whilst he travelled, after the Grecian custom, from
                    curiosity and a love of knowledge, was presented to Croesus at the Lydian court;
                    and being asked by that prince what news he brought from Greece, answered, with
                    a republican freedom, that the islanders had collected powerful squadrons of
                    cavalry with an intention of invading Lydia. “May the gods grant,” said Croesus,
                    “that the Greeks, who are unacquainted with horsemanship, should attack the
                    disciplined valour of the Lydian cavalry; there would speedily be an end to the
                    contest.” “In the same manner,” replied Bias, “as if the Lydians, who are
                    totally unexperienced in naval affairs, should invade the Grecians by sea.”
                    Struck by the acuteness of this unexpected observation, Croesus desisted from
                    his intended expedition against the islands; and, instead of employing new means
                    for extending his conquests, deteπnined peaceably to enjoy the laurels he had
                    won, and to display the grandeur he had attained. But his happiness was soon
                    afterwards allayed by the death of his favourite son Atys, who was unfortunately
                    killed in the chase of a wild boar. This loss rendered him disconsolate for two
                    years, and reduced him to a state of inaction, till the conquests of Cyrus, and
                    the growing power of the Persians, roused up his martial spirit, and diverted
                    his mind to other thoughts.</p>
                <p part="N">Croesus apprehending that the success which had attended Cyrus in all
                    his undertakings might at last prove dangerous to himself, resolved if possible
                    to put a stop to his progress. In adopting this resolution, which might probably
                    be attended with the most important consequences, he was desirous to learn the
                    will of heaven concerning the issue of the war. The principal oracles which he
                    consulted were those of Branchis in Ionia, of Ammon in Libya, and of Delphi in
                    Greece. But, amongst these respected shrines, the oracle of Delphi maintained
                    its ascendant, as the most faithful interpreter of fate. Croesus was fully
                    persuaded of its veracity; and, generously desirous to compensate the priests of
                    Apollo for the trouble which he had already given, and still meant to give, he
                    sacrificed three thousand oxen to the god, and adorned his shrine with gifts
                    equally valuable for the workmanship and for the materials, viz. precious
                    vessels of silver, ewers of iron beautifully inlaid and enamelled; various
                    ornaments of pure gold, particularly a golden lion weighing ten talents, and a
                    female figure three cubits or near five feet in height. In return for these
                    magnificent presents, the oracle, in equivocal and ambiguous language, flattered
                    Croesus with obtaining an easy victory over his enemies, and with enjoying a
                    long life and a prosperous reign. The god at the same time enjoined him to
                    contract an alliance with the most powerful of the Grecian states.</p>
                <p part="N">Elevated with these favourable predictions of Apollo, Croesus prepared
                    to yield a ready obedience to the only condition required on his part for the
                    accomplishment of his aspiring design. Not deeming himself sufficiently
                    acquainted with the affairs of Greece to know what particular republic was meant
                    by the oracle, he made especial inquiry of those who were best informed
                    concerning the state of Europe, and discovered, that amongst all the members of
                    the Grecian confederacy, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians were justly entitled
                    to the pre-eminence. But in order .to learn which of these communities deserved
                    the epithet of “most powerful,” it was necessary to send ambassadors into
                    Greece. The Lydians despatched on this important commission soon discovered that
                    the Athenians, having been long harassed by internal dissensions, were actually
                    governed by the tyrant Pisistratus. The Spartans, on the other hand, though
                    anciently the worst regulated of all the Grecian communities, had enjoyed
                    domestic peace and foreign prosperity ever since they had adopted the wise
                    institutions of Lycurgus. After that memorable period, they had repeatedly
                    conquered the warlike Argives, triumphed over the hardy Arcadians, and,
                    notwithstanding the heroic exploits of Aristomenes, subdued and enslaved their
                    unfortunate rivals of Messene. To the Lydian ambassadors, therefore, the Spartan
                    republic appeared to be pointed out by the oracle as the community whose
                    alliance they were enjoined to solicit. Having accordingly repaired to Sparta,
                    they were introduced not only to the kings and senate, but, as the importance of
                    the négociation required, to the general assembly of the Lacedaemonians, to whom
                    they, in few words, declared the object of their commission. “Lacedaemonians, we
                    are sent by Croesus, king of the Lydians and of many other nations, who being
                    commanded by the oracle of Apollo to seek the friendship of the most powerful
                    people of Greece, now summon you, who justly merit that epithet, to become his
                    faithful allies, in obedience to the will of the god whose authority you
                    acknowledge.” The Lacedaemonians, pleased with the alliance of a warlike king,
                    and still more with the fame of their valour, readily accepted the proposal. To

                    before this τansaction they had sent to Sardis to purchase gold for naking a
                    statue of Apollo, and on that occasion Croesus ιad gratuitously supplied their
                    wants. Remembering this generosity, they gave the Lydian ambassadors at their
                    de- )arture, as a present for their master, a vessel of brass containing three
                    hundred amphoras (above twelve hogsheads), and beautifully carved on the outside
                    with various òrms of animals.</p>
                <p part="N">Croesus, having thus happily accomplished the design ecommended by the
                    oracle, was eager to set out upon his n.tended expedition. He had formerly
                    entered into alli-ιnces with Amasis king of Egypt, and Labynetus king of
                    3abylon; and he had now obtained the friendship of the nost warlike nation of
                    Europe. The newly-raised power ∙f Cyrus and the Persians seemed incapable of
                    resisting uch a formidable confederacy. Elevated with these flat-ering ideas of
                    his own invincible greatness, Croesus wait-d not to attack the Persian dominions
                    until he had col-ected the strength of his allies. The sanguine impetuosi-y of
                    his temper, unexperienced in adversity, unfortunately ∣recipitated him into
                    measures no less daring than ruinous. Attended only by the arms of Lydia, and a
                    numerous band f mercenaries, whom his immense wealth enabled him at ny time to
                    call into his service, he marched towards the liver Halys, and, having with much
                    difficulty crossed that eep and broad stream, entered the province of Cappado-
                    ∣ia, which formed the western frontier of the Median do-hinions. That
                    unfortunate country soon experienced all pe calamities of invasion. The Pterian
                    plain, the most eautiful and fertile district of Cappadocia, was laid waste; He
                    ports of the Euxine, as well as several inland cities, ere plundered, and the
                    inoffensive inhabitants were either ut to the sword or dragged into captivity.
                    Encouraged y the unresisting softness of the natives of those parts, I'roesus
                    was eager to push forwards; and if Cyrus did not reviously meet him in the
                    field, he bad determined to probed in triumph to the mountains of Persia.
                    Against this angerous resolution he was in vain exhorted by a prudent lydian
                    named Sandanis, who, when asked his opinion of he war, declared it with that
                    freedom which the princes ∣f the East have in every age permitted, amidst all
                    the ride and caprices of despotic power, to men distinguished y the gifts of
                    nature or education. “You are preparing,” ⅛id he, “to march against a people who
                    lead a laborious E∣d a miserable life; whose daily subsistence is often deed
                    them, and is always scanty and precarious; who drink nly water, and who are
                    clothed with nothing but the skins if wild beasts. What can the Lydians gain by
                    the conquest If Persia; the Lydians, who enjoy all the advantages of! mich the
                    Persians are destitute? For my part, I deem it ìblessing of the gods that they
                    have not excited the war-ke poverty of these miserable barbarians to invade and
                    ∣⅛under the luxurious wealth of Lydia.” The moderation f this advice was
                    rejected by the fatal presumption of 'roesus; confounding the dictates of
                    experienced wisdom ∙ith the mean suggestions of pusillanimity, he dismissed ιe
                    prudent counsellor with contempt, and prepared to prolocute his fatal
                    enterprise.</p>
                <p part="N">I Meanwhile, the approach of Cyrus, who was not of a ∣ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> t</hi> mper to permit his dominions to be ravished with
                    impurity, afforded the Lydian king an opportunity of bringing fie war to a more
                    speedy issue than by his intended ex-edition into Persia. The army of Cyrus
                    gradually augmented as he advanced; the tributary princes cheerfully mtributing
                    with their united strength towards the assis-j nee of a master whose valour and
                    generosity they ad-fired, and who now took arms to protect the safety of his
                    objects, as well as to support the grandeur of his throne, inch was the rapidity
                    of his movement, especially after ting informed of the destructive ravages of
                    the enemy in Cappadocia, that he marched from the shores of the Caspian to those
                    of the Euxine Sea before the army of Croesus had provided the necessaries for
                    their advance. That prince,’ when apprized of the neighbourhood of the Persians,
                    encamped on the Pterian plain; Cyrus likewise took up a position at no great
                    distance; frequent skirmishes occurred between the light troops; and at length a
                    general engagement was fought with equal fury and perseverance, and only
                    terminated by the darkness of night. The loss on both sides prevented a renewal
                    of the battle. But the numbers as well as the courage of the Persians much
                    exceeded the expectation of Croesus; and as they discovered no intention of
                    harassing his retreat, he determined to fall back towards Sardis, in order to
                    spend the winter in the amusements of his palace, and, after summoning his
                    numerous allies to his standard, to take the field early in the spring with such
                    increase of force as would be sufficient to overpower the Persians.</p>
                <p part="N">But this design was defeated by the watchful vigilance of Cyrus. That
                    experienced leader allowed the enemy to retire without molestation, carefully
                    informing himself of every movement they made, and of every measure they seemed
                    determined to pursue. Patiently watching the opportunity of a just revenge, he
                    waited until Croesus had re-entered his capital, and disbanded the foreign
                    mercenaries, who composed the most numerous division of his army. Cyrus then put
                    his Persians in motion; and such was his celerity, that he brought the first
                    intelligence of his own arrival in the plain of Sardis. Croesus, whose firmness
                    might well have been shaken by the imminence of this unforeseen danger, was not
                    wanting on the present occasion to the duties which he owed to his fame and the
                    lustre of the Lydian throne. Though his mercenaries were disbanded, his own
                    subjects, who served him from attachment, who had been long accustomed to
                    victory, and who were animated with a high sense of national honour, burned with
                    a desire to check the daring insolence of the invaders. Croesus indulged and
                    encouraged this generous ardour. The Lydians in that age fought on horseback,
                    armed with long spears; the strength of the Persians consisted in their
                    infantry. The latter were so little accustomed to the use of horses, that camels
                    were almost the only animals which they employed as beasts of burden. This
                    circumstance suggested to a Mede, by name Harpagus, a stratagem, which, being
                    communicated to Cyrus, was immediately adopted with the approbation of that
                    prince. Harpagus, having observed that horses had a strong aversion to the shape
                    and smell of camels, advised that the Persian army should be drawn up in the
                    following order: All the camels which had been employed to carry baggage and
                    provisions were collected into one body, and arranged in a line fronting the
                    Lydian cavalry. The foot soldiers of the Persians were posted immediately behind
                    this line, and placed at a due distance; and the Median horse, a few squadrons
                    of which followed the standard of Cyrus, formed the rear of the army. As the
                    troops on both sides approached to join battle, the Lydian cavalry, terrified at
                    the unusual appearance of the camels, mounted with men in arms, were thrown into
                    disorder, and the horses, turning their heads, endeavoured to escape from the
                    field. Croesus, who perceived the confusion, was ready to despair of his
                    fortune; but the Lydians, abandoning their horses, prepared with uncommon
                    bravery to attack the enemy on foot. Their courage deserved a better fate; but,
                    unaccustomed as they were to this mode of fighting, they were received and
                    repelled by the experienced valour of the Persian infantry, and obliged to take
                    refuge within the fortified strength of Sardis, where they imagined themselves
                    secure. The walls of that city bade defiance to the rude art of attack, as then
                    practised by the most warlike nations. If the Persian army should invest it, the
                    Lydians <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209353?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-9353-0610"/> were provided with provisions for several
                    years; and there was reason to expect that in a few months, nay even weeks, they
                    would receive such assistance from Egypt, Babylonia, and Greece, to which
                    countries they had already sent ambassadors, as would oblige the Persians to
                    raise the siege.</p>
                <p part="N">The Lydian ministers despatched into Greece met with great sympathy from
                    the Spartans. That people were particularly observant of the faith of treaties;
                    and whilst they punished their enemies with unexampled severity, they behaved
                    with generous compassion towards those whom they had once accepted as allies.
                    They immediately resolved therefore to send speedy and effectual relief to
                    Croesus; and for this purpose they assembled their troops, made ready their
                    vessels, and prepared every thing necessary for the expedition. The valour of
                    the Spartans might perhaps have upheld the sinking empire of Lydia; but before
                    their armament set sail, Croesus was no longer a sovereign. Notwithstanding the
                    strength of Sardis, that city had been taken by storm on the twentieth day of
                    the siege; the walls having been scaled in a quarter which, appearing altogether
                    inaccessible, was too carelessly guarded. This was effected by the enterprise of
                    Hyreades, a Mede, who accidentally observed a sentinel descend part of the rock
                    in order to recover his helmet. Hyreades was a native of the mountainous
                    province of Mardia, and, being accustomed to clamber over the dangerous
                    precipices of his native country, resolved to try his activity in passing the
                    rock upon which he had discovered the Lydian. The design was more easily
                    accomplished than he had reason to expect; emulation and success encouraged the
                    bravest of the Persians to follow his example; these were supported by great
                    numbers of their countrymen; the garrison of Sardis was surprised, the citadel
                    stormed, and the rich capital of Lower Asia subjected to the vengeful rapacity
                    of an indignant conqueror. Thus ended the ancient kingdom of Lydia, which
                    continued subject to the Persians until they in their turn were conquered by the
                    Macedonians.</p>
