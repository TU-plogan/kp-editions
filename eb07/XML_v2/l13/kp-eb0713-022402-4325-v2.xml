                    eminent English antiquarian, was born in London about the year 1507. Having lost
                    his parents when a child, he had the good fortune to find a friend and patron in
                    a Mr Thomas Myles, who placed him in St Paul’s school, of which the grammarian
                    William Lilly was master. From that school he was sent to Christ’s College,
                    Cambridge, whence, after some years’ residence, he removed to All Souls, Oxford.
                    From Oxford he went to Paris, chiefly with a design to study the Greek language,
                    which at that time was but little understood in this kingdom. Upon his return to
                    England he took orders, and was soon afterwards appointed chaplain to King Henry
                    VIII., who also gave him the rectory of Poppeling, in the marches of Calais;
                    appointed him his librarian; and in 1533 granted to him, by commission under the
                    great seal, the office of king’s antiquary, an office never borne by any other
                    person before or since. By this commission he was empowered to search for
                    ancient writings in all the libraries of abbeys, priories, colleges, cathedrals,
                    and places where “records, writings, and secrets of antiquity were repositeđ” in
                    his majesty’s dominions. We are informed by one of his biographers, that he
                    renounced popery soon after his return to England; but no authority is quoted
                    for his statement. Be this as it may, in 1536 he obtained a dispensation to keep
                    a curate at Poppeling, and set out on his journey in quest of antiquities. In
                    this employment he spent six years, during which time he visited every part of
                    England where monuments of antiquity were expected to be found. After his
                    return, in the year 1542, he was presented by the king to the rich rectory
                    ofHaseley in Oxfordshire; and in the following year Henry gave him a prebend of
                    King’s College, now Christ’s Church, Oxford, besides that of East and West
                    Knowle, in the cathedral of Salisbury. Being thus amply provided for, he retired
                    to a house of his own in the parish of St Michael le Querne in London, where he
                    spent six years more in digesting the materials which he had collected. Henry
                    VIII. died in 1547; and in a short time afterwards poor Leland appears to have
                    lost his senses. He was at first seized with a deep melancholy, which was
                    succeeded by a total deprivation of reason. In this lamentable state he
                    continued till the beginning of the year 1552, when he was happily released by
                    death. He was buried in the church of St Michael le Querne, which was destroyed
                    by the fire in 1666. Leland was a man of great learning, an accomplished
                    linguist, and an indefatigable and skilful antiquarian. Upon his death, Edward
                    VI. gave all Leland’s papers to Sir John Cheke, his tutor, and Latin secretary
                    of state. When this king died, Sir John, being obliged to leave the kingdom,
                    gave to Mr Humphrey Purefoy four folio volumes of Leland’s collections, which,
                    in 1612, were transferred by his son to William Burton, author of the history of
                    Leicestershire. This gentleman also became possessed of the Itinerary in eight
                    vols, folio, which, in 1632, he deposited in the Bodleian Library. After the
                    death of Sir John Cheke, many other of Leland’s manuscripts fell into the hands
                    of Lord Paget, Sir William Cecil, and others, and at last fortunately came into
                    the possession of Sir John Cotton. These were of great use to all our succeeding
                    antiquarians, particularly Camden, Dugdale, Stowe, Lambard, Batteley, and Antony
                    Wood. His Itinerary throughout most parts of England and Wales was published by
                    Mr Hearne, in nine vols. 8vo, 1710-1711; as was also his <hi rend="italic"

                    distinguished writer in defence of the Christian religion, was born at Wigan,
                    Lancashire, in 1691, and descended of eminently pious and virtuous parents, who
                    took the earliest care to season his mind with proper instructions. But, in his
                    sixth year, the small-pox deprived him of his understanding and memory, and
                    expunged ail his former ideas. He continued in this deplorable state <pb

                    />near twelve months, when his faculties seemed to spring up anew; and though he
                    did not retain the least traces of any impressions made on him before the
                    distemper, yet he now discovered a quick apprehension and strong memory. In a
                    few years afterwards his parents settled in Dublin. When he was properly
                    qualified by years and study, he was called to officiate as pastor to a
                    congregation of Protestant dissenters in that city. He was an able and
                    acceptable preacher, but his labours were not confined to the pulpit. The many
                    attacks made on Christianity, and by some writers of no contemptible abilities,
                    induced him to consider the subject with the greatest care, and the most
                    faithful examination. Upon the most deliberate inquiry, the truth and divine
                    original, as well as the excellence and importance, of Christianity, appeared to
                    him so clear and certain, that he published answers to several authors who
                    appeared successively in that cause. He was indeed a master in this controversy;
                    and his View of the Deistical Writers that have appeared in England, is very
                    greatly and deservedly esteemed. In the decline of life he published another
                    laborious,work on the Advantage and Necessity of the Christian Revelation, shown
                    from the State of Religion in the ancient Heathen World, especially with respect
                    to the Knowledge and Worship of the one true God, in two vols. 4to. This noble
                    and extensive subject, the several parts of which have been slightly and
                    occasionally handled by other writers, Leland treated at large with the greatest
                    care, accuracy, and candour. In his View of the Deistical Writers, his cool and
                    dispassionate manner of treating their arguments, and his solid confutation of
                    them, have contributed much more to depress the cause of infidelity than the
                    angry zeal of intemperate disputants. Besides his learning and abilities, his
                    amiable temper, great modesty, and exemplary life, recommended his memory to
                    general esteem and affection. He died in 1766.</p>
