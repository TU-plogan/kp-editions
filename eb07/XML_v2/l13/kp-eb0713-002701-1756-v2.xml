                            Lefrançais de</hi></label>, a most zealous and accomplished astronomer,
                    born at Bourg en Bresse, on the 11th of July 1732, was the son of Peter
                    Lefrançais, and Marianne Mouchinet, his wife.</p>
                <p part="N">His parents were in easy circumstances, and his education being somewhat
                    too indulgent, the natural quickness and impetuosity of his temper was too
                    little restrained. His earliest taste, like that of most other children, seems
                    to have been for romantic tales; and he was fond of making little stories with
                    such materials as he possessed, but their subject was chiefly religious. He was
                    in the habit of living much with the Jesuits, and he imbibed from them a
                    predilection for the pulpit. At the age of ten he used to amuse himself with
                    making sermons, and preaching them to a select congregation. The comet of 1744,
                    however, with its long tail, took more forcible possession of his imagination,
                    and he watched it with the most unremitting attention. Having been sent to Lyons
                    to continue his studies under the Jesuits there, he acquired a taste for poetry
                    and eloquence, and was then inclined to devote himself to literature and to the
                    bar; but an eclipse of the sun recalled his attention to astronomy. His parents
                    wished him to follow the profession of magistrate, and with that view sent him
                    to Paris; but he accidentally lodged in a hotel where Delislc had established an
                    observatory, and this circumstance led him to become acquainted with that
                    professor, and to attend his lectures. These lectures were by no means popular;
                    and the want of a more numerous audience made it easy for the professor to
                    accommodate his instructions to the fixed attention and rapid progress of his
                    new pupil, who became singularly attached to his master, and to all the methods
                    which he employed. Lalande attended, however, at the same time, the
                    physico-mathematical lectures of Lemonnier, who was more in credit as a teacher,
                    and who also took great pains for his improvement.</p>
                <p part="N">In the mean time he had completed his legal studies, and at the age of
                    eighteen he was called to the bar as an advocate. His family was anxious for his
                    return to Bourg; but just at that time Lemonnier obtained leave to nominate him
                    as a substitute for himself on an astronomical mission to Berlin, where he was
                    to make observations on the lunar parallax, corresponding with those which
                    Lacaille was sent to the Cape to obtain. He was favourably received by
                    Maupertuis, who introduced him to Frederic and his court; and was made a member
                    of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, when he was about nineteen.</p>
                <p part="N">He remained a year in that city, observing at night, and passing his
                    mornings in the study of the integral calculus, under Euler’s directions; and
                    his evenings in the society of Voltaire, Maupertuis, D’Argens, and other men of
                    talents. It was not likely that his intercourse with such persons would confirm
                    the principles which he had imbibed from the Jesuits; his moral conduct,
                    however, does not appear to have been influenced by his change of sentiments.
                    After his return to Bourg, he pleaded a few causes to oblige his friends; but
                    the success of his operations at Berlin obtained him speedily a place in the
                    Academy of Sciences at Paris; for, in 1753, before he was twenty-one, he was
                    chosen to fill up a vacancy in the department of astronomy, which had been open
                    for some years. He soon afterwards offended his friend Lemonnier, by rejecting
                    too harshly an unfounded objection of that astronomer to his method of computing
                    the effect of the earth’s ellipticity on the lunar parallax, which differed from
                    Euler’s formula. Lacaille, wĥo drew up the report of a committee appointed on
                    the occasion, decided in Lalande’s favour; but Lemon,nier remained dissatisfied,
                    and would not see him for twenty years. He had some similar discussions, at a
                    later period, with Duséjour, who was a little too severe in criticizing some of
                    his approximations, as if they had been intended to be rigidly accurate; but
                    their personal friendship remained unaltered.</p>
                <p part="N">For more than fifty years he continued to be a constant and voluminous
                    contributor to the Memoirs of the Parisian Academy, as well as to other
                    scientific collections. His investigations were always judiciously directed to
                    the advancement of astronomy; but they can scarcely ever be said to have
                    exhibited any marked features of talent, or of address, beyond what might be
                    expected from the industry of a man of good ordinary abilities, confining
                    himself almost entirely to one subject. He was always anxious to call the public
                    attention to astronomy as a science, and to himself as an individual. Thus, on
                    occasion of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201769?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-1769-0028"/>transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, he
                    addressed a circular letter to most of the governments of Europe, on the
                    importance of obtaining a multiplicity of collateral observations; and he
                    received in reply several invitations from sovereigns whose countries were more
                    favourably situated for the purpose than France, to come and make the
                    observations in person. He thought it unnecessary, however, to leave Paris on
                    the occasion. He contented himself with being the first to announce to the
                    public the result of the most satisfactory comparisons; and his countrymen
                    seemed to give him almost the whole credit of every thing that had been done by
                    others in conformity with his suggestions. He was much mortified, however, in
                    not receiving from Father Hell an account of the observations made at Wardhus;
                    and he was afterwards greatly inclined to dispute their accuracy, because Hell
                    made the parallax smaller than he did by ⅜th of a second; whilst the mean of
                    both results, which is 8, 6", agrees extremely well with the most modern
                    computations; but, in the end, he did justice to the importance of Hell’s
                    observations.</p>
                <p part="N">He was constantly in the habit of passing a few months every year with
                    his family in the country, and he occasionally amused himself, in the course of
                    these visits, with mineralogical excursions, and with chemical studies. He
                    delivered, about the year 1758, an oration before a public assembly at Lyons, on
                    the advantage of monarchy above every other form of government; he even adhered
                    to a similar opinion, and expressed it openly, in times when nothing but his
                    celebrity, as a man devoted exclusively to science, could have made it safe for
                    him to declare it.</p>
                <p part="N">After having published the astronomical tables of Halley, he felt the
                    necessity of a new collection, and determined to begin with those of Mercury,
                    which he found the most imperfect. He pursued, for this purpose, a regular
                    course of observations at the Palais Royal, where he used to go before sunrise,
                    in the winter mornings, to see the planet in the twilight. Having occasion to
                    refer to the observations recorded by Ptolemy, he found it 'necessary to refresh
                    his acquaintance with the Greek language, which he had in some measure
                    neglected. But, with all his labour and diligence, his tables of Mercury
                    exhibited, in 1786, an error of forty minutes in the time of a transit. The
                    circumstance mortified him extremely; but it led to a revision of the tables,
                    and he afterwards succeeded in making them much more perfect. It must be
                    recollected, that, in the time of Hevelius, a transit was anxiously expected for
                    four whole days before it occurred.</p>
                <p part="N">He next undertook to improve the tables of Mars and Venus. His tables of
                    these planets were, on the whole, less accurate than those of Mercury, though
                    more exempt from great occasional errors. He had computed their perturbations in
                    the Memoirs of the Academy, but he never thought it worth while to compare his
                    formulas with observation. The irregularities of Jupiter and Saturn were much
                    more discouraging; he was obliged to confine himself, in discussing them, to the
                    most modern observations; and he did not appear sufficiently to appreciate the
                    empirical equations of Lambert, though they greatly diminished the errors of
                    Halley’s tables.</p>
                <p part="N">When Maraldi had given up the management of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Connaissance</hi><hi rend="italic">des Tems,</hi> Lalande and Pingré were
                    candidates for the appointment. Lalande succeeded in obtaining it; but he had
                    the modesty to confess that the work would have been more accurately performed
                    by Pingré, if his connection with the church had not, according to the rules of
                    the academy, incapacitated him for the situation. He made the work, however,
                    much more popular, as a miscellaneous publication, than Pingre was likely to
                    have done; and he was less prejudiced than Pingré in the choice of his tables.
                    He remained editor of the work from 1760 to 1775; it was conducted by Jeaurat
                    from 1776 to 1787, and from 1788 to 1793 by Méchain. Lalande then undertook it
                    once more, Méchain being engaged in some measurements with Delambre, and the
                    academy having been abolished, and its members dispersed.</p>
                <p part="N">Lalande had been disposed to call in question the assertion of Newton
                    and of Voltaire, that no cometcould possibly come into contact with the earth;
                    and he had proved that the effect of perturbations at least rendered their
                    reasonings somewhat inconclusive. A short memoir on the subject, which was to
                    have been read at a public sitting of the academy, was accidentally omitted, as
                    not very important, from the pressure of other business. This circumstance
                    alarmed the sensibility of the public of Paris, who fancied that Lalande had
                    foretold some dreadful catastrophe, which the government was afraid to announce;
                    and when the memoir was published, they insisted that its contents had been
                    modified, to lessen the alarm. Duséjour made some objections to the author’s
                    reasoning; but the whole affair was soon forgotten.</p>
                <p part="N">A memoir on the length of the year was honoured with a prize by the
                    academy at Copenhagen. Delambre, however, thinks the determination not so good
                    as the earlier one of Lacaille, though much better than Mayer’s, which was more
                    commonly adopted. Lalande took great pains also with the subject of the sun’s
                    rotation, employing in his computations of the places of the spots an easy
                    approximation, instead of Duséjour’s more laborious methods; but being careful
                    to compare with each other the most distant observations of the same spot. From
                    the existence of this rotation he thought it reasonable to infer that the sun
                    had also most probably a progressive motion, which would naturally be produced
                    by any single impulse capable of occasioning a rotation. He had some discussions
                    with Dr Maskelyne respecting the mode of computing the equation of time, in
                    which Maskelyne appears to have had the advantage.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1762, Delisle resigned in his favour the professorship of
                    astronomy in the College de France, which he kept for nearly forty-six years. He
                    allowed the most attentive of his pupils to board with him at a cheap rate,
                    doing his utmost on all occasions to promote their success in their studies and
                    in life. Thus he brought forward Méchain and Dagelet, and afterwards his own
                    nephew, who completed, with so much diligence and accuracy, the Description of
                    the Heavens, which he had himself projected, and which had been begun by Dagelet
                    before his unfortunate expedition. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of
                    London in 1763.</p>
                <p part="N">His health was generally good, though his constitution was delicate. He
                    had an attack of jaundice in 1767, which was attributed to intense application;
                    but he completely recovered from its effects by an attention to diet, and by the
                    use of horse exercise. He then intended to leave all his property to the
                    academy; but he afterwards gave up his family estates to his relations, and
                    lived on his appointments only, refraining from all kinds of luxuries, in order
                    to be the more able to do acts of liberality to his friends, whom he always
                    sought to oblige in the most delicate manner, and often without making his
                    services known. He had a pension from Russia in the time of the Empress
                    Catherine; it was suspended by Paul, but restored in 1805 by Alexander.</p>
                <p part="N">He was not particularly successful as an observer, but used to refer to
                    the works of his contemporaries, Bradley and Lacaille, though not exactly,
                    according to the expression of one of bis biographers, <hi rend="superscript">
                        ii</hi> as Ptolemy had done to those of Hipparchus ;” for Hipparchus must
                    have been dead two centuries before Ptolemy was born. On the occasion of the
                    disappearance of the ring of Saturn in 1774, he went to Béziers, in order to
                    profit by the superior serenity of the air there, the climate of that country
                        <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201782?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0713-1782-0029"/>being supposed to be the best in France; but
                    his observations were less valuable than others made at Paris and in London.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1798, he undertook an astronomical expedition to Gotha. He
                    had once meditated an aerostatical voyage there; but his companion took care
                    that their dangers should terminate in the Bois de Boulogne. He was received
                    with much interest at Gotha by an assembly of astronomers that was collected
                    from different parts of Germany. The object of the congress was perhaps not
                    unmixed with personal vanity; but it had no political design to promote, unless
                    the general adoption of the new French measures could be considered as a
                    political object. Lalande was by no means a revolutionist; he was sufficiently
                    free from any prejudices of education; but he openly condemned the political
                    opinions of the day; and, in 1792, he even exposed himself to great personal
                    danger in order to save the life of Dupont de Nemours, after the 10th of August;
                    and he was equally useful to some of the clergy, whom he concealed in the
                    buildings of the Observatory at Mazarin College, making them pass for
                    astronomers. He had also the courage to publish accounts of Lavoisier and
                    Bailly, a short time after their deaths.</p>
                <p part="N">The attentions of the German astronomers gave him sincere pleasure. He
                    was at all times extremely sensible to compliments, and even to flattery, though
                    very regardless of satire. He used to call himself a sponge for praise, and an
                    oil-cloth for censure. He professedly believed himself endowed with all the
                    virtues, modesty not excepted. He was so fond of notoriety that he once
                    undertook to exhibit the variations of the light of Algol to the public of Paris
                    on the Pont Neuf; but the police interfered, thinking it right to prevent a
                    disorderly assemblage.</p>
                <p part="N">Though Lalande can only be classed in the second rank as an inventive
                    astronomer, or a mathematician, he certainly stands in the first as a professor
                    and a popular writer. His methods of calculation have in most instances been
                    already superseded by others more convenient or more exact; those which related
                    to particular phenomena for want of sufficient precision, and those which were
                    more general for want of being readily applicable, without continual repetition,
                    to a sufficient number of concurring observations. It has been observed, that he
                    may perhaps have been often too zealous in the pursuit of his favourite objects;
                    but that, if he had possessed more circumspection, and less vivacity of
                    character, he would have been more exempt from criticism, yet would have
                    rendered less important services to science and to mankind.</p>
                <p part="N">His last illness was of a consumptive nature, and he seems to have
                    accelerated its termination by attempting too much to harden himself. He died on
                    the 4th of April 1807, nearly seventy-five years old, and in the perfect
                    possession of his faculties. His last words, when he dismissed his attendants to
                    rest, were, “I have need of nothing more,” and in a few minutes he was dead. Had
                    he survived a few hours, he would have received a letter from Dr Others,
                    announcing the discovery of a new planet, for which that distinguished
                    astronomer afterwards received the fourth prize medal upon the institution
                    founded by Lalande in 1802, for the most important astronomical discovery made
                    in the course of the year.</p>
                <p part="N">Of his voluminous and diversified publications a simple enumeration of
                    the subjects will perhaps be thought too long for perusal, though not improper
                    for insertion in a work which ought to comprehend a complete literary history or
                    bibliography of the sciences.</p>
