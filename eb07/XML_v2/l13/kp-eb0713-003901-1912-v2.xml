                    of the most learned Frenchmen of the sixteenth century, was born at
                    Montreuil-sur-Mer, in Picardy, about the year 1516. He studied at the College of
                    Amiens, where he afterwards officiated for some years as professor of
                    belles-lettres. He then accompanied Cardinal de Tournon to Rome, and profited by
                    his stay in Italy to visit the principal cities, and to form friendly
                    connections with the learned men of that country. On his return to Paris, he was
                    appointed professor of eloquence in the Royal College, through the influence of
                    Amyot and the Cardinals of Lorraine and of Tournon; and the following year he
                    was promoted to the chair of Greek. He commenced his prelections by an excellent
                    discourse, in which he traced out the course which he proposed to follow, and
                    announced that he would explain alternately the Iliad and the Philippics, the
                    two works best calculated to form poets and orators. The numbër of his auditors
                    was considerable; but the contagious malady which then devastated Paris soon
                    thinned his class, and also carried off a nephew to whom he was much attached,
                    an event which drove him to seek, in a distant retreat, some alleviation of the
                    grief which overwhelmed him. But his prelections were not long interrupted; and
                    although already overburthened with labour, he consented, in the year 1570, to
                    explain Cicero to some select pupils in the College of Lemoine. A witness of the
                    civil troubles which then distracted France, Lambin bewailed them in secret; the
                    massacre of the Protestants made a terrible impression on his mild and gentle
                    spirit; and whilst the sorrow thus occasioned was recent and fresh, the news of
                    the death of his friend Ramus arrived to complete his affliction. Unable to bear
                    up under such an accumulation of calamities, he sunk the victim of grief, and
                    died towards the end of September 1572, about a month after the tragedy of St
                    Bartholomew. By his marriage with a lady of the house of the Ursins he left a
                    son, who became preceptor to Arnauld and Andilly, and who also possessed much
                    erudition. Lambin, though of a mild and modest character, had nevertheless his
                    enemies. He was accused of appropriating the researches of his contemporaries
                    without due acknowledgment; but there appears to be no foundation whatever for
                    the charge. On the contrary, it was Lambin himself who had reason to complain of
                    the plagiarisms of Muretus and his disciple Giphanius. He had also a warm
                    dispute with Paulus Manutius on the orthography of the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >consumptus,</hi> from which Lambin maintained that the letter <hi
                        rend="italic">ρ</hi> ought to be expunged; and it is even said that the
                    disputants became so warm, that, in the course of this absurd controversy, they
                    proceeded from mutual reproaches to blows. The style of Lambin is easy and pure,
                    but diffuse and somewhat heavy; and his enemies characterised it by the word <hi
                        rend="italic">Lambiner,</hi> which has remained in the language. The works
